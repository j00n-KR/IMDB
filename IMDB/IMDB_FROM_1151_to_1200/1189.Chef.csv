0,MartinHafer,There are much better foodie movies out there....,4,12 February 2015,"Movies about food and chefs are rather popular and I am particularly fond of them since I adore cooking (and I make an amazing soufflé, by the way). So, it's not the least bit surprising that I'd watch the film ""Chef"". However, what is surprising is that I didn't particularly like the film and it's one of the first foodie films I really haven't enjoyed. So, while I adore ""Babette's Feast"", ""The Big Night"" and ""Mostly Martha"", I really wasn't captivated by ""Chef""--though I sure wanted to be. With such a great cast of supporting actors, I sure expected to love it.So why didn't I like this film? Much of it is because the movie's main focus is NOT on the food but the main character (Jon Favreau). And, his character is a real jerk-face. Again and again, he makes dumb decisions and often treats people badly and is completely self- absorbed--yet we are expected to pull for him and his success. His abusive language, way he repeatedly mistreated his really nice son and childishness made me irritated with him and I lost any desire to connect with him or pull for his desire to rebuild his career (a career, by the way, which he clearly threw away). All in all, I don't fit in with most of the other reviewers, as I know there are just so many better foodie films--- and you could do a lot better.",Chef
1,SnoopyStyle,very light menu with some food porn,7,29 December 2014,"Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) was once an edgy Miami chef. He's divorced from Inez (Sofía Vergara) and trying to connect with his son Percy. When important food reviewer Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) comes, he acquiesces to restaurant owner Riva (Dustin Hoffman) and serves a safe uninspired menu. Molly (Scarlett Johansson) is the hostess. The reviewer pans it and it becomes a full on twitter war as Carl gets Ramsey to come taste his new menu. However Riva insists on the old menu and Carl gets let go. Tony (Bobby Cannavale) takes over the kitchen. Ramsey pans the food once again and Carl bust in going nuclear. The incident goes viral. Inez gets him to her ex-husband Marvin (Robert Downey Jr.) who sells him a rundown old food truck in Miami. Martin (John Leguizamo) quits his job to join him. Carl goes on a road trip in the food truck from Miami back to California with Martin and Percy.Jon Favreau needs a little time to warm up. The movie starts off functionally. Then RDJ shows up and injects some much needed hilarity. Sometimes I like the kid but other times I'm not so sure. He's not the easy supercute type. That's also how I feel about Favreau. The plot is a bit too easy and doesn't really have any tension. It's a light story with some food porn and a bit of cross country charm. This is more like a light appetizer but there's nothing wrong with that.",Chef
2,Prismark10,Hell's kitchen,6,1 August 2018,"Jon Favreau writes, directs and stars in Chef. I think he also had a hand in selecting the soundtrack as you get a few original versions of songs made famous by being re recorded by other artists such as the bassline used later by Melle Mel for White Lines.Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) loses his cool on the internet, a medium he has no clue about when he gets a dismissive review from a food critic. Carl wants to make cutting edge food but bows down to commercial considerations from the restaurant owner (Dustin Hoffman.)Out of work, divorced and middle aged. Carl and his son refurbish an old food truck in Miami and with his former assistant chef Martin (John Leguizamo) they drive the food truck to California wowing customers along the way with some authentic Cuban food.The story takes a while to get going, like many other 'chef' films, Carl is self absorbed, he can be mean to his staff and has little time for his son when it is his turn to look after his son. Carl his lucky that his ex-wife (Sofía Vergara) actually likes him and appreciates his culinary talents.The film picks up a pace once Robert Downey jr shows up for a cameo and Carl gets hold of the food truck and begins his cross country jaunt.Chef is an easy cooking film, it does not have much plot or tension. The music is nice but it feels like an easy starter than a main course.",Chef
3,nogodnomasters,I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING DEAD IN THERE,5,19 April 2018,"There is nothing like a fun family film with a family message and a few F-bombs tossed in for the kids.Carl is a chef who gets hammered with an on line review. He gets into a Twitter war with the critic leading to his termination from work. Carl most go from being with Molly (Scarlett Johansson) ""will have sex for food"" to living off the charity of his still loving ex-wife Inez (Sofía Vergara). I wish I had his bad luck.Carl succumbs to his wife's idea of obtaining a food truck which causes him to bond with his son and other formulaic ideas to the point of nausea. The problem I had with the script and film is that it tried so hard to create a feel good formula film it seemed plastic and fake. The characters and situation never seemed real, which makes this nothing more than a substandard comedy.A mildly entertaining film.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",Chef
4,kosmasp,Kiss the cook,8,3 June 2016,"I have no idea why anyone would call this movie by this title. But the German distributor thought it would be a perfect fit, so who am I to argue? Another thing that cannot be argued with, is the passion Jon Favreau went after this. Learning the trades of being a chef and really going into as much detail as he deemed necessary. He did not take this lightly, which can be seen throughout.It also has a more than stellar cast, a kid actor who really sells it (no pun intended) and is really good at what he does. Watching this you can see that there is a lot of love going into the food by some cooks. Though of course there is an apparent parallel to filmmaking, where critics don't seem to mind, if they hurt the feelings of the filmmakers and the passion they brought into the products. A really fun and enjoyable ride, if you let yourself into it",Chef
5,classicsoncall,"""I think there's something dead in there.""",5,11 January 2021,"This film left me with a real indifferent feeling, I really couldn't warm up to any of the principal characters. I guess it's because Jon Favreau didn't really exude a personality that made you care for him as the head chef of a restaurant who gets into a Twitter war with food critic Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt). Flying off the handle the way he did over a bad review of his menu, combined with an unfamiliarity with social media, turned his entire world upside down to the point of getting fired and submitting to his ex-wife's (Sofía Vergara) suggestion to operate a food truck. I don't know about anyone else, but if I had been offered a vehicle in the condition that 'El Jefe' first arrived in, I would have turned it down flat. It was just a monstrosity that no amount of hard labor could have turned into the gleaming food truck it wound up being. But that's what the script called for, so Chef Carl (Favreau) and his son Percy (Emjay Anthony) made it happen against all odds. On the flip side however, I did admire what a talented chef could produce in a day's work; the dishes Carl prepared not only looked delicious but appeared absolutely stunning. So while giving in to his ego, Carl gave up a lucrative and professionally satisfying gig in order to salve his self esteem. That it allowed him to rekindle a relationship with his son was about the biggest positive takeaway from the story, which when all is said and done is the most important thing. But had he kept his head on straight the whole while, he probably could have had it both ways.",Chef
6,lee_eisenberg,take a bite,8,11 January 2015,"The food cart culture has democratized eating out. Restaurants can cost a lot, limiting who can go to them, but food carts can give one a good meal for a bargain. Jon Favreau's ""Chef"" looks at this culture, with Favreau playing a schlub-like out-of-work chef who opens a food cart. Some of the best scenes are when he's cooking. Even if you like eating out, you gotta love seeing how the food gets prepared. Most importantly, food carts keep money in the community just like local restaurants do. When you spend money in a local business, you're helping your city survive, as opposed to helping an executive buy another yacht.Some other reviews that I read of ""Chef"" misunderstood the movie. One interpreted it as an ad for Twitter. Another (by a person who only heard about the movie but didn't bother to see it) said that it glorifies a takeover of the streets by private businesses. I don't know how anyone could come up with such an idea. It's a good movie, and that's final.",Chef
7,Calicodreamin,Enjoyable,8,5 December 2020,"A very enjoyable film, fun storyline, great acting, and an amazing soundtrack. Loved the journey and genuinely felt invested in the characters and story.",Chef
8,oscaralbert,See CHEF for a savory blend . . .,9,5 June 2014,". . . of appetite-engendering food visuals, father & son bonding, frequent star cameos, and a Smurf of a different color. Seldom does a single dad get much respect in Hollywood flicks, unless he's the sole surviving parent on the run from international bad guys. Chef's title character, Carl, is an exception to this norm. Carl's apparent joint custody of winsome 10-year-old son Percy is tenuous at best when this story begins, but strong as a jalapeño by CHEF's close. As might be expected, Carl's social media skills expand accordingly as he devotes more time and attention to his only child. To prove that he's finally getting his priorities straight, Carl basically ditches Scarlet Johansson for Percy. (In real life, there probably are fathers who would NOT make such a substitution.) Part road-trip flick, but a journey toward Carl's self-actualization as well, CHEF also joins BIG NIGHT, BABETTE'S FEAST, ROMANTICS ANONYMOUS, and RATATOUILLE near the top of the food movies listing. Perhaps lacking the drama of FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, WAITRESS, or THE COOK THE THIEF THE WIFE & HER LOVER, CHEF still hits a sweet spot on the palate in its own right.",Chef
9,george.schmidt,Better than leftovers.,9,9 May 2014,"CHEF (2014) ***1/2 Jon Favreau, Sofia Vergara, John Leguizamo, Bobby Cannavale, Emjay Anthony, Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, Amy Sedaris. Funny and warm-hearted comedy with Favreau (who wrote and directed and a return-to-form- with-his-indie-roots) as the titular artiste de culinary who finds a mid-life crises when his creative desires to break free from his stable but unhappy job in a tony LA eatery leads to embarking on a new venture in the unlikely form of a food truck dishing out Cuban cuisine for the working class. Amiably ambling along at a fine clip with enough food porn for the least- interested in the subject and mouth-watering designs for those who crave some new juice in the familiar domestic comedy with father/son bonding over good eats. Anthony as the sharply observant son is a natural while the fine ensemble keeps things lively namely Leguizamo as Fav's aide-de-camp sous chef and Vergara as his comely ex. Better than leftovers.",Chef
10,neil-476,A movie with heart. And pasta. And Cubanos...,9,27 June 2014,"Chef Carl, fired after a very public altercation with a food critic, sets up business in a food truck and goes on a road trip with his young son.That brief synopsis badly undersells this quirky and very enjoyable good-humoured light dramedy. Written and directed by, and starring, Jon Favreau, it consists of two acts rather than three. The first sets up Carl as being a good man and excellent chef, but a man whose concentration on his job has blinded him to the important things in life. This section takes longer than it needs to before it gets to the point, but is always fun to watch. The second half concerns what happens after Carl is fired: getting the truck, preparing it, then the road trip and its consequences. The developing relationship between Carl and his son Percy (a naturally empathic performance from 10 year old Emjay Anthony) is at the heart of this section, although there is plenty of other material to keep us entertained.Credit goes to all the other performers, from John Leguizamo as Favreau's main support and Sophia Vergara as his estranged wife, to effective cameos from Scarlet Johansen, Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt and Robert Downey Jr.I can understand why it has been referred to as ""food porn"" - I could have done with a little less time (and fewer close-ups) devoted to shopping, chopping, frying, toasting and the like. And, with one exception, I felt the bad language was unnecessary. But these are small complaints to aim at a film which has a lot of heart and which left me with a joyful feeling.",Chef
11,evanston_dad,Formulaic But Enjoyable,7,4 January 2015,"""Chef"" is formulaic film making with an indie vibe. If it had starred A- list Hollywood actors it would have joined the endless ranks of glossy studio rom-coms; instead, because it stars a bunch of people average movie goers probably haven't heard of (Sophia Vergara aside), it feels more like a quirky art-house find. But just because it's formulaic doesn't mean there aren't things in it to enjoy. The indie vibe is infectious, and I appreciated the message of the film. Jon Favreau's character learns not only that it's important to be a good father but also that it can actually be fun to spend time with your own kid. Parenthood is not an obligation, it's a privilege, and there's a lot more to raising kids than wiping their noses and fixing their lunches. ""Chef"" manages to convey that message without making it feel false, unlike the other conflicts in the film that all resolve far too neatly and happily to resemble real life. My biggest problem with the film is that I just don't like Jon Favreau that much. I find him physically repulsive to look at, to the point that it's hard for me to watch him on screen. I get that his character wasn't supposed to be likable for much of the film, but he is supposed to be winning. We're supposed to root for him to stop being a jerk and become the stand up guy we know he's going to become from the second the movie starts, but I personally find it hard to root for Jon Favreau. It seems unfair to use this as a criticism of the film, since there's nothing the film makers could have done other than cast someone else in the role. But it was a hurdle for me to overcome nonetheless and it did impact my overall enjoyment of the movie.Grade: B",Chef
12,ferguson-6,"Food, Family and Funny",7,15 June 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes it's nice to to just sit back and enjoy a pretty simple and familiar story with (mostly) likable people and an uplifting message. Don't worry, I'm not going soft on movies ... it's just that I found this little movie made me laugh and smile, and despite the formulaic approach (it plays like a sports movie) it made me care what happened to the characters (even though there was never any real doubt).Jon Favreau plays Carl Casper, the chef at a swanky L.A. restaurant owned by Dustin Hoffman. When a powerful food critic (Oliver Platt) is headed their way, chef and owner butt heads like the true artist and bean-counter they are. The Chef wants to wow the critic with a unique meal, while the owner wants to stick to what's been filling seats for a decade. Guess who wins? Once the Chef's public berating of the critic goes viral on social media, the soul-searching begins. Our hero soon learns that all phases of life - including parenting and cooking - work out much better when passion and full attention are in place. The film is a not so subtle reminder to all of us that our attitude determines our altitude (thanks to Zig Ziglar).This is a remarkable cast, many of which appear on screen for only a short time. The Chef's lead assistants are comprised of Bobby Cannavale and John Leguizamo. The maitre'd is Scarlett Johansson. Chef's ex-wife is played by Sophia Vergara, and her other ex-husband is Robert Downey Jr in a hilariously mind-muddling scene. Amy Sedaris has a funny scene as the fast-talking publicist and comedian Russell Peters plays a photo-happy Miami Beach cop. Even Emjay Anthony, as the young son Percy, has some nice moments.Mr. Favreau has had a remarkably varied film career as a writer, director, producer and actor. He wears all of those hats here. It's clearly a personal project for him and he wears it well, though a bit of script tightening could have elevated the film a notch. You might remember him from writing and starring in (with Vince Vaughn) Swingers in 1996, and of course, he more recently directed colossal blockbusters Iron Man and Iron Man II. It's been quite a career, and it's nice to see him take on the smaller, more personal projects again.The best ""foodie"" movies I can recall are Mostly Martha (2001), Eat Drink Man Woman (1994) and the animated classic Ratatouille (2007). This latest culinary comedy from Favreau definitely holds it's own, and gives us an exceptional soundtrack and road trip from Miami to New Orleans to Austin and back to LA. My only wish was that the language had been toned down for a PG-13 rating so that more families could enjoy it together.",Chef
13,anaconda-40658,Jon Favreau Serves Up a Great Film!,10,21 May 2015,"Chef (2014): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Jon Favreau, John Leguizamo, Emjay Anthony, Sofia Vergara, Scarlett Johansson: Passion project for Jon Favreau who previously made such big films as Elf and Iron Man. Here he tones down the budget for an insightful comical film about identity. Favreau plays a creative chef who grows frustrated cooking menu food when his creative impulses are far beyond the menu. When he receives a negative review from a food critic he goes ballistic when his reaction spirals out of control on social media. After a recorded outburst he is fired. His ex-wife has business in Miami and needs Favreau to spend time with their son. After a meeting with his ex's ex he is set up with a taco truck and is soon on the road with his son selling Cuban food. Despite his great work with the bigger budget films, this may be Favreau's best effort yet. He plays a guy with a passion and love for cooking and Emjay Anthony plays off the wit of his son who is smart and eager to spend time with his father. John Leguizamo steals scenes as Favreau's co-chef who leaves his job to join Favreau. Sofia Vergara as Favreau's wife is funny just through her accent but she genuinely desires for a relationship between Favreau and their son through the taco truck. This provides a comical space for location work as they get the truck and business up and going. Scarlett Johansson plays a hostess at the restaurant he worked in originally and she encourages him to go independent. This is a fantastic and often funny film about how our passions can bring us closer to those around us thus forming a greater bond. Score: 10 / 10",Chef
14,deloudelouvain,Not a good idea to watch this when you're on a diet,7,18 April 2016,"Since we get overwhelmed by cooking shows now on television I guess the logic step is to make movies about it. The first ""cook"" movie I saw was Burnt with Bradley Cooper and I hated that one so much I had my thoughts when I saw there was going to be another one on the same subject. Certainly when I saw that Burnt didn't get really bad ratings while the movie was very bad in my eyes. But I saw that Chef got even better ratings so I gave it a shot. And what a difference this one was. It's a thousand times better then Burnt. Maybe it was not a good idea to watch Chef now for me because I'm on a strict diet since a couple of weeks and so during the whole movie I dreamed about the food I could not get. But for the movie itself the story is okay, it's not really a comedy, just a drama about a chef that doesn't like critics and tries to be a good cook. Unlike Bradley Cooper in Burnt Jon Favreau delivers in this movie. I was never irritated (even though I am seriously hungry all the time now), while with Burnt I could not stand to watch another minute of that crap. In Chef you have a way better story, with a way better cast. Enjoyable movie.",Chef
15,siderite,"Culinary fantasy, but a bad one",6,18 January 2015,"The entire story is bull: nothing like that ever happens in real life. However it is one of those stories that we would like to happen in real life, especially ours. There isn't much more that I can tell you above what was in the trailer; indeed, this film can be considered a full feature movie inspired by its own trailer, since it has the same kind of narrative.It goes like this: A chef gets tired of being constrained by commercial, so he goes rogue to freely enjoy his own craft. He does it in a food truck, together with his best buddy, both renouncing promising careers in cooking because they want to follow their heart. In a way, this movie is a bit damaging, since it implies that you cannot follow your heart and also be successful. That is mostly true, but really... it shouldn't. See what I mean?The food scenes were kind of nice, but I really disliked the fake emotional scenes. They were all kind of forcing themselves down your throat. I wanted to enjoy the film, but I actually couldn't because of these boot on the neck advertising like scenes, where everybody is happy and smiling and singing and ostensibly enjoying food, for no good reason.Also, take care with the cast. A lot of the people there have a few scenes and that is it. There are really no other actors fully featured in the film other than Favreau, Leguizamo and the little kid. Hoffman, Downey Junior, Johansson and even Vergara are there only to bring you to the theater.So bottom line: has that commercial Christmasy ""we want your money"" feel, even if its subject is going in the exact opposite direction. In the end it feels like drinking poison with a lot of sugar.",Chef
16,namashi_1,A Nicely Done Food Comedy....,7,17 September 2014,"Jon Favreau's 'Chef' is A Nicely Done Food Comedy, with a charming cast, that make the proceedings even better with their winning performances. 'Chef' Synopsis: A chef who loses his restaurant job starts up a food truck in an effort to reclaim his creative promise, while piecing back together his estranged family.Delicious Food & a Father-Son at heart, 'Chef' shifts from yummy food to relationships that offer genuine bond. Favreau's Screenplay, Direction & Performance, are simply terrific. He slips into the character beautifully & delivers a story of true merit. Also in super form is Emjay Anthony, who enacts Favreau's sympathetic son with flourish. Sofía Vergara & particularly John Leguizamo, add to a strong supporting cast. On the whole, 'Chef' not only makes your stomach hungry, but also touches the core of your heart. Recommended!",Chef
17,DKosty123,Summer Camp Movie,5,1 January 2015,This is billed as a comedy when actually it is just a father -son movie on how I spent the summer. It is pleasant enough to put you mind in check and enjoy. It has lots of scenery from coast to coast and north and south and throws in Scarlett Johansen. Dustin Hoffman is an eatery owner who will not let his chef change his menu. So the chef leaves and goes to run a food truck after a big time run-in with a supposed famous great food critic. this critic is way below - Chef Ramsay.Twitter gets a promo and there is some R-Rated Lamguage though this is one of the softer R'rated films I have seen in a long time. The cast includes Robert Downey Junior. It is an a list cast and a very pleasant film.The main conflict between the wronged chef and the food critic is resolved lat in the movie. The divorced parents of the father's son even makes some peace at the end of the movie.The music is great and gives the movie a pleasant pace which is enjoyable and lite.Overall - a feel good movie with little else plot except that camp is replaced by a food truck after chef leaves the eatery.A deleted scene on the DVD has a New Orleans scene which was cut from the film which is neat to see. I like the music.,Chef
18,KineticSeoul,Lacks the sizzle and flavor,4,27 September 2014,"This movie just lacked that sizzle and flavor to merit a watch. It's just predictable and narrow movie that doesn't have any surprise to it. As a matter of fact the movie ""The Five-Year Engagement"" which doesn't even revolve around the cooking much was better than this flick. Watching this movie, you won't feel like your being treated for a cuisine but a fast-food instead. So the movie is about a passionate and yet very pride and sensitive chef that goes on a mediocre and forgettable journey to find himself and what is really important to him. He is a good guy though and cares for his family. Everything is just mediocre at best and forgettable and that includes the dialogue as well. The thing is, the movie seems to focus more on bonding than actually focusing in on the cooking elements. Yeah, it's not Iron Chef or Hell's Kitchen, but it would be nice with a movie that has the title ""Chef"" to focus a bit more on the chef elements. Overall, this one just bore the heck out of me.4/10",Chef
19,OllieSuave-007,More like family drama and social networking boost.,6,2 September 2014,"Chef is a so-called family comedy about chef Carl Casper, who quits his job at an upscale restaurant and, at the urging of his ex-wife, starts a food truck business in attempts to re-piece his cooking career and to make amends with his estrange family.This film offers some creative and appetizing dishes and food selections, making your mouth water at times. It also concentrates on the ingredients used in each dish (albiet too much focus on the use of oil, which makes you feel you're going to have heartburn).The plot points about Casper losing his restaurant job, quarreling with the food critic and his attempts to restart his career with the food truck are pretty captivating to watch. And, the father-son relationship was pretty heartfelt and sends a nice message about a father being there more often for his son and teaching him the ropes of his career. The acting, though, was sub-par; I thought the sexual innuendos, off-color jokes and the attempts of adult humor were done overboard and poorly executed. The emphasis on the use of Twitter and other online programs makes you wonder if this film is just merely another attempt to boost the use and power of social media, rather than focusing on the cuisine aspect of the movie.Also, the plot device of Casper quitting his job mostly due to a negative food critic review is petty. If you're going to make food at a restaurant for the public, you're subject to critique, good and bad, from a wide range of people with different tastes and opinions. Casper whining and crying about one bad food review just shows he is a poor sport at times (though, it is still pretty cool seeing him take on a critic).Overall, it is not a great nor a bad film - falls somewhere in between.Grade C+",Chef
20,Hellmant,I was starving by the end of the film!,9,10 June 2014,"'CHEF': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Jon Favreau wrote, directed, co-produced and stars in this comedy flick about a chef who loses his job (at a successful restaurant) and then goes to work (for himself) driving a food truck. The movie costars Sofia Vergara, John Leguizamo, Bobby Cannavale, Scarlett Johansson, Oliver Platt, EmJay Anthony, Dustin Hoffman and Robert Downey Jr.. Favreau learned to cook for the film by training with Roy Choi; one of the most famous food truck chefs there is. The food looks so delicious (in the movie) that it was painful to watch (due to the fact that it made me painfully hungry) but it is a good film.Favreau plays Carl Casper; a successful but unhappy chef who feels like he's lost some of his creative freedom working for Riva (Hoffman), at his popular Los Angeles restaurant. When an arrogant critic (Platt) writes a horrible review of Carl's food Carl attacks him on Twitter (thinking he's sending him a private message) and later he's caught (on video) chewing the critic out in Riva's restaurant (which goes viral). After quitting the restaurant Carl can't find work anywhere else, due to his notorious internet reputation. He then finally gives into his ex-wife's (Vergara) idea of running a food truck. This gives him the chance to spend more time with his estranged son (Anthony), as they drive the vehicle home from Miami and sell cubanos out of it (Cuban sandwiches). Carl's old line cook, Martin (Leguizamo), also joins them on the adventure.I like most of the movies Jon Favreau has written and or directed (my favorites being 'SWINGERS' and the first two 'IRON MAN' films). He's not the best actor but he is likable enough to carry a film like this and he appears to have a lot of good friends willing to help him out, in smaller supporting roles (like Downey Jr. and Johansson from the 'IRON MAN' films). The movie does have a decent father/son story to tell but I was most drawn into it by it's beautiful look at cooking (and the passion that goes into the art). I was starving by the end of the film (so it's probably best viewed while eating) but I can't see anyone who loves food not enjoying this movie. It's beautifully shot and touching at times; it's also funny as well (all of the performances are fun to watch). I also really liked it's commentary on social media (most noticeably Twitter) and it's look at how an ignorant critic can really effect someone's life. It's not a perfect movie (the third act could have used some more work) but it's definitely got enough going on to make it a really enjoyable viewing experience. One of Favreau's better efforts.",Chef
21,Lejink,Good food guide,7,7 February 2015,"I'm no foodie but I really enjoyed this road-trip / father-son / buddy movie, written directed by and starring Jon Favreau, based on the recent life and times of a perfectionist chef who struggles to suppress his own innovation to the demands of his conservative paymaster boss. More than this, he gets involved in a spat with the town's number 1 food critic, sees his relationship with his son founder under pressure of work and still pines after his glamorous and super-rich ex-wife.There's not much more to the story than that and I feared for all the anticipated parental-bonding scenes I would see the second I clapped eyes on his flop-haired 10 year old son but I was very pleasantly surprised to be engaged by this lighthearted, fast-moving, feel-good movie, right up to the predictable happy ending for all concerned.With a busy but enjoyable soundtrack of soul and salsa in the background, nice realistic acting by all the leads right down to son Percy and of course lots of scrumptious shots of freshly made food, this movie certainly mixed its ingredients together well, delivering in the end a most palatable dish.Perhaps the star-power cameos were a little unnecessary, maybe the father-son stuff did get a little hokey at times and the wraparound happy ending did seem somewhat forced but on the whole I found this a very watchable and occasionally funny movie which more than whetted my appetite for a decent Saturday night stay-in movie.",Chef
22,bowmanblue,A 'feel-good' film for adults,7,6 December 2014,"'Chef.' I only watched it because I used the film as a 'filler' on my online rental list. However, after viewing it, I'm glad I did. For a long film, it passes by pretty well. Not that it's anything that original. It's a pretty standard tale of loss and redemption. A cranky – yet strangely lovable – chef loses his job in a restaurant and has to go it alone in a 'mobile food wagon' (while naturally trying to win back his estranged family).If you've ever seen ANY film before, you'll probably be able to guess the story from A to B. However, just because it's predictable doesn't mean it isn't worth watching. Yes, (the always on form) Robert Downey Jr is in it and obviously he's the biggest name attached to the project, but it's not really 'his' film. Jon Favreau is what holds it all together. Despite being a little loud and a little obnoxious, he always seems to have his heart on show, making quite a believable hero to root for.There are plenty of other big and semi-big names in the film, but it's Favreau who makes it worth watching. It's not always funny and not always dramatic – just a gentle vibe which falls somewhere between the two. It's a nice movie to sit and relax with – as long as you don't mind the bad language!",Chef
23,dromasca,the comedy of this summer,8,28 August 2014,"One just needs to search how many movies include the word 'chef' in their name in order to understand how daring an enterprise director-writer-actor Jon Favreau took upon himself in making yet another comedy about master cooks. No need to mention, not all films about 'chefs' include 'chef' in their title. And yet, here it is, Chef is the comedy of this summer, at least in what I am concerned.I know too little about Cuban food, and even less about Cuban junk-food. Good chances are however that I will taste some at the first opportunity to despite the protests of my dietitian. The rather trivial story is about a cook who cannot really exercise his art, and has the guts and will to quit at the right time, and the luck plus support from a wonderful kid and delicious ex and future wife to make it in the change of path. The understory is maybe about the director Jon Favreau himself and his fight to make a film which is as much a crowd pleaser as Cuban sandwiches are, but can also contain and radiate quality despite what critics say.There are certainly many good reasons to like this film. Some are related to acting, starting with Favreau himself who is so good that I completely forgot that he is also a director, until the presence of stars like Dustin Hoffman, Robert Downey Jr., or Scarlett Johanssohn who visibly enjoy being on that screen. There may be also one more reason and this is the 'I'll do it my way' message of the film which may have been the motto of the director-writer-actor himself when daring to turn what should be a very over-used theme into a nicely paced and fresh comedy - one of the best I have seen lately. The character has passion, the director has passion, and as a viewer I fully bought it.",Chef
24,ThomasDrufke,Same Old Same Old,6,12 October 2014,"Chef is a fun small budget film that does what it wants to do, even if it's entirely formulaic. Every bit of this movie has been done before. It's a father-son re-connecting story that revolves around the father, who happens to be a Chef, having a mid-life crisis.It's full of acting talent across the board but none of them really get to show what they can do except for perhaps Jon Favreau. Favreau recruited all this Hollywood buddies to have small cameos and give the film a broader audience than perhaps it deserved. I enjoyed the film for what it was but it's just nothing special. Favreau and his son have great chemistry at not having great chemistry in the story, if that makes sense. And I also liked the way of flowing social media into the story and why this man's life unfolds quickly.It's a pleasant film that would be better served on cable where it's condensed to about 90 minutes. As great as it is watching all this food being made throughout the 2 hours, it could have definitely been shorter. Scarlett Johanssons character could have been completely wiped from the screenplay and it wouldn't have changed a thing. I think as far as the story goes it's fine, but we have all watched a father son relationship fall apart and then be put back together again on screen. Even with Favreau's great acting it didn't quite click for me on all levels.+Favreau's acting +Looks delicious +Cool Cameos -...But they didn't serve any sort of purpose -Rehashed story -Too long 6.6/10",Chef
25,g-bodyl,A Very Tasty Film!,10,29 March 2015,"Pardon my pun, but I found Chef to be such an appetizing entrée that delivers upon which the aromas promised. Chef takes director Jon Favreau into the indie world where he began, and he delivers one of the best films of 2014. Not only is this a satisfying movie, it's a movie that makes the actual food look delicious! I am in the mood for a Cuban sandwich now. What I really liked about the film is how it is actually a heartfelt father/son story with pure characterization instead of a movie just about the food. The food does add some exotic flavoring though.Favreau's film is about a chef named Carl Casper who works tiring hours at a trendy restaurant and has an estranged wife and son. After losing his job at the restaurant, the once-promising chef decides to put his career back together by starting a food truck business along with his best friend, and tries to put his family back together in the process. The film has many A-listers, but I actually sort of enjoyed their roles were played to the minimum. Jon Favreau does a great job in the lead role and is quite funny. John Leguizamo does a solid job as his best friend. Newcomer Emjay Anthony was excellent as Favreau's son. As far as the cameos go, Robert Downey Jr's and Dustin Hoffman's are the ones to keep an eye on. Overall, Chef is one of the best films of 2014. The story is clever, engaging, and funny and it truly works even if it does not tread new ground. I loved the addition of the food and how they attempt to make the food look delicious, even if I do not care for some recipes. My advice to people is do not watch this movie on an empty stomach or you will be sorry. A fantastic, heart-warming movie. My Grade: A+",Chef
26,secondtake,"Satisfies your hunger, but leaves you thirsty for more",7,14 August 2014,"Chef (2014)A hoot. Well constructed, well acted feel-good comedy about a chef who wants to cook from the heart.This is a formula film, for sure. You are made to fall in love with the main characters (mostly one of them, writer, director, and leading man Jon Favreau). Then things go wrong. Some are comic, some are sad, but all is told in a way you know will end just fine, more or less. And so it goes.Because Favreau got his Hollywood creds as a producer (""Iron Man"" series) he has lots of connections, and he cashed in some favors here. Small parts are given to several stellar players. Scarlett Johansson is a charming hostess at the restaurant, though she isn't given a lot to do. Dustin Hoffman plays the reasonable but hard headed owner at odds with the chef. And Robert Downey Jr. himself shows up as an ex-wife's ex-husband with his usual charm and screen presence. Briefly.So the movie bustles along. The script is really funny—even in small moments the lines and the delivery work well. The boy, played by Emjay Anthony, is superb, holding up a key emotional part of the movie. Favreau, the actor, manages to seem like both the impassioned chef and the warm dad in believable ways. Eventually the plot turns into a road trip, which is always fun, and we get touristy visits to Miami, New Orleans, and Austin. It's all so feel good you want actually for something more to happen. Yes, the problem with the movie is the formula thing, which it sticks to too well. And there are lots of little scenes, some of them musical inserts, that sound and look great but that drag down the momentum. And the big ending is far too sugary for me. The movie doesn't quite lift its excesses into a fable, or into a style that justifies them. Instead it shamelessly uses pumped up music, great characters, and a triumphant plot to work you over. And make you feel good, which is pretty good.",Chef

Carl Casper (Favreau) is the best chef in the city working at the best restaurant. On the night that a respected food critic is coming Carl decides to change the menu and do something different to show off his skills. The owner of the restaurant doesn't like that idea and Carl is forced to abandon his ideas. When the critic gives him a bad review it hits the internet. Carl decides to respond and a war of words culminates in a confrontation that ends up with Carl out of a job. When a trip to Miami provides a new opportunity Carl and his son discover something more important then food. I have been a Favreau fan since Swingers. That was really the last movie he was in where he was the main star (even though in that and Made Vince Vaughn really stole the movies). After seeing this I wouldn't be surprised if he got more starring roles. He is perfect for this movie. He really just plays Mike, grown up, with a little more confidence. That is not a bad thing at all. The movie is full of comedy, heart and is so entertaining and enjoyable to watch that the movie moves along almost too fast and you wish there was more.

Mind you, the meals-on-wheels in this dramedy appear on the up-and up.  Tired of being at the mercy of his boss' (Dustin Hoffman) outmoded menu  and humiliated by an online food critic (Oliver Platt), Carl (Jon  Favreau) quits his head chef job.  On the advice of his ex-wife (Sofía Vergara), he goes to Miami to  refurbish a dilapidated taco truck with his social media savvy son  (Emjay Anthony) and former cook (John Leguizamo).  With his son documenting their return trip on Twitter, Carl's Cuban  food truck forms a huge following, including former detractors.   With a heavy web presence and little footing in reality, Chef evokes  sentimentality through online montages accompanied by feel-good songs  more than it does through any discourse between father and son.

31,ironhorse_iv,Are you hungry for a good comedy? Chef is cooking up a storm. It's a great recipe for a good time family dynamics film.,8,8 August 2014,"I ate this comedy all up. You can tell that Jon Favreau was having a blast with this film! In many ways, the movie mirrors Jon Favreau's life, as he always wanted to go back to basics and to create a film about cooking. Semi-autobiographical, it incorporating parts of his life into the main character, such as being a father while having a busy career and coming from a ""broken home"". After years of directing box buster superheroes movies, he finally got his chance to direct and write the movie, he really wanted to do. You can tell that this movie was indeed made with a lot of heart and its shows. The movie tells the story of an acclaimed chef, Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) whom very frustrated with his job, due to the fact that he's losing his artistic freedom by his boss, Riva (Dustin Hoffman), and critics like Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) are noticing it. Things continue to get worst for him, as his family life seem to be decaying, as he left with little time to spent with his son, Percy (Emjay Anthony) and ex-wife, Inez (Sofía Vergara). Things finally boil over, when vicious viral-videoed public confrontation against Ramsey Michel went online, ruining what left of his career. With no way out, Carl find redemption, by going into the food truck business. With his son, Percy and old colleague, Martin (John Leguizamo), Carl hope to offer quality cooking on his own terms and regain his freedom. I have to say, the movie have a lot of things going right for it. The acting throughout the film is well-done. Jon Favreau is amazing as Carl Casper. He definitely has the acting chop and rep to carry his own movie not to mention every other aspect of the production. He looked like a trained chef in this film. That's how great, he was. Favreau contacted Roy Choi, a professional food truck chef, to serve as a consultant on the film; Choi was eventually promoted to co-producer. Favreau shadowed Choi in his restaurants and worked as part of Choi's kitchen crew after training at a culinary school. Choi oversaw all of the menus prepared for the film and created the Cuban sandwiches that formed a central part of the storyline. Indeed, Favreau learn from one of the best as I have try Choi's food, before. The supporting actors were all pretty good with their roles. Even the kid actor wasn't that bad. The message of the film is somewhat clear. Chef is a movie about the joy of small, meaningful experiences, and the pleasure of seeing them shared; about how social media has the power not only to amplify mistakes, but to transform the craft and passion of people into a gift that can be shared with a much larger world. Still, there are some faults to this film. First off, the movie felt like a love-letter to social networking. Felt like a 2 hour commercial about how twitter, vine, and others is key to any success. The story kinda get lost in pacing, when the movie feel the need to advertised people to check out places such as Versailles restaurant, the Fontainebleau Hotel, and the Cuban restaurant Hoy Como Ayer in Little Havana, Miami as well. It even market how great New Orleans and Café du Monde in the city's French Quarter is. Is this a movie or Anthony Bourdain TV special? It really took forever to get to the food truck part of the story which was the best part. I love the music choice, throughout the film. Its gives this Latin jazz, New Orleans jazz and blues vibe to the journey. Still, this movie used musical montages way too much, the second half of the movie is just that every 5 minutes, long if you take away, all the montages. I'm not even kidding. Either they're driving somewhere or cleaning something or cooking something or buying something with music in the background. If you get rid of those scenes, the movie would only be like 45 minutes long. The movie has a lot of food porn in it. It's beautiful to watch, and get made, but besides that, it serves little to no reason to the main plot. I wouldn't call it a family movie as there are strong verbal and profanity language. It's not the worst, but I really thought, they could had try to go PG-13 with this. The Rated R rating did teach me that cornstarch is great to use when rubbing your balls. The humor was pretty good. Mostly hit than misses. It was kinda funny, but I wasn't like laughing my head off. The movie is a bit predictable, and the plot straightforward, but there's the Art of Cuisine with a backdrop of relationships or vice versa with a range of emotions that kept me hooked for it. The credits have a lot to look forward to. I love the post-credit scene of how to cook a grill cheese right. I wouldn't recommended, watching the trailer for this movie, as it spoils way too much scenes. Funny how the title of this trailer proudly says Robert Downy Jr., and Scarlett Johansson, when both are barely in the film and not the main focus. Overall: We're sure foodies and future chefs will definitely enjoy watching this star-studded movie. Any fan of 2011's Jiro Dreams of Sushi, 1994's Eat Drink Man Woman and 1996's Big Night will love this food-centric film. I enjoyed it very much. I rather eat this movie again, than the Lava Cake.

33,briancham1994,Straightforward good time,7,28 October 2020,"This film is a good, positive watch with no extra baggage. It stars Jon Favreau as a temperamental chef who is feeling restricted by the commercially minded and stubborn restaurant owner (no doubt channeling his inner frustration at the Marvel franchise). This all blows up when he starts some drama with a famous food critic, leading him to reconsider his life and start a food truck. He feels like a real person with a fleshed out life and personality, trying to do his best for his ex-wife and son. The moments when he bonds with his son are very uplifting and we are happy for their happiness. My only criticism is that their success is too idealised and it moved too quickly into ""happily ever after"" territory.",Chef
34,Floated2,Predictable but Entertaining,7,16 September 2015,"Chef stars Jon Favreau, to many known mainly as the director of such hit films (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Cowboys & Aliens). Chef can be described as a predictable, yet heart warming small film with little to no surprises and twists, but we watch for the journey and joy of the characters. The film can be served as well into two parts. First part is taken place at his Los Angeles restaurant where he works full time at an upscale restaurant, then fast forward to the second part of the film, where Chef decides to quit his job and start his own truck-run service. Along the way he brings his long time friend (John Leguizamo), and his youngest son.Also co-starring in this film are Favreau's supporters from the Iron Man franchise Scarlett Johansson (whom only appears in the first half) and Robert Downey Jr (for a total on screen time of roughly 5 minutes). Although the film is predictable, with a typical ending (protagonist wins, with the antagonist coming back to apologizing and them becoming friends), the entertainment comes from the journey that we see a long the way. The scenery is beautifully well shot, and the close up shots of the food being cooked is well done. This film is listed as solely a comedy, but has many dramatic elements. The ending is left open ended but we are to assume everything works well. Although what we don't see is the return of some of the supporting actors that were earlier shown in the film.",Chef
35,eddie_baggins,An easy to digest delight,8,28 September 2014,"WARNING: Do not watch Chef on an empty stomach, for it's likely that you will not be able to sit through the film without rushing to the fridge and combining ingredients in the hope of creating one of many dishes within this film that look almost too good to be true, not least the Cuban sandwiches which play a large part in the films second half. Food on screen is unlikely to look more appealing in 2014 than it does here in Jon Favreau's small scale dramedy but it's a good thing that the movie itself is quite the entertaining feast to.More than likely to go down as one of the year's most breezy, enjoyable and often quite funny films, Chef is a purely unadulterated joy of a movie that while at times contrived and more sugary than a box of freshly baked donuts is a movie that should appeal to everyone no matter how cynically minded they may be. For food lovers there is the previously mentioned abundance of amazing looking food but for us film lovers there is a film here that whooshes through its 100 minute run time with a likable storyline, a cast of on form and obviously enjoying the experience actors and a tale not looking to fill itself up with emotionally plot points but looking to entertain as the number one order of the day. It's a real credit to Favreau that he was able to achieve such a charming low key movie.Moving on from the big world lights of Marvel and the Jersey Boys movie project, Favreau once more shows us how skilled he is at the small scale story much like he did in his early films Elf and Made. Favreau is by no means the most talented of directors around the industry today or even one of the most visually recognisable but there is little doubt he knows how to make a likable cast work into a likable movie as evidenced in previous movies like Iron Man and here in Chef. Favreau's lead Carl is a flawed individual yet remains someone you can root for even when his disregarding his child or talking up the virtues of his cooking while supports in the form of actually likable child actor Emjay Anthony as Carl's son Percy, the ever fast talking John Leguizamo as Carl's best friend Martin and the always begging for more screen time Bobby Cannavale as one of Carl's cooking compatriots Tony are all universally likable which leads to a great overall feel in proceedings.It would take a hard hearted movie watcher to talk down Chef and while there are numerous plot contrivances and somewhat unbelievable developments (really would everyone around the country line up for Cuban sandwiches?) it remains a movie that wizzes past while entertaining at every stop. It's great to see Favreau come back to a small-scale (especially after the insanely awful Cowboys and Aliens) yet meaningful smaller movie and like a 3 course feast, Chef will leave you feeling wholly satisfied at its conclusion.4 perfectly toasted sandwiches out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Chef
36,Red-125,"A food movie, a dad-son bonding movie, a road movie",7,29 June 2014,"Chef (2014) was written by directed by, and stars, Jon Favreau. The movie has its virtues, but I found it noisy, formulaic, and predictable.Favreau plays chef Carl Casper, who produces excellent high-end cuisine, but who is held back from displaying creative genius by the restaurant owner. He's also divorced, overweight, and pretty much estranged from his son. (Emjay Anthony plays the son, and he does a good job. The kid is already a professional, and it shows.) Sofía Vergara plays chef's former wife, and she also does a good job if you like to watch voluptuous sex objects wearing a different outfit in each scene.OK, a quiz:1. (a) Chef obediently cooks his excellent but tired cuisine or (b) Chef refuses to confine his creative genius any longer;2. (a) Chef finds another good job or(b) Chef starts a new life with a food truck3. (a) The food truck starts out beautiful and shiny(b) The food truck is a messThis could go on and on. I didn't even get to the bonding- with-the-son part.Throw in some shots of colorful locations--Florida, New Orleans, Texas--and some great food preparation, and there you have it.However, forgetting the formulaic parts, there's something that I consider a real plot weakness. Early in the film, Chef has a major on-line fight with a food critic. The problem is, the food critic is right. He says Chef has been cooking the same stuff for years, and that's just what Chef has been saying. So, Chef should have had the fight with the restaurant owner, not with the critic. (Because this occurs early in the movie, I'm not giving anything away.)What amazes me is that, as I write this review, the movie has an IMDb rating of 7.8. That's really an impressive number. Did everyone see the same film I saw? More fun to see this in the theater, but it will work well enough on the small screen. I wouldn't seek it out, but this is a good movie to watch if nothing better is playing.",Chef
37,leonblackwood,Fresh and original! 7/10,7,10 November 2014,"Review: I really enjoyed this fun movie, about a excellent chef who gets a bit too big for his boots when he tells the restaurant owner that he wants to change the menu to impress a restaurant critic. The acting is very realistic and I liked the chemistry between all of the characters, especially the relationship between the chef and his son. Johansson and Downey Jr. were great touches to this well written and directed movie and the storyline was fresh and original. It also shows how the use of social media can be bad in one hand and good in another and the attention to detail with the cooking was impressive. The first half, which is based in Hoffman's restaurant, seemed like a completely different movie to the second half, when he goes on the road with his food truck, so there's enough material to keep the movie interesting and quite funny. In all, it's a very well made movie with a great concept. Enjoyable! Round-Up: It's good to see that Jon Favreau, who plays the main character and also wrote and directed the movie, can also make a good drama/comedy, after directing the action packed Iron Man franchise. He has proved that he can cover other genres, as well as acting in many being movies like The Wolf's Of Wall Street and the Identity Thief. In this movie, he brought a lot of realism to his character and with all of the cooking programs that are on TV at the moment, it was good to see another aspect to a chef. On the downside, it does end a bit abruptly without much explanation and I would have liked to see Dustin Hoffman's character after the food truck becomes famous, but that's just me being picky. Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $46millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there drama/comedies about a chef who loses his job in a restaurant and ends up preparing food on a food truck with his son. 7/10",Chef
38,howard.schumann,"An enjoyable, market-tested contrivance",7,22 April 2015,"Anticipating the appearance of Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt), a prominent food critic, Carl Jasper (Jon Favreau), a respected chef at a popular restaurant in Los Angeles, wants to add some innovations to the restaurant's tried and true menu. Riva, the bistro owner, (Dustin Hoffman), however, tells him to stick to what has always worked, a conflict that is unresolved until the chef decides to utilize more of his creative skills somewhere else. Written and directed by Jon Favreau and featuring cameos by Robert Downey, Jr. and Scarlett Johansson, Chef is an entertaining film that keeps the blood moving with a very loud Latino soundtrack selected by music supervisor Mathieu Schreyer (bring ear plugs), but never really rings true as anything more than an enjoyable, market-tested contrivance. The story takes shape after Ramsay writes a negative review of the restaurant causing Carl to respond online, a tweet that gets wide circulation and a return visit by Michel. Without taking responsibility or looking with objectivity at the points made in the review, Carl goes into a paroxysm of rage, venting his anger not only at Michel but at all critics whose opinion ends up really hurting people, (nothing personal with Favreau, of course). As a result of this somewhat implausible blasting of a food critic in a public setting, Carl is (you guessed it) fired. Though his ex-wife Inez (Sofia Vergara) is none too pleased, she sees it as an opportunity for Carl to spend some more time with his ten-year-old son Percy (Emjay Anthony), who seems to have the makings of a good relationship with his dad but wants more of him than just going to the movies once in a while. Taking off for Miami with Inez and Percy, they meet Inez' ex-husband Marvin (Robert Downey, Jr.) who convinces Carl to become an independent entrepreneur, refurbishing an old truck and setting up a mobile restaurant serving Cuban sandwiches and Yucca fries, not exactly nouvelle cuisine. It is then that Martin (John Leguizamo), Carl's old cook from Los Angeles, happens to show up to join the sandwich truck, while son Percy has clean-up duties and helps out with the cooking. Almost immediately and without any trial and error, the venture achieves success and they set out for Los Angeles with stops along the way in New Orleans and Austin, Texas. Percy has the chance to go to Disney World, but what ten-year-old wouldn't rather go to New Orleans to sample the food? Along the way, their trip becomes one long commercial for Twitter with Percy teaching his dad how to use social media to promote the business, treating it like he is unveiling a brand new invention.Taking advantage of the commercial success of television food shows, the star of the film, of course, is the food which is displayed in tantalizing bits and pieces like models for a fashion show. With the food presentation so appealing, the audience could be seen whispering to each other – boy, doesn't that look good. What we do not see, however, is the artistry (and hard work) that goes into cooking anything, only the hungry customers standing in long lines. Of course, the subject of whether or not the food being served is healthy is not discussed, but one can definitely form their own opinion. Chef is a crowd pleaser that will satisfy a mild hunger but leaves you wanting more substantial fare. What does work is the bonding between father and son and the message that your work should be something you are, rather than something you do. Pass the chili peppers.",Chef
39,Ed-Shullivan,A delicious 💞🍔🍟 🌭🍕🍗🍤🎂🍦🍫🍻🍷☕️ feel good film for families (especially parents) FIVE STARS,9,4 May 2015,"Mrs. Shullivan and I were in the mood to watch a film that did not include any heavy gunfire, lengthy action scenes peppered with overdone computer graphic images (CGI) and repetitive loud bangs! So we settled in to watch Jon Favreau who wrote, directed and stars in last years (2014) comedy/drama film titled Chef. If you have read any of my other reviews you will note that I am usually very critical in a negative way to those egotistical self glorifying writer/director/actors whose film project is all about them. Trust me when I say this is one of those rare films that is so well done that there is not one star in the film but instead many of the actors who shared the screen with Jon Favreau who were brilliant. Congratulations Mr. Favreau for delivering a heart warming story that is just so creative with too many memorable moments to mention them all.To summarize Jon Favreau plays a five star chef named Carl Casper who runs a five star restaurant which is owned by two time Oscar winner Best Actor Dustin Hoffman, who plays Riva. Now Riva does not care two cents about his Chef Casper's desire to create new dishes that will wow the palates of restaurant/food critics such as that of restaurant/food critic Ramsey Michel played superbly by Oliver Platt. No, instead Riva wants his chef to stick to the menu that brings a steady clientele in to his restaurant and the big green bucks in to his bulging pant pockets. In the showdown that transpires between head Chef Casper and owner Riva, there is an angel overlooking the conscience of Chef Casper played by Casper's ex-wife Inez, played lovingly by Sofia Vergara who is also the mother of Casper's pre-teen son named Percy played perfectly by the young up and coming actor with a bright future Emjay Anthony. Now as most of the famous chefs have their uniqueness our chef Casper's passion for cooking is sometimes overwhelmed by his intense pride and so he engages in a war of words in an unfamiliar form (to him) of on-line communication called twitter. Without realizing what he has done to his career by using the new Twitter account that his 10 year old son Percy just created for him Chef Casper is told to apologize publicly to food critic Ramsey Michel or find another restaurant to cook his delicious creations at.With encouragement from his ex-wife Inez Chef Casper decides to purchase a beat up old mobile food truck from his ex-wife's first husband the rich Marvin played by Robert Downey Jr. With the assistance of one of his cooks and good friend Martin, played with great excitement to embark on a road trip by the character actor John Leguizamo they get the assistance from an unexpected source. Chef Casper's 10 year old estranged son wants to travel with the two seasoned cooks on the road trip.This is where the journey really begins for the three men and the careful attention to every detail both in how to prepare a special meal for every customer and the relationship between these three friends emerges. This is a joyful movie that will leave the audience feeling warm and ready to hug the ones you love. I gave Mrs. Shullivan a few big hugs after this appealing film had ended and throughout the film. 🎬💞🍔🍟 🌭🍕🍗🍤🎂🍦🍫🍻🍷 I give the film a strong 9 out of 10 rating. You will not be disappointed.",Chef
40,matthewssilverhammer,"Food looks amazing...otherwise, meh...",6,20 June 2014,"Chef is a passionate two-hour long love letter to cooking, returning Favreau to his roots of fun dialogue and solid characters. The food is mouthwatering, and when the film focuses on the main story of father and son building a food-truck, it hits. Unfortunately the first and last 20 minutes drag, bogging down in story building instead of just letting the world create itself. Nonetheless, enough joy seeps through to make this a decent small-scale dramedy. Chef's a movie for Millennials, exploring the effect technology and social networking has on family and work. It parallels Favreau's own real-life career: highest highs, lowest lows, and bouncing back. He clearly did his homework on the culinary side, handling the fare with effortlessness. However, Chef is as much about fatherhood as it is food, questioning how to be a parent when you don't feel grown up yourself. This father-son trope is nothing new, but it's a bit more down-to-earth here than most melodramatic family dramas; sweet and true. It's just a bummer that any depth explored is brought bluntly to the surface, rarely allowing us to naturally intuit them. The film's style works, both smooth and jarring like the main characters own cuisine If only the final edit was more constricted. When they are focused on the kitchen and interplay, full of natural dialogue and chemistry, it works in spades. A tighter setup, some scenes cut (Downey Jr. is wasted and pointless), and a quicker end would make for a much better film.

The plot is straightforward, not to say predictable: Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) has a dust-up with his boss (Dustin Hoffman) as well as a supercilious restaurant critic (Oliver Platt) and leaves his restaurant. He sets up a food truck and by doing so reconciles himself to his estranged family, especially son Percy (Emjay Anthony).The major snag with Favreau's film is that his central character comes across as a boor; the kind of person to run away from as soon as possible. Foul-mouthed, narcissistic and clumsy, he seems entirely unsuitable for his chosen vocation. Even the supposedly cordon bleu dishes he cooks seem uninspiring, full of cloying sauces designed to obscure rather than bring out the taste of his basic ingredients.The script, supposedly described as comic, proceeds in a series of fits and starts, punctuated by curses from all the characters. The guiding principle seems to be this: - if you can't get a laugh by saying the f-word once, then repeat it four or five times so as to browbeat viewers into smiling.The plot is wearily sentimental; we can see what's coming from about half an hour into this 114-minute movie. Perhaps the best advice is to turn it off and go cook for oneself; it would be far more satisfying.",Chef
42,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Film's first celebration of foodie culture, 'Chef' is in tune with the times",8,7 July 2014,"After a foray into the blockbuster world, filmmaker Jon Favreau has settled back into his bread and butter (a bit literally), independent comedy. ""Chef"" is a feel-good movie that goes down easy, especially for any self-described ""foodies"" in the audience.Call it ""food porn"" if you will, but Favreau taps into contemporary society's obsession with food as an experience in this film, which also relies heavily on social media, particularly Twitter, as a means to propel the story forward. In fact, it might be the first film with a main plot conceit that hinges on social media (aside from ""The Social Network,"" obviously).Carl Casper (Favreau) is a renowned chef working in a popular restaurant. When big-time food blogger Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) comes to review the restaurant, Carl puts aside his plans for an ambitious menu and sticks to his classics at the urging of his owner (Dustin Hoffman), only to get reamed by Michel. Newly introduced to Twitter by his young son, Percy (Emjay Anthony), Carl engages in a war of words with Michel and ultimately quits his job. At the urging of his ex-wife (Sofia Vergara), Carl returns to Miami, where he made his career, with his son in tow and starts a food truck serving Cuban sandwiches.""Chef"" serves up more fun and little conflict, but it has a certain road trip and nostalgia quality that Favreau can get away with it. Sequences of mouthwatering food prep shots also infuse that same entertainment value one gets from watching Food Network or a Bravo food show. Supporting roles from Favreau's ""Iron Man 2"" stars Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. don't hurt either, especially because the latter hasn't done anything small in the last six years.Although he's become more known for his directing in the last five years, Favreau gives his best performance in recent memory, perhaps ever. Carl is a snippy chef with an ego and an attitude problem who can work his sensitive side when he needs. Favreau really owns all his screen time despite a career of supporting performances.What really stands out about ""Chef,"" however, is its modernity, or how in tune Favreau is our world in 2014 in terms of how we behave, what we like and how we communicate with each other. ""Chef"" is highly representative of the times, the kind of movie you might show to children in future generations to explain American culture in the 2010s. The way eating and food have evolved into something that connects people in a digital space is not lost on Favreau, and how prolific social media is in the film proves that it fascinates him too. What happens to Carl plays out the full spectrum of how social media can tear people's lives apart, yet also build them back up. That's a lot of power.""Chef"" has the exact kind of joie de vivre that you want in a summer indie, and is somewhat of an antidote for those who want feel-good independent films that don't completely focus on a young boy's coming of age. Carl's relationship with his son is important to the story, but it's mostly there to add heart.But no matter how you take to the story, don't sit down to watch ""Chef"" on an empty stomach – or at least be sure to have a delicious place in mind to go afterward.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

43,imseeg,Strong Warning: This flick will definitely make you crave for delicious food.,8,6 June 2018,"Strong Warning: dont watch this movie without food nearby. Because this flick will make you CRAVE for burgers, pickles, beignets, the whole lot. I never watch this movie unless I have my refrigerator filled to the brim with sausages and pickles and hot sauce.Director/Writer/Producer/Actor John Favreau really made his comedy masterpiece with this movie. He is already hilariously funny as an actor in this movie, but as a director he had total control over this movie and that results in a really funny and feel good FOOD flick. It is all about the love for food and family. Both are celebrated in this story about a food chef who couldnt get a job anymore, after he verbally abused a food critic. To pay the bills, he started a foodtruck and became his own boss. The movie describes the succes story of this high cuisine chef that starts cooking REAL FOOD for a change, together with his 10 year old son. It is a simple story, but what makes it so special, is the fact that the guy is divorced and at first reluctantly brings along his estranged kid in the foodtruck, to work with him. The father and the kid however start to bond through their love for authentic cuban food. Sounds rather simplistic, but the acting and the jokes are really great. I often dont like leading roles for kids, because they cant act properly, but this kid is really funny and endearing.Lovely supporting roles by Dustin Hoffman, Robert Downey Jr, Scarlet Johansson, Bobby Cannavale, Oliver Platt and John Leguizamo. That is an incredible supporting cast to die for! And they all play hilarious roles. A picture for everybody who wants to feel good, and loves REAL delicious food. Especially recommended for fathers and their kids, because this movie really has got a love for family at its heart.",Chef

He also stars in it. Jon plays a Chef that loves to cook. The only problem is that his boss will not give him the freedom he wants to experiment with the menu; his boss wants the same dishes every day. When Jon looses his job over a menu dispute, he ends up with a food truck-like those taco trucks that you see-and gets to create the dishes he wants to. The story also concerns his relationship with his ten year old son by his ex-wife, Sofia and then there is his present girlfriend, Scarlett-I guess that must be one of the best perks of being the writer/director/star of the movie is picking who plays your ex-wife and girlfriend. John plays his best friend and co-worker. There are a few cameos of some of his friends and during the end credits, you can see Jon learning how to cook for the movie. It's rated ""R"" for language and some smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes.

45,meeza,Chef sizzles!!!,10,24 May 2014,"There is something cinematically catching fire that many people are not aware of, and no it has nothing to do with a district-wide apocalyptic survival competition. The hunger game I am referring to is the immensely entertaining independent movie ""Chef"", which was mustered up by the great Jon Favreau. The former swinger returns to his independent roots by writing, directing, and starring in the tasty film dish that is ""Chef"". Favreau stars as Carl Casper, a passionate chef who runs a kitchen in a Los Angeles restaurant whose patrons include Hollywood socialites and celebrities. Carl is divorced to the beautiful Inez played modernly, I mean moderately, by Sofia Vergara. Carl has a 10-year old son named Percy (Emjay Anthony), who idolizes his father but unfortunately Carl sometimes disappears as Casper the semi-friendly Ghost Dad and does not provide the full attention and companionship that Percy deserves. Things get overheated for Carl in the kitchen when he is pressured by the restaurant's owner Riva to cook up his tasty, regular dishes against Carl's wishes of expanding his menu offerings. When Carl goes Carl Cray-Cray in response to a negative food review by a famous L.A. food critic, Carl ends up losing his job. In trying to start anew, Carl decides to get into the food-truck industry in the 305 or 786 (for that matter), and the meal wheels start rolling up the right path for him. Favreau cerebrally spices up ""Chef"" with a diversified offering; including the use of social media (most notably Twitter) in today's business world, the fruits of fatherhood, and the resiliency to strive for success. Favs also includes the right mix of verbal ingredients with his engaging screenplay of the movie. ""Chef"" also utensilizes I mean utilizes famous actors in supporting roles; this menu includes Robert Downey Jr. as Inez's ex-ex husband Marvin who actually helps Carl start up the food truck business, Scarlett Johannson as Molly the restaurant hostess who shares the pot with Carl, John Leguizamo in a pivotal role as Carl's right-hand cheffie Martin, Bobby Cannavale as Tony who diffuses the motion that there are too many cooks in the kitchen, and Oliver Platt as the stringent food critic Ramsey Michel. Oh, and this little-known actor named Dustin Hoffman also turns out for this one with his not-so-riveting role as Riva; Sorry Dustin, I am punning here!!!! My favorite thespian delivery of the film was of Favreau as the title character; all of the other performances were not a bit underdone or overcooked (except Hoffman's), but were not of the culinary thespian spectacular arts variety. ""Chef"" gets a five-star review from this pseudo film & food critic, and I do highly recommend that you reserve some time to digest this wonderful movie. ***** Excellent",Chef
46,estebangonzalez10,Make sure you don't watch this on an empty stomach,7,16 August 2014,"""I may not do everything great in my life, but I'm good at this.""Oh please don't be so humble Jon Favreau, you do everything pretty much great, and you proved it once again by directing, starring, and writing this charming and feel good family film. If there were ever a time where the term food porn could be applied to a film review, this is it because everything looked so tempting and delicious. Please don't watch this film on an empty stomach because you will be tortured by every single scene where Favreau is preparing food, whether it be a complicated dish for his fancy restaurant or a plain cuban sandwich from his food truck. But this isn't just a film glorifying food, it uses this passion people have for it and metaphorically shows us how it's never late to reinvent and discover ourselves. It is quite a change of pace for Favreau whose latest films were big budget productions (Cowboys & Aliens and the first two Iron Man movies), but this small family road trip film served its purpose in its own way for Favreau to reinvent himself once again and go back to his origins. Chef was an improvement from his last two films, but I still think Iron Man and Elf are Favreau's best ones. What Chef has going for it despite a pretty simple premise is how charismatic and natural the characters are in this film. The family drama feels authentic and it's never forced like so many films in the genre are. The film takes its time to introduce each character and doesn't simply rush things to the fun parts (the road trip). It's a feel food film but one that avoids clichés and forced situations and simply takes us along for a reinventing and natural ride. The premise is pretty simple, but the way in which Favreau presents each character is refreshing in its own way. He is likable in the lead role despite being a flawed character who remains friends with his ex-wife (played by Sofia Vergara) and is trying to balance out his time working in a respected restaurant while trying to connect with his young son, Percy (Emjay Anthony). He seems to have lost his creative freedom and is restrained by the owner (Dustin Hoffman) to continue serving the same dishes that have given the restaurant its fame (nice nod to the movie industry in Hollywood which restrains the creative instincts from its talented directors so that they continue to serve their audience the same dishes). But when a famous food critic (Oliver Platt) criticizes his dishes an online twitter war breaks out between them. Favreau decides it's time to move on and following his ex-wife's advice he travels with his son to Miami and buys a food truck. This is where their road trip begins and the two begin bonding. John Leguizamo and Bobby Cannavale play Favreau's assistants, and they both are the reason why the film is so charming. I was surprised with Anthony's performance as well. Having seen a couple of old films recently I can't help but realize how child acting has improved over the years. You never get the feeling that Anthony is ever acting or reading out his lines because every word and reaction felt completely natural. There were also plenty of funny and warm moments throughout the film. It was good to see Robert Downey Jr. and Favreau reunited once again although it was only for a couple of minutes. There was nothing groundbreaking about Chef, but it was so authentic and charming that it was hard to resist. The cast plays a key role in the success of this film and so does the food.",Chef

He loses his job after he doesn't get a favorable review for the food he serves from a respected food critic, sends him a nasty response on Twitter which he thinks is a private message, and then a confrontation with the critic caught on video goes viral. His reputation in ruins and his family life damaged due to a divorce and a strenuous relationship with his son, he starts to rebuild with his team on a food cart. This features a good cast and excellent performances all around. It might draw comparisons to the Bradley Cooper film Burnt. I loved all the scenes of the food being prepared.

50,3xHCCH,"Sweet and Familiar, with a Hint of Spice",7,4 July 2014,"Carl Casper is a passionate chef at a fancy restaurant, but a failure as a family man. An unceremonious altercation with an online food critic was a cruel twist in Carl's fate. Fortunately, he gets an opportunity which could reestablish his career, as well get his family back together again. Will Carl be able to make the most out of his second chance at success?Writer-Director Jon Favreau also stars in the lead role, and he was able to portray the gruff Carl with a big heart and that makes us root for him. The jokes were not exactly laugh-out-loud funny, but were at least delightful. This humor is basically because of Favreau's great chemistry with John Leguizamo, who played Martin, Carl's assistant chef. Leguizamo brings an infectious energy to his role, making it more memorable than it was on paper. Young Emjay Anthony plays Carl's sensitive son Percy with unusual maturity for a boy his age. A look at the poster will show that there are many big name stars in this film. However, they were in much smaller roles, probably just lending their star power to bolster this film's chances at the box office. Sofia Vergara plays Inez, Carl's estranged wife. Robert Downey Jr. plays Marvin, a rich eccentric Miami businessman, who used to be married to Inez. Dustin Hoffman plays the owner of the restaurant for whom Carl cooked for the past ten years. Scarlett Johansson plays Molly, the bistro hostess whom Carl fancies. Oliver Platt plays the vicious food critic Ramsey Michel whom Carl hates.I must say though that all those lovingly-shot close-ups of food preparation were so beautiful. They were the best scenes in this film. Seeing those tender barbecued slabs of meat and those tasty Cubano sandwiches made my mouth water. Foodies will love this film. Music, particularly energetic Cuban beats, was also a prominent feature of this film, though those long concert scenes could have been shortened. The road trip from Miami to New Orleans to Austin en route to LA looked like a lot of fun. The influence of Twitter is also well-demonstrated here, almost too well. It felt like watching an advertisement for that social networking site.We get the sense that Favreau wanted to send a message to the critics of his previous films, probably the Iron Man franchise. He was apparently saying that he was not in complete artistic control in those films and the harsh words of the critics hurt him. This film was his special way of starting over by getting back to his indie film roots.If not for its generous sprinkling of bad language, ""Chef"" could honestly have been a Disney Original Movie for TV. This was supposed to be light and fluffy family fare, but I thought that it was tad overdone in terms of its two-hour running time. But as a whole, the meal Favreau prepared for us in ""Chef"" was sweet and familiar, with just a hint of spice. It was warm-hearted and made with positive intentions, so it will be a pleasant viewing experience for most audiences. 7/10.",Chef

52,aharmas,"For the most part, a charmer and a crowd pleaser",7,9 July 2014,"Some people are going overboard with the praise for this film. Unlike ""Eat Man, Drink Woman"", the camera doesn't really show how powerful food can be. There is something off with the way some dishes just don't come across as succulent as they should. We need to hear it from the principals that they are ""good"" or better than that. I remember how Ang Lee, who is a magician with his visual language showed Chinese food in such a way that we felt like we had to run out of the theater and get our hands on some of that exotic food, but even the simple lunches that one character packed for her daughter's school lunch ""felt"" appetizing. There is very little of that here. Yes, we can imagine that those Cuban sandwiches are tasty and special, and there was a moment when they make a hybrid of Texan BBQ and the medianoche sandwich that almost crossed the line into something special, but as I mentioned before, food is present here, but it's not truly the star, and that might just be a good thing because there are other gems in here, and they do sparkle.Favreau is not bad here. He does o.k, but he's easily out shined by Leguizamo who always hits his targets with a look or a carefully delivered line, and who can't like Cannavale. The man steals the spotlight all the time. I was wondering what if we had another leading man here? Then again Favreau wrote it as vehicle for himself because he uses his physical attributes in a couple of key scenes. We would have liked more to come from his relationship with his son. That is actually well done here, integrating technology and human touch. Here's a presentation of how people can bond instead of isolating themselves. There are still some silly things holding their very portable tablets documenting a restaurant fight, but the young kid uses his phone to create a documentary of their trip, and it is a very touching moment in the last part of the film.As usual Vergara glows with her own powerful personality. She has the most expressive eyes in Hollywood nowadays. It doesn't hurt that she's gorgeous and unlike some of the other famous personalities out there doesn't rub it on our faces. She's presented here as a bright and lovely woman who understands there is more to gain by letting father and son grow closer than by creating barriers. She's funny and touching.The funniest moment comes from Downey who uses his dry sense of humor to give us a portrayal of man who thinks a lot of himself, but he's also practical and still shows plenty of humanity. There is a lot of good will in this movie, and even our ""evil"" food critic, wonderfully played by Platt manages to save the day in the final scenes of the movie. It's an interesting ending, a lot like a fairy tale, and it's refreshing that it reaches its ending because the film is getting a little long by this moment. Still, one is bound to leave with a smile on one's face, and watching a film full of good food and with a warm soundtrack can only make smile.",Chef
53,peterp-450-298716,Best you eat something before you watch this tasty movie ...,7,9 September 2014,"""You're never going to be happy cooking for someone else."" If there's one thing I really hate, it's those countless cooking television shows (and variations) we get on our plate (how appropriate) recent years. They even founded television channels like ""24 Kitchen"" and ""Njam"" where you can view cooking 24 hours a day. How is it possible. You can't even surf your TV-channels on an average night without bumping into some cooking program where they are preparing a delicious dish again. I'm sick and tired of hearing the terminology like baking,flaming, roasting, steaming, filleting, Bain-Marie, stewing, poaching, ragout, caramelize and the hype-word in recent years ""cuisson"". I'm not sick of seeing those plates with tasty food, but the oversupply of television programs with people cooking enthusiastically. Suddenly, any known chef de cuisine or unknown cooking amateur has a TV-show where they can demonstrate their skills while brandishing a wooden spoon.Why the hell would I watch a movie like ""Chef""? Especially when I already know in advance that it's mainly about cooking. Perhaps out of curiosity? The only cooking-related films I've ever seen are ""Ratatouille"" (where there's even a rat in charge) and ""La Grande Bouffe"" (but this film showed the art of cooking in a very different lurid way). Maybe it's because Jon Favreau played the leading role. Not that I've seen him acting that much. He had a small part in ""Friends"" years ago, he starred in ""The Break-up"" and he also did something in ""Iron Man"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". He also directed the first successful ""Iron Man"". But it's his charisma that convinced me. He looks like a cheerful and sociable chubby guy who converses in a fairly amusing and slightly lisping manner. Looking at the size of his waist I guess he's also a fan of culinary excesses and therefore he's perfect for this role as chef. And then there's also the pleasure of admiring Sofia Vergara as Inez, the ex-wife of Carl. What a killer babe. I'll never understand why someone would want to divorce such an adorable,sensual person. I'm sure her butt look more appetizing than that of the pig that Carl cuts into pieces in the beginning of the film.Cooking in itself is a central theme in this film, but the main focus is on other matters. Firstly, there is the father-son relationship that has grown crooked after a while. Carl focused fully on his prestigious place in the kitchen, so he ignored and neglected his son Percy (Emjay Anthony). The whole film is about the recovery of that relationship and rediscovering each other in a beautiful, serene, sometimes funny and sometimes sad way. Secondly, it shows how in today's society it's seemingly dead simple to ruin someones career simply by writing a destructive review. The consequences of a flame-war could have far-reaching consequences. Especially if the virtual brawl goes viral. And then it shows once again how that virtual world is merged with our daily life The way Percy uses Facebook, Twitter and other online services while driving around America with a food truck, is perhaps a bit exaggerated, but it is an example of the impact of the internet nowadays.""Chef"" is nothing more than just another film in which the main character is successful in the beginning, has to go through a deep valley with the known setbacks and towards the end he rises again unscathed from the battle as a conquering hero. And in ""Chef"" everything really turns out all right again. This is not an ordinary feel-good movie, but an extraordinary feel-good movie. But despite that, you can really enjoy other things. The juicy lingo of his two confidants Tony and Martin. The enthusiasm Percy shows during the trip. Yet a little warning though : make sure you have eaten firmly before you watch this film, because I guarantee you'll be running into the kitchen now and then to get a snack. At times it looks so delicious and appetizing, I spontaneously started to drool. Those browned butter filled Cuban grill sandwiches were so painfully slow prepped, it was almost a torture. A 3D flat screen TV with scents option, would have been ideal at that particular moment.A blandly and not too complicated film. In cooking terms one can summarize it as follows: it's not expensive haute cuisine but simple food that they serve us here. A film with a positive attitude (rare nowadays) with beautiful renditions and a surprising supporting cast. Dustin Hoffman as the old restaurant owner who only trusts a classic,safe menu and doesn't feel like following the new trends. Scarlett Johansson as a colleague of Carl who supports him on all fronts. Robert Downey Jr. as the eccentric rich man who helps Carl getting started. Jon Favreau who still has the passion to create eatable art even when things get him down. Emjay Anthony is doing everything to get back his father's attention he's entitled to and at the same time shows his talents. And the whole film is dressed with a sauce of hugely catchy music. Normally I don't pay attention to the soundtrack, but in this film it fits like a glove. The Salsa music creates that summer feeling, the blues kicks in when it starts to be corny and ""Sexual Healing"" is sung a capella. The soundtrack is a perfect ingredient for this tasty movie. Don't expect profound life lessons in ""Chef"". But the end result is still a pleasant and definitely tasty-looking ride. Favreau supplies a genuine end product that tastes moreish ...",Chef
54,AudioFileZ,Film Food Fun,7,9 August 2014,"Faureau as I know him is a director and sometimes actor. Or is it the reverse? That's the thing, I'm not sure which is first or second. Chef makes it clear that in the right role Faureau is a great actor (yes, he's the writer and director too). Strangely, he reminds me of Albert Brooks, funny but without the neurosis.The ritual that is food: the conception, preparation, and serving is at once the most sensuous as well as labor-intensive brush with sweaty human frailty (Murphy's Law?) a working man can combine. It's extremely personal and a daily challenge to pull off well. Not unlike Beethoven having to each day write, and conduct, another Fifth Symphony. A chef who produces masterpieces regularly is a victim of his own success. That, combined with outsiders, as in our case a ""riva"" owner, demanding the SAME symphony be played over and over. Forget about a possibly brilliantly inspired new work of culinary genius. Of course, this makes for a major conundrum, and online ugly showdown. So begins the story that is the movie Chef. Faureau totally nails and inhabits the character of harried food impresario who after great initial success has landed in a rut both professionally and personally.Chef's son Percy, played by Emjay Anthony, takes on a major role in this fictional food adventure. If a child could be more lovable on celluloid it would be hard to imagine. There's also Chef's ex-wife Inez played by the striking Sofia Vergara. Admittedly, this role throws a curve. Why she's his ex isn't fleshed out leaving one to wonder since she's kind like Mother Teresa and genuinely supportive. And, by all outward appearances she's cash-flush plus runway ready too. Well, this is Hollywood after-all! Chef has to have a wing-man and taking that role to great heights is John Leguizamo as Martin, the sous chef. He's fantastic because he's a pro and this role is tailor-made.In addition there's notable performances by Dustin Hoffman (restaurant owner), Oliver Platt (food critic), Robert Downey Jr. (a delightful ex cameo role), and Scarlett Johansson (hostess w/ a sweet disposition)...It's a dream cast and works as expected. Throw in a magical road-trip with some pretty tasty, and extremely well placed music, and watching Chef is great fun. Don't miss this one as it is easy to like.",Chef
55,jadepietro,What's Cookin'?,7,2 February 2015,"This film is recommended.Eat, drink, and be merry! The Foodie Movie continues to whet our movie-going appetite. Foreign films like Babette's Feast, Chocolat, La Grande Bouffe, Tampopo, and Like Water, Like Chocolate. American releases like Julie & Julia, Soul Food, and Big Night tantalizes us. Food soothes our intellect in My Dinner with Andre. Even in animated features like Ratatouille, food is king. We play with our food in scenes like When Harry Met Sally or Tom Jones. From sweet to spicy, it becomes a means of romance as in Lady and the Tramp or sexual foreplay in 9½ Weeks or The Cook,The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. Most recently this year, two films can be added to this long list of foodie movies: The Hundred-Foot Journey (see archives for review) and now, the independent film, Chef.Written, directed, and starring Jon Favreau, this small and innocuous little trifle is more comfort food than a five course meal. Chef always plays it safe, following the formulaic recipe for film success and never venturing into real gourmet cuisine or creative filmmaking. This is a film about the love of cooking with more attention paid to the mouth-watering close-ups of various platted wonders than the plot or characters behind the stove.The conventional story follows Carl Casper, an unhappy head chef in a California high-end restaurant who leaves his job to find himself and rediscovers his Cuban passion for cooking via a food truck business. Along the way, he establishes a stronger tie with his son, Percy (a natural Emlay Anthony), and his ex-wife, Inez (a far too glamorous miscast Sofia Vergara). No spoilers here, we've seen this storyline for the umpteenth time. Although the overnight success angle seems unrealistic as does the relationship between Favreau and Vergara, the film has all the right ingredients with the tenderness on display in the father-son moments. These scenes are the film's strength and have a genuine honesty in their depiction. While Favreau's script needs more added zip and tang, his acting and direction are solid.With a skilled supporting cast including Oliver Platt, Scarlett Johansson, Bobby Cannavale, and John Leguizamo, Chef is always entertaining. The film remains thoroughly pleasant and diverting, even if it's a rather predictable flavor of the month.

56,Seraphion,"Great entertainment, yet it's off from what it aims to be",7,6 August 2014,"The story rolls out quite well. Yet From my perspective it doesn't share the duration in a pretty balanced way. The early conflict takes too long to build and climax, yet the usual 'road to resurrection' part takes too many moments in a montage part. The food shown here makes me curious of how they'd taste. I would've given this movie a 5 or 6 at most if it's only the comedy or family movie it aims to be. Yet the parts with all the cooking practice are done greatly that they become very enjoyable, and they lift this movie's score for me. The cooking parts are so convincing on screen for me. The acting feels so much a so-so for me. I even think it's a waste of talent for Downey, Johansson, Platt, Cannicale and even Hoffman because they play such insignificant roles. Favreau did okay to make the movie seem quite alive.",Chef
57,richard-1787,"Very much a feel-good movie, so beware if you don't like them",3,8 July 2014,"The saving grace of this movie is definitely Jon Favreau the actor. He is immediately likable, and you completely buy him as a man whose great passion is creating great food. It's important that he's so winning because his character is not always very likable, especially in his relationship with his young son. We never find out why Favreau's character was divorced by his extremely beautiful and sympathetic wife, but we can't help but wonder if it wasn't because he puts his work before everything else and too often disappointed her as well as his son. He's passionate about his work, yes, and that's great. But he has also fathered a son, and married a woman. You do that, you have to make compromises with your own passions and show a little responsibility. Actual interest in your family members would be even better. He doesn't know how to do that, and it makes him, as he himself admits, a bad dad.The weakest part of this movie is Jon Favreau the screen writer. There are definitely the makings of a good movie here. But it plays to sentimentality too often, especially the closer it gets to the end. When his character gets remarried, without any explanation, to his son's mother, you feel like hunting for the TV remote, because you're sure this is a made-for-TV movie of the Hallmark Hall of Fame variety. When the critic who dissed his original restaurant menu online offers to back him in a new restaurant, you're wondering what could be left to toss in to the mixture.It also takes too long to get to the most interesting part, when Favreau's character sets up a food truck so that he can prepare the sort of food he wants to make, not the menus dictated to him by his restaurant-owner boss and his middle-class, middle-aged clientele. (Shades of ""Big Night,"" which handled that better.) On the other hand, once we get there, it needs more development. What made his food so popular, different from the other food trucks you see parked next to it in Austin and other cities? Is it just a matter of the pr his son creates online? If so, that might have merited some reflection/discussion.One example of the lack of development that could have been interesting: At the end of the road trip, Favreau's character tells his son, with no explanation, that when they reach home in Los Angeles, the boy will no longer be able to work with his father, even on weekends. Why? When he drops the boy off at his mother's house, the boy clings to his father, not wanting to let him go. It's very moving. But there's no real grief on Favreau's face. He doesn't seem to feel much.Then, later, he watches a video his son had created of pictures and short clips taken during their cross-country tour in the food truck. He is clearly moved, and ends up calling his son to say that he will, after all, be able to work with him during the school year.Favreau the writer doesn't do anything with this. A better writer or director - Favreau is both for this movie - would have seen that this could be a commentary on art in general and film in particular. Art, in this case film, can put together elements of our lives in a way that, by the talent of the editing, makes them far more moving and meaningful for us than those various elements had been when scattered through our lives. (That's Proust, for example, in a nutshell.) That would then tie back to what Favreau's character tells his son as they start their odyssey across America: food is important to him, because he can use it to touch people. That is what the son's arrangement of the photos and clips had done. So then, is Favreau's character the chef a metaphor for Favreau the film-maker and his conception of the role of cinema?So much could have been done with this. But nothing is done.It's a shame, as I said. There are good things here. But this movie too often goes for the ""awe"" factor - which it got from the middle-aged women in the audience when I saw it in the theater this afternoon. They loved it when Favreau's character got to remarry his son's mother. I thought: ""Ah yes, the kitchen sink as well."" A better script could have made this a much better movie. Not artier, just better. Given it more substance, like the food that this Chef so longed to create.",Chef

Then there are too few food passages, half of which are fast food like sandwiches and hot dogs, just a few dishes cooked by the chef. The music is good.

59,brando647,CHEF Has an Infectious Positive Vibe (and the Food.....),8,13 March 2015,"CHEF is something I feel we've been waiting for from Jon Favreau for a while: a passion project. He's been on a strong blockbuster but CHEF comes across as something more personal. If you've heard him speak on the project or listened to the commentary he did for the film, you'd see it's the case. And the final result is a really satisfying film that entertains as much as it stirs the appetite. He wrote, directed, and starred in the film in the lead role of popular Los Angeles chef Carl Casper. Carl is head chef in a ritzy restaurant owned by the finicky Riva (Dustin Hoffman) who'd rather serve the same tired dishes every night than change the menu and potentially scare off business. Carl is suffocating under Riva's oppressive rule over the kitchen and it leads to a poor review from a powerful local food critic (Oliver Platt). Eager to keep his finger on the pulse of the news, Carl starts a Twitter account and finds himself in a flame war with the critic, eventually confronting him in a raging explosion in front of countless camera phones. With his career officially in the toilet, Carl is inspired to get back to his roots and he puts together a food truck specializing in Cuban sandwiches. With the help of his former sous chef Martin (John Leguizamo) and his son, Carl takes his new business on a road trip from Miami to Los Angeles, and along the way he reawakens a love for his profession and repairs his shaky relationship with his son.Everything about this movie works really, really well. Again, this was obviously a passion project for Favreau and, since it wasn't a big budget studio film, he had full creative control to create exactly what he wanted. This is reflected in his performance. I've been a casual fan of Favreau's for a while and I'm pretty confidant in calling this my favorite of his performances. And his enthusiasm must've been contagious because everyone involved turns in fantastic jobs. John Leguizamo, for example, is excellent here. He matches Favreau's excitement and naturalism in his performance. The two of them both look as if they're genuinely having fun in the movie. As strong as the two of them are, the film still wouldn't have worked if Emjay Anthony (the boy who plays Carl's son Percy) had dropped the ball. Child actors are pretty hit-and-miss and a crap child performance is enough to ruin a movie for me, but Anthony does great. But while the cast was pitch perfect in the film, my opinion is probably still a little biased because this movie appeals to my appetite like no other. Holy crap, I can't watch this movie without running out to one of my local Cuban joints for a sandwich (thankfully, I've got my choice of a few). I'd never tried a Cuban sandwich before watching this movie but Favreau and Leguizamo spending an entire movie raving about them. CHEF glorifies the food (as it should, considering the subject matter) with a love that obviously comes from director Favreau, and it's infectious.The movie, if I had any ""issues"" with it (and I'm using that in the loosest sense of the term), has very loose structuring. It's a good solid half hour or so before circumstances force Carl out of his position as head chef in the restaurant and then probably another fifteen minutes or so before the food truck really comes to fruition. I can probably blame this on my own ignorance of the plot before going in but I expected more development with the food truck. Really, I expected the focus to be the food truck and his new career thriving within the smaller, more personal environment. But in reality, this is a movie about relationships and the food is just a catalyst used to bring a father and his son together. With his job at the restaurant, Carl was often dismissive of his son. Divorced from his beautiful, surprisingly still caring wife (Sofia Vergara), he often leaves his son in her care and, when he does spend time with him, it's often while obsessing about the restaurant. When his son accompanies him on the truck's maiden voyage, it gives them a chance to come together and he brings his son into his world of cooking and food appreciation. Once the actual point of the movie became apparent, I settled in fine and I really did enjoy it. The ending just sort of happens. There's not some major revelation or big climactic moment. It just sort of falls into place and leaves you with the knowledge that everything is better off. I guess I'm just preprogrammed by modern bombastic Hollywood to expect some grand finale but CHEF is very subdued in that way. It ties up its loose ends, gives some happy vibes, and signs off. I can respect that.I can't recommend CHEF enough. It's just such a pleasant movie with characters you can get behind. It's so easy to care about these characters and cheer for them to succeed; they're some of the more sympathetic characters I've seen recently. The movie is peppered with little cameos (including IRON MAN alumni Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johannson) and the attention to detail on the food will leave you starving for your own sandwich in the end. CHEF was one of my favorite little surprises of 2014.",Chef

He decides to refit a truck and cook on wheels. Carl is divorced but is friendly with ex-wife Inez (Sofie Vergara), but he needs to bond with Percy (Emjay Anthony) his son.This is a pretty good made-for-TV movie where nothing happens. It's bland, a slice of life light drama. No funny lines, no funny skits. Nothing is overdone. Fairly good acting all around. Like I said a slice of life that could happen to anyone.Some may call this a feel good movie because all hinges on success with the food truck and Carl bonding with Percy. I suppose that could all be true, but it would have been a lot better if there were some funny lines, or even a funny slap-stick skit. Jon Favreau is a good actor, but should get someone else to do the writing especially if he wants to put some funny things in there. He wrote this. See what I mean? Please don't tell me he used to do Stand-Up (he did Improv early on). Some of the music was spot on. The photography and cinematography in New Orleans and Texas were very good. Kudos. Some support cast members who had very short scenes: Scarlett Johansson, and Robert Downey, Jr, Again, the big names drew me in. One day I will learn (you always say that). Again, bland, not funny, a slice of life that normal people live most of the time. Watchable, but definitely not a Comedy. A good made-for-TV movie.

62,Sergeant_Tibbs,Delicious but light.,7,14 August 2014,"Coming off the back of blockbusters Iron Man and Cowboys & Aliens, Jon Favreau returns with his most personal project to date. Really, his passion shining through here is what the magic of Chef is all about. The effort he put into the role is overt and thoroughly impressive at every turn. He has been pretty good in the past with charming work like Elf, but this has his stamp all over it as opposed to studio dominated films. It's full of energy with entertaining montages, killer soundtrack, genuine sense of humour and likable bit parts from A-listers and chums of Favreau. But of course, to make a film so personal and small scale it comes at a price of it rarely being bold enough. Its highs and lows are modest and outside of its quite touching but superfluous story of a father bonding with his son, it doesn't have any tender nerves to touch besides the bewildering theme of how damaging criticism can be which feels far too bitter to enjoy. Otherwise it's just a good time with a good bunch of people. It is a delight to see a film so in touch with social media in a good way though.

The movie is engrossing and engaging right from the beginning and is a treat for all the food- mad people.Art of cutting the vegetables and cooking the food is absolutely stunning with humor smeared over it and bond between father and son adding extra spice to it. Hats off to Farveau to attempt something different and coming out of his comfort zone. He did a marvelous job as an actor as well supported by Emjay Anthony who plays his son.

65,brchthethird,An immensely satisfying treat,8,30 January 2015,"As I've been exposing myself to new types of movies and different filmmakers, I sometimes feel like I'm trying new food. CHEF, directed by and starring Jon Favreau, was a delightful little indie ""dish"" and an immensely satisfying treat. It's about a chef, Carl Casper (Favreau), who works for this French restaurant. One night a critic (Oliver Platt) comes in and later posts a scathing review on Twitter that goes viral. Carl, a little bit new to social media, inadvertently starts a flame war with the critic and challenges him to come back because he'll cook the menu he wanted to cook the first time around. Things don't end up going so well, and Carl leaves his job as chef and takes his ex-wife's (Sofia Vergara) advice about starting a food truck. Narratively, the film is somewhat divided. The first third or so is more of a traditional ""food"" movie with some relationship drama thrown in, but at a critical point the film shifts gears into a road trip movie. Structure aside, I thought that they did a great job balancing the food aspects (which looked amazing) and the character relationships. The key relationship is between Carl and his son, who comes along with him on his food truck journey. It was really great to see how the relationship changed and improved over the course of the film. Something should also be said for the cast. Although most of them have relatively small roles, Favreau was able to call in some favors and get Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, Bobby Cannavale, John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara to appear here. Even though most of these people only appear in the first half when Carl works at the restaurant (and are therefore dropped once the narrative switches gear), it was still nice to see them. I thought they all gave excellent performances, even for such small roles. The only iffy member of the cast was the boy who plays Carl's son who, at times, seemed like a blank slate. Maybe that was intentional? I don't know, but he also is a child actor so I won't make too big a deal out of it. The only other aspect of the movie I find fault with is the way in which the film ends, which I won't spoil here. All I'll say about it is that it was a little TOO nice and clean. That being said, I thought that CHEF really worked on an emotional level. Overall, it might not be the best film I've ever seen, but it had a feelgood atmosphere, great dialogue and some great cooking. Bon appetit!",Chef
66,maurice_yacowar,Ruined chef rediscovers community in food and family,7,8 June 2014,"Jon Favreau's Chef resonates as a unifying address to the divided American political scene. It speaks to the liberal (at least theoretically, Democrat) side as an allegory of the artist who needs to sustain his personal vision and individuality in the face of conformist and capitalist pressures. Carl (Favreau)'s career suicide begins when his boss (Dustin Hoffman) forces him to serve the visiting food critic the conventional menu instead of letting him free his inspiration. The chef's predicament mirrors Jon Favreau's dilemma as a film director, torn between making personal statements like this film or Made and the commercial blockbusters like his Iron Man franchise and the quirkier Cowboys and Aliens. Carl's fumbling with the new social media provides another example of the dangers in a mass address.The film speaks to the Republican ethos by showing a largely Latin American community working very hard to get ahead in America, exulting in their self-sufficiency, not looking for handouts. There is very little government interference with Carl's new food truck business. The friendly cop is no lumbering bureaucracy. Carl's relationship with his ex-wife Inez (Sofia Vergara) makes no sense psychologically or chemically but it encapsulates the country's ethnic diversity and its historic dependence upon a influx of immigrants. Favreau's latent Jewishness evokes the first wave of American immigration, Inez's Cuban glitter the current one. The film's predominantly Cuban score confirms this celebration, as do the feel-good romantic ending and the sensual delight of the food scenes.Both the art and the self-sufficient immigrant themes converge in the film's emphasis on community connection. The chef shouldn't go off on a personal campaign (Hold the sweetbreads) but has to connect to the audience, his market. So Carl revives his career — and as it happens his first family — by dedicating his food truck to Cuban street cuisine. The promise of Cuban sandwiches mobilizes the reluctant workmen to help the gringo. Moving from posh restaurant to food truck recovers the most elementary principle, preferring hearty folk cuisine over the posh restaurant's precious designer morsels. When Carl, funded by his ex-enemy critic (Oliver Platt), opens a new posh restaurant at the end it escapes the stigma of his first establishment by keeping his dedication to the people's cuisine. The miniature of his food truck shows Carl has not forgotten his roots. Of course the key reconnection is familial. Carl's journey salvages his relationship with his son — and through that Inez. It returns Carl to the freer, sambaing and passionate spirit that presumably first attracted her. She even helps him work the truck. As his waitress girlfriend (Scarlett Johansson) reminded him, he was not happy in his initial situation. Perhaps the corpulent Carl's fascination with the dancing/singing skeleton, Mister Bonejangles, reveals his sense that he has lost his inner being. That he rediscovers and liberates when he hits the road with his buddy and his son with a populist immigrant menu. The chef recovers his inner cook. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.",Chef
67,sharky_55,What's a Vine???,7,2 December 2015,"Jon Favreau pretty much looks the part of the jovial food loving chef, so it is unfortunate that the writing of his character and his acting don't do that justice. There are many many musical cues in this movie, each setting a different mood, and in between these tracks, talking, talking and more talking. These explanations are lacklustre, even as the food is exquisitely prepared. There is a scene where the hostess Molly lies seductively on a coach, yet it is Scarlett Johanson who is being seduced by the wonderful combinations of flavour that Casper is cooking up in his pan - this is a intoxicating representation of desire and love and food, and certainly more convincing than any half-assed explanation he gives to his son when he offers up a burnt sandwich: ""Yeah, well...I love it"". And certainly sexier than any love scene would have been. And then she disappears, and a seemingly hinted romantic subplot vanishes in the dust of this messy script. Another good friend, Robert Downey Jr., seems to perform the same act, in perhaps the blandest role I have seen him in yet, and these seem more like the mates of Favreau doing a favour and boosting the opening box office draw. He tries to shift that romantic chemistry to the character of the ex-wife Inez, but that is unsuccessful because she is not a character, but a somewhat weak link to the Cuban world of cuisine which gives new life and spark to Casper's cooking. And then she is helping out too, and then they are getting married...for some reason. It feels like there are a few chunks of story missing from their relationship entirely. The attention is given mostly to that of the strained father-son relationship. It is unfortunate that Emjay Anthony's performance is rather stilted; the most authentic moments exist in the one second video, where the phone footage feels candid and genuine, and it looks almost like off-camera bonding. The rest of the time he is busy trying his hardest to turn the movie into a Twitter commercial, or shooting Vines, or taking selfies...suffice to say, it is painful to see any director try this sort of pandering nonsense. Why show human interaction when you can just cover the screen with pop-ups and tweets, and make the notification icon tick over rapidly? Why not shoot an emotional meltdown through a camera phone - how viral and shocking! Favreau also resorts to oddly placed bits of profanity, which loses its punch because it is sprinkled lightly in place or anger/real emotion, but without any force or actual persuasion in the dialogue: ""I'm a f'cking meme"". And it also simultaneously tries to end with that family feel-good 6 months later cliché. And then there is the confusing matter of the scathing critic in the first place. We aren't given nearly enough information about Casper's position in the food world, only that Ramsey is immensely popular (and something tells me he knows more about social media quips than food) and thus his words are binding. So either Casper is not a great cook (but he clearly is shown to be) or he is not passionate about cooking such a bland menu anymore - but what exactly is wrong with lava cake and caviar egg? Why does he pine so much for the high cuisine and yet continues to wallow the same restaurant, when he is clearly talented enough to try his hand elsewhere? In his journey he discovers it is not about the type of food, but why you are doing it. And when we hear the crisp sound of knife hitting the bread of a Cubano, we know he is at home. It's too bad that there is little cultural back-story here. When Casper addresses the staff about the night's menu, there is a clear sense of boredom in the air, and Casper himself seems disinterested. I would be too if I was as talented as he was in the kitchen, yet somehow shackling himself to a mid level family restaurant.",Chef

Never a dull moment, but it lingers in the first act too long, and just when things get up and running there doesn't seem to be a conflict any longer. ???

77,cardsrock,Supremely enjoyable,8,14 January 2020,"It was nice to see Jon Favreau take a break from blockbusters to make a smaller, more personal film with Chef. His direction shines through with plenty of great shots of delicious food and lots of personality. The actors seem to be having fun and it's pretty contagious. Chef doesn't the most original story out there, but it's simply hard to resist its infectious spirit and solid filmmaking.",Chef

79,Laakbaar,You won't want to miss this one,8,14 July 2014,"I really enjoyed this funny and heart-warming movie about a chef and his relationship with food and his son. The film is worth about 8.5 in my books. The current IMDb score is roughly accurate, despite the inexplicably negative reviews and voting of a tiny minority.Leguizamo and Vergara light up every scene they're in. Quite a few A-list Hollywood stars are in this movie, but it's not a Hollywood movie at all. The performances by all the main and supporting actors were excellent. When I try to single one or two out, I just start thinking about how good the others were too.You feel like the movie had no script at all, that's how natural the writing was. Remarkably cliché-free.I was subtly but deftly moved at the end. This is an optimistic guy movie but women will enjoy it as well.Kudos to Favreau (of course) and to everyone else involved in this film. I have a new respect for Favreau and will watch out for his films in the future.",Chef

So DO NOT GIVE OUT THE BURNT FOOD SON. Then he found out his Young Son was Advertising on the Computer as they Drove City to City on our Way. The Best Food on its way then his Father found out. It kind of Blew his Father and Friend away. His Father put his Little Boy in charge Plus making Foods. It was kind of like Old School. It reminded me when I grew up.

The former is predictable while the latter is alright with a lot funny moments.Chef is good because of the atmosphere. It radiates good mood despite everything that might befall the protagonists. And when it comes to the scenes with preparing food, Chef will make your mouth water. In my case it happened after a hefty dinner, which gives you the feeling how good they are.With this being said and if you're acquainted with the current offer of comedies in cinema or on TV, you'll appreciate Chef for it's unassuming delivery.",Chef
83,TheSquiss,"Mouth-watering food film that, ultimately, has little meat on its bones.",5,12 June 2014,"When renowned restaurant chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) refuses to compromise his vision and loses his job, his desperation for both an income and freedom of creativity (and an encouraging ex-wife) prompts him to buy a dilapidated food truck and hit the road to find his own, rejuvenated way with his career, family and life.That's the premise of Chef. Unfortunately it's also the first half of the film and there are no surprises thereafter.The trailer of Chef suggests a comedy drama, the cinematic equivalent of a light snack. What Favreau (as writer, actor and director) serves up, however, is long drawn out meal with little substance that devours an evening. While there are moments of light humour Chef lacks the laughs to deserve it's billing as a 'comedy' and the drama is both limited and obvious.But, despite the obvious flaws, Chef is still a generally enjoyable film that is well performed for the most part with an enjoyable gathering of Favreau's friends. There is a sense here that one evening he came up with an idea, flicked through his speed dial numbers and cast his film with friends over a beer in his armchair. And it works a heck of a lot better than Seth Rogan's vanity project, This is the End.Central to the flow, aside from Casper (Favreau doing his Favreau thing), are Martin (John Leguizamo), his assistant chef and constant encouragement, and Percy (Emjay Anthony) his hitherto largely ignored son, who also believes in him. Then there's ex-wife Inez (Sofía Vergara) who encourages him in all he does. And waitress/playmate Molly (Scarlett Johansson) who encourages him to get out and be creative. Hang on a minute Yes, Casper appears to be a failure who would amount to nothing without the constant validation of others. And yet we are expected to believe he is a great, groundbreaking, visionary of the culinary world? And both Molly and Inez fell for him? Nope. I'm not buying it.In the least subtle sponsorship deal since Google's feature-length commercial The Internship, Chef relies heavily on social networking giant Twitter, and gives us all a jolly good lesson on how to use it to succeed in business. Alas, when it comes to shouting about Vine, Favreau (the director) forgets the rules he has on screen expert Percy spell out; the video he allegedly creates shooting only one second per day, very clearly wasn't. Clumsy, clumsy.But far from being leaden and stodgy, Chef trundles along pleasantly; it just takes a very long time about it. There are two principal reasons to spend time with the chef, though, even though he's neither of them. Robert Downey Jnr as the ex-wife's ex-husband, Marvin, is the biggest reason to smile and the cause of the few real laughs. His self-centered, brash, egotistic fruitcake is a genuine pleasure to watch (from a distance) and a welcome change of pace and character from Downey Jnr's omnipresent superhero franchise.And then there's the real star of Chef: The food. This is the most mouth-watering movie since Big Night and Chocolat. Be warned: Don't watch Chef on an empty stomach!

84,RevRonster,"Fun, funny, and charming...",10,30 September 2014,"Some who watch ""Chef"" may think I'm wrong with giving the film a perfect score but there was just a charm to this film that had its hooks in me and didn't let go the entire time.I won't lie and say the film itself is perfect because it isn't. The only real complaint I had about the movie was the slightly sloppy treatment that the relationship between Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) and his ex-wife (Sofia Vergara). While their story plays out exactly how you would predict it, I wish a little more time was utilized for them and the rekindling of their fire. However, that minor complaint aside, I still really enjoyed the film.The film is dramatic when it needs to be and hilarious all the way through. Jon Favreau wrote, directed, and acted in a delightfully entertaining film with a great cast. From beginning to end, the film had me smiling and laughing and will definitely end up as one of those films I turn to in order to brighten my mood when dark clouds come rolling in. All in all, a fun movie that showcased some real fun chemistry with its cast—especially scenes with Favreau, Emjay Anthony, and John Leguizamo.Hi! My name is Rev.

85,Java_Joe,Don't see this on an empty stomach.,8,1 June 2019,"To put it bluntly, Chef is food porn. And I mean that in the best possible way. To those of us that have a love of food and not just the eating of it, this is a movie you need to see.Jon Favreau plays a chef that has had enough of cooking other people's food. He wants to cook his food and he wants to do it his way. So he leaves his job, gets a food truck and uses it to reconnect with his son. Along the way he cooks some incredible looking meals, seduces Scarlett Johansson with some pasta, bonds with his son and generally lives his dream. It's uplifting and it's going to make you hungry.I'm not kidding about the hunger part. This shows food being made and every scene has you going, ""I want to eat that"". I tracked down the recipe John Leguizamo uses to make his Cubano sandwiches and when I made it, it was nothing short of fantastic. Even the grilled cheese sandwich Jon Favreau makes for his son looks like the most delicious thing you could imagine.Strong performances all around. Jon Favreau is a great actor and director. John Leguizamo plays off him so well. And of course the lovely Scarlett Johansson is lovely as always.This is a a movie with heart and soul and a desire to eat.",Chef

Favreau's a classic Jimmy Stewart figure here, and acquits himself well. . Oliver Platt is fun in a couple of significant scenes, RD JR's short cameo is at his crazy best for a brief moment. rest of cast is perfectly fine. Otherwise it's that same ole father-son bit, but with a Cuban sandwich, which, though delicious, is not enough to lift this above the usual tired maudlin' ""feel good"" everyday.
Intro of intricate preparations and exquisite presentations of an array of familiar current better restaurant offerings is beautiful to behold, and will make foodies drool.
Superspectacular soundtrack! really the best thing about this project,
My suggestion: watch the beautiful foodie intro, then turn the picture off and listen to el ritmo, checking back into the picture for scenes of Favreau with anybody but the kid, unless you want to risk sugar-shock from the treacle. Do that and you'll experience the best of Chef
grudging 7, should be 61/2, or even lower if not for Favreau's honest and affecting portrayal
but soundtrack gets a 10!",Chef
87,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,A Somewhat Empty Plate,5,18 May 2014,"Fans of SWINGERS, good news That film's writer and star is back in indie form after directing and igniting the IRON MAN franchise, and then crash landing with the big budget misfire, COWBOYS AND ALIENS In CHEF, Jon Favreau plays Carl Casper, a name that sounds like a superhero's true identity; but his powers are in the kitchen of someone else's restaurant. That's the first of three dilemmas: His boss doesn't want any original menu items, making Carl's work a dull template, eventually beleaguered by a top food critic who, going viral on Twitter, shares an awful review that turns into an online feud, eventually making our put-upon hero look ridiculous. And on top of quitting his job, Carl's a weekend dad for a moody son who wants more and more time.The funniest scenes occur as Favreau displays his usual neurotic charm, trying desperately to climb out of a seemingly endless hole. But halfway through, as the main plot ushers in of a once great restaurant chef running his own food truck it's all sunshine viewed through rose-colored glasses, deleting the edgy banter that made SWINGERS, and even the flawed follow-up, MADE, so engaging.One problem is how easily Carl comes to own the truck in the first place, conceived and handed down by his ex-wife and backed by her rich ex-husband, played by IRON MAN himself, Robert Downey Jr., in a caustic cameo surprisingly awkward and unfunny (Jon's ex partner Vince Vaughn would have worked better). But this scene's purpose is how Carl floats into what should be a risky venture, which, through his son's twitter account, becomes such an instant smash there's little left for the characters, or the audience, to worry about.If the intention was to make a feel-good road movie about a father and son bonding, Favreau's hit a home run. Or if exploiting delicious looking food is a factor – this could very well be the CITIZEN KANE of taste buds. But for anyone who prefers a dash of perpetual stress as an essential comedy ingredient, CHEF, while somewhat satisfying, is a meal that leaves much to be desired.",Chef
88,bbickley13-921-58664,A great meal at the movies!!!,8,11 May 2014,"Jon Feavueu gives us another masterpiece in the area of Swingers and Made. It's surprising that his wing man, Vince Vaughn was not in the movie, but I feel the flick is too grown up for his type of comedy.It's funny, romantic and entertaining. Jon does a good job writing and directing this film as well as starring in it. He plays a master chef trying to bring his art to making food. Jon brings an everyday man to the role that everyone can relate too. Like when his boss played by Dustin Huffman, puts a cap on his creativity. No matter what kind of job you have, everyone can relate to these scenes.I loved how social media played a big part in the movement of the story. We live in a new age where going viral can make or break you and the movie shows every aspect of it from Jon's character Carl Casper who is illiterate of the situation to his ten year old son Percy's natural embrace of it. Speaking of Carl's son, Percy, the movie's most beautiful relationship was between father and son. Jon did not play the perfect father he played a real one, someone everyone can relate to. The interaction going on was of a man we can tell loves his son, and was trying his best. Very touching. As great as Jon did on this movie, I cannot forget to mention the other amazing actors like John Leguizamo, who is a brilliant supporting actor in anything he does and does a great job as the best friend in this flick. Most of the other stars in the movie seemed like over credited cameos, but having such well known stars as Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. play such small roles only put more depth to the characters. Oh, and Sofia Vergara, I need not say more. And a movie called Chef would be nothing if it did not have cooking. Watching Jon and his crew prepare the dishes was fun to look at. I wonder if Jon actually went into training like Downey Jr. did to beef up for Iron man or Johansson did to look like she can fight as the Black Widow? Adding to the culinary pleasure was the music score that gave a real south of the boarder flavor to it all. Overall, this is a must see movie. As much as I loved what he did for Iron Man, it was good to see Feavueu go back to how he started, and show us how much he has grown.",Chef
89,MovieHoliks,Get ready to laugh and salivate!,9,18 March 2015,"I can't believe I had never heard of this movie until it showed up on Netflix a month or two ago. Jon Favreau, who directed such big budgeters as ""Iron Man 1 and 2"", ""Zathura"", ""Elf"" and ""Cowboys and Aliens"" returns to basics with ""Chef"", in which he stars, and directs, as a disgraced chef at a high-scale restaurant who takes to the road in a food truck, sorta representative for Favreau himself, who goes from directing high-scale Hollywood productions to this smaller more-indie type film. What can I say, I LOVE LOVE LOVED this movie!! It's clever, funny, and has a feel that the whole thing was almost ad-libbed, which is brilliant. Favreau has recruited some heavy hitters to be in his movie, including John Leguizama, Sophia Vergara, Bobby Cannavale, Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt and ""Iron Man"" himself, Robert Downey, Jr even.

91,ArchonCinemaReviews,Feel good family film for foodies,8,21 September 2014,"Jon Favreau's Chef is a feel-good film for the foodies.Carl Casper is a creatively stifled Chef who suddenly quits his job at a successful LA restaurant after being attacked and ridiculed by a food critic and on social media. Bruised, broken, jobless and quickly heading toward a midlife crisis he travels to Florida as caretaker for his son with his ex wife. In Miami he gets a food truck and travels back to LA with his son and his sous chef/friend. The rest is a road trip of discovery and resolution.Only good things can be said of Chef, Jon Favreau's heart-filled independent and comedic film about personal revelation. Jon Favreau writes, directs, and stars in the movie and then enlists all his closest friends to join in the fun. The movie feels very special and close to Favreau's heart and is a positively connotative 'vanity project'.Chef is charming, appealing, delectable, refreshingly genuine and has a lot of soul. The chemistry between Favreau's Casper and his son, played by Emjay Anthony is realistic and endearing. John Leguizamo is the quintessential do-anything-for-you best friend. Chef is not trying to revolutionize the genre, it is just tries and succeeds as a delightfully gratifying movie.My only critique of the film is there are characters who seem important in the beginning of the film that just fade away by the final third act: Scarlett Johansson, Bobby Cannavale, and Dustin Hoffman. Admittedly, if Favreau had forced a resolution I would have been equally frustrated by the contrived happy ending. And while hilarious, I found Robert Downey Jr.'s cameo to be slightly distracting.Chef has a lot of heart and is a film of a dying breed – truly sincere. No cheap plot twists, no unnecessary drama – just a happy enjoyable film. Uniquely, it is also a film that the whole family can go see and have fun.Now excuse me, I'm grabbing the killer soundtrack and then I'm on my way to South Beach for a Cubano then heading to Texas for good ol' BBQ and then to New Orleans for dessert in the form of beignets. Yum! More recent reviews can be found in FULL at our website.",Chef

It popped up on Amazon Prime and had lots of good actors attached so I gave it a go - and I'm so glad I did.It's a genuinely sweet story about a father connecting with his son, about a man's infectious passion, about friendship and love. The result is such a feel good and uplifting experience which will be sure to bring a smile to your face.The characters and performances were all great. Jon Favreau was so good, with so much energy and brilliant comedic delivery. The script was very tight, with lots of genuinely funny comedy and well thought out relationships. It had a lovely plot with great character development and brilliant pacing.What I also think this film did so well was to convey the passion and dedication of our protagonist, chef Carl Casper. I'm not particularly a foodie and am by no means a chef, but none of that mattered in terms of my connection with the character. Watching somebody with a passion and a love of something is always entertaining and engaging, and this gave the film an infectious energy and buzz.Such a great surprise and a fantastically feel good experience. A movie that for sure deserves to be more well known.",Chef
93,bbewnylorac,Lovely film,8,17 May 2014,"The script, directing and acting of Chef are all very tight and entertaining. I did love this film. It's a simple but strong plot -- top chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) gets publicly humiliated on social media when LA's top food blogger, Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) gives him a scathing review. Unwisely, but hilariously, a hot-headed Casper publicly retaliates, ending his job at the restaurant and leading to him setting up a food truck in Miami with his 10 year old son and best friend helping out. Jon Favreau, while an unconventional leading man, is appealing and convincing as a chef for whom his work is everything. The supporting actors, from Dustin Hoffman as the restaurant owner, to Scarlett Johansson as Carl's friend and maitre d', John Leguizamo and Bobby Cannavale as fellow chefs and Robert Downey Junior as Carl's ex- wife's ex-husband, are all great. Emjay Anthony, as Carl's son Percy, deserves special mention as a child actor who comes across as very natural, and as obviously having a ball taking part in this movie. Even Oliver Platt as the food reviewer puts in a funny performance as the dweeb who has the power to ruin Carl's career. And to the writers' credit, he's not totally portrayed as the bad guy; he is just doing his job and other factors contributed to Carl's downfall. The only questionable note in the film was casting Sofia Vergara as Carl's ex-wife, Inez. Vergara is certainly gorgeous to look at, and she acts well as a loving mother to Percy and still affectionate friend to Carl. But in every scene she looks dazzling -- like she's just stepped out of a beauty parlour, perfectly made-up, dressed for an awards night and not a hair out of place. I felt it was just too much; it was like she belonged more in a Vogue photo shoot rather than in this quite down to earth film narrative. Only in a later scene does she pitch in on the food van and actually wear something realistic.",Chef
94,estreet-eva,"A movie about Twitter...oh, and food",5,19 May 2015,"Twitter is really cool. On Twitter you can advertise your gourmet food truck and draw extensive crowds. You can pick fights with food critics who lack the insight to critique your cooking favorable. And Twitter makes the whole process so simple even a child can use it effectively. This movie demonstrates how the communication service can be employed to grow your business.Oh, the movie is also about food and family to a degree as well. Jon Faveau, director, actor and all-around movie jack-of-all-trades, plays a divorced chef struggling to impress Oliver Pratt's on-line food critic and to build a bond with his son. Both of these story lines work out as you expect. Faveau's movie clot pulls some A- listers into this small film including Sofia Vegara as the hard-to- understand ex- wife. The cast doesn't have a ton to say given a limited script, in particular Robert Downey, jr. as the sleazy past ex-husband of Vegara's character. The always intriguing Amy Sedaris also makes a too brief appearance as Vegara's agent. Then again, the writers wouldn't have given her much to say had she hung around. In short, a light and mostly entertaining idyll with a feel-good story about a father and son bonding over cuban sandwiches and panini's.",Chef
95,willcundallreview,Do not eat before this!,6,28 October 2015,"Movies about food usually have some long shots of some person cooking some delicious meal, sounds galore of sizzling, bubbling and the whole works of the kitchen and of course they also have the person doing all the cooking. Chef is a movie that contains all my past statements and mixes them up into a film that works in some ways but also can fail at some others. The story see's Chef Carl Casper as he deals with a restaurant critic who isn't the nicest of guys, and we see Carl change not only the way in which he cooks his meals, but also how he moves on in the food industry and most importantly, how he treats his family.The story takes just a little time to get started and much like the state of the food van when Carl finds it, the movie really stutters into a nice end half. For me one thing this movie does that feels kind of annoying is the addition of cast like Dustin Hoffman and Scarlett Johansson who just feel like big name fillers for very ordinary roles in the movie. The movie really does get better as soon as Carl realises what he wants to do and does it, the movie transforms itself from a pretty average affair into a satisfactory one and weirdly also I felt gets funnier by the end.Jon Favreau plays Carl and I wasn't so keen on him, I'm not sure if it was his acting or that he didn't feel right for the role but something felt odd in that sense. I admit though that Favreau does like the actual movie transform, turns into a much more likable character by the ending scenes and that is helped by him realising some home truths. Carl's son Percy is played by Emjay Anthony and he is pretty good in the role, his mother is played by Sofia Vergara who like Favreau for parts of this can feel the wrong casting for the role, she is not bad but maybe I just needed to see more of her in the story to truly feel for her too. One cast member who injects life into the story is Robert Downey, Jr., could be seen as a big name filler but to be fair he is a funny character albeit not seen a lot though, maybe more of a guest appearance than a true role for Downey, Jr.Jon Favreau directs and writes this movie and gets it right for the most part, I think he manages to get enough shots of the food to make it the kind of movie where you just want to eat afterwards. He also gets the odd bit of humour out the script, not really that funny and one of the reasons I felt this wasn't great but still gets a few jokes squeezed out and makes the most humour wise of the talented cast at his disposal. I think this being in the mind of Favreau for a long time really makes this feel like his baby and his most honest work, I mean Favreau controls aspects of this movie that make it feel like he made this not for the box office returns, but that he made this because he just had to tell a story like this one day.I did feel at times this movie can feel a little too basic, you know like you can see what happens but actually it turns out not too predictable to make it too dull. If I had to try and recommend this to people then this is really one for those who enjoy a feel good vibe, the kind of movie that is happy but also can make you feel for Carl as he realises his inner most hopes and dreams. We see Carl's life before him and we then get to see what he makes of it when a big thing hits it, that I feel is why this movie for me is satisfactory and also a just about acceptable contribution to the food films out there.",Chef

The terrific Jon Favreau is the frustrated chef at an upscale restaurant; while being an absentee father to his young son, he's forced to churn out too-traditional food by conservative and unflinching boss Dustin Hoffman. Ex-wife Sophia Vergara finally convinces him to create his own destiny, and hooks up Favreau's character with her first ex-husband (played hilariously by Robert Downey Jr.), who gifts Favreau a shambles of a food truck.Favreau's character and his son journey cross-country in it, and that's where ""Chef"" takes flight, further cementing Favreau as a great hybrid actor-writer of any era. The always-charming Vergara is immensely so here, and both are supported by a cast improbably loaded with some of the greats of our generation delivering typically grand performances (in addition to Downey Jr., John Leguizamo and Scarlett Johansson also share screen time).Ultimately, ""Chef"" is a wonderfully entertaining film; an engrossing, endearing, and moving reminder to chase down our dreams and (re)focus on family.",Chef

Jon Favreau is charismatic as ever as he plays down on his luck Chef Carl Casper. It's nice to see him take time out from directing those mega budget blockbusters he's now famous for and doing something low key.
Not to say that 'Chef' isn't utterly entertaining.
This movie relies on great characters and good old storytelling. There's not a glimmer of CGI anywhere in this film.
All that delicious food is real and it's fantastic.
Favreau even drafts in his Marvel buddies Robert Downey Jr and Scarlet Johansson for support with also a rare appearance by Dustin Hoffman.
That said it's the relationship between Favreau and young Emjay Anthony as father and son that carries this movie.

99,diac228,Arguably the safest indie-flavored movie in years,6,15 July 2014,"I have seen this type of movie before: chef loses touch, chef needs drastic change, change is good, complication arises, everything works out in the end. Yep, I just about got it.Jon Favreau's Chef is the director's return to his indie, low-budget roots after branching to the Blockbuster Hollywood lifestyle. And almost parallel to his career path (In need of some calming), we see Chef as a stripped down back-to basics films that shows the age-old battle between art and business with minimal effects, minimal pizazz, and an overall minimalism approach that requires a strong script and strong performances to carry the movie through.And to an extent it works, but almost too well. Chef is not a lazy movie, it is instead a very harmless adult-oriented film that doesn't take any risks, doesn't push any boundaries, and remains comfortable within its borders. With the safe approach, you can predict where the movie is going and despite the mildly enjoyable ride you can't help but be underwhelmed by the lack of challenge of it all.What's worse is that you have a stellar cast with each not given enough material to truly excel. Come on now, a movie with the likes of Scarlett Johansson, Sofia Vergara, Robert Downey Jr., and John Leguizamo has to have some sort of spice. Instead each of them were handed limited roles that didn't allow for any of them to truly grow and have any standout moments. They were instead treated more like cameos in the life of a struggling chef (Jon Favreau acting and directing) trying to regain his footing after a rough month that culminated from a scathing review.Nothing about this movie fizzled to be honest, but nothing really stood out. It's similar to a breakfast of cereal and milk; no matter how good the cereal is, it's still just a breakfast consisting of cerealand milk. During the self-fulfillment trip there wasn't much of a rock bottom moment, there wasn't much of a challenge or a setback to return to prominence. Compared to the instant classic gem about a cook known as Ratatouille and even a milder fare involving a cook on the sentimental rocks like No Reservations, Chef doesn't stack many odds against our hero. Your investment to keep watching is the nice locales (Wish there was more Miami though), the nice food, and the great performance from youngster Emjay Anthony.Jon Favreau's rise to fame was his indie gem Swingers, which entered the pop culture lexicon as well as displayed Favreau as a good low-budget director and a good down-to-earth actor. Chef was his attempt to recapture his youngster roots. While he does step in the right direction, Chef lacks the bite that was prominent in his earliest works. But it's the right step forward. That being said, Chef will not stand out, but will entertain, and will keep you visually satisfied with the good food, good locations, and attractive people. This makes for a decent appetizer that can hopefully someday lead to a Swinger-like main course from Jon Favreau.",Chef
100,dansview,Accept it for What it Is,6,31 January 2015,"Favreau cleverly capitalized on the dominance of the Hispanic demographic, including Hollywood's Hispanic ""it girl"" Vergara, Leguizamo, Salsa music, and Cuban food.Simultaneously he threw into his secret sauce an acting hero from each generation...Hoffman, Downey, and Johansen. Then he paid homage to social media. There's a little something for everyone. Although none of that constitutes a good movie per say. But it almost guarantees to attract plenty of viewers. That's smart and he did it without blowing up anything or bombarding us with cynicism.Stop trying to analyze every aspect of the plot for believability. This is a lite comedy. The key is to evaluate a picture based on what it was meant to be, and whether it delivered the goods effectively.I stuck with it, because Favreau's character was likable at the end of the day, unlike Tony Soprano, another dominating big man with a passion for food. I felt that he was a legitimate underdog.I like that he didn't have a real love interest. Food was his love. Favreau could have added a few things to make it better. Tell us what his ex wife does for a living. Is she an actress? How did they meet in Miami originally? I need the back story. Tell us a little more about his fling with Johansen. What was the nature of and history of their relationship? Is Leguizamo's character Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban and why is he so loyal to his chef? Tell us more about that.Does the chef have parents or siblings? Show us some concern about his weight. It could be from his doctor or family. What will become of the food truck? I can buy his desire to return to a regular restaurant, but don't leave the truck hanging. That was awkward, after asking us to invest time and emotion into accepting the truck concept.",Chef
101,James_De_Bello,8/10,8,25 September 2014,"8/10 ""Chef"" is in no way a refreshing, original take on cinema or comedy, but boy is it entertaining. This movie is a very simple movie to review because other than knowing exactly what it is supposed to do and succeeding in it, the good and bad elements are very evident. Firstly a shout out to Jon Favreau for his very solid and safe direction, it isn't too stylish, yet it is instantly recognizable. From the first second you're in to the moment you exit the theater you will have a very wide smile on your face. Despite being somewhat surreal and having continuous minor shortcuts on the story the pure fun value and warm-heartiness of the movie manage to make you forget the problems it has and make you go through the experience without second thoughts. The acting is very solid, Emjay Anthony in particular actually does a great job and never results annoying and there is a cameo role midway through the movie that made me laugh out loud without interruption for a good three minutes. The food component of the movie is amazing, I cannot imagine someone coming out of this movie and not wanting to go out and try eating every single food shown. All in all this is a very good-hearted, fell good comedy that brings nothing new to the table and has its obvious story shortcomings, but gives you an amazing, fun time in the theater.",Chef

A man ""hits bottom"" and is forced to change his life for the better. It's very much a family movie with lots of soul searching, all enveloped in the concept of cooking. It's very different from what I'm used to, and the characters are certainly the ""special sauce"".A very well written and structured little story. The way it starts is masterfully done, and easily gets you interested. Sadly, I feel is a bit undercooked.. that or I was served the main plate without noticing early in the night. That is to say, it feels short and dips in places. But it's quality doesn't suffer. I am still very content with what I saw. Leaves you in a good place too.Stick 'til the end of the credits for a very short window into movie-making, and some character writing. I love that sort of thing!",Chef
103,MCMAYNERBERRY,"Frustratingly straightforward, simplistic and just plain unengaging",1,9 May 2014,"When a film doesn't have any form of engaging conflict, its difficult to like it. Chef is your straightforward, feel good, everything works out in the end project that reeks of passion project.Favreau stars as Carl, a chef who gets the boot from his lofty LA restaurant, and results in him purchasing a food truck to live his dream of cooking his own food his way.What makes this film so bland and forgettable is that it offers you nothing to view as conflict. If the film was about him getting fired, and opening a rival restaurant, there's a conflict. But here its more of a road trip film, where he travels across the US with his ex- wife, son and best friend.Chef boasts an impressive cast, most of which is underused or grow irrelevant. Favreau brought in the likes of Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Bobby Cannavale and Dustin Hoffman to fill supporting roles. You can't help but wonder why? Downey and Hoffman boast high grade talents that feel squandered here in their very minimal roles. Johansson's character was underdeveloped and I feel could easily be edited out. Films like this hit theatres every year, a feel good film that will make audiences swoon, but in repeated viewing will lose its allure. Chef is a knockout bore.Chef 3/10",Chef
104,vjnambu,Delicious entertainer,10,11 April 2019,"Chef is Jon favreau show all the way. He is the writer, producer, director and lead actor of this film. Its a story of a chef who after being frustrated when his boss doesn't give him a work freedom and having a verbal spat with a top food critic quits his job and buys a food truck which is given by his ex wife's ex husband. He travels all around with the truck,making sandwiches with the help of his co chef and son. His business starts flourishing and he improves his relationship with his son.
Jon favreau is perfect as chef. His body language and cooking is exactly like a professional chef. The son character is also good. But the icing of the cake is our favorite RDJ's cameo for whom you have to definitely watch this film. Also the various food shown waters your mouth. The last act where chef misses his son and calls him back is shown in a grounded manner without any cheesy melodrama. On the whole, chef is a delicious watch.",Chef
105,shawneofthedead,"Healthy, happy and hearty fare - if a little on the heavy-handed side.",7,8 June 2014,"Anyone familiar with Jon Favreau's work prior to Iron Man would know just how odd and brave it was for Marvel to entrust him with the film that would, ultimately, launch an entire Cinematic Universe. Pre-Tony Stark, Favreau largely lived in the realm of the quirky indie: dwelling on character rather than spectacle, finding humour within the everyday. So it's nice to see Favreau returning to his quirky indie roots with Chef, a sweet, intimate, if rather familiar film about a small band of people struggling to figure out just what they want to do with their lives.Favreau plays Carl Casper, a perfectionist chef whose career is effectively derailed when he throws a fit at celebrity food critic Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) for daring to give him a bad review. After his tantrum goes viral, Carl is forced to figure out what he wants to do next: keep cooking to order in someone else's restaurant, or start over, completely from scratch - whipping up the kind of food that will touch people's hearts.The real crux of the film, of course, is not so much Carl's professional choices as his personal ones. Along the way, Carl must re-connect with Percy (Emjay Anthony), the precocious son he's neglected as a result of his job, just as he must learn to accept the help of the people who still care about him - including his ex-wife Inez (Sofia Vergara) and his former kitchen helper Martin (John Leguizamo).What results is a pleasing, if somewhat formulaic, stew of character, comedy and cuisine. (The numerous montages of food being painstakingly prepared and served will have you hungry within the first half-hour.) Carl serves as an effective anchor for the film, though some of the emotional weight of his transition from respected chef to underground food truck guy doesn't quite come through. Nevertheless, his evident anger issues and personal doubts feed into the script's funnier and more dramatic moments, while his tender rapprochement with his son is so lovingly developed that it's easy to forgive its occasional dips into predictability and mawkishness.The top-notch cast adds greatly to the film's appeal. Favreau is a winning screen presence, keeping his character's irritability and rage just this side of sympathetic. Anthony is wonderful as Percy, a role that might grate in the hands of a more annoying young actor. Vergara (slightly miscast) and Leguizamo (cheeky and charming) lend able support, as do a host of A-list stars plucked out of Favreau's phonebook. Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr and Dustin Hoffman all pop up in small parts, helping or hindering Carl in his metaphorical and literal journey towards self-actualisation.There's a whiff of the self-indulgent to Favreau's passion project - one gets the sense at times that he couldn't bear to tighten or edit his final cut, which winds up clocking in at just under two hours long. But it proves easy to forgive Favreau his indulgences when the resulting film is, for the most part, so sunny and full of good will. Ultimately, Chef serves up its plot - simultaneously sweet and tart - with a generous helping of memorable characters and gentle comedy. It's a great reminder of what Favreau can do with perfectly ordinary people, trying to figure out how to get by in their perfectly ordinary world.",Chef

107,bix171,Sweet And Satisfying,9,7 November 2015,"Jon Favreau has written and directed a film that makes no bones about being a crowd-pleaser and the casual and loose feel sends its audience away feeling good in all the right ways. Favreau plays a chef whose run-in with his restaurant's owner and a food critic causes him to abandon his career; but it also allows him to reconnect with creative side and, just as important, his broken family, particularly his young son (a talented Emjay Anthony). There are some trenchant observations about social media and marketing but it really has more of a sweet side and it makes its mark in building affection for its well-intentioned characters; the emotions are heartfelt and sincere. Favreau is very likable and he builds a fine all-star supporting cast that includes Sofia Vergara, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt, Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson, Amy Sedaris and Robert Downey Jr. (and for us ""BBQ Pitmasters"" fans, a cameo by Aaron Franklin); everyone turns in fun, relaxed performances--they seem relieved to be in a film that has no hidden agenda and has goodwill in place of cynicism. Yes, it seems that with the exception of some profanity it could be a made-for-TV movie with the happiest of endings; and yes, the second half almost turns into a travelogue. But this time that's nothing to be ashamed of and it's gratifying to watch a film that in this day and age wants to do nothing more than entertain--which it does in a highly satisfying way. There's some really nice cinematography from Kramer Morgenthau and a very, very cool soundtrack. An emphatic recommendation.",Chef
108,Figgy66-915-598470,"A film of two halves, the second being much more fun",7,2 July 2014,"2 July 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Chef. Written, directed and starting Jon Favreau, this film charts the story of Carl Casper a once edgy and innovative chef who, divorced from his wife is entrenched in a very deep rut, working for a restaurant owner who will not give him free reign in the kitchen. After a particularly public showdown he quits his job and then finds he is pretty much unemployable and not being a very good Dad to his son Percy. With the help of his ex wife, and his ex wife's ex husband (yes try and sort that out in your head when you've had a pint of cider) he gets established in a food truck and he and his mate and his son set of a road trip of culinary discovery. This was very much a film of two halves. The first half was slow and somewhat uncomfortable as he lost control of his life but the second half was so much more fun.....after all who doesn't love a road trip......and boy some of that food looked sooooooo good. I wish the food truck phenomenon would take off over here!!!",Chef
109,yris2002,funny and tender comedy around food,7,19 August 2014,"""Chef"" represents an umpteenth attempt to reflect on food and its relationship with emotions. And it's a well conceived and successful attempt: food is the protagonist, we enjoy the colour of food, but we also manage to smell it and even feel like tasting it. And the rediscovery of the passion for food goes hand in hand with the protagonist's rediscovery of his creativity and the importance of family bonds, especially with his child. The emotional quality of the picture is enlivened by an involving Latin soundtrack, by lively moments of singing and dancing, which make it a celebration of the joy of living, despite difficulties. On the whole, the plot sounds very predictable and without any significant twist, but I think this is quite significant for a director like Jon Favreau, who abandoned the great Hollywood productions filled with spectacular effects, and in a way re-set his career by starting with a plain movie, just to please the viewer with real shots and real emotions. So it is possible to appreciate sincere moments of fun and tenderness, supported by a good cast, especially Favreau himself and the little actor interpreting his child.",Chef

When a blogger critiques his cooking as doubles and lacking creativity Carl decides to quit his job Snd ends up opening up a food truck named el jefe meaning boss and being able to be the chef he once was.

Also, the cooking scenes was attractive! It looked tasty and enjoyable! And the actors learnt the way to cook by the professional chef in the ending credit.About the review, when you get some severe commemtaries, it can be helped. Most of the writers wrote it without caring about the creators. Or rather, it sounds strange that they're aware of the creators.

114,robsta23,A Decent Feel-Good-er,6,17 March 2016,"Chef has a lot of potential for a great story. Instead, we are left with a story that, while making us feel good, lacks quality as well as a major conflict to bring the audience into the story and build interest. The movie is a good father-son story and has heart, but simply lacks something to intrigue us.The most exciting aspect of the film is the relationship between Favreau's character and his son. The relationship develops progressively throughout the film as it starts out with the two of them ""doing stuff"" together, but we learn what the kid really wants in a strange situation when Favreau asks his son to help him with Twitter. ""I wish we could do stuff like this more... spend time together, talk about things"" says Favreau's son. This gets Favreau's character thinking about how he can become more involved with his son, and leads to his decision to let his son help him when things go south.The first act of this film takes forever to get through though, making the film seem slow at first, yet not exactly uninteresting. We get hints that Favreau might leave his job as a prestigious chef in a quality restaurant early on, but it takes about 40 minutes into the film to finally see this happen so we can move onto the second act: how he will dig himself out of this situation and be able to support himself.Stories are built on conflict, and sadly there is no one big conflict in this film as much as there are a few smaller conflicts. These conflicts include questions such as will Favreau's character become closer with his son, will Favreau ever get his job back, and will he find happiness despite the situation. And rather than building up tension for these ""conflicts,"" they get resolved slowly but gradually throughout the film. This allows the audience to focus on the relationship at the heart of the story, but it is also somewhat boring to watch since the second act of this film does not hit us hard with huge conflicts. The pace to this movie is slow, but safe.The third act then is extremely rushed and takes roughly only a few minutes, and then the film is suddenly over right after the ""climax."" This is annoying if you're looking for a good story, but if you are looking to be pleased this film does just that, but in a cheesy manner. Chef is decent, but it is simply not up to par with other Favreau films like Iron Man or Elf.2.5/4.0",Chef

116,blakiepeterson,A Rare Example Of An Intelligent Feel-Good Movie,8,2 May 2015,"Chef is one of the few feel-good comedies of the year that doesn't make you feel guilty for loving it. Not once did I feel like a sap; not once did I feel like an overly emotional stay-at-home dad. The film is able to warm your heart in that three-hanky, too-good-to-be-true way, yes, but it's much too bright to be only cloying. Chef is passionate, agreeably witty, and, when the time is right, acidic. It has a sort of old- fashioned escapism that surrounds us with a spicy but sweet ambiance. Even the ""conflicts"" are a part of the charade, as they are tinged with the notion that all will end on a blissful note. It's rare that a blissful note can feel so true; most of the time, happy endings are merely a tired routine to turn crap into chocolate.Chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) has had the same job at a prominent Los Angeles restaurant for years; it has paid him well, given him somewhat of a grasp on creative control, and has made his childhood hopes and dreams become a reality. But now that he's in his 40s, Casper is beginning to doubt much of his work. He wants to spruce up the menu at the restaurant, but his boss (Dustin Hoffman) won't allow it. Things take a turn for the worse when a respected food critic (Oliver Platt) trashes his work in a scathing review.Casper decides to quit, but the slicing of ties ends with a very public meltdown that leaves him broke and laughed at by the population. He takes all the negative energy, however, and forges it into a risky idea. What if he opened a Cuban food cart? It's a serious step down from the luxuries of his previous job. But once business begins rolling again, he finds his life suddenly reinvigorated.Favreau has been writing, directing, and starring in his own movies for a decade now. Chef is a return to his everyday roots after massive projects like Iron Man or Elf. But even in his most upscale moments, Favreau has proved time and time again that he can balance heart and heftiness with ease; if you're going to touch our ever sensitive souls, you'll have to do so in a subtle, brainy way. Chef is possibly such a lovable film because Favreau bonds with us; we're never manipulated into shedding a metaphorical tear. The themes of family, work, and the dreaded mid-life crisis are all on display, but they are done in a way that leaves unwanted clichés behind. Much should be made for the soundtrack as well – wrapped with Latin fire, it reflects the excitement Casper feels as he reaches into his past and makes his early cooking days new again. It only adds to the film's bustling energy, heightening its quirky joys.When the film isn't making our mouth water with a never-ending array of tasty looking dishes, it's kicking those legendary endorphins in our brain. It's hard to find a movie that can be pleasantly diverting and self-aware; kudos to Favreau for taking a risk. It's a reinvention of underrated means, considering he could have easily taken the blockbuster route once again.Read more at petersonreviews.com",Chef

118,ivko,It will leave you hungry for more,8,18 December 2016,"Like a well designed dish, Chef is a deceptively complex blend of themes and ideas that blend harmoniously into a beautiful theatrical medley. Although I have never really had the resources to follow the gastronomical trends of the great chefs of our time, I have a close friend who became a CIA trained chef and who managed to instill a measure of respect for the field in me.Chefs are perhaps among the most approachable artists to us lay- people. Of course, there were times when I have been given dishes which required a palette more advanced than I was capable of appreciating, but the attractive aspect to food artistry is that even when we fail to notice nuance, all of us humans can enjoy a delicious dish and even a measure of the work that went into preparation.The mix of themes in this film range from the approachable and well known, such as the conflict between the demands of our family and personal lives and those of our professional careers and aspirations, to the more subtle balance of creativity, which tends to be chaotic and risk-taking, with conventional success, which tends to be, if not static and unchanging at least more staid and predictable since slowing down and presenting uniformity is often how a creation can best be appreciated by a large volume of individuals.Favreau plays a Miami chef once considered a rising star who settled into a creative rut. His food is good and his restaurant well regarded, but as he settled down in his personal life with a (now ex) wife and child at a local favorite eatery his dishes have become stagnant. The film begins when his world view is shattered by a poor review from a popular online food critic who somewhat painfully reminds the chef of all the compromises he has made.Although he desires to bring his creative vision to prominence again, his efforts are stymied by the restaurants owner (Hoffman) who prefers the predictable returns of the old menu that has been accepted by the local population, liking it to a music concert where the band plays their greatest hits instead of their ""new stuff"".Although the protagonist rejects this view to regain his passion for food, it's hard not to at least appreciate the point of view of the owner. Drawing a parallel to the film industry, the choice between letting a director make another franchise sequel or create a passion-project film will usually bend towards the sequel; the sequel is a ""safer"" investment with a broader, known audience. And while the passion project has the better opportunity to give you a 'The Godfather' or even a 'Star Wars', which people tend to forget was a passion project of Lucas' that was not expected to perform very well by the studio, it is also far more likely to produce a well-rated but ultimately forgettable film that few will remember a decade later.By using such a talented actor (Hoffman) to present the restaurateur's view, the film avoids the trap of demonizing the more conservative viewpoint, even if the protagonist ultimately rejects his former life in favor of the riskier foray into guerrilla-style food preparation with a truck.From this point on in the film it is often, as others have stated, food porn. The film does a decent job of translating the passion a food artist has for his art by basically showing us a lot of really amazing food while the characters talk about what goes into the preparation. It's both a good way to appreciate how much goes into good food as well as a great way to get inspiration for a couple of meals and maybe even a little traveling.The remainder of the film has few surprises; viewers will probably guess in broad strokes what happens over the remainder of the film. But since one of the major goals of the film seems to be to present to the viewer what this passion for food is all about, it doesn't really need to surprise the audience to fulfill its mission. Not that there aren't a few surprises by the end of the film, but mostly the journey is about showing the audience how and why the chef loves food and his efforts to pass that love along to the audience's proxy, his young son.I really enjoyed this film. Showing how an artist sees his craft while retaining that sense of wonder and love for the subject is not an easy thing to do. I would definitely recommend.",Chef

Clearly showing that doing what you want and being your own boss is the best thing ever, being told what to do and being a corporal slave working from 9am to 5pm is not healthy for anyone.Clearly Carl was happy with his old job too, because he just loved cooking so much, but when he got his own food truck and started his own business, he was really happy and managed to full-fill his dream, even more important that his business, was the good father-son relationship he established with his 9 year old son, who really missed his father, which resulted into his super hot ex-wife to marry him once again.What i was kind of disappointed about, was the fact that the movie had 3 very popular actors, namely, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr. and Dustin Hoffman, but all of them played a very insignificant role in the movie and didn't have much screen time :/ Nonetheless, the movie was good and uplifting - 8/10.

Because food looks very good in this movie. It's a good movie, not only because I have an interest in cooking. I do love food and always liked to cook thanks to my mum mainly. It's a great comedy with what everyone calls ""food-porn"" and very good music. Chef displays people who really know what they're doing in a kitchen. It has an awesome way to make you feel as if you were in the kitchen, showing you what it's like to go to different places on this food truck, to experience different cultures, different music and of course the food. Plus, characters seem so real. Jon Favreau did an incredible job at capturing characters, dialogues, situations and scenes that did not feel set up or fake. In fact, dialogue flaws as if you were watching a documentary. The relationship between Favreau's character and his son is very sweet and endearing. He also really surprised me as an actor, it's by far his best performance, he was simply great. John Laguizamo does a good job as a supporting character he ads a lot of comedy to the movie. Finally, people that Favreau brings from Iron Man movies were pretty good in their scenes as well. Overall Chef feels really good with awesome food that just make your mouth watering. Advice: go see it with a full stomach! Maybe the best film evolving around cooks that I've seen in a long time.",Chef

124,stevepat99,"10 If it was a 30 minute father-son, bonding, road trip film ...NOT!",3,15 July 2014,"I heard the hype, noted the IMDb ultra-high rating and expected a cool, indie, cinema moment. That never happened for me. Some have gone on and on about all the mouth watering 'foods.' Actually, aside from a sub-par wannabe gourmet meal served to food critic (Oliver Platt) there were sparse full screen gourmet mouth watering moments. Most of the film dealt with roadie 'sandwiches.' Yes, sandwiches... things slapped between two slices of bread and which you will never find in any gourmet restaurant kitchen.A word about Jon Favreau's acting and writing efforts. First, his lack luster performance was a 'fail.' His script eliminates chef's earlier passions for the craft replacing same with a sad acceptance of the fact this years long 'gig' stamps every and any opportunity to hone his craft with new and original creations. This script creates a virtual Chef's ground hog day where same old same old goes on and on.Early on Chef has an ugly restaurant table confrontation with food critic Platt. Never mind that, as some other astute reviews noted, his gripe was NOT with Platt whose 2-star review was correct. Chef's gripe was with his boss Dustin Hoffman who forbid chef from being creative and ordered chef to serve Platt the same old same old dishes he cooked for Platt like ten years ago. Then there were so many other glaring plot holes. Like the 'free' truck and the never disclosed source of the thousands needed to re-do the truck and furnish it with new cooking equipment.How does any renowned chef go from a major restaurant to a food truck? That leads to the dad/son bonding road trip. Son gets burned while illegally working, cooking, has his first 'beer' and the two have their moments.Most all cameos were unnecessary but did show how many 'friends' Favreau has in the industry.What do chef's live for? To cook! And let their creations touch others. As much as I love BBQ brisket.... no one has mentioned this plot hole. Chef stops at a famed Texas BBQ where the friend/owner provides him with four or so whole 13 hours smoked/cooked briskets which chef then sells off his truck. Has any restaurant chef with an ounce of pride ever out sourced his main entrée i.e. filet mignon to Ruth Chis's steak house? And here was a signature dish that 'another' BBQ chef has spent 13 hours cooking to perfection.Another plot hole no one has mentioned. Chef's Florida truck has a cool painted exterior with huge lettering that says EL JEFE CUBANOS. OK it's a great hit in Miami but why exactly does the truck attract huge crowds outside of Little Havana? Chef declares his son to be a gourmet chef junior...after teaching him to brush butter on the sandwiches and crisp them on a grill. But then again there was little else to do on a sandwich/grill truck.The finale was unreal. Food critic Platte chomps down one sandwich and declares Chef to be at the top of his gourmet chef game at which point he says, paraphrasing.... fantastic sandwich...how about I spend half a million and set you up in a restaurant? Remember, its been like ten years since Platt tasted any gourmet meal cooked by Chef.As a 30 minute road trip bonding movie...fine. As any sort of realistic film about the world or gourmet kitchens and cooking I found it to be a 'fail.'",Chef
125,lucasnochez,Film Review: Chef/www.nightfilmreviews.com,10,6 June 2014,"Chef is a film about a battle we all face to reconnect with our passions when the flame has burned out. Jon Favreau, a jack-of-all-trades in Hollywood who has hidden behind his passions for the last decade or so, has stuck to his guns on this one and delivered an indie film that not only delivers a tasty slice of one's person's struggle to keep their passion alive, but also shows the consequences when one follows their passion too closely. Carl Casper (Favreau) is a phenomenal chef but a lousy father to his son Percy (Emjay Anthony). Carl tries hard to entertain his son with artificial activities that he thinks would allow them to bond by taking him on roller coasters, to town fairs and the beach, while failing to realize that all Percy wants to do is just hang out with his dad. In an early scene, Carl and Percy connect over a homemade grilled cheese sandwich, discussing twitter, social media and the effects of the Internet on youth and an older generation of users. Percy smiles and the art of subtly is established. Chef could then best be described as the perfect grilled cheese sandwich; familiar and fattening, yet, when cooked right, its gooey, cheesy deliciousness and soft center always finds a place in your heart. Chef may be cheesy and formulaic at times, but at its core it's just plain comfort food that is perfect for the soul. Simply put, Chef is mm-mmm satisfying filmmaking in the shape of a surprisingly delicious film.It's not hard to see the comparison Favreau is making between his career in Hollywood and his love for independent filmmaking. There is no denying that Favreau is a modern-day pioneer when it comes to directors and writers with humble beginnings. Favreau, who started off his career scripting Swingers as well as writing/directing/producing his 2001 smash Made, has set a trend for Hollywood studios who snatch up promising young directors to spearhead big-budget blockbuster film franchises. After all, Favreau was the first director for Marvel to successfully launch the Marvel universe on the big screen and reignited good friend Robert Downey Jr.'s career after his stint in rehab. Favreau is undoubtedly a man of wonders and shows off his skills here behind the burner.With Chef, it is not hard to see that Favreau is a lover, not a fighter; a lover of culture; of beautiful women; of fine filmmaking and most of all, a lover of good food. Through Chef, Favreau serves up his signature dish: real-world comedy that doesn't sugarcoat what real- relationships actually look like.Carl Casper is surely a representation of everything Favreau has been feeling for a very long time. Lost and unhappy behind the scenes of a posh Venice Californian restaurant owned by the business oriented Riva (Dustin Hoffman), Carl is given a little hint of hope when he gets wind that the critic who helped launch his career from culinary obscurity in Miami is coming back to review him. Last time Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) and he met, Ramsey was a small time food critic, doing it for the love of food. This time, Ramsey, backed by AOL and nearly ten million followers, challenges Carl to cook something special. As he gets his kitchen staff ready, namely his sous-chef Tony (Bobby Cannavale), his line chef Martin (John Leguizamo) and his hostess and gorgeous Sommelier Molly (Scarlett Johansson), Carl begins to prepare a menu that will knock Ramsey's socks off. Despite his best efforts, the restaurant's owner Riva thwarts Carl's plans, forcing him to prepare the same, tired menu that he's been doing for a decade. As tempers flare and egos parade, the events of Ramsey's return find Carl without a job, forcing him to seek refuge in his ex-wife Inez (Sofia Vergara) and her eccentric ex-boyfriend Marvin (Robert Downey Jr.). On a surprise trip back to Miami, Carl allows the spice and sizzle of the Latin culture to take hold, and while enjoying a simple Cubano sandwich (basically a ham and cheese sandwich), Carl finds inspiration in owning a food truck.It's no surprise that Favreau, who has made excellent relations with A-list actors during his time in the big leagues, likes to surround himself with the best. Chef may not look like your typical independent film feature courtesy of the generic polished coating and a star-studded cast that would make the night sky jealous, but the film uses its high-profile cast to its advantage. From Dustin Hoffman, who plays a the perfect, grumpy restaurateur, to Scarlett Johansson, who captivates with subtle sounds during a seductively sexy food foreplay scene, to the mega superstar Robert Downey Jr., who in only mere minutes, finds a way to convince audiences that he is able to create a more outrageous character than Tony Stark, the film showcases the organic talent of a cast who have spent a little too much time in the bright Hollywood spotlight. Although the film is cluttered with talent, the true stars remain the three characters we stay the longest with; Favreau as Carl, his son Percy, and the always underrated John Leguizamo as Martin, Carl's trusty sidekick and best friend. Leguizamo delivers laughs and moments of true representation of a Hispanic culture in a predominantly Latino-centric United States of America. Leguizamo is nothing short of tasty comedic genius.",Chef

128,jmillerdp,Amiable Comedy-Drama,7,19 July 2014,"Favreau definitely does his best directing work here. His two ""Iron Man""s were bloated, rather boring effects fests that were also fairly soulless. Favreau shows that a movie like ""Chef"" is definitely where he should be.The movie is good, and is well made. The characters are well drawn and you get involved in them and their journeys. The movie does go on for a while though, and is pretty loosie goosie, pacing wise. I was expecting a tighter film. But, I'm guessing that Favreau pretty much got Director's Cut here, and got to include everything he wanted to include.Performances are good. The cinematography, while shot in widescreen (2.35:1), rarely uses the widescreen for anything. You have little sense of time and place along the way, as everything is shot in fairly close quarters. Even when they travel across the country, you don't get much of a feeling that they are. I am guessing that the production couldn't afford a Robert Richardson. But, they should have at least done more with what they had. The music is excellent, and features many inspired choices.All in all, an amiable comedy-drama that goes down easy.******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)",Chef
129,tex-42,Male Pattern Optimism,5,2 July 2014,"Chef is a movie that reeks of what former Washington Post writer Lisa DeMoraes called ""male pattern optimism."" Male pattern optimism is when in a TV show or movie, a mostly average looking actor ends up with a ridiculously good looking actress cast as his wife and/or girlfriend. In this case, you have Jon Favreau who gets to be with both Scarlett Johansson and Sofia Vergara over the course of the movie.The movie itself is nothing spectacular. Favreau plays a chef who is more concerned with his food than his son. A bad review, followed by a social media blunder of epic proportions leads to the chef losing his job. The chef's ex-wife then sets him up to be his own boss with a food truck, and he and his son bond over a road trip from Florida to California. The movie is slow at points, and somewhat contrived, but largely inoffensive. At times, you may feel as if you are watching an ad for a certain social media company.There are a lot of big names in the cast, but they are mostly wasted in cameos or roles where they are given little to do. This is not by any means a bad movie, it just suffers mostly from wasted potential and the feeling that it is going nowhere.",Chef

133,FilmMuscle,A Goodhearted True Crowdpleaser,10,14 June 2014,"Every now and then, it's quite pleasant to witness a genuinely sweet and charming film that's never stifled by obnoxiousness or cynicism. With Chef, Jon Favreau (the director, writer, and lead actor of the project) portrays a famous chef, named Carl Casper, whose creativity in his cooking is continually restrained by the restaurant owner who wants to stick to the same old formula because it seems to continue appeasing his customers. And after many years of the same menu offerings, the chef's frustration gradually intensifies due to diminishing control over his own food—an artist whose vision and imagination is being ""dumbed down"" and strangled by a reigning-over businessman. Sound familiar? Well, anyway, as can be expected with such a film, it seriously torments its viewers as you cravingly reach out for the utterly delicious food interminably exhibited on-screen—pasta, juicy meat, sandwiches with nicely melted cheese. It instantly pumps you up for a nice restaurant afterwards—""food porn"" at its best. As an effective addition, the movie also highlights a tremendous soundtrack, flooded with upbeat, lively Latino music that perfectly complements the paradisiacal and mouthwatering food that's showcased throughout. With all of these elements combined, the audience is treated to an unbelievably pleasurable and fun atmosphere. Honestly, every character in this picture shares impeccable chemistry with one another; the dynamic between Casper (Jon Favreau) and his son (played by a highly talented child actor, Emjay Anthony), as well as the one between Casper and his friend (who's played by the always-wonderful John Leguizamo), are truly the best attributes of this adventure. Surprisingly, Chef is definitely the best comedy I've seen so far this year—remarkably hilarious thanks to Jon Favreau's ranged performance (alternating between fueled rants, solemness, and humorous quips) and John Leguizamo's laid-back and lovable presence. On a side note, being the smart man that Favreau is, he made the clever decision to cast Sofia Vergara as his ex-wife and Scarlett Johansson as an on-and-off partner— not too shabby! Actually, Sofia Vergara depicts a far more calm and sweet individual here in comparison to her other (boisterous and loud- mouthed, obnoxious) roles. Now, I really want to get to one of the most significant components of this film. As you could see in my synopsis, the narrative quite conspicuously draws parallels with any artistic industry/medium. Frankly, I get the feeling that the heavily underwhelming critical and fan reception to Favreau's last two directorial productions, Iron Man 2 and Cowboys & Aliens, strongly inspired him to helm this project. Essentially, he went out to make this movie in order to vent his sheer frustration out at the (stereotypically) self-entitled and unappreciative critics that excoriated his last two films. You have the artist (the chef or the filmmaker/director) who desperately seeks to put his utmost passion and creativity into a precious project but is terribly constrained by the powers-that-be—the studio executive or the restaurant owner. Then, in comes the audience (the moviegoers or the restaurant's customers) who enjoy the usual, simplistically delightful offerings while the critics wish for something with a little more substance and artistry behind it. There are several scenes throughout the film where Favreau's character enters a complete tirade about how obnoxious critics can really be, and you could feel the fervent vexation on his face and within the authentic words that stream from the script and, of course, his mouth. Those are the kind of moments when you—the critic—somewhat lean or stand back for a moment, recognize the position you find yourself in as a reviewer, and feel bad as you start antagonizing yourself. With that being said, given the fact that I'm a storyteller at heart—having written my fair share of tales and on the path to produce films—these types of themes always resonate with me. I loved Inside Llewyn Davis' uncompromising commentary on this matter, and I love Chef's much more lighthearted and crowd-pleasing take on it as well. When it comes time to address particular flaws of the film, I actually couldn't find any. As a whole, Chef is just so enchanting that any minor weakness is immediately forgiven and forgotten, and all you remember after walking out from the theater is the ultimate experience of pure joy. (You also feel sadness because this rare piece of wild entertainment is over.) I hope this review does enough justice to exactly how much I enjoyed this marvelously endearing work. Anyone who's seeking to finally crack a smile, laugh, and notice the goodness still left in the world, Chef is ready to serve!",Chef
134,nikitalinivenko,By The Book - No Deviation,1,18 July 2019,"Ex-husband estranged from his son that he gradually grows close with - check. Quits unfulfilling bland job to be his own boss because his old boss doesn't like creativity for some reason - check (ironic how the movie about seeking personal creativity is as un-creative as they come). Critic apologizes in the end and gives Favreau his own restaurant, who also gets re-married to generic bombshell who's too hot for him (i.e. the most standard eye-rolling movie ending) - check. Over-reliance on social media references - check. The movie is so uninspired even the title sounds generic and store-bought and indistinguishable. Movies should be about showing you something you ain't seen before, not something I can literally get around the corner from my house. Jon Favreau is a hack. I can't stand John Leguizamo - I know that's unfair to take it out on the movie, but whenever he's in something it instantly knocks it down. Side note: this heavily reminds me of the Bob's Burger's episode ""Food Truckin'"" (I wonder if Favreau lifted the idea) which was a lot more fun and creative than this waste of a movie. At best, it's well shot, and there are some nice to look at food preparation montages, but that does little to redeem this flat uninspired standard pedestrian exercise, lost in the faceless shuffle with all the rest.",Chef

It's all about friendship, family, bonding and love throughout food. Not too healthy or good for your diet, but never the less tasty as hell. After so many successful blockbusters Jon Favreau went out, and did this low budget, yet star packed, sweet movie, that actually made me feel a little better in some weird way. There is nothing mean or really evil in this picture. It only gets better as the movie progress and I absolutely loved the ending. Each actor embraced his role to the perfection. The only thing that felt a bit unreal was how someone like Sofia Vergara would have married with someone like Jon Favreau in the first place, but still they manage to pull that off. I loved it. I will watch it again. This one simply elevates the mood.",Chef

Even with an injured knee, I found myself unable to refrain from some serious toe-tapping to the infectious beat of the music.

John Languizamo as Martin, Bobby Connavale as Tony made for these parts. Emjay Anthony as Percy is a little heart-stealer and Sofia Vergara as Inez will have every male in the audience drooling. Oliver Platt as Ramsey Michel the food critic could not be better and he is a favorite of mine to begin with. Even Robert Downey Jr., though showing up in a very small part, was well worth watching. This was a movie where everyone laughed and smiled though most of it and had that smile still plastered on their faces as they left. Can't improve on something like that.

137,bravesfanc,A hidden gem,8,1 February 2015,"This didn't get much publicity or mainstream press but under a recommendation from a friend I was happy to learn that this is movie many people should watch. It has an all star cast led by Favreau, the director himself.Some complaints I've read are about how they overuse twitter and social media, almost like they are advertising it. I disagree and believe that it was essential to the story. A chef receives a terrible review by the most acclaimed food critic in the country. The review blows up on twitter so with the help of his son, he creates his own account. When he responds to the critic via twitter, he thinks he has only privately messaged him when in reality the whole world can see what he wrote.The other part of the story is the relationship he has with his son and ex-wife. In my view, the underlying story is to pursue what you love. Don't let anyone tell you what to do, if you have a dream go and make it happen. As long as you're happy, life is good. With a solid cast and enough comedy to keep it lighthearted, I highly recommend this film.",Chef

The emphasis is on the comedy over the drama, and as like others have noted, there is minimal conflict in the film. The cast is first rate, as are most of the performances, and what is impressive is how natural and believable it all is. As I really enjoy outstanding child actors, Emjay Anthony ranks with the finest. As Jon Favreau's 10 year old son, he seemed so natural and comfortable in his role as to make viewers feel they are watching a reality show. I won't review the plot, as it has been well covered already. At the end of the film, after the credits, Arclight theater, where we saw it, played a 7 minute short on the making of the film, which was both entertaining and informative. If you want a tense, dramatic film about divorce and conflict, then this is not for you.

141,rjsf96,An Exquisite Dish,8,12 June 2014,"Chef is almost an unqualified success for writer, director and star of the film Jon Favreau. The key ingredient here is that it is almost an unqualified success (alas it falls slightly short of that status), but don't let the fact that it is not filmmaking that excels on every level, like Iron Man put you off. This is definitely a step forward in the right direction after his last two films as Director, but I digress.The film in its simplest form is more or less what you would expect to find. The chef by the name of Carl Casper (talk about literation) is played with emotion and depth by Jon Favreau who is having trouble in the restaurant that he works in with his boss, played with ruthless brutality by Dustin Hoffmann. He believes that Casper should abide by the rules that he puts in place. When Casper challenges his boss about the menu, this allows for further conflict in the films funniest moment.This involves a food critic who turns up to the restaurant (for the second time) only to find himself eating the same food, even though Casper promised him a new menu after his scandalising review. Casper turns up without permission and all hell breaks loose when he slates the critic for the whole public to see. At one point Favreau's character retorts to him ""you wouldn't know a good meal if it sat on your face"" over a social media site. It recalls the gut bustlingly funny laughs of last year's The Wolf of Wall Street. So the film gains extra credit for being funny and not trying too hard. The jokes actually work and don't feel as cold as the piece of hardware in which they were written in, unlike many comedies of the past decade.Eventually, Casper leaves the restaurant as he is unable to choose the food he wants to cook, a passion that he lets take hold of his life even when it comes at the expense of others around him. With his friend played by Leguizamo and his estranged son they set up a food truck and tour New Orleans among other places. The bonding between the characters is solid and it is easy to picture them as a team albeit one that can cause havoc and go off the rails.Yet, there are still many clichés that Favreau; try as he might, cannot manage to stop them from detracting from the experience. I have witnessed numerous films that executed some elements better than what is on display here. Like a father tied up in his work, whereby he never has enough time for his family and children, have been done aplenty and this doesn't resonate on the emotional level that I think Favreau thought it would. It is most importantly lacking in impact and at times seems rather pointless, only to add to Chef's two hour runtime which could have easily lost some fat.However, when the film does excel in finding the right beat and tempo; it shines brighter than ever before. This can be attributed in part to the charming cast and the witty (surprisingly funny) script; which is a terrific treat on its own terms. The cast manages to make it work, and this is what the film relies so heavily on that it is a godsend that Favreau doesn't let it go stale. I actually have to admit that Leguizamo actually possessed comedic talent; something I never thought I would say. He does not take himself too seriously which really helps lighten the atmosphere and also allows for jokes to come in left, right and center.For food lovers you will not be able to resist this film, it is surprising in the best way it can be, even if it does recycle elements from other films. My advice would be to not take it too seriously and you will enjoy Chef for what it is a delicious, fresh and enticing platter of all kinds of food that demands to be eaten with relish. Just don't go on an empty stomach, otherwise it will be groaning throughout.",Chef

This movie is at the edge of totally ridiculous and not in a positive way. The relation between the people are a joke. The characters flat, predictable and mostly unbelievable. The storyline equally so. The dialogues between father and son are shockingly terrible and miss any serious depth. And why the f*k do we need to know they put something on their b*s while driving? There are many more useless scenes like this.Whatever made Dustin Hoffman take such a ridiculous role is a big mystery, probably he didn't like it either because his few minutes of acting are the poorest of all the cast.

144,cattjones,Finger-licking Good,8,7 June 2014,"It was really refreshing to go to the movies just to see a good story. I consider myself to be a foodie, so I was excited about this film. The story centers around Chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) who is stuck at a restaurant where he is forced by his boss, Riva (Dustin Hoffman) to continue to make the same old dishes that he has always made and not try anything new. He winds up crying on the shoulders of his friend, Molly (Scarlet Johansson) who eventually gives him some excellent advice. Chef Carl is also in the process of trying to get his private life together with his ex-wife Inez (Sofia Vergara) and his son Percy (Emjay Anthony). There is a strained relationship between father and son because Chef Carl is so wrapped up in his career that he has neglected the one person that should be at the top of his list, his son. This kid is so adorable and it also turns out that he is a social networking genius. All the kid wants is to spend a little time with his dad. Chef Carl has a best friend named Martin (John Leguizamo) who truly epitomizes the meaning of friend. Everyone should have a friend that is as loyal and supportive as this guy. Now about the food; the food in this film had my mouth watering every time something new was prepared. Even something as simple as a grilled cheese sandwich looked very inviting. I am going to start making my grilled cheese exactly the way Chef Carl made his in the film. He also made a pasta dish for his friend Molly and I was mentally trying to remember the ingredients so that I can prepare it myself. When Molly took a bite of that pasta, I took that bite with her. Her reaction was exactly what I expected. It did not seem like she was acting; it genuinely felt like she was enjoying the food. I think that Jon Favreau did a fantastic job writing, directing, producing and playing the lead role in this film. He even found a bit part for his old friend Robert Downey Jr. (Marvin) who played the role of Inez's first ex-husband. The ending of the film was kind of predictable, but I still had a great time watching it all play out. If you get a chance, you should check this one out.",Chef
145,ahegde3149,Wish the story was as scrumptious as the food,5,14 February 2015,"I did not know what to expect from Chef considering Jon Favreau previous work being the blockbuster superhero Iron Man franchise. Here the glamorous talents of Scarlett Johanson and Robert Downey Jr. (from the same Iron Man series) are shockingly wasted with poor dialogues and unimaginative writing. Still Jon somehow carries the film on his own shoulders making me consider it as commendable effort.Favreau stars as Carl Casper,a very talented chef who does not get to prepare his golden menu because of his restrictive restaurant manager who believes people wont buy his 'artsy' food. Things get worse when a food critic bashes the food Jon is forced to serve, which results in face-off where Carl loses his temper.That goes viral on the internet and the chef loses his reputation and his job. He then decides to get back to basics by opening a food truck so that he is able to serve good food for the people. Sofia Vergara has a considerably smaller role as Carl's ex-wife and their son Percy (Emjay Anthony) feels that his dad is too busy with his cooking to spend some quality time with him. As we the film progresses we get to the familiar father-son getting closer story line.The ending was surprisingly bland apart from being predictable. At almost 2 hours Chef fills a bit too over stretched with its feel- good vibes and aromatic cooking scenes. While the dad-chemistry gets a good amount of focus and the duo is likable but the same cannot be said about any other character. The story follows a predictable arc and the dialogues are nothing great. The silver-lining here is without any doubt is the food-porn show where the scrumptious shots of variety of food preparations to beautiful background score are irresistible. Whenever those mouth-watering scenes turned up I was excited while rest of the time I didn't care much.RATING: [2.5/5]",Chef
146,The_moan_of_all_moans,Do not watch with an empty stomach.,5,2 July 2014,"I would like to start by elaborating on my summary. You really don't want to enter the screening hungry, it would be a very bad idea. I, stupidly and naively did this and was left feeling sad. The food just looks soooooooo good. Advertisements where proclaiming ""Chef"" was the equivalent of ""Food Porn"" and it's easy to see why. I remember sighing and sulking at points in the film, due to good old envy. And i honestly swear i heard some moans from others....Now, although (the amazing food included) there are some good parts to this film, it unfortunately comes across very chaotic. There are far too many scenes where people are talking, shouting, screaming over each other. Never mind the fact that that is incredibly rude, it also happens to be very annoying. It is constant and leaves a sour taste throughout the film. John Favreau is a decent actor and he does a good job as a leading man; nothing special, but decent. I really don't know what else to say about the film. I suppose it is a ""feel good"" film, but not if you're hungry it's not. In conclusion it is basically Man vs Food, with a story and projected on the big screen.",Chef
147,robinski34,Dish of the Day,9,5 July 2014,"Jon Favreau's film Chef is a simple joy - confirming that less is usually more effective and that it is okay to make a film that leaves the audience smiling, laughing and tapping its feet. However, arguably, Chef is deeper than first glance suggests. It touches on very modern themes of the power of social media (constructive and destructive) and the impact that glib online criticism (positive and negative) can have on real lives, and it's to Favreau's great credit that he does not gloss over these things. The film's use of Tw***er is ingenious and effective, if somewhat similar to at least one previous treatment of texting (the BBC's extraordinary Sherlock), but it is not a throw-away gimmick, rather an important part of the story, showing that - like a loaded gun - social media's power derives from the will of the user.Chef has a highly likable cast in great form. Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson and Fav's Iron Man mucker Robert Downey Jr. provide very effective cameos. RDJ is his quirky self, and Johansson is at her most charming, while Hoffman's superbly forceful turn ensures that it's not all sweetness and light, as do chef's scenes with Oliver Platt's restaurant critic. Sofia Vergara, Bobby Cannavale and the excellent John Leguizamo provide enthusiastic and likable support, but it is Favreau and Emjay Anthony's delightful central relationship that is the beating heart of the film, their scenes are so wonderfully natural that you can only root for them both.The film features something of a flying foodie travelogue through the southern states, but it is much more than that. Favreau's direction feels light and empathetic, a man confident in knowing exactly what he wanted, and Chef is clearly a film made with great care and affection. The soundtrack is superb, infusing the film with a rhythm that makes it difficult not to be swept along, but why would anyone not want to be carried away by Favreau's wonderful film, which tells us it is okay to take pleasure in what we do, feel the rhythm and love life.",Chef
148,jk-692-236394,"Happy, Uplifting, Feel Good Movie",9,8 August 2014,"I did not expect such a talented cast of actors mostly in small parts. Jon Favearu has a lot of friends. The actor who played his son is a find. He was great. Low key, sweet and very natural and believable. The story is good. It is about the chef and then the food truck, but it really is about him and his son. I liked that he was friends with his ex wife, Sofia Vergara, who did a great job. That struck home for me, because my ex and I get along well and it brought a lump to my throat to see how happy that made their son. It is special when divorced parents can get along and do things with their kids. The story moved quickly and I loved how the son used twitter and they incorporated social media into the story. Very realistic. I highly recommend this movie. Really a joy to watch.",Chef

The smattering of stars all had cameos and were on screen for only minutes and even they couldn't save this stinker. I wanted to switch off after ten minutes but persisted because of all the good reviews which leads me to think that the good reviews were written by family and friends of the writer, director and backers.All connected with this mess should feel ashamed and will most likely omit it from their CV's.I WANT MY TWO HOURS BACK !",Chef
151,texshelters,Chef: Undercooked with the Wrong Ingredients,4,15 June 2014,"Chef: Undercooked with the Wrong Ingredients""Chef"" is a Hollywood version of a chef suffering the indignities of cooking what an owner, not the chef, wants him to cook. In a time of high unemployment, whether the government wants to admit the real numbers or not, the idea of a man quitting a chef's position over a menu without having a back up plan lacks credulity. And that is not the only thing the film lacks. The major plot point in act one that propels the action is not realistic. So many other solutions to the chef's conflict would have been more realistic and at least as entertaining as what transpires in the movie. The chef is unlikable, and director and producer Jon Favreau lays to bare his lack of acting ability in the film. I don't mind unlikable characters, but they have to be interesting. Moreover, it helps if we understand his motivations. Just saying ""I love cooking"" over and over is not enough. It's one thing for a character to say they love something, like cooking, but what an audience needs to do is see why a character loves what they do. We get little back-story to the chef's development, and thus, we just don't care. Well, some over the shooting of his father, whom he clearly loves. His face tightens, his arms clinch, his brow lowers. We see no such emotional reaction to the chef's love of cooking. Sure, we see chef-like cutting and food presentation, but that's all. As my mother pointed out, the chef claims that he yearns to be creative and ends up making well something all kids, parents and college students have mastered. Really? That's his breakthrough?Favreau has directed many of the other actors in the a-list cast including Robert Downey, Jr. and Scarlett Johansson. Downey does the best with the material he is given, but is not enough to make up for the Swiss cheese plot. The other actors are okay, but the real standout is actor Emjay Anthony as the son of Favreau and Sofia Vergara. She is once again playing the wife of another, far less conventionally attractive, white guy. Is this Latina type casting? At least I could imagine Vergara with Downey who is at times charming. The upside of the film is that it didn't pull out any last minute disaster: heart attack, car wreck, pregnancy as a plot point. However, not utilizing an out of place plot point does not a good film make. Rating: Rent it if you like food movies. Otherwise, watch Tampopo, Babette's Feast, Delicatessen or other, better food movies that have more heart and craft on their menu. Bonus: The music from the film is excellent. Peace,Tex Shelters",Chef
152,albrechtcm,Some pretty good cookin',8,8 November 2014,"I'm appalled that this film garnered so many negative reviews. Okay, the script wasn't that outstanding, and it was pretty far-fetched to boot, but the interaction between the characters and situations had me laughing and feeling for them most of the way. I spent many years in the kitchen, and of course, had to see this based on its title alone. I don't know how much time Mr. Favreau spends in the kitchen at home, but what I saw on the screen was a real pro. I was pleased to see him operate the way a chef should operate in a kitchen. He was fast, efficient and he knew what he was doing and he knew exactly where everything was without fumbling around. As For those who criticized the chef for touching food with his bare hands and tasting, they haven't been in very many real kitchens. Even in the finest French stainless steel kitchens, cooks routinely handle food with their bare hands and they of course have to taste to make sure their creations are on the mark. That doesn't at all mean they aren't clean or don't understand hygiene. Almost all are very careful about that or we'd all be sick. I'm not sure whether the close ups of hands chopping etc. were by someone else, but that someone knew what he was doing. I always get a kick out of Mr. Leguizamo. I don't know how he does it! He always delivers a memorable performance. One shaky moment came when the chef bought a 6"" chef's knife, but when I realized it was for his little boy, I understood. Personally, I don't have any fancy knives from Germany, France or Japan. I still use my good old 10"" Made in USA Dexter that has served me faithfully for nearly fifty years and it's still as good as the day I bought it. This film is flawed, but what film isn't? When it opens, the chef is preparing something special for the arrival of a famous critic (brilliantly played as always, by Oliver Platt), but at the last minute the owner, Dustin Hoffman, comes in and asks to be reassured that the critic will be served the regular menu. We are given no reason to suspect that the owner should feel the need to ask, or that the chef would deviate from the regular menu, and even he did plan to make a change, there was no reason for him to say a thing. All he had to do was tell the boss not to worry. Everything would be perfect, thus sending Mr. Hoffman off with a happy contented smile. However, the chef had to throw in the catalyst: He had planned a special off-the-grid menu for this critic. Big problem for the boss, and without it there would be no movie. Robert Downey's appearance was brief, but memorable and overall I enjoyed this film very much. All the others did a great job. Ms. Johansson's appearance was negligible and any cute actress could have handled it with little preparation. Bobby Cannavale was right on point and I believed him. As far as I'm concerned, a movie may try to make a statement, further a cause or influence public opinion (which they sometimes do without intending to do so. Remember Clark Gable's no-undershirt scene, Flashdance's leggin's, etc), but above all, job one is to provide entertainment. If a film fails to entertain, it fails. I thought ""Chef"" was quite entertaining with quirky characters, interesting yet fairly believable situations, and a happy, if absolutely inevitable but totally unbelievable ending. I really enjoyed it. Overall: Four forks!",Chef
153,MovieGuyFunTime,Big Heart and LOTs of FOOD!,9,14 February 2021,"This film not only tells a great story about career, family and how life can take unexpected directions.. It also is a visual feast for the eyes with all the incredible cooking scenes of very elaborate to very basic dishes. Can't tell you how many times I had to pause the film and go make a fancy snack!The movie is ultimately a very positive and heart-warming tale of a chef who is so *consumed* :) with his work that he has ignored his family which has lead to divorce (although civil). He finds that even in his relative freedom from family obligations, he still cannot satisfy those he wishes to impress the most with his cooking.The pressure gets to him and finally he breaks and has to reevaluate his life and make some changes. From that point on the movie really shines in his ""starting over from scratch"" situation with refocusing on, and accepting help family and friends.It is also a great story about reconciliation and letting go of resentment and how technology can be a painful double-edged sword if not wielded correctly.Great film. Great cast and LOTs of great FOOD!",Chef
154,sohansurag,Deliciously Funny!,7,15 September 2014,"I made the severe crime of watching this movie on an empty stomach. I should have known, after all the movie was basically food porn. Anyways back to business, Chef is a delicious comedy out this season and without much ado, I'd like to say that Chef is a great watch and anybody who loves food will definitely love this movie as well.Chef is Jon Favreau's latest and he's directing, producing, acting and making loads of food. It an adult comedy that is both fun and deliciously tempting. I know I cant help myself talk without food but it is so. This ain't a laugh out loud comedy and instead of bouts of heavy laughter here and there, it promises more subtle chuckles adding up to make it more memorable. Jon Favreau plays Carl Casper, an egoistic chef who gets fired from the restaurant he works for, he sets about with his son and his colleague on a road trip to find what he was really meant to do. It's a roadtrip movie, its a family drama and has some good father son bonding. The way he slices, dices and seasons, its just so tempting. As soon as the movie was over I headed over to the nearest restaurant with a boatload of drool in my mouth.Jon Favreau is obviously a skilled director having scribed the brilliant indie flick, Swingers and then moved onto shape the the Marvel universe with Iron Man that shot him to the top among all the AAA directors. But then Iron Man 2 happened which wasn't all that bad but still lacked something very integral, followed by the piteous Cowboys Vs Aliens, the less said about it, the better. With Chef, he's back to his indie roots and packs that essential Favreau tone. Social networking plays a major role Chef and it stands to be a good marketing lesson as well.Chef's also got a terrific cast which screams for an applause. As for Favreau himself, this is by far his best performance. Up until now we have seen his short goofy roles in the movies he's played in and for the first time hes in a legitimately good role having layers of different nuances in his character. John Leguizamo was pleasant and was a good supporting actor who the landed the role of Carl's friend and colleague. All the characters are lovable, especially the kid who played Carl's son. Sofia Vergara isn't the usual self that we are all familiar in Modern Family, she is more poised and refined here. Throughout the movies he's made, Favreau has made loads of friends and most of those friends makes a cameo in Chef. From the oh-so-gorgeous Scarlett Johansson to Iron Man himself.Chef isn't without its flaws though. Its an R Rated comedy with loads of abuses spewed, so even if it handles a family drama and father- son story well its not recommended for viewing with a younger audience. And it does get a tad bit boring when there ain't no cooking happening on screen. Its also long and could have used a good amount of editing. But count these out, you've got a well made entertaining movie.Chef marks Favreau's departure from comicbook movies and poorly made action flicks and back to good indies which makes for a great feel good comedy with loads of loads food. Believe me its gonna make you drool watching all the delicious food being made, so Don't make the same mistake that I'd made. This particularly stands out like the gem among the mediocre big budget flicks thrown at you this season.",Chef
155,sujanfaster,Smells Good Indeed,7,9 September 2014,"Well, Jon Favreau has his way. We can see this movie is very close to his heart. Wikipidea says he wrote the script in 2 weeks. However this is a simple movie and one doesn't have to worry much about the story. Especially if you are a lover of Food shows on TV, this movie is a treat to watch. The screenplay is a bit wayward moving from one scene to another without much connection. But that doesn't hamper this movie as it doesn't have any build ups.The story is about a creative celeb Chef who struggles with his boss as he doesn't give him the freedom of preparing his menu on the day when he's being reviewed by a top reviewer. The review doesn't go his way and the chef loses it. Afterwards it shows how the chef uses social media(or should I say twitter) to his advantage which was the initial cause for his fall. There is the usual subplot such as divorce and bonding with the son. Favreau should have trimmed down the first half of the screenplay and added more into the second part which is how the Chef comes back by starting his own truck. However this movie shows the journey is more important than the destination. So we are not complaining.I think this is the first time I have seem Favreau in a lead role. He's not bad. John Leguizamo in a very energetic role is very impressive. The cameos of Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johansson are okay. Sofia Vergara is pretty funny with her accent as always. The kid Emjay Anthony fits into the role nicely.Overall this is a nicely cooked up meal. But don't watch expecting a fancy cuisine.",Chef

157,stephenlovelette,"A hilarious slice of life, but don't you dare pardon the pun.",8,5 August 2014,"I don't know if it's always been this way, but the phrase 'date movie' is a surprisingly bad omen.It's synonymous with bad comedy and cheesy romancing.The idea that a sequel to Valentine's Day got producedAnyway.Last year's The Spectacular Now is a great example of what a 'date movie' should be.So is this year's Chef.It's a heartwarming story about a talented L.A. foodsmith finding his niche. In part a road-trip buddy comedy, Chef explores father-son relationships and the struggle to maintain balance.'Slice of life' is what you might call it.Jon Favreau is lights-out. That dude's a boss.He writes, directs and stars in Chef. Favreau directed Elf; he has a cameo in The Wolf of Wall Street, and plays a great supporting character in Iron Man 3. You may be surprised to find out he's also Danny Bateman, the overzealous linebacker from The Replacements.He's also into comics and a big supporter of the Marvel franchise. (Yes, I can easily forgive him for Iron Man 2.)Plus the off-type roles he wrote for Scarlett Johansson and Sofia Vergara in Chef are very strong. The whole movie's well written. It's not a comedy in the traditional sense, even though most websites categorize it such.If we're to get technical, Chef meets the prerequisite minimum of hilarious dick jokes. So in a scholarly sense it's a comedy.Perhaps 'realistic fiction' is the right name for it. I still prefer 'slice of life.'It tells a real story about a hardworking, driven middle-aged man who's reached a seemingly insurmountable crisis. The interactions between Favreau and Dustin Hoffman are believable and compelling.The viewer quickly forgets they're watching the Hoffster, and can empathize with both sides of the conflict.Between Scar Jo, Sofia, Dusty and all the rest, the supporting cast is phenomenal.One final actor worthy of mention is John Leguizamo. He's always great, and doesn't disappoint here.A common criticism is the initial half is far more compelling than the later. But I couldn't disagree more.It's between six to eleven minutes too long but that's the film as a whole; there is no greater or lesser half.Chef also dives into social media and creatively incorporates animation to illustrate 'tweeting.'There's no 'stinger' after the end-credits but if you wait until halfway through, there's a short clip of Favreau learning to make grilled cheese from a professional. It's not mind-bending, but it's fun and worth the three minutes.Chef's not a blockbuster but it's hilarious, heartwarming fun if you're seeking a flick in-theaters.I saw it for six bucks, which is a steal nowadays.So don't leave it on the backburner any longer.Chef's packed with laughs and just the right amount of sentimentality.It's a realistic date slice comedy of fictional life movie.With a dusting of romance.",Chef
158,byrann_gowan,A Recipe for Success,8,18 August 2018,"When you think of great directors, you think of Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, Christopher Nolan, Stanley Kubrick, etc. While he may not be at the heights that those guys are at, if Jon Favreau keeps going the way he is, he will be a legend soon enough.The best directors can direct just about any genre. Favreau has directed action movies (the first two Iron Man movies), adventure movies (Zathura, The Jungle Book), comedies (Elf) and dramas (Chef) - all of which were resounding critical successes. What makes this one interesting is that, while he is usually in most of his films, he usually plays supporting characters, but here he is, front and center, and he does a great job carrying the film. He is also supported by a wonderful supporting cast: Sofia Vergara and John Leguizamo are their charming selves; Oliver Platt plays an interesting food critic. Also good to see Dustin Hoffman and RDJ; even if their scenes are limited, they make the most out of them. However, the star who stole the show was Emjay Anthony as Favreau's son.The only problems that I felt the movie had was with two characters: those played by Scarlett Johansson and Bobby Cannavale. While I felt that both actors did the best they could with the parts they were given, I felt that their characters were severely underdeveloped. Once the plot of the film gets moving, you don't hear anything else from them, and I felt that these were two characters that we could've gotten to know more of.Nevertheless, this is a great movie and I definitely recommend watching it! Favreau has done it again!",Chef
159,resireg,"As a professional cook, this movie ashames me",1,11 September 2021,"So far I watched maybe a half of the movie, and so far, it hurts how much they distort the reality of the kitchen.First of all, the owner says he owned the restaurant for many years, but I see no stains, tears, imperfections on the equipment. I went to culinary school, worked in fancy places, and I know no restaurant will have 100% brand new gear always.Their uniforms remain clean during the entire shift. In any restaurant, food spille on your apron and jacket.The head chef is not wearing a hat, that means his hair can and will fall on the food.An overweight middle aged guy with a young, rich and pretty ex wife? Pretty mistress too? The rule number one of kitchen staff is that they hire the scumbags to work in the kitchen, fat, poor, handicapped people that the labor market rejected. The servers date mostly the customers, not the back of the house staff.My chefs had always immigrant wives, mostly from working class, because any other woman would consider kitchen staff below them. I know because I see it every day. Most of my coworkers are incapable of getting a date, except the foreigners, who have wifes.Restaurants have music. There is a scene where a discussion happens and everybody stoos to hear. In a real restaurant, only the tables beside would be abke to hear it, besides, it is rude to eavesdrop conversations, so the entire restaurant would not stop to a scene that happens all the time.The main character lives in a studio apartment fully equipped with a flat top, professional kitchen. That doesn't happpen in real life, if you you fry stuff, the smell and grease will get stuck in your bed, sofa, everywhere.Restaurants do not rely on farmers markets. They have suppliers, trucks who deliver all those ingredients. Kitchens never have so much space. The clutter should be everywhere.The servers are not supposed to eat for free. They pay for a staff meal. Even chefs are not gourmet eaters. They cook fancy stuff to make a living. In their spare time they go to KFC and McDonalds, because food is a necessity of life. People who go to restaurants have friends and money, something chefs and cooks lack.In short the movie creates a false impression that kitchens are chaotic places with lots of shouting and drama. They are not. We are mostly professionals who perform our jobs in silence. We can read the bills alright, and when we talk, we say please and thanks, because we are so mistreated by society that we normally stick together and are nice and repectful to each other.",Chef
160,john32935,Drama without conflict = DULL,4,20 January 2015,"As a wanna-be foodie and avid watcher of everything Food Network, I was anxiously anticipating Chef. Sadly, I was very, very disappointed.The cast includes Jon Favreau (who also wrote and directed), Sofia Vergara, Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey, Jr., and Oliver Platt. A very talented and likable all-star cast indeed. Unfortunately, most of them are not asked to do anything worthy of their skill.The story centers on Mr. Favreau who was an up-and-coming chef in the LA world of pretty people and pretty food. The chef blows his cool (captured via cellphoneshow new) when a critic remarks that the food served is well below his expectations. Frustrated that the restaurant owner will not let him change the menu and practice his creativity, Chef follows ex-wife (as one of the most civilized post-divorce couples ever filmed) and son to Miami where he decides to return to his roots and re-invent himself as a food truck owner. The instant success of the enterprise and the almost bumpless reconciliation with his young son as they drive back to LA are beyond anyone's concept of the real world.But I can tolerate a Hollywood spin to make a happy ending. I just could not buy that this supposed chef decides that happiness and success can be found by making a basic Cuban sandwich. Nothing unique or creative in his preparation that would lead anyone to believe in his satisfaction of this creative freedom or the instant lines of customers created by some simple tweets from his son. Also it is hard to believe that anyone today is as unfamiliar with social networking as Mr. Favreau plays it.But the biggest disappointment for me, the wanna-be foodie, is that the time the movie spends in the kitchen showing the trials and tribulations of a chef is extremely limited. Rather than highlighting the world behind the kitchen walls, the career of the main character could have been anything from a frustrated salesman to a frustrated lawyer, just so long as he was frustrated by his current job. And so I left the movie frustrated too.",Chef

The main characters (especially the young son) were great. The food scenes just made you want to go out and find something fabulous to eat as soon as you left the movie theatre (I was feeling downright deprived eating my popcorn). The only real negatives were Dustin Hoffman who has a very caricatured role and Robert Downey Junior, whose scene was downright ridiculous. He over-acted it to the max, and was completely unnecessary for the plot. Clearly both were in the movie because they're mates of Jon Favreau, their roles were lousy and so was their acting. Also the scungy old food van cleans up a treat - and a fair bit of suspended disbelief is required for how well it ends up looking (brand new) after some elbow grease and a paint job.This is a light, entertaining movie and an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a bit.",Chef
164,j-madej,A heartwarming story of redemption and second chance that most viewers should enjoy.,8,21 September 2014,"Everyone loves an underdog. Often stories of struggle of an individual on the screen, going through turbulent moment in their life, makes us revisit moments when our life was in chaos. We want the main character to succeed and rebuild whatever they've lost. Actor/writer/director/producer Jon Favreau has impressed me long time ago with the versatility of his skills being one man band, so to speak. He has proved in the past with movies like ""Cowboys & Aliens"" and ""Iron Man"" that he can direct big action flicks with a great box office success. But can he make a character driven comedy or dramedie to be exact? Combo of comedy with a little bit of drama. The answer is definite yes! ""Chef Carl Casper suddenly quits his job at a prominent Los Angeles restaurant after refusing to compromise his creative integrity for its controlling owner, he is left to figure out what's next. Finding himself in Miami, he teams up with his ex-wife, his friend and his son to launch a food truck. Taking to the road, Chef Carl goes back to his roots to reignite his passion for the kitchen -- and zest for life and love.""Judging from the trailer I wasn't sure about seeing this film. I enjoy food as much as the next guy, but the concept itself did not appeal to me at first glance. However there is something very endearing about this story and matter of fact engaging as well. After tiff with the restaurant owner (Dustin Hoffman) as well as renown food critic (Oliver Platt) who destroys his reputation Chef Carl (Jon Favreau) decides to start from square one by getting a food truck that in a way reignites his passion for food he always wanted to make and transitions into being his own boss. However in this straight forward premise hides actual deeper story of the relationship between father and a son. Women develop relationships by talking, men bond by doing something manually together. Working on a car, building a house, or fixing something together gives father and son bigger opportunity to get to know one another and subsequently get emotionally closer. This is an underline message of the movie that translates into enjoyable joyride of a movie. Anyone who visited ""Pink's Hot Dogs"" joint on La Brea in L.A knows what an iconic place it is for all the Angelenos. I used to live few blocks away from it and anytime of the day there used to be queues that lasted for hundreds of meters just to have a hot dog and some fries. For the European it could seem really weird that people would wait for some food sometimes for over an hour. To kill time people would talk to one another and in town when you are mostly stuck in your car it was a cool place to actually socialize with people. Similar concept is used in ""Chef"" where Twitter and Facebook are used to spread the word about the quality of food on offer that elevates a Cuban food truck to the level of cuisine celebrity. There is plenty of good music here specially if you enjoy a little salsa now and then, with the Latin beat that carries the whole movie nicely. The performances are solid and Favreau assembled solid cast leading with Sofía Vergara, John Leguizamo, Bobby Cannavale as well as cameos by Scarlett Johansson, hilarious Robert Downey Jr, Dustin Hoffman and Oliver Platt. Everything is tied in nicely with a heartwarming story of redemption and second chance that most viewers should enjoy.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",Chef
165,bodhi-13262,Serves up the Taste:),7,4 April 2016,"'Chef' is the slice of life about a former restaurant chef who starts a food truck and reclaims his passion for cooking.This was just a delight to watch overall. Jon Favreau is proving himself more and more to be an impressive director (even after taking a step back from the superhero genre). His acting as well as his directing makes Favreau just a sheer pleasure to watch on screen as his character of Carl not only cooks with a passion but bonds with his son (Emjay Anthony).John Leguizamo is a great addition to the cast as Carl's right-hand man and sou-chef. His humor and charm is perfect for this role and he never seems out of place as the movie progresses. Both he and Favreau have great chemistry, not only as partners in the kitchen but buddies as well.Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson and Dustin Hoffman have short cameos in the film, but they all serve a purpose even though their screen-time is limited compared to the others. Oliver Platt plays a food critic that has more of a vital role in regards to Favreau's character finding his motivation throughout the film.Sofia Vergara rounds out the cast as Favreau's estranged ex-wife Inez. I know, Sofia is known for being the loud and fiery stereotypical Colombian woman, but she couldn't be anymore different here. She plays her part with a fun humbleness and it's interesting to see how both she and Favreau manage their relationship strains. She's more beautiful than she's ever been in this particular film;)'Chef' probably won't get the notability and praise it deserves, but it definitely is one of the better 'feel-good' movies of the year. I dare anyone not to love it...or feel hungry by the end;)",Chef

167,Timbo_Watching,A good feel good film!,7,10 April 2020,"Let me start off with the talented cast. Jon Favreau is great and to see people like Robert Downey Jr was great too. Nonetheless this is about a chef who got into a fight with a famous food critic, making him lose his job after he couldn't take the critisim, but then found his passion elsewhere at a food truck. Along the way father and son start to bond really well, as he previously couldn't due to his work. This and the very happy ending this film got were lovely to see. A great build up to a great finish to say the least. I recommend this film for sure.",Chef
168,DrPhibes1964,A charming throwback but don't watch on an empty stomach,8,5 August 2021,"Chef reminds me of the slice-of-life films that used to be made back in the 70's. There is no great plot or contrived drama but a simple story of a father sharing his passion for cooking with his son. Some may be turned off by the excessive vulgar language but underneath is a very sweet story. There is not a bad performance to found from the ensemble cast. It charming from beginning to end. The food served throughout is mouth watering,especially the cubano sandwiches.",Chef
169,logicproreviews,What a pretentious load of garbage.,1,28 September 2019,"Oh my God, this movie was just a platform to show off. It's so up it's own wazoo, I'm surprised it even got a distributor. Jon Favreau stars as chef Carl Casper, an absolute whinge bag of a character. Right off the bat, you don't care about this guy. If that was the intention - bravo. Casper is obnoxious and acts like a spoilt little brat.I get the impression that Favreau probably wanted to be a chef in another life and that this is his own self indulgent fantasy. Chef is all probably an attempt at ""comedy"", but oh dear, it's not funny. The chocolate lava cake scene is just well... embarrassing.The supporting characters mostly pour honey all over Casper which just ups the pretentiousness meter. There is one scene where Casper prepares a plate of Pasta Aglio e Olio for Scarlett Johansson's Molly, who watches the chef with the utmost adoration as he flawlessly cooks the dish - which is effectively, sex on a plate.And so, in short, this guy leaves his restaurant after a bust up with a food critic and ends up in a food van - where he and his old friend/colleague cook up a storm with their self invented Cubanos sandwiches. Soon, people are queuing up around the block, the word spreads and Casper is seemingly redeemed.Again, this guy can do no wrong. His food is presented as manna from heaven. Give me a break!I'm sorry Mr. Favreau but this seems like you called up your Hollywood buddies and said, ""let's make a movie where you all kiss my ass and laugh at my jokes"".Chef tastes as raw in the middle as a badly made molten chocolate cake.1/10",Chef
170,mekjd,"Depth, Dimension, and Warmth",9,22 May 2016,"It is possible for emotional depth, humor, and love to occur simultaneously within the same film. This much should be self-evident, but in truth, this is a too infrequent occurrence in current film- making, which veers from the mawkish and inane to the tragic and depressing. Here it is possible to fall in love with deeply flawed characters working their ways out of their own personal depths with a certain amount of emotional integrity, warts and all. On the surface, a viral eruption (of the media sort) catapults the protagonist chef into a seemingly irreversible career tailspin. A nemesis steps in to proffer aid theretofore rejected, but with a boatload of effort, some ingenuity, and both nothing and everything to lose, el jefe is reborn as the soul he knew he was all along.This movie is about a lot of things, not the least of them human attachments, but it is principally about how we die day by day for failure to nurture our passions. Happiness does lie in kindling those passions. And also in cubanos.An A-list cast. It would be surprising to learn that any viewer would not spot a personal favorite within this accomplished crew.Very surprised that this movie did not garner more attention. Hoping its legacy will only improve with age, and that it will become a go-to for restoration of faith in the goodness of life.",Chef

The plot has continual forward momentum without any art-house slack, but nothing that happens is a contrivance, and all the key performances are wonderfully naturalistic.It's wall-to-wall laugh-out loud funny, it's wickedly smart about social media, and it has touching but entirely unschmaltzy father / son and ex-husband / ex-wife relationships to boot.And, oh yeah, pure food porn.

Gotta say, streaming platforms have good AI, amazes me time to time (does disappoint too with recommendations such as 'Love Wedding Repeat'). As the name suggests, the movie is about the chef, food and passion but no, it does not feel like you're watching an episode of MasterChef Australia. The passion draws you in, the food makes your mouth water (don't watch it on an empty stomach) and the chef keeps you on your toes.The movie could have been dull with its simple story, but the acting is pretty darn good, the dialogues make is seem like a real conversation and it almost feels like this is an autobiography. If you're looking for a reason to continue your craft or somebody who just wants their spirits lifted or a reminder of why you started something in the first place, watch Chef.I also felt that two songs in the movie are veryyy similar to Cardi B songs - I Like It Like That was the one I recognized.",Chef

Until I started watching a bunch of Vincent Vaughan films then going backwards when they was in films back in the early days and Jon was the lead, not the 2nd or 3rd banana....

Emjay is a future Oscar winner and should be a presenter on this Oscar presentation night. This movie has it all, the agony of defeat i.e. Chef being fired from a Michelin 3 star restaurant to complete redemption by starting up a new restaurant, with all the pitfalls and very funny situations that occur in between. Emjay plays Percy and steals every scene. Watch this young fellow Hollywood he's on his way to some very big future hits.

177,swellframe17,A Tasty Delight.,7,2 July 2014,"Jon Favreau's ""Chef"" is a nice little film about Chef Carl Casper (played by Favreau) who is fired from his job and starts up food truck business. It's a story about fatherhood and the art of cooking. Favreau stars, writes, and directs the film and you can tell he has a lot of passion for this film. He has a large and talented to cast who all give solid performances, whether it is Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson, John Leguizamo, Sofia Vergara, or Robert Downey Jr..The cooking scenes are handled with care and sizzle with energy. Food is not just a meal. It's an experience. Cooking is a way for Carl Casper to vent and create something great. It's his art. He uses cooking equipment like a paintbrush. Although it can feel slow at times, ""Chef"" is a well-made sentimental film that has heart, wit, and a tasty menu. This film will make you hungry and wanting to cook after. It is a nice indie treat in a summer that can be crowded by big action movies and reboots.",Chef
178,schnoidl,embarrassing,3,15 August 2014,"the only explanation i can think of for this trite mishmash of lifeless clichés is that somehow it's a brilliant parody that went right over my head. There are occasional moments of humor, most of them involving the effortlessly adorable John Leguizamo, butmuch of it is so eye-rollingly bad that it's tempting to get on a plane to LA and go down the list of people who need a good slap. Check, cameos by all kinds of people who should know better (exception, the chewing-gum-faced omnipresent Scarlett, whono expectations of her knowing better, so i guess she's excused), check, happy Latin music at every turn, dimpled kid dancing on Daddy's shoulders, lazy Hispanics who ignore the white man but get in line to help when fellow Espanitch espeakerrr promises them food and beerjust an endless string of weary sighs. Shame on you Jon Favreau, you worked so hard to climb to where you are, and then pee it all away on this drivel? Was there maybe an equivalent of the restaurant boss who said, no, don't show up at the restaurant with all the great food you cooked and show the critic your real magic, that would just end the movie, no, better if you come and bitch the guy out and call him an asshole 10 times. Oh, and we finally get a chance to find out what's the ""buzz"" about all this new-fangled ""social networking"" stuffs the kids are all doing now, with what do they call it twitter or something? can someone please explain to me how it works, oh wow, the 10 year old kid is a master of it! please program my VCR! The only surprise was that there wasn't a tearful smiling dog looking into the lights at the end. They even ended with Oye Como Va. Jon Favreau, shame on you; you need to step back from making movies and go run a food truck and think about what you've become. Get rid of all the yes men posse that didn't smack you in the head early enough on, and find some friends who won't let you get away with such crap. p.s. Sofia Vergara's boob job is really sad, looks like she stuffed a pillow in there. Did her head shrink? Her mouth is going to fall right off.",Chef
179,thedukeofmovietown,Dude version of Julie and Julia,7,14 September 2014,"I saw CHEF last night. For those of you who don't know, Chef is a new film written, directed and starring Iron Man director Jon Favreau. This marks the second film written and directed by Favreau and I have to say, it's a great feel good film. The movie stars Favreau as Carl Casper, a popular yet stifled chef who starts his own food truck in an effort to reinvent himself, strengthen his family and resharpen his admittedly dulled edge. The movie has got a good story and it's supporting cast, which includes heavyweight names like Dustin Hoffman, John Leguizamo, Sofiia Vergara, Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr, really do their part to fill out the flavor of this movie. This is kind of a mixture of Swingers and that Amy Adams movie Julie & Julia about the woman who bakes Julia Child's recipes if that makes any sense. If I could think of anything bad to say, I'd say that it does get a little dry in the middle but that's no reason not to see it. In short, it's one of those women's self discovery movies but its told from a dude's perspective, it's genuinely funny and it's actually about something real so go and check it out if you can. Chef gets a 4... out of 5.",Chef

Initially there were some confusions about his son's relationship with him and that got clarified only at the last 30 minutes for me, which was a minus according to me. Acting and direction of Jon Favreau was very good and Sofia Vergara too! I really liked the message of the movie - ""If you follow your heart/passion and your work touches/impacts others positively, then you will feel very much satisfied with your profession"" and I wish I follow this in my life. The other thing that I liked in this movie was, it travels across multiple cities such as Miami, LA, Austin & New Orleans and felt like travelling along. This movie might not be suitable for kids below 10, as plenty of bad words in the movie!!",Chef
181,anderbilt,Spoiler: It's about a Chef,10,11 April 2015,"I just saw this movie last night and was knocked out, as I usually find myself to be from a Jon Favreau film. True, he's no Orson Welles but who needs another Orson Welles? The world can definitely use more Favreaus. ""Chef"" achieves that level of mastery that divides great writer/directors from good writer/directors. Like many great stories, it's a story about someone becoming suddenly aware of their ongoing slow decline, aware of their own part in it, and where that takes them. It's a film that touches on some traditional Hollywood plot premises, man-with-estranged-son, work-a-holic-breakdown, etc. and turns these plot premises to a unique and organically-told story, instead of mining for pathos. Thankfully Favreau lets a fun personal-journey story tell itself, and avoids the clichés found in so many lesser movies when they don't trust the potential of their own stories. Watching with my wife, we'd say to each other, ""oh here's where the vindictive ex cuts off contact with the son to make matters worse,"" or ""oh, here's where the kid accidentally burns himself because chef-dad doesn't understand that kids have limits,"" but those fakey twists never happened. At the onset, the viewer knows Caspar's days at Riva's restaurant are numbered, and why; after that the movie is one pleasant surprise after the next as the story of Caspar's passage back to himself is told through the events surrounding these uniquely drawn characters. The soundtracks from this movie are worthy of mention as well; they feature some of the most infectiously fun Cuban/Latin songs ever performed, which provide a wonderful foreshadowing in the early parts of the film and underscore the movement of the plot throughout. I wouldn't trade for anything, the joy I felt last night while viewing this film for the first time. On IMDb, I always choose the 'chronological' filter when I'm reading the movie reviews by users. If you do that on this review section and scan the first few pages, you're going to run into at least a half dozen one-star reviews for this movie. Without exception, these one-star reviews are ad hominem attacks on Favreau; brutal and thoroughly incorrect trashings of the movie based on what can only be called outright lies and distortions. The only reason you'd write and post things like this would be to hone and sharpen your own ability to engage in propaganda and rhetorical warfare, to magnify your ability to quickly deter others from viewing a thing regardless of its actual content. If so, it's the most cynical and horrible abuse of this website that I can conceive. It's right out of Goebbels. Stop it already. See this movie.",Chef

183,Nixon_Carmichael,Excellent food movie. Jon Favreau is back in business.,8,24 November 2015,"Chef follows Carl Casper, ""El Jefe"", as he navigates the rough terrain that is the food world. I could've done without the integration of the new school filmmaking, mainly the virtual Twitter birds and occasional bubble text messages, but those were a very small part of the film. Chef begins with Favreau's Chef Carl, a jovial artistic type, working as head chef of a restaurant owned by a ball busting, capitalist archetype played by Dustin Hoffman. After the chef is caught on video in the throes of a public meltdown, he is promptly fired and left to his own devices, and so he manages to attempt to reconnect with his son and his art through the trucks.Chef is an r-rated, yet humorous and feel good movie which does a great job capturing what it means to be not only a chef, but a parent as well as an artist.I honestly can't think of a good reason for you not to watch the movie.",Chef
184,agblum,"Mixed Feelings about the Ending, But a Really Good Movie.",9,2 November 2014,"The Comedy ""Chef"" tells the story of Restaurant Chef Carl Casper, played by the film's Writer and Director Jon Favreau. Casper is the Head Chef of an LA Restaurant, who, bored with his normal menu, wants to change it up to impress a visiting top food critic, played by Oliver Pratt. His Restaurant's owner, played by Dustin Hoffman convinces him not to. This all happens in the backdrop of Carl's relationship or lack there off with his son Percy (Age not given, appears to prior to being a teenager), played by Emjay Anthony, with being divorced from him mother Inez, played Sofia Vergera, and his romantic relationship with his restaurant's hostess Molly, played by Scarlet Johansson. Suffice it to say, the critic's review does not go well, the results of which carry the plot of the movie forward, which become not just about Casper's search for more creativity and variety with his cooking, but morph into having a better relationship with his son. While the first 1/3 movie has some funny lines, it really takes off after that point. There are some truly funny moments. Particularly in the later 2/3 of the movie, the performances of Favreau, Anthony, and John Leguizamo, playing Carl's fellow Chef and Friend Martin, carry the film. I have mixed feeling about the ending, as I saw the film becoming about a connecting of father-son, and not adding another relationship that takes co-center stage at the end.

Does it give you bellyaching guffaws and out loud laughter? No. Is it a rom-com? No. It's simply enjoyable to watch.And I liked the overtone that people should follow their dreams, shouldn't be trapped into doing the same thing for 10 years, that they should break out of their shells and try new things. How many of us actually wish we had the resources and support to do something so fun yet economically challenging? Chef is not great film-making, it's not the best plot, it doesn't have the best acting. But it is a nice film to watch and I recommend it!",Chef
186,LeDentalPlaque,Not the Greatest from Jon Favreau,6,26 December 2014,"I honestly had high expectations for this film because of the great cast. The first few moments of the movie were decent, because it built the backbone of the story and how the main character's food creativity was being oppressed by the owner of the restaurant he worked at.However, the rest of the movie was ""meh"". The overall storyline was very simple but the storytelling was poorly done. The events that took place throughout the film were unrealistic, and these little things added up to become a huge detriment to the story by the end. If you're looking for entertainment, this movie doesn't deliver. It's an okay film that's amusing at times, but it doesn't have enough memorable content for anyone to really consider it an original idea, because the morale of the story (following your dreams and family bonding) is one that has been repeated too many times in the past.",Chef
187,templar77099,Jon Fraveau sure knows how to make an enjoyable flick,6,12 June 2015,"Coming from blockbusters like the praised ""Iron Man"" and the despised ""Cowboys & Aliens"",and despite being born to the cinema in an indie background, I never thought Jon Favreau could pull off a dramedy so jolly. ""Chef"" has such a good vibe to it that it's almost impossible not to smile when the movie starts. The opening shots lead us to believe that the plot of the film will only revolve around cooking and menus. However, ten/twenty minutes in and we can clearly understand the it has also other layers, such as, troubled father and son relations, lack of stimule to creativity affecting the main character (Chef Carl Casper), boss/employee relationship, etc. I would say the main purpose of the movie is to tell the story of a troubled middle aged man who wants to break out of the ordinary, have a proper relationship with his son and seeks a freely way of living, a more creative one. Besides the plot, the film also features an amazing cast, starting with Favreau and ending with Robert Downey Jr., amidst the gorgeous looking Scarlett Johansson and Sofia Vergara. Dustin Hoffman also gives a good performance. The young Emjay Anthony is certainly a revelation. ""Chef"" was one of the best movies of 2014, a comedy for most of the time, with some drama bits which accentuate the light-hearted approach the director went for. The film is also a self-aware critic to all the gastronomic industry, with all it's critics and bloggers and the consequences one bad reckless sentence can have on a cook's life. Besides, social networking is also proeminent in the plot, whether through the usage of Twitter to promote the ""El Jefes"" food truck or even through the usage of Vine to publish short videos. The photography is competent, wherein the film shines on what concerns to soundtrack. The Spanish sounds grant it a very light-hearted vibe and make it very enjoyable to watch. ""Chef"" is, above all, a smooth flick and very, I repeat,very enjoyable to watch. Jon Favreau is a name to consider on the next years, starting with ""The Jungle Book"" slated to release on 2016.",Chef

192,FinneganBear,Very entertaining movie!,10,2 February 2021,"I've always liked Jon Favreau but when this movie came out, the idea of a movie about a chef didn't have much appeal for me. But years later when I had nothing to do I checked it out on Netflix. Wow! I wish I had watched it sooner! It's the story of a successful, respected but divorced chef who finds his career and personal life spiraling out of control, particularly his relationship with his 10 year old son.Favreau was always an appealing actor (""Swingers."" ""Made,"" ""The Big Empty"") and then became an A-list director. ""Chef"" combines his talents. Not only does he star but he he wrote an amazing script and directed flawlessly. Every performance in the film is top notch from Favreau to Emjay Anthony as his son. Favreau called in some of his Avengers (Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johansson) for small parts and added stars like Dustin Hoffman, Sofia Vergara, Oliver Platt, Bobby Cannavale and John Leguizamo. Leguizamo has a lead role and was never better. Even Vergara, who seemed to be a one trick pony in ""Modern Family,"" gives an outstanding performance and shows she's capable of much more depth as an actor. It's to Favreau's credit that he got so many top actors to participate, even in small roles, and got great performances from everyone involved.This movie won't be everyone's cup of tea because it's not an action film, not a love story and not a riotous comedy. But it is a very interesting story about interesting people that feels real and makes you feel good after watching it.

You may find it to be a little unbelievable that this guy has women in his life who look like this - but, as writer-director - you have the option of casting hot women (Woody Allen's been doing it practically his whole career).
What is believable: that Jon Favreau is a chef de cuisine, and has almost a religious attachment to food and the part that it plays in the quality of life for many people.
Also welcome: his speech (about 38:00) about the necessity of ""excellence"" in life.

195,Matt-144-792009,Enjoyable but Somewhat Undercooked,6,27 October 2014,"Jon Favreau wrote and co-produced one of my favorite independent films, Swingers (1996). A movie brimming with relatable, quotable, near and dear to your heart charm. The movie put him and Vince Vaughn on the map. His follow up, Made (2001), which he directed was just as good. It's a hidden gem of a film if you haven't seen it. It pairs him and Vince together again and is simply hysterical. One of my favorites to quote with people who have seen and love the film. It also is another great example of how Puff Daddy (Sean Combs) has real comedic talent. After Favreau directed the now holiday staple Elf, Hollywood took notice and eventually placed him in the big budget Hollywood director chair; with films like Iron Man 1, 2 and Cowboys & Aliens.In the movie Chef (2014) Favreau plays Carl Casper (nice alliteration), a big time celebrity chef torn between conforming to the money behind his restaurant and a critic who feels he has lost his culinary magic. In a massive social media blow up Carl is forced to go back to his roots as a food truck chef, and our protagonist gets his shot at redemption.I feel this movie is a very close to life story for Favreau. A big time Hollywood director, torn between the push of producers and critics, Favreau returns to the small time indie film realm. Much the way his character Carl returns to the small time cooking venture that is the food truck.Only Favreau's beat up food truck contains an arsenal of A-list Hollywood celebrities.I can't say if in Favreau's shoes I wouldn't have cast my love interests as Scarlett Johansson and Sofia Vergara as well. Yet I just don't know how believable it is. And to risk sounding like the critic played by Oliver Platt in this film, that's not the only thing about this film that lacks believability. The story line is very tired Hollywood, all the pieces fit together too nicely in the end. A far departure from the independent roots Favreau was attempting to return too. The film is not with merit, along with the cast and soundtrack is amazing.Any film that includes an appearance by the incomparable blues guitar god Gary Clark Jr is great in my opinion.Only much like the chocolate lava cake in the movie, at the center of the film we have Favreau. His acting is the underwhelming center of the film. Surrounded by great acting talent his lack luster performance is dulled by the shine of those around him. Perhaps if he had allowed this passion project to be acted by any other actor in this film. The emotional center of the father and son dynamic is just not there.Despite all of this, I still eagerly await the next Jon Favreau project, be it in a big posh Hollywood restaurant or served off an independent food truck.If you liked this review check out my blog at yourturntopick.com.",Chef
196,srjohannes,Great film,9,11 January 2021,"Chef is about a chef who is struggling in his life. Between being unhappy in the work place and failing to please his son, he leaves his kitchen in hopes of starting a food truck business where he can unleash his passion for cooking, freely. This film was great. Jon Favreau really knocked it out of the park with this great story, characters you can connect with, and beautiful direction and editing. It all really felt grounded in the real world except for the over reliance on social media. It was to the point that not long from now this film will feel outdated. Now, I don't mind it all when it's necessary, which in this film it sometimes is, but there were so many instances that used social media that really didn't need to be there and they felt almost awkward. Not only that, they had to add to it by putting text of what they were typing on the screen along with the Twitter bird flying around in the air. All of this was really bothersome to me and I feel that if they toned it down and had removed the text, the film could've been about perfect. That being said, all of what I loved about this film drowns out my negativity. There's so much to enjoy and it's a really fun watch. I rate Chef a 9/10.",Chef

199,AkelaLoneWolf,The usual loser-turns-around tale,7,5 October 2014,"What happens when life gets nasty and trips you up? The chief protagonist was (literally) shaken and waken up from a creative culinary rut by the venomous review of a renowned critic who was formerly a fan. After unknowingly and unwittingly starting a virtual war with the critic (to sidetrack, hard as it might be to believe any individual living in the current era not knowing how to Tweet or use Facebook, nevertheless there ARE such primeval beings around and our chef portrayed such a ""living fossil"" quite well) and losing everything after a major collision, Carl ate humble pie, went back to basics and started a food truck. Which then was a phenomenal success. Somewhat cliché as it might seem, this movie emphasized the importance of supportive family and friends when one is in a rough patch plus reiterated the vitals in cooking - great food and real heart (re: scene when it was proposed that a burnt sandwich could pass at a giveaway). Simplistically and idealistically, everything turned out the best for Carl and all's well that ends well. Some of the scenes were too noisy and left dialogues hanging in the air, though the storyline remained intact and the storytelling smooth. But the script could have expounded on the self-discovery culinary journey more: it would take more than a Cuban sandwich to convince the audience our chef is back in full gear. All in all, this is a heartwarming and enjoyable movie that would leave viewers comforted and content - but skeptical viewers might call it a modern fairytale of the loser-turn-around genre.",Chef
200,mockfilmreviews,Another brilliantly solid film from Favreau.,8,24 January 2016,"There is the idea that two kinds of motion pictures exist: Films and Movies. Films make you think. Movies make you turn your mind off and enjoy. Now, these are broad terms to put them in, but for the sake length I hope you can forgive me. My point being, there is a place for both mediums in the cinematic pantheon, but being proficient at creating both thought provoking and shoot em' up is not every director's forte. It's not often a director manages to take on significantly varying projects and find success in the process. Thankfully, John Favreau is a member of this echelon of filmmakers. Whether a light Indie comedy or a flashy summer blockbuster, Favreau makes it look easy. For this go around, he has chosen to keep it small with Chef (2014).Stifled creatively by his boss, which leads to a bad review going viral on Twitter, once renown chef Carl Casper (Favreau) finds his career at a stand still. Scrambling to find another job, he becomes neglectful of his young son (played wonderfully by Emjay Anthony). Following the advice of his ex- wife (Vargara), Carl starts a food truck with his buddy Martin (Leguizamo), where he can be free to create dishes that matter again, while mending the father/son bond.—",Chef
201,jonesaby,A feel good ride,7,17 August 2020,"This was a good experience. I am impressed with Jon Favreau. This is his first directed movie I am watching. After an initial lag, the introduction of characters and plots seemed a bit boring but then as the father son duo clicked it became a better version. The movie never had a dark element, it was smooth ride which is one other reason that I liked. There were some 2 or 3 jokes which were good but the movie was mainly on the father son relation and the cooking just a side dish.
Overall, I would say watch it if you are in need of some safe feel good movie, dont expect LOL moments or emotional moments, its just a ride a father and his goes on...",Chef

203,bartom-612-185848,"Predictable script, yet amazing",6,22 May 2015,"From the start to the finish, you know where this movie is headed, no real surprises there. But still Jon Favreau has given so much heart to the movie that it is a real treat to the eyes.At every corner you find food and i think that is by itself is very inviting to watch. You can see the passion and talent of Casper in his eyes and the commitment he takes to win our hearts is commendable.I have been watching his movies ever since i saw John in the sitcom ""Friends"" and he is sure a talented director and a really passionate actor. It's never easy to make such a straight-forward script so lovable and that shows the innate talent of the actor.Kudos for making this movie, the only improvement could have been the climax, it was so very obvious and it would have been delight to see a twist in the turn of events.",Chef
204,mistercsays1,Look Who's Cooking,8,17 May 2014,"Stepping away from the blockbusters that have occupied his time and talents of late, Jon Favreau scales back the spectacle to deliver Chef, a thoroughly enjoyable story of redemption set amid the chaos and camaraderie of the kitchen in which Favreau delivers what may be his best performance yet. In addition to taking on the lead role of disgruntled chef Carl Casper, Favreau also wrote the screenplay and served as producer and director, putting himself firmly in the firing line if the film misfired. Fortunately, he has got most of it right and Chef overcomes any shortcomings through its refreshing take on relationships - particularly between Carl and his 10-year-old son Percy (Emjay Anthony) - and the power of technology and social media as both a destructive force and an instrument of considerable social currency. Confined to bit parts of late in the likes of The Wolf of Wall Street and the three Iron Man films, Favreau seems to relish the opportunity to take on this role of a man forced to re-evaluate everything that is important to him.We first meet Carl as he begins preparations for the evening ahead at the restaurant at which he is the head chef. Once hailed as the next big thing in culinary circles, Carl's career and reputation has stagnated somewhat as he finds himself frustrated by the limitations placed on him by restaurant owner Riva (Dustin Hoffman). You see, Riva is more interested in maximising profit, while Carl is desperate to shake things up and broaden the menu, particularly with high profile critic Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) dropping in to sample the fare. It is not giving too much away to say that things don't go well and, when Carl unleashes at Michel in a tirade that goes viral, his tenure at the restaurant is over. At the urging of his ex-wife Inez (Sofia Vergara), Carl heads to Miami and establishes a food truck that enables him to reconnect with his love of cooking and the son he has neglected. Much merriment ensues as Carl hits the road to redemption with Percy and best friend Martin (John Leguizamo) along for the ride.The film very much celebrates the art of cooking and gastronomes will go nuts at the myriad montages of Carl at work in the kitchen, whether it be in the restaurant, the food truck or at home where even a toasted sandwich is prepared with passion and precision. The relationship between Carl and Percy, which is the crux of the narrative with the food truck as the conduit that brings them together, is refreshingly realistic and devoid of mawkish sentimentality. Young Graham is remarkably composed and naturalistic as Percy and the underrated Leguizamo makes the most of his best role in ages. The music is fabulously funky, creating the up-tempo mood that permeates the second half of the film. There really is a lot to like here, which makes it easy enough to overlook those aspects that go unexplained. For example, Inez lives in a luxurious house with an armada of domestic staff and is always making reference to her work, yet we never get any sense of what this work entails and ultimately Vergara seems to be simply rehashing her Modern Family persona, albeit not quite so shrill.The sudden disappearance of Scarlett Johansson from the narrative is another mystery that remains unsolved. In the opening portion of the film, Johansson's Molly works as a hostess at the restaurant and there is clearly a mutual attraction between her and Carl. In fact, a scene in which Molly lounges seductively while Carl prepares a meal is sexier than most love scenes, yet once Carl leaves for Miami, Molly is neither seen nor heard from again. A cynic might suggest that Johansson's inclusion, along with a somewhat strange cameo from Robert Downey Jnr as another of Inez's ex-husbands, is simply Favreau calling upon his Iron Man co-stars in an attempt to secure maximum leverage for his film with multiplex audiences.The film demonstrates the power of ubiquitous presence and power of social media; initially bringing Carl to his knees before ultimately playing a very significant role in his resurrection as a chef and a father. Despite a few unanswered questions along the way, Chef is a charming, refreshing surprise.",Chef

It leaves a few loose ends you'd like to see tied up, but in all the film delivers where it counts.If there is a problem here, it is that you are going to get hungry. Not a little, but a lot. From scene to scene of delicious food, from the Cubano sandwiches (which, if you have had them, you know are fantastic or, if you haven't had one, your life is empty) to the slow cooked brisket, you want to reach in and grab the food. It's a good thing this is not 3D with smell added or the entire audience would be ripe pickings for the nearest food truck.Yes, this is food porn.However, the relationship that grows as the father and son travel and work together is amazing.

209,victuki,"A Chef, His Wife and a Truck",9,27 August 2014,"This is the story of a gifted Chef that served the same menu everyday, something that did not motivate him at all. He is stuck, and has lost his family in the process. After a terrible review by a posh ""blogger"", he blows up, losing everything he still had left....or maybe not? what seems to be the end, is just the beginning of a journey inside a food truck, a journey through his past, present and future. Jon Favreau directed ""Iron Man"" (2008), a then unexpected success that set the tone for the whole Marvel cinematic universe. He proved to be a capable director to manage a blockbuster, and basically started the fire that is still burning. This time though, he wanted a humble project, and in order to get some superstars, he promised a fun time in a three weeks scheduled job, and convinced everyone on board. This is the kind of movie you do have to watch no matter what. It is positive, it does not dwell on drama, because probably is what it should never be done. The characters, the events all along the film, you feel that positive flow, and some of us long for those feelings on screen, because comedy can be touching as well. That honest approach is something to admire (except for the cast, Sofia Vergara and Scarlett Johansson as his love interests? Sci-Fi!!!) Mel Brooks would say: ""It's good to be the director"". The cast (Downey Jr, Oliver Platt, John Leguizamo, etc) is great, the film seems to last just a moment, and everything is well arranged, just like a proper kitchen. So the recipe for success is still the same: a good story, good cast, a good director, and little else. Favreau cooks the whole menu, and it's truly tasty. At the end of the day, everything feels better after a good meal.",Chef
210,TheMovieVlog,"I loved this movie. It was funny, sweet and totally entertaining. A feel good movie.",8,9 May 2014,"Writer/Director/Star Jon Favreau made an auspicious writing/acting debut back in 1996 with the cultural touchstone, SWINGERS. Since then, he has moved smack dab into the middle of mainstream studio filmmaking with such megahits as ELF and IRON MAN. Perhaps as a way to reconnect with his indie roots, Favreau brings us CHEF, the story of a man tired of working for ""the man"" who strikes out on his own with a food truck and strives to forge a better relationship with his young son. If this sounds like conventional stuff, it is. It's also charming and lazy in equal measure. Saw one of the advance screenings last night at cia. Entire audience was clapping at the end. We laughed so much. Kudos to favreau for not going the obvious direction we have grown to expect from movies. chef is a well told and comic story of a once up and coming star chef. Dustin Hoffman plays his role as chef caspers boss brilliantly. When pushed to far some very inspired and comic results transpire. You will want to eat after seeing this , even with popcorn in you.

Certain things would perk me up but it just seems like they gave us their best first and then obviously ran out of the same type of material later, which is unfortunate but if you need a distraction or are really in into cooking or have nothing else better to do then this is the go to movie. In this movie you see the actual work that goes into being a chef, what they have to endure and be able to handle from two different avenues.

Emjay Anthony,essaying the role of Favreau's son is good. So is John Leguizamo, as his best mate and sous-chef.

216,isabelle-frater,You'll be happy and hungry after watching this,5,25 September 2014,"Chef is a fun movie about food, life, and fatherhood. While I'm giving it only 3 stars, I still liked it a lot. However, it wasn't a great masterpiece, or terribly exciting. My reason for watching it twice is that it gives me a warm feeling every time I watch it.The movie is a lot of fun. It has a fast talking chef, Carl Casper, who swears a lot, like most chefs I've seen on TV, and that's always great to watch. There are some good jokes, and the cop played by Russell Peters was a memorable comic character. It's also about food, and being a chef. Today the trend in food is good, local ingredients, and an ever changing menu that adapts to the environment. The changing menu allows the chef a creative freedom, and also gives a chance to people to try out new things. In the movie, the opposite of this style is a menu that is always the same, which is portrayed as being stuck in the past. As someone who loves to discover new food, I like the progressive approach as well. The food in the movie looks very good. I read that Jon Favreau, the actor portraying Carl Casper, studied cooking, and worked with Roy Choi to look authentic on screen. It turned out very well. I recommend not watching it on an empty stomach. Chef is also about life and self-discovery. All people come across a time in their lives when they feel that they are in a rut. This is harder on creative people, who may feel uninspired and frustrated. The only thing we can do is to change, when possible. That can be hard, unless we are forced into it, or opportunity comes knocking. However, this movie is trying to show that once we finally make that leap, we will be happier for it. Another theme in the film is fatherhood. Carl is divorced, and tries to spend as much time with his 10-year-old son as possible, but he's busy with his job. It was very nice to see that his ex-wife was supportive, and understanding. A lot of times in film we see bad divorces, but part of the good feeling this movie gives is the great relationship between Carl and his ex. The kid, played by Emjay Anthony, adopts his mother's understanding attitude, though there is a moment when he shows that he isn't perfect after all. It would be great if all divorced families could have the same relationship as they do. I also liked how social media was portrayed. Today, if you have a business, or building a personal brand, social media is very important. In the beginning Carl isn't knowledgeable about it, and while it's part of the hilarity, it also shows that we all have to be careful about what we post online. However, while it warns us of the dangers, it also portrays the power and potential of what a Twitter account can accomplish if used well.Overall, I recommend this movie for an after-dinner watching as a couple, or as a family. Though there is a lot of swearing, especially in the beginning, so the kids may need to be older. While this isn't mostly about food, foodies will also enjoy it. Check out the Facebook page as well, as they have recipes. Anyone for a Cubano?",Chef
217,hamass-mujadid,Making of Two Dishes,6,15 March 2015,"Apart from the disastrous editing (sound and otherwise), this movie takes the viewers to a whole different level. There are no extraordinary dialogues, mind it. There is no dramatic story, mind again. There is nothing breathtaking in the plot. There's just an idea. Actually anything said or written about the idea would be an understatement so I'll leave the guidance blow empty here.Chef in Chef faces challenges, and given his current state, that is, the loser restaurant and loser owner, and his illiteracy with Twitter, he is disappointed by the whole state of affairs. With the power of the sacred bond (with his son), he sets out trying to correct things, but this time, he does just a one dish, which I'll leave to the prospective audiences of this movie to see for themselves.Movies like Chef are, nonetheless, quite mainstream. But then, such movies only aim at easing their audience. The whole point of having nothing extraordinary elevates these movies to extraordinary levels. Favreau's frustration, anger, grief, comedy is the focal point. His situation throughout makes the watch constantly interesting. There are many flaws, so I'm guessing the only target was making audiences giggle on just about everything, while feeling good about themselves.In acting, there were two extremes, it was Jon Favreau at his best and Sofia Vergara at her poorest. But don't worry, she isn't the headline. As for the story (not the idea), you'll be hungry throughout the movie.

It was like no other storyline I have ever seen and Favreau did an amazing job as a writer, director, and actor in this film. I don't think it was so much about his job change, but more of a personal mid-life crisis and his struggles of a his role of a father to his young son. I have never cared for Scarlett Johansson, yet I really like her in the role of Molly. It refreshing to see the beautiful Sofia Vergara play something outside of her MF role. She was really good in this and it was also good to see a couple be amicable post-divorce, instead of including the normal drama that is usually portrayed.

For example; how do average looking chefs manage to attract not just one, but two gorgeous model like women with extra white teeth? Well maybe, since cheffing is the new sexy black these days, but would such a man really stay such close friends with his ex- wife and get on well with his ex-wife's other ex-husband who would then present him with an enormous gift in the shape of a humongous motor vehicle - because he thinks he's a loser and really wants to help him out?!? Then, later on, would a father really give his 10 year old son a lethal knife to take care of, having first told him how extra sharp and dangerous it is? And are kids really that tolerant of their absent fathers who spend more time at work than with them? Also, would a Sous chef who have just been promoted really leave his job to go and work on takeaway truck? It just seems devoid of any modicum of reality or common sense in fact.As for the twitter integration thing – why does technology have to feature so heavily in every other movie these days? It's really quite boring for viewers who don't live out their lives on the internet. Aside from that, the film contained no character build up, no depth, no climax and well...no flavour...with near cameo performances by Dustin Hoffman, Robert Downey Jr and Scarlet Johansson all but wasted! The whole thing was too superficial, too unrealistic and just too flaccid for my liking. The only cool thing about it was the sound track.

221,shashthezarch,The food can be more tastier!!!,7,10 February 2019,"SOME SPOILERS!!! BUT IT WONT SPOIL YOUR EXPERIENCE!!!
Chef is an awesome movie with a good
storyline. The acting is normal and satisfactory. Jon Favreau had done a great job in this movie. I was really excited to see RDJ in this movie(though his role was very small). If people thought that they are gonna watch Chef, it must have been because of this amazing cast. But the cast doesnt get that much screen time which the watchers really expected. Talking about the story, it is very simple and quite good. It explains the basic meaning of life. But some things are illogical and unjustified.
1)The movie represents that how a Father got close to his son. Well looks like they pressurized it, they had a good relation at the very beginning of the movie. Then the makers made it bad so that they can be on the track of there story. It was normal Father-Son relation at the starting too
2)People who have never even tasted the Chef's food, gathered in huge amount to eat his food like he was that famous. Well they showed a pretty good use of twitter(it plays an important role). But then i dont think it can work like this specially in a normal movie like Chef
3)The Ending:We dont see any gaps filled in the relation between him and his wife. She just mistakenly said ""I love you"" to him(thinking it was there son). And then whoosh, they got married again(they had divorce). They should have showed more about him and his wife. More talks, more scenes.
Well, these were the 3 things that the ""Chef"" should have added in his food, to make it more tasty. More enjoyable. Except this, i think it was all good.",Chef

I'm used to the fact, that in the recent time there are not much comedies out there. And there are less and less funny comedies. I've seen action movies and thrillers, that are way funnier than many movies that have the Comedy sticker on it. If the movie is not funny enough, why is it categorized as a Comedy? For this movie, I would say it made me laughing twice, once in the beginning, and afterwards a little bit. I was waiting the another half of the movie to get laugh-inspired again, but was deeply disappointed. The whole movie was intended to make a father-son drama with positive emotions, but I'm really missing a point here. Throughout the whole movie you expect to get some funny stuff, but instead you are pushed to see a family drama that is not moving, and in the end you really ask yourself: ""Why did I had to watch this movie at all ?"".",Chef

I don't know if they had a deal with Twitter and it was a 100 minute advertisement, but that is what it seemed like. The Chef has an ex wife and kid who live in a mansion. He looks after the kid in his best capacity as a busy chef who gets a bad review from a restaurant critic and quits.The storyline is mindless as this guy starts a business making Cuban sandwiches from an old beat up truck. The acting is mostly terrible especially the Cuban wife who was so wooden she must have floated to the USA. The critic once again appears and decides the Cuban sandwiches are nectar and wants to back the chef in a business venture. Total rubbish and mind blowing dull.My advice is avoid this movie and do watch your fingernails grow for 100 minutes...it would be a less boring and more funny experience.",Chef
226,davidsmovingcastle,"Love Jon Favreau, he is talent all the way through",8,14 June 2021,"This is an excellent fun movie....it kicks up reminders for me, since I worked in hospitality and catering for 15 years....some of the conversations between Chef and the owner are spot on lol...very accurate to life.*although the food in this movie looks fantastic, it gave me a heart attack just looking at it. Unfortunately I was cursed with a broken body, I can't eat much, but it's nice to see people coming together, and enjoying food together. I'm sure this film spawned a million food truck businesses around the world.Jon is a great writer. He worked miracles with The Mandolorian.",Chef
227,Snowgoat,Self-indulgent rubbish,1,9 April 2015,"Utterly self-indulgent vanity-project rubbish. These kind of films crop up every now and then – usually side projects of A-list stars or directors. Such films are almost always labelled as ""whimsical"" or ""charming"" by some critics, when in fact they're nothing but lazily-written, poorly-developed ideas which would never have been made had it not been for the star-power behind them. In the case of Chef we get a thinly-veiled metaphor for the director's movie career. But switching Hollywood for a restaurant kitchen makes it no less self-indulgent and actually a heck of lot more boring. It's just a rambling mess of food-porn shots where story should be, and Favreau's A-list mates dropping by to improvise nothing-roles which apparently exist for no other reason than to burn a few more pointless minutes of screen time. The whole thing feels like it was written in a couple of hours and shot the same day.",Chef
228,costafic,Find motivation when faced with adversity,8,28 June 2020,"Chef is a great film! It's dynamic, heartfelt and clever.

The resilience and infectious enthusiasm of the main protagonist is inspiring.
I highly recommend",Chef
229,xylophone59,Salubrious and entertaining. Good clean fun.,8,2 July 2014,"Good movie-making. I didn't know the lead was the director until after the movie and I thought as I was watching ""this guy is really good"". Ironic because as the director he could do what Casper the cook could not do at the start and that is to be in control of the show. Jon Favreau could do as he saw fit in a way that his character Casper the cook could not. The result is excellent. The movie flashed by it seemed very quickly as there was nothing difficult about watching it and it never dragged. It held my attention comprehensively; in short it is very entertaining. Emjay Anthony played his son very competently- in fact he would have stolen the show completely had the rest of the cast not been so capable also. Sofia Vergara as Percy's mum and Casper's ex-wife, was also excellent. I couldn't help noticing she is rather good looking- AND charming. But it is the chemistry between Percy and Casper that makes the movie entertaining. The lines are witty and the brilliance of Percy on social media is endearing. Social media is a big part of the movie and being dumb about it myself, it was great to have Twitter finally clearly explained to me. Looks scary to me. The advice of the 2 workmates who realize before Casper the implications of being twitter-famous and that it has benefits as well as pitfalls, was very amusing. I am like Casper- I don't have a clue. I am a big fan of Robert Downey and Scarlett Johannson but to the movie's credit it took me ages to recognize them. In fact I did not recognize Robert at all till after the movie- sign of a good actor. Dustin Hoffman was understated and convincing as usual. The photography was great especially Miami, and the Americana shots were not clichéd as is typical in many movies. A really charming, salubrious and humanity-driven film. I strongly recommend it. Excellent. Great music as well.",Chef
230,MIKE-1280,Overlong and overdone,2,17 June 2014,"I found there was not enough content in this film to keep it going for the 2 hours and 9 minutes it dragged on for. From the start it was fast paced but so much so the characters seemed to talk over each other, or was it the constant loud Latin music which stopped me from hearing much of the dialogue. And then it flagged for a good half hour or more when nothing much happened, I had a hard time staying awake through this part or was I just trying to avoid the ""noise"" of the soundtrack and dialogue?The last part of the movie did get going again but it never really lifted enough to make it worth the effort of staying awake.Fix the 2 main faults : garbled dialogue and overpowering music, cut a half hour out of the middle and it would probably have been a very passable B grade movie.Having said all that, my wife really enjoyed it, although she too thought it over long. S there you are",Chef
231,sajib-66432,a successful chef struggling for his own mistakes not motivating idea,4,8 May 2015,"Really felt bored because stories, acting wasn't really something which make you feel good .i mean if a man have everything that he desire then suddenly throw it away then whats the point of watching how he take it back again( though for chefs if you can cook you then you don't have to fight hard to get back on your foot ) When in recent TV shows like master chefs where regular home cooks struggling with their lives find time to show their love for their food but its not really the case for this chef .Don't feel i actually seen any real creative idea(No Ratatouli this time) or anything from him .He was as boring as a character(acting) & in his re invention of foods (haven't seen much really) there is no real struggle .what ever they try to portray about his struggle don't really make sense if he really was a long term successful chef .feel every chef's dream is to get to the position where he was .so its like movie how to throw away everything ,not good for audience because who really don't want to see a suicidal idiot commit suicide then whine .anyway if a chef movie be more about family bonding other than being a chef with foods then maybe everything is like lost in translation .interesting part is ending wasn't what i hoped .i guess director don't believe in having patience .less struggle in getting what ever you want ,when ever you want isn't really something will keep the audience interested in this movie",Chef
232,thirteenprime,Tasty!,8,30 August 2014,"I can't help feeling that this movie is not only about a chef finding himself, but it's also about lead actor/director Jon Favreau trying to get back in touch with the kind of films he used to make -- small ones without guys wearing super-suits or cowboys drawing down on aliens. Here, Favreau's Carl Casper quits his big Iron Restaurant job and rediscovers himself, and his passion for food and family, by running a Chef-sized food truck. Results: excellent.Films like this can be lost if the wrong kid is cast. Emjay Anthony is the right kid. He's great as Percy. I particularly enjoyed the way the film handled Percy's internet-savviness, and how he used it. John Leguizamo is a great fit as Carl's friend and sous-chef. Sofia Vergara as Carl's ex- wife is, as usual, capable and stunning.See Chef, and bear witness as a good filmmaker continues his journey to becoming a great one.",Chef

234,rogerg100,Family movie,5,18 September 2014,"This movie is sweet with some good actors, good characters and a few jokes. The movie is about a chef that takes his job very seriously with lots of passion who has a mean one dimensional boss a son a hot divorced wife etc. The characters are all interesting except his boss. If you like to watch a family movie/ romantic movie this is 7 Star!! easy! However it is classified as comedy with a joke about every 10 minutes. Even Jaws( horror) had Jokes and so did Commando (action). That does not make them a comedy !! This is a family drama with some jokes! This spoiled it for me since I wanted a good laugh ! There was not a single funny joke until the 40th minute! Most jokes were as much dramatic/ sad as funny.I was on the verge of leaving then Robert Downey Jnr entered the scene . He was there for 5 minutes yet somehow after this - not sure if the actors suddenly realised it or the script writer- but the movie picked up life! Overall it was still way to serious for a comedy! I am not sure who classifies comedy to the genre for this family drama with occasional jokes.. So for a family movie 7 starts for a comedy 4 stars. So I can settle on 5 *.",Chef

237,snodlander,Nothing new,5,25 June 2014,"I can't help but think a lot of favours were called in to make this. Robert Downey Jnr was of course brilliant, but he appears in a single scene for 5 minutes, and I had no idea why he'd help the ex husband of his ex wife. Dustin Hoffman doesn't appear after the 1st 15 minutes. Ditto his early love interest, Scarlett Johansson.No surprises in this road trip, estranged dad spends time with his son movie. And everything ends wonderful in the last reel, for no apparent reason.But yet again we have a Hollywood film where a gorgeous woman is in love with a fat guy. How many films have there been when the fat girl has a gorgeous guy? (OK, so I'm watching Taxi at the moment. Queen Latiffia excepted).Even Shallow Hal had Gwynneth Paltrow pretending to be fat.There are worse ways to spend an afternoon, but overall I was left with the feeling I#d seen it before. Great for food porn, but not foe anything else.",Chef
238,Kyleeeeeeeeeeeeeee,"A tasty treat, but is it a memorable one?",7,22 July 2014,"WARNING: The following contains minor spoilers for the movie ChefGet your taste buds ready!Because Chef is a feast for both the eyes and taste buds. First of all, props to the cameraman for getting some expert shots. They looked very cool, especially during scenes featuring food (which did almost make me feel very hungry by the way) And don't go to this movie with an empty stomach. Everything in this movie is surrounded by food. The main character, a chef (obviously), feels at the top of his game. However when a bad review comes his way (2 out of 5 stars, which isn't that bad in my eyes), the chef lets the criticism consume him, mainly since he wasn't able to create the food he wanted to prepare because he didn't own the restaurant. Things then escalate when he explodes on Twitter, thus a twitter war ensues between the critic and the chef, which eventually leads to the lead getting fired. Now without of job he must find his inspiration to get back on track with both his career and personal life (he was recently divorced). But how?The character of the chef is an unlikable one, which is kind of the point. He thinks highly of himself which makes it very interesting to watch him fall. He doesn't progress very much in the film until the end. Near the end it made me mad when he didn't let his son work with him once the school year started. But he didn't explain why! It just makes him look even more jerkish in my eyes (which, by the way, an unlikable central character is a major pet peeve of mine). By the way THE KID ACTOR DIDN'T STINK!!! IT'S A MIRACLE! He became better and better as the movie progressed. It's as if he got more and more comfortable with his character on screen. As I mentioned before, this film has a lot of food in it. A lot. So much that it is actually used in almost every single transition into a new scene. I'm not kidding. Even if the scene has nothing to do with food the transition to the next scene involves food. What if the chef is angry? He angrily cooks food. What if he's spending time with his son? You'll bet he'll make some more food! I wouldn't have a problem with this if they didn't do it so many times. It makes the film feel like a cookbook and not so much a film of good storytelling and creativity. Speaking of storytelling, the main focus actually isn't the relationship between the chef and the critic. It's between the chef and his son, which is totally fine. In fact, I would actually prefer this over the war against the critic or the relationship between the divorced parents. However, the two parts of the story I just mentioned go by unnoticed until the end of the movie, where you see the couple get back together and the critic become a business partner with the chef. The only problem with this is that these story aspects never really developed; therefore I honestly didn't care that much. It just makes the film look unfinished since there wasn't enough time to flesh out these stories and were instead placed at the end in order to end everything in a nice little bow.But like I mentioned, Chef is a tasty treat. With an interesting premise and interesting characters, what could go wrong?",Chef
239,tinidrilcharon,Not your typical formula,8,21 August 2021,"Great acting, great story, well executed.I kept waiting for the 'shoe to drop', just like in life, but it was just a great story.

240,goddardr,Good decent fun,8,15 June 2014,"For those with a cynical outlook on life, this movie isn't for you. If you are looking for angst and conflict, these ingredients are missing as well. If you are interested more in a human interest story and how one can find their way out of a setback from an unexpected direction, this is worth taking a chance. As you probably know, the main story line involves a chef, once one of the up and comers many years ago, now runs a kitchen in a well established successful restaurant. The restaurant is successful with dishes he created many moons before, but now he wants to freshen up the fare, especially when a noted food critic is scheduled to rate the restaurant again after many years. As you can guess, events happen to cause a total upheaval for the chef.The complicated part involves his son from a failed marriage. He spends time with him and gets along well with the ex, but he doesn't really ""know"" his ten year old boy. Now, with encouragement of his ex-wife, he and his son have an opportunity to spend time together while the chef puts together a new strategy.First off, if you are a food junkie, there are a lot of nice moments involving the preparation of food. It isn't just a plot mechanism; it is a full feature of the whole story. Second, the chef is struggling with what he wants to do and what he has to do. During his journey, he discovers why he became a chef and why his previous experience was lacking. Who can't identify with this dynamic.Third, I really enjoyed seeing the change as he goes from a chef in a successful restaurant to a chef that finds what it takes to get himself re-invented and re-energized into his true passion.This movie does lack the bumps and challenges of many similarly themed plots. Plus, it isn't a doubling-over-with-laughter type of movie. It has fun moments, touching moments, poignant moments, and a few outrageous moments, all of which are executed well. So, since when does this make for a bad movie? Do we need to see recovery from galactic suffering in order to call it a ""good"" movie? I don't think so.For the most part, movie goers want to go and have a good time once in a while without the extra baggage of human discontent. There is enough strife to give the story a base to advance the idea that, when pushed, we can change and come out stronger. It is just that this particular journey is a little more enjoyable earlier in the movie than most.",Chef
241,jgrapejiang,Disappointing,3,6 April 2021,"With such high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes (both critics and audience) and on IMDb, Chef seemed like a perfect comedy to enjoy on a Friday night.I appreciate Jon Favreau's talent on The Avengers and the Star Wars franchises. That's what made Chef a letdown. The conversations between Chef Casper (Jon Favreau) and his son were dominated by fast-talking quips. If you're not paying attention, you'll miss what they're saying. Favreau also says those lines with no expression whatsoever on his face; to me, I don't see the purpose of that type of delivery. And who even talks like that?Onto the humor...there were some moments that were kind of funny, I'll admit. I love to see John Leguizamo and Robert Downey Jr. However, the bulk of the comedy is 1. Overuse of swear words 2. Sex/genital-related jokes.Plus, does no one else find it strange that a white man starts a Cuban food truck by leveraging his Latina ex-wife's connections and the help of his Latino ex-employee? It feels even more like cultural appropriation, because the relationships and dialogue between the characters don't feel natural to the point where I believe that he's truly passionate about Cuban culture and cuisine.The main reasons I'm not giving this a one star rating are that I liked the message of rediscovering your love for something and taking an unconventional path. Casper also gains some empathy vis a vis his son, which was one plot point that was believable.",Chef

243,krirks,Feel good movie for feel good people,10,16 October 2015,"Yes, it is simple, predictable, typical road trip movie. It is not a superhero movie even if there is RDJ in it. This movie 'Chef' is very realistic, some say boring, because it is very realistic. There are no totally bad or completely good guys here. The characters are believable. The movie portrayed the father and son who lives with his mother just getting the first time getting to know each other via road trip with the food truck. The food truck went to many interesting places that helped the ambient in the film feel very heartwarming. And yummy. The detail when you see the chef cook can tell you that Jon Favreau went to amount of practicing for his food making skill. Sofía Vergara is very beautiful. It could have had more romance scenes but it chose to focus on father and son relationship. And also focus on what you should believe in yourself and integrity. You know the end of the movie just minutes from the start but the journey along the story is very interesting and enjoyable to watch.",Chef

You can follow the characters as they laugh, go through some struggles, and seek happiness on their own terms.Ultimately, you can invest yourself in the film, and that's what makes it great.It's a simple narrative, but executed wonderfully.",Chef
245,junkmail-385,"Slow, poorly motivated",3,15 February 2015,"The real chef behind Chef was outstanding, producing food that was amazingly scrumptious to look at. Too bad the script didn't match it! The movie began quite well, but soon ran off a cliff when Casper went on his rant. Until then, I felt compassion for him, but completely lost it at that point. No longer could I see myself in his position, because he behaved like no rational person would. Every plot point from then on seemed unnatural, purely manipulative and largely predictable. Faced with insurmountable adversity at the restaurant, a rational person might have invited the food critic to dine in his home or sought a job elsewhere, instead of burning all his bridges.Unlike the tasty, wholesome foods displayed, Chef the movie is chock full of fillers, such as unnecessarily lengthy musical interludes and other scenes that just go on way too long. The film could have been improved a couple stars just by cutting 30 minutes. Clearly Favreau has many talented friends, but that's not an excuse to go overboard with their promotion. The dialog is dreadful and the cornstarch in the crotch scene was a real head slapper. Emjay Anthony was the one bright star, only hampered by the script.",Chef

I know it's a foodie thing, but I totally am one. If you are one already, I think you'll love this movie. If you aren't one yet, you might discover the foodie within! Chef is a movie made with integrity and real heart and soul. Chef reminded me the literalexcitement and pleasure of finding, touching, and smelling great fresh produce, of finding a perfect cut of flank steak and knowing what it could taste like, the satisfaction of working with well-made tools, the way aroma can bring people out of the woodwork (i've literally have had people knocking on my door from other apartments wanting to know wth smelled so good; i've also come home, smelled what was going on next door and immediately got all excited and inspired to make something delicious) and more importantly, bring people together. It reminded me of what it felt like to cook like that, and feel proud of what I accomplished. Most importantly, it makes me realize I need to start doing that again. And I need to get to New Orleans! Thank you, Jon Favreau! Next month I'm picking up a cutting board, a cleaver, a good chef knife, a few select pots and pans, and getting back into kitchen.",Chef

Before seeing this movie I watched another movie named 'Chef' in Hindi which is a direct adaptation of this movie shot in Indian Context.

249,airfoyle,Very disappointing,6,28 May 2014,"My wife and I went to this movie because its IMDb rating (7.9 as of 2014-05-26) was higher than the ratings of the other two movies we were considering. I cannot tell a lie: my wife liked it. I was dismayed (by the flick, not her opinion of it).First, the good things: Robert Downey Jr. does a terrific job of sketching a character of eccentric loathsomeness with the 5 minutes he has on screen. Scarlett Johansson is always fascinating, although she vanishes from the movie about a third of the way through. Oliver Platt has some nice moments. Emjay Anthony as the kid is quite solid. (Why do boys in movies always have long hair? Is it to make them look younger than they are? But not this time; I think Anthony is 11, playing a 10-year-old.) Sofia Vergara is charming, and pretty if you like busty women (which I don't).The bad things: Dustin Hoffman is wasted playing a key character whose actions are so irrational he should wear a sign around his neck saying ""Plot device.""Come to think of it, everybody in the movie is wasted. The plot is full of holes big enough to drive a food truck through. There are no plausible conflicts in the movie, and even most of the implausible ones are resolved by everybody deciding to be nice. Early in the movie the chef, played by director Jon Favreau, is told by his ex-wife, played by Sofia Vergara, that he would be happier driving a food truck than being chef of a classy L.A. restaurant. I thought her suggestion was to establish that she was somewhat ditsy; what self-respecting chef would want to drive a food truck? She turns out not to be ditsy at all; she has some sort of career that makes her more prosperous than her ex, although I couldn't figure out what that career was. The food truck materializes, the music gets more Latin, and the movie becomes a father-son-bonding road trip. Then the fairy godmother appears, waves her magic wand, and all problems are solved. It's somewhat strange that people love to watch other people cook, while cooking less and less themselves. My advice is to stay home and make yourself a cubano sandwich; it'll fill you up more than watching Jon Favreau make a few thousand of them.",Chef
250,facorread,The following expectations are a prerequisite to this movie,10,7 September 2014,"This film reminds me of the works of poet William Wordsworth, who started the Romantic Age using a particular style, based on simple vocabulary, inspired on everyday life events, and intended to bring poetry to the reach of all people.As a prerequisite to this movie, you should convince yourself of the following:This is not a summer blockbuster. This is not Iron Man 4/The Avengers whatever. This does not have a huge budget. This is an independent film, with a simple plot, no twists (no spoilers), simple premise, simple characters, honest feel-good intent. A wonderful cast collaborating in this movie out of personal friendship, giving very good performances, playing characters that are developed just mildly.

On the other side, you have to understand the subtext and what they were really getting at with this film: it's not necessarily about food (though having Roy Choi as a Technical Adviser on set didn't hurt, heh) but more about the passion that goes into the art itself. I also really enjoyed the father-son storyline. But the idea of passion resonates throughout the film, along with a fantastic soundtrack featuring a mainly Latin and New Orleans vibe. I thoroughly enjoyed Leguizamo as the feisty sidekick - he was the perfect choice to compliment the more serious Favreau.The downsides? Scarlett was more a prop than part (though quite a good-looking prop, I might add), and I found the ending pretty cheesy. Other than that, I'm just hungry for a Cubano now.",Chef

It's true that at one or two points, the movie really stretches and some of the characters are one-dimensional but there is nothing you can't enjoy with some sizzling sandwiches, tostones and yuca fries !

There's just a few scenes where I felt that Jon Favreau could have done better.. There's a scene where his son is about to serve a burnt sandwich to someone who isn't paying.. now first of all, it's hard to believe that a sensitive kid like that would ever do such a thing, but the way Jon takes him in the back and gives him a load of crap about him being good at this instead of telling him to treat people well, that just really didn't make sense to me. Also the scene where he's telling him he can't work on his truck.. well he should've explained why.. but he simply says it can't be done. Those conversations should've been handled better because the movie was all about those conversations. But everyone in the movie was good otherwise. Sofia was such a beautiful presence in the movie and even Scarlett.. the food scenes are also done really well! Nice movie. Do watch it!",Chef

Some scenes will make you say wow that looks tasty. sometimes the movie brings small smile on your face. These kind of things Chef does it brilliantly. Acting wise: john favreau was good as the father/main character, the kid was good. my favorite Character was Martin (John Leguizamo) the friend of main character, he was funny. Overall: if you want to feel good or to enjoy 2hr of your life , then IMO this one should be on your list.",Chef
257,hounds_star,Fractionally less boring than watching paint dry!,1,30 June 2014,"If you like watching endless scenes of food being shopped for, prepped, cooked and served - wrapped up in a trite, stale and so obvious storyline - then you might just enjoy it! But only 'might' mind! Same old storyline of man has access to child with ex wife - who since remarried and divorced again - and through child sharing they get back together and remarry (yawn/barf). Same old storyline of man (in this case a chef), has creative ideas stifled by boss, so eventually quits but then starts from bottom up and makes a huge success. Throw in a sort of nasty ex husband who (at ex wife's behest) provides the wherewithal for the 'fresh start' - but only very meanly - a 'cute' boy who (as always) craves his father's attention having been rather starved of it, a Twitter duel with a food critic, a couple of interesting road scenes, and copious amounts of tweeting - (did Twitter fund this film???) - and you pretty much have the whole picture. There were no saving graces - the comedy was extremely sparse to say the least and what there was was poor. There were no interesting twists or surprises. If you don't fall asleep (or walk out) by the halfway mark, give yourself a gold star for endurance!",Chef

Especially the part where...,3,26 May 2021,"...the white chef becomes successful by selling culturally-appropriated sandwiches made with meat cooked by other people and doesn't credit them. I also liked the director/star's choice to cast a beautiful woman 18 years his junior to play his girlfriend, and her important role in the story of becoming aroused by his cooking skills as she poses sultrily.Ooh, Jon Favreau studied with a professional chef for a couple weeks before filming?! Give me a break. This movie is a full cinematic representation of the Dunning-Kruger effect.3/10 for competent directing and nothing else.",Chef
259,rshyleshnair,Visually tantalizing and pulls at the bonding heart strings,9,8 June 2014,"I loved the premise and was left fulfilled after a feel-good movie. The story focuses on the life of a very passionate chef and his struggles as a man discovering who he is deep down as a father, husband, and above all someone who deeply and profoundly is in love with the art of cooking and creating gastronomic delights. I was surprised that a chef of his caliber and owner of the kitchen and menu domain would be creating a chocolate molten lava cake and very wanna be poser menu items such as an egg caviar etc. to serve LA based foodies. The real gem of the story was Chef as a father and sharing his passion of cooking with his son and discovering his 10-year old's gifts and ethics. A great story for father's day- father and children story. The 10- year old is prodigious as a social networking expert who helps promote Chef's food truck across their nation-wide romp in their bonding tour. John Leguizamo is perfect as the sous-chef side- kick, Sofia Vergara presents herself in a classic, elegant composed yet passion glows from her beautiful eyes. And while I was surprised at how heavy Jon Favreau has become, he doesn't hesitate calling out his own weight-gain in the movie. the music is great and I am forever a fan of Mr. Favreau's writing, direction and acting. He brings his best A-game to this movie as a real dude! loved it. The food preparations and presentations inspires and tantalizes you to really cook and prepare and eat a really good soul felt meal to feed all the senses. With the exception of a few F-bombs and the overt sexually implied food prep scene b/w Scarlett Johansson and Favreau I recommend this as a family movie..",Chef
260,alaskan9,love to do this,8,9 July 2016,just love watching this movie. the idea of driving around America trying all the different foods would be like a dream come true. the film is light hearted and easy to watch. this film brings a dysfunctional family back together and shows the relationship between father and son as well as how technology can change peoples lives. it also goes to show how the children of today are more clued up when it comes to technology than the older generation. this film shows the different types of food that is served all over America and just how gorgeous it can be made to look. the fact that there are so many well known people in this movie goes to show how well like john favreau is. I personally think there could be a follow up to this film,Chef
261,labolts,Don't bother,1,19 October 2014,"I had the unfortunate experience of watching this on a long flight thinking it will help pass the time. It didn't. The movie starts out slightly promising. Great cast, good vibes, and in some cases nicely shot (the food looked incredible).... but like most flops, the film had no soul and terrible script writing. The relationship of the main character to his ex-wife and to their son was confusing at best. Also, the focus on social media in general felt like a promotional campaign for twitter. Clearly the writers barely gave this script a thought. But for whatever reason, it didn't bother the cast. Come on Jon, Scarlet, Robert, are you that desperate for money?Now I can't get my 1+ hour back. Good thing I had my pod-casts handy. Shame on Jon Favreau, I expected more from him. Next time I won't choose a film based on the cast. Lesson learned. If you're looking for feel good movies, it's safer to stick to sitcoms, most movies can't seem to get it right these days anyway",Chef
262,beckegav,After the film you'll crave Cuban sandwiches...,8,1 May 2020,"Whether you like John Favreaus work or not, he gives his all in this movie.This movie is realistic and the characters never felt like they were reading a script, the actors seemed to work off each other naturally with improv.This is also a compelling story, I genuinely cared about the relationship between Carl Casper and his son. This movie is also funnier than I expected, mostly coming from character interactions.And the food... The food in this movie looks gorgeous. It's obviously a big part of the film and the way the food is depicted makes your mouth water. Your going to crave Cuban sandwiches after this movie is over.The few flaws with the movie is some of the pacing of the second half of the movie could be better. And I didn't really care about the Twitter references. I know Chef Casper can be full of himself in the beginning but him not being able to work Twitter was out of place and stupid.Overall, I was impressed with this movie and I would love to see Favreau tackle smaller movies like this. I would be more interesting in that than another Disney product (although the mandalorian is good). The fact that he can juggle direction, script, and a starring role in one movie and making it work well shows how dedicated he really is.",Chef

My rating of 4 stars isn't due to the high-caliber talent nor the fact that it probably wasn't filmed in his mom's basement, but because of my enjoyment of food and its preparation.The greatest potential for story driving drama was between protagonist chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) and (Gordon?) Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) the influential food critic yet even the talented Platt couldn't bring any more passion than a plain peanut butter sandwich on white bread; as for Favreau - I don't know if he has any dramatic chops to begin as for his writing and directing skills ... maybe start with summer stock.",Chef

266,jposhea8888-1978,Much unjust vitriol for this film,7,11 April 2015,"Color me fortunate for I am oblivious and apparently impervious to the hype-machine monster that seemed to crash on everyone's party. Yes, I was snug as a bug under a rock and it resides on the east coast of Florida. I'm hearing anger over it not doing for food what ""Sideways"" did for wine, and J. Favreau was supposed to produce it in the ""Swingers"" vein. There are two veritable gripes that can theoretically hold water: First, without knowing one iota of the plot, or a modicum of the genre, there's merit to having lofty expectations simply due to the star-studded ensemble cast, and by no stretch of the imagination did it deliver or come within light years of ""What Could've Been's"" gravitational tug? Second, the incessant, in-your-face, one and a half hour campaign for Favreau's primary financier and floater Twitter! I have neither the strength nor desire to look into this allegation, but quickly as of today, 4/11/15, Twitter is trading at $51.94. If one was so inclined one good gather a great deal of information on their ""partnership"" merely by reading the ticker tape. If this wasn't a page ripped from his buddy Vince Vaughn's ""Internship"" script and production book, then IDK. I hope this isn't a trend. Two events do not denote a trend, and if there are others reading from this playbook, I hope audience's rebel. These tawdry tricks reek of cheap chances to push product down our throats and at the same time manufacture feeling; it's movie manipulation 101. What's next, subliminally flashing little Twitter birds flying at you in 3D of course?But I digress, I actually found the movie to move at an organic pace, the dialogue wasn't constipated and the cadence allowed for reflection, yet diligently maintained momentum and optimism. This reminds me of an amalgamation, a loose one at that of ""The hundred- foot Journey"" and the poignant adventure of the Irish film ""The Van."" If you could take the best of each and sprinkle in a dash of originality you'd have yourself a recipe for a ""Chef."" At times, the father-son relationship teetered on hokey, but this did in no way deter sentiments for each of their characters. I am a fan of complete disorder and zero resolution movie endings, but I also yearn for the neat little package ending with everything tied off nice and clean topped with a bow. I'm not in the business of ruing endings, so I'll leave the discovery to you. Please note, that I was content. So, without dissecting the minutia of every character and relationship, I'll say that I was pleased when the credits rolled. 57/100",Chef
267,Grjas,Why is this movie so popular?,4,30 January 2015,"This is about as paint by numbers a Hollywood movie as I have seen in a while. The plot summary did seem bizarre- top end chef converts to a food truck- but given the reviews we thought we'd try it. But yes the plot is as bad as the premise.The acting is over the top, the ""jokes"" are fairly predictable and the plot is non-sensical. This seemed to be the year of chef movies and we saw 4 of them. This was by far the worst. I know tastes differ, but I'm not sure what makes this movie popular. May be ugly fat guy gets hot woman? Who knows. I gave up on it well before it ended.",Chef

I think people who have a business and want to setup their own place of food or any business. The message is very positive.The cast was top notch. The particular acting was more than average. Sofia Vergara's role at the end seems to be very likable, because the couple divorced re-marries.Only thing that I would really suggest is that the food be much more healthy. Maybe you can have at least one or two Cuban sandwiches. But you can change the meats and the cheeses for a healthier alternative. Can't deny that the food is good though.",Chef

All the while in a food truck traveling from Miami to L.A.",Chef
270,deadwaxdallas,Fantasies are alright.,8,23 July 2019,"Let's start by saying right off that Chef is a lark. It's about a father reconnecting with his young son and finding his way via a food truck on a roadtrip. If you're looking for something deeper than food , and a bit of heartwarming comedy, keep on moving. The morons writing multiple reviews that the movie is a Twiiter ad are simpletons who can't enjoy a film for what it is. If anything, it's a refreshing look at a chef who is blissfully unaware of social media, his selfishness as a father,
and how it affects his life and livelihood. Mostly, it's a fun, charming and well made flick about food, friends and family. Dig a little deeper. You'll find it rewarding.",Chef
271,jaclyn-144-759583,It's a great start to what could be a great film.,5,16 November 2014,"Eh. Meh. Okay. Sure. I'll always enjoy a movie with Jon Favreau on the screen – either as the main character or complimentary best friend role (The Break-Up comes to mind). He's lovable. You can't help but want to be his friend even when in the middle of a rage or feeling sorry for himself. I just like the guy. And I like the opportunity to support him as an actor / writer / director by buying or renting his movies. I'm a fan through and through of Faverau.But, ugh, I just can't put this movie in the same pile as his other great movies (from independent flicks to Hollywood blockbusters). It just never went deep into the story or the characters. The story  Good. Predictable. Sweet. A little too perfect. The acting  Okay. Y'all wanted to hang out together in amazing food cities and enjoy great food — totally get it (think Couple's Retreat but for foodies — a group of Hollywood folks that found a way to get a studio to pay for a once-in-a-lifetime trip). Would it be better if Vince Vaughn joined at some point? Maybe. Why not?It seems as though this was a very personal movie for Favreau — but he never really ""let us in"". The entire time I felt as though we were minutes if not seconds away from seeing his heart, passion and reason for making the film. It was so close. But it never got there. Is it about love? Kids? Cooking? Standing up for yourself? What? What do you want us to walk away with? I know there is an answer in there somewhere. I searched for the meaning. It just didn't get there.If Jon was my buddy (a girl can dream, right?) I would sit down with him over a delicious meal (cooked by my man Matt of course) and a glass of wine and I would challenge him to cut half of the movie out and give it more passion. I would ask him what he was afraid of doing with the movie and to tackle it head on  instead of relying of Sofia Vergara to smile us through it (she is gorgeous so I understand taking that route!)It's a great start to what could be a great film.Jon – it's just my opinion. I hope we can still be friends. :)",Chef
272,Morpheus911,A Great Father and Son Movie,8,7 September 2014,"I guess some people thought this movie was long and boring. Even some said acting was kind of bad. Well I think the total opposite of this. And I cannot see why anyone would think otherwise. This movie as basic as the plots and story lines were, totally kept my interest. I think it's Jon Favreau's best movie ever. It's a masterpiece. This could be a cult classic for Father's Day, like It's A Wonderful Life is for Christmas. Of course the general sway of Hollywood shun's on a great family life. However Jon Fav didn't give a crap and he decided to celebrate how to celebrate living again. Yeah not much going on but if you don't feel good after watching this then you have a crusty heart and your problems have deep rooted issues. I thought this was probably one of the better movies I have seen all year. Personally. I believe we really - really need more movies like this to remind us about how precious life really is and how to enjoy special moments just eating a real beignet from New Orlean's French Quarter, and in search of the perfect Cuban sandwich recipe, and perfecting the ultimate beef brisket slider. I totally was impressed by this movie for it's full hour and fifty minutes. I loved a great - feel good - movie - - I recommend for any dad and most everyone to see it This will surely restore a sense of how important a support group of family and good friends can be. Great job Jon Favreau! I kind of thought you were like Hollywood stuck up before seeing this movie. Now I know you are a real guy and cool ass family man.",Chef
273,berfedd,"Good, thought-provoking entertainment with some inspirational performances.",7,8 August 2014,"I was expecting a light comedy, but found this to be much more and really enjoyed the movie. It can written off as a 'feel-good' affair, but, so what? It really did leave my wife and myself feeling good about what we'd seen afterwards. If the sign of a good movie is that you see the world slightly differently afterwards, then this is a top bracket affair.Jon Favreau plays Carl Casper, an affable but obsessive chef, whose megalomania brings him into conflict with the owner of the restaurant (Dustin Hoffman) and a scathing food critic (Oliver Platt). Other ingredients in his life are a glamorous ex-wife (Scarlett Johansson) and his 10-year-old son (Emjay Anthony). Ignorant of the world of social media, he vents his fury through Twitter, not realising that this means that the whole world can see the conflict being played out, and his taunts will come back to bite him with a vengeance. The parts where his son is teaching him how to send tweets is great fun, and the observations by various characters on the pleasures and pitfalls of social media ring very true.(*Friends aficionados will remember Favreau as Monica's computer millionaire boyfriend who decided to become an 'Ultimate Fighting Champion' with disastrous consequences. This movie reprises that role to an extent. He even has an agent that bares a strong resemblance to Joey's agent Stella.)There are several well-known names in the movie, but there roles are not overplayed, except, perhaps, in the case of Robert Downey Jr. His character as another ex-husband of Scarlett Johansson is a little too oddball and his Howard Hughes-like eccentricities and relationship with Faverau are never really explained. I think this was a sign of Downey and Favreau being friends from other projects, or maybe a producer's insistence on Downey having significant screen time for publicity reasons. He does raise a few smiles, but thankfully disappears from the screen once his part is played. (Sorry, Mr Downey, but you were a character too far for me.)Great fun are John Leguizamo and Bobby Cannavale as Caspar's long-time work buddies. (Leguizamo is the voice of Sid the sloth in the Ice Age movies, and one sees how much Sid's characteristics fit Leguizamo's personality). I worked as a chef myself many years ago in a high pressure kitchen with a self-obsessed chef, and these characters really hit the mark with their endless crude banter yet perfection-obsessed work ethic. The kitchens one sees in the movie are a little too regimented to be true - just as most hospital dramas omit nurses and care assistants, there is a distinct lack of jobbing chefs and dishwashers in these restaurants - just who is doing the washing up? But it's still close to reality, right down to the restaurant boss having to yell at the head waitress (Sofía Vergara) to get off the phone and back to the bar, and the cuts and scrapes the chefs get from working amongst hot metal, boiling liquids and sharp knives.The movie has a meandering narrative thread, and I was worried that it was losing its way a few times, but on each occasion the pace picked up again and the themes become clear. There's no great climax, and it wraps up a bit twee perhaps, but the passion conveyed and the way Favreau works through his self-created hell is rewarding to watch and even made me feel like taking up a chef's knife again.In short, good, thought-provoking entertainment with some inspirational performances.Keep an eye out for a the out-take at the end of the credits, where Favreau's culinary mentor (Roy Choi, a real chef) is teaching him how to cook a cheese toastie.",Chef
274,BloodGuts,Feel good meal of the summer,7,11 June 2014,"For Starter: A platter of bruschettaChef strolls in like an episode of Masterchef. Displaying a feast of culinary specials and delicatessen that makes your mouth water. Head Chef Carl Casper (Jon Favareau) along with his sous chef Tony (Bobby Cannavale) and next in line, Martin (John Leguizamo) have a success of dishing up the best food in town. Like a plate of food porn it dishes up the best of fine dining and friendly chemistry between the kitchen staff. Unfortunately, this is all at the cost of being an abandoned husband to Inez (Sofia Vergara) and father to son Percy (Emjay Anthony). A great ensemble all lovable with passion for the kitchen and foundations to be built upon. However, an hour in and no further development in either plot nor character sees the crew feel like a drag and with the main meal still to come, the warm up begins to become more of a filler than it needs to be. An extensive cameo from starlet Scarlett Johansson adds little to the plot in addition some of the shopping/cooking scenes could have been omitted to deleted scenes on a DVD package, while the set-up is brilliant, it takes far too long and there's far too much here to digest for the real story to begin. We realised he was a cook and bad father in the first 15 minutes.For Main: Pan Fried Steak with a side of sweet potato fries and honey jusFinally, when Casper loses his job after abusing a food critic over Twitter, the real film begins. A road trip movie which sees Carl, Martin and Percy take the love of food and build their bond. Rich in bromance and the relationship between Carl and Percy gets stronger throughout the journey and realising his sons strengths in the growing world of social media (leading to a hilarious exchange of teaching Carl to use Twitter) by the closing chapter, the fun and passion for food and family will make you want to ditch the popcorn for something rich in flavour. Supported with a side of a soulful soundtrack and the sights and sounds from Miami to New Orleans, this truly is the feel good hit of the summer. Those expecting Iron Man 2.5 can walk away now, sharing cameos (which are unneeded) with a comedic written script, 'Chef' is a blast that can forgive its lengthy beginning in return for a tasty dish best served to an audience in need of a smile.For Dessert: Popping Candy Ice Cream with Lemon TartClosing out with a brief fast forward of the after effects feels rushed and frankly unrequired as the journey tells a thousand words but one thing Favareau has achieved with 'Chef' is a lovable trio on an adventure that stretches neither budget nor fiction (well, perhaps from being unemployed and paying thousands on a kitchen). Overall, this has the ingredients for a superb dish but some portions could have been smaller than others and inside is a raw tale of companionship and passion all with a gooey centre that serves a great slice of summer.",Chef

It's not award caliber and I think everybody knew this before signing on. They took this concept for what it was and made it into the best that it could be. It's a simple story of family and passion, and it was executed perfectly.I think this is a good movie to watch if you want to blow a few hours out of your day. It's not great, but it is good enough in what its trying to do to allow me to really get into it. I found myself smiling throughout the movie and really enjoyed it.

276,briancseel,Solid Story Idea But Flawed Execution,4,23 February 2015,"On the surface, Chef seems to be a movie set-up for success. The story follows a successful formula. Chef loses family and creative soul working for someone else. He's not happy and he melts down. In trying to bounce back he finds what really makes him happy, cooking good food, and it allows him to reconnect with his son and eventually with his wife. Add to that story an outstanding cast (as Mr. Favreau is obviously well liked in Hollywood) featuring Mr. Favreau, John Leguizamo, Dustin Hoffman, Sofia Vergara, Scarlett Johansson, Oliver Platt, and a great cameo by Robert Downey, Jr. Solid, likable story, good cast, sounds like the formula for a breakout hit right?Unfortunately Chef goes wrong almost from the beginning. The first act setting up Chef Carl's fall is entirely too long and seems to muddy what the movie is about. A movie about a Chef and food suddenly gets twisted into a commentary on social media and seems to be a vehicle for Mr. Favreau to air his own grievances at critics. We are also introduced to Ms. Vergara who seems to not be playing an actual character but rather a vague version of herself. She shows up for brief, 1 minute scenes, dressed in the bright, flowing dresses that she has become known for, appearing in front of a large house that might well be hers, and delivering her lines flatly.Then, oddly enough, despite the fact that her character is quite wealthy from a prior marriage, as Carl falls and is unable to get a job, she does not, or has she ever bankrolled his restaurant adventures. But moving on from Act I, Carl begins his path to redemption with a food truck in Miami and by exploring the radical idea of selling Cuban food in Los Angeles. Fortunately the movie doesn't try to sell us the implausible by making the idea of selling Cuban food in the nation's 2nd largest city out to be some kind of Quixotic quest.Soon enough Carl is reconnecting with his son and hitting the road. Unfortunately, what should be the heart of the movie, a story of a father and a son bonding is crudely executed. Offering a 10 year- old beer and swearing in front of him are not heartwarming ways to bond with one's child. They are cringe worthy more than anything.But we plod along until the conclusion in Los Angeles where Carl's one time rival food critic has decided to back a restaurant venture where he can do his own thing. Then magically as the closing credits roll we find Carl having remarried his ex-wife, with whom we saw no evidence of reconciliation, nor did we understand really at all why they divorced in the first place.Mr. Favreau is a talented director, he has a lot of friends in Hollywood, and screen writing his hard. Perhaps in future films he can better fulfill the potential that was here in this film.",Chef

However, the real incredible work comes from Favreau and Emjay Anthony, who plays his son in the film.Favreau has a way of creating incredible dialouge that offers both depth and humor at the same time, creating a sense of trust with the audience. This movie made me laugh a lot but it also allowed me to dig deeper into these characters as the film progressed. I loved the simplicity of the story that also allowed it to actually be quite powerful in the end.If you continue to follow what you love with who you love, you will be able to acheieve real success in your life.

Eventually i became familiar to cook and different cuisines. Surprisingly this obligation has also some advantages. Thanks to my wife i didn't miss two movies of 2014 with stories based on cooking, chefs and food industry.Chef is not telling only a story of cooking but tells the challenge of a successful chef in social media and its huge effect which design our new world. And for them who knows this impact well, it is not a bad choice. To see bottom in a second or being in the center of all attention is mostly not related with how you are performing your work but how you are using internet tools. With social media, dedicating yourself to your dream or even dreaming bigger is not scary as it used to be. We all are sharing things on internet with a significant purpose. I will not start writing an essay about our instincts which pushes us to leave a trace for humanity or being noticed by others. But we all know that these are much easier than how it was in the history. Though it is easier for everyone, so we still need to be better than others while we can push our fears.I need to talk about movie little bit, right? But what makes a movie good is how it tells itself to us right and how much it makes us talk about the main idea besides acting, directing, music etc. Still I should add something about this movie which is special for me.

Leave aside everything else, this is an entertaining, clever, feel good movie that draws you in from the start and takes you along for an enjoyable ride of redemption. Chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) is, or rather was, the next big thing in the kitchen, an exciting up and coming young chef, an unknown Miami chef able to be creative and daring in his own demesne. 10 years on and commercialism has taken its toll. Tied to an upmarket LA restaurant, as an employee of Riva (Dustin Hoffman), an erratic and unimaginative owner, Carl is not the man he once was with Riva continually putting him down in front of his staff and usurping control of the creativity (or lack thereof) on the menu that clearly hasn't changed in years. Unhappy, unfulfilled in his job, divorced from glamorous well to do wife Inez (Sofia Vergara, Modern Family), we see Carl struggling to both pour his heart into his work, proving to himself he still has what it takes to be ""Chef"" while trying, and failing, to be a dad to his 10 year old son Percy (Emjay Anthony) whom he clearly loves but guiltily feels he has let down by failing to be the husband and father he wanted to be and so avoids time with. Savaged by a critical food review at the hands of Ramsey Michel (the ever talented Oliver Platt), Carl retaliates via Twitter and social media but what he thought was private was anything but and amidst a war of words with his critic, Carl loses the plot and storms out of his job with his parting rant videoed and sent viral, condemning him as too hot to handle for any future employers. Favreau does well to establish his character - we like Carl, we feel for him, we empathise with his plight of juggling career and fatherhood roles. There is a strong group of equally likable characters around him in the restaurant all of whom attest to a better Carl that existed before the weight of the world upon his shoulders brought him down. Not least of all in this mix is the pot smoking, food junkie restaurant hostess Molly (Scarlett Johannson) with whom Carl seems to share more than just the odd smoke on occasion. Forced to look at new ways to pursue his career and maneuvered by ex wife Inez, Carl takes up a food-truck while visiting Miami and taking help from Inez' ex-ex-husband, Robert Downey Jr. who plays his small part wonderfully erratically. And now the passion begins to return. Joined by his former kitchen hand Martin (John Leguizamo) and his son Percy, Carl and Co take the food truck cross-country back to LA. Percy hits Twitter (who must have sponsored the movie!) with their journey, playing on his father's earlier notoriety and suddenly the El Jefe food van is a coast-to-coast sensation with their Cuban sandwiches, sliders et al. En route to LA, Carl is reinvigorated both as ""Chef"" and as a father sharing life and times with his son and clearly returns to the man he once was, as can be seen through the returning chemistry with Inez. The movie has a great cast, all appearing with small but pivotal roles, playing their part in the rebirth of our protagonist and you just can't help but will it along. On the way there are shots are how harsh, if not selfish, some critics can be, sometimes dismissing the fact that those they set their sights upon are really just hard working men and women who take those reviews to heart and suffer from them. There was almost an expectation that things must go wrong somewhere towards the end, that there must be a doom still to come but clearly this was never the plot's intent as it races through to the 'happily ever afters' back in LA, all the while accompanied by a funky Cuban/Latino beat score that just adds to the vigour and power and life being restored back into Carl. Don't think this is a schmaltzy life is all roses type of affair as it's not. The script is intelligent and so is the acting. The relationships built up are convincing and realistic, swinging through a range of emotions, mistakes and apologies and attempts to do better clearly showing none of us are perfect but when we live out our passions we are all the better for it. The other side effect of this movie – other than the feel good factor – HUNGER! Gastronomical delights abound throughout the movie so maybe one to catch on an earlier showing and then hit the restaurant afterwards! Enjoy.",Chef

285,carlosarango-980-744058,Movie for a perfect peaceful Saturday evening,8,13 October 2015,"This is a movie in need of some instructions before watching it. First, you gotta be hungry so watch it after leaving work of during the weekend 6 hours after brunch. Second, don't be angry if Robert Downy Jr doesn't fly in his armored suit. Downy, Hoffman, Scarlett and even Sofía are just decorations... but wisely used. Their roles aren't superfluous, they add a special mood in which the movie evolves and you notice that folks around you enjoy their presence. Third... you better be near a supermarket cause 8 out of 10 viewers will head home thinking if they have the ingredients needed to prepare the melted cheese sandwich at home. Ahh, if you missed it and its on Netflix, call your friends and have everything on hand like a good Cabernet, your favorite cheese, olives and enjoy. And Fourth... if you are having trouble communicating with your teenage son, watch it together, it might open a line, try it!",Chef

287,is24,it is a great fun ...,10,4 May 2014,"exactly what it was for me watching the movie ""Chef"" tonight. This movie is not about a plot. It is about authenticity and I got that away from it. It is one of those small movies that connects you back to reality. Jon obviously made a passion project. It felt like he really enjoyed playing this down and out character since he is so believable as a chef. Some expected scenes do not diminish the fact that this movie is upbeat and inspiring!Well Jon, I did not wait for the selfie with you this evening, as the line was too long. I do hope, however, you come up with a cookbook! I would love to buy it.",Chef
288,ronaldo-rivera03,Wasn't what I expected,8,13 May 2014,"Was expecting to watch a glorified and overly dramatized version of a reality cooking show before seeing this but I was gladly mistaken. Movie focused on the Chef, the emotions, the challenges and the insecurities he goes through and not the food. It showed a very humanized version of a celebrity chef and the storyline was feel-good and sometimes touching. Jon Favreau is a great actor and director, I like that he can explore different genres and do a great job at it.Dialogue is great with just the right amount of funny to not degrade the more serious emotional tones of the script. Was also refreshing a more toned-down Sofia Vergara (comparing to her Modern Family character), Downey's brief scene was quite funny though I thought there wasn't enough in ScarJo's character's background to establish a real connection with the Chef.Overall I'd recommend it even if you don't like cooking or cooking shows.",Chef
289,ajeshjag,Keeps you engaged without doing anything extraordinary,7,23 December 2014,"A feel good movie to watch with family. Does Have some clichéd moments but you hardly notice them due good acting and direction. The role of the Chef's (Carl Casper- Jon Favreau) son Percy played by Emjay Anthony is written and acted well. He balances the old fashioned chef and serves as the character most from the present generation can easily connect to.The cameo from Robert Downey Jr provides a good fun moment. Dustin Hoffman does his role to perfection making sure you hate his character in the little screen time he got. The film did feel rushed into a clichéd climax in the end, especially after the good second act. Definitely worth watching once.",Chef

I know it's a late review but I cannot stop myself, here it goes:Rarely do movies inspire you and Chef is one such movie. The complicated father-son relationship is beautifully shown, the struggle between the chef and his creativity and how he manages to break out of the commercial cycle to stand on his own feet is splendid. Jon Favreau has done an amazing job both as an actor and as the director. Emjay Anthony did a great job. The cinematography, locations were perfect and the food- My God! The chefs have done an awesome job! This movie inspires me to dream, travel, love and most of all it makes me passionate towards my goals, ambitions and loved ones. I can watch this for thousand times and still enjoy it. Hell, I'm giving this movie a 10 rating.On a side note- after watching this movie, you'll definitely get hungry... lots of food porn.",Chef

293,efi_de,"""Bon appetit""",10,3 July 2014,"Having just returned from yet another screening at the current Munich Film Festival - I think I just found my favorite movie for 2014: ""Chef"", written and directed by and starring Jon Favreau, who acted in Sean's ""The Big Empty"" in 2003, and was also one of its producers (""Coriolanus"" with Tom Hiddleston does not count, as it is a filmed theater production!). On this culinary self-discovery journey through America he is joined by his friends from the world of ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers"", Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr., as well as Dustin Hoffman, John Leguizamo, Sofía Vergara, Oliver Platt and Emjay Anthony as Percy, the 10-year-old son of award winning chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau), who loses his job in a posh restaurant, but with the help of a friend and his son discovers again his love for cooking, for life and for his ex-wife. And along the way his son teaches him (and the inclined audience) the wonders of social media. The programmer of the Film Festival introduced the movie with the words ""If there were Michelin stars for movies, this one would be at the very top of the list,"" and wished us ""Bon appetit!"" There was much laughter, some food for thought (no pun intended), and plenty of applause during and stormy applause after the film. The music is also great and you should remain in your seats until the end of the end credits! I couldn't find a German release date so far, but if you can get ""Chef"" in your part of the world – go and see it – you won't regret it!",Chef
294,paul-psr-ryder,Lovable story telling,9,12 August 2014,"Beautifully heart warming family movie. The movie was obviously written by a foodie, (somebody passionate about food), which is great. The movie allows you to fall in love with the main character as it runs through his life as a hard working head chef in an established restaurant. It shows what his creative aspirations are, and what kind of impact it has on his everyday life. There are a few insightful things which anybody who may be interested in becoming a chef may find informative..The movie itself has great cinematography, a good wholesome cast and leaves the watcher feeling filled with love, as well as an appetite, so, don't watch this on an empty stomach... Great movie",Chef

296,infernalaffairs1980,Serving up a brilliant movie,9,8 June 2014,"Director - Jon Favreau Starring - Jon Favreau, John Leguizamo, Sofia Vergara Jon Favreau is a man whose work is more well known than his face. Pete Becker? Happy Hogan? Maybe this is because he has spent the past few years behind the camera, helping to create the Iron Man franchise. In his latest film he pulls triple duty; writing, directing and starring.Chef is a dramedy which tells the tale of Favreau's Carl Casper, a talented chef who, following an incident involving a food critic, lava cake and the internet, takes his talents on the road in a food truck. The film then shows how this affects his relationship with his son and ex wife (the beautiful Sofia Vergara).Some people may be attracted to the prospect of an Iron Man reunion with the inclusion of Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson. However neither actor is in the film for very long, although R.D.J's short turn is utterly hilarious.Instead the film is at its best when we see the relationship Carl shares with his son Percy (Emjay Anthony) and best friend Martin, (John Leguizamo), as they journey across America in their truck. All three actors are wonderful; their scenes are sparky yet natural.Do not see this film on an empty stomach. Food is lovingly shot and used to great effect. Meats, spices, fruit, sweets and so on, are given screen time most actors would kill for.Music is also used creatively with a special guest appearance by Gary Clark Jr. and a brass band version of Marvin Gaye's Sexual Healing; it shouldn't work but somehow, it does. The music adds to each scene without detracting from the action on screen.The film uses social networking, such as Twitter, as a convincing plot device; from the downfall of Carl to his rapid resurrection and beyond. The audience is reminded how the internet can affect a person's life (maybe a little shot at critics everywhere).This film was nice. That isn't an insult; it was a genuine pleasure to watch a film that was funny without being embarrassing or gross out. The cast were superb and all looked like they were genuinely having a good time together. I left the cinema feeling happy without having been overwhelmed by action. I would thoroughly recommend this film to cheer up the most miserable soul.",Chef
297,vijayprasanna2896,this film serves your entertainment with an open heart and warm smile,7,20 March 2015,"One thing I immediately noticed about this film is it has an air of light heartedness in it from the very beginning. I personally felt that Jon Favreau had spilled his own holed up desires about how food can bring happiness in a life of a chef through this movie. Yes , this is a movie about happiness and if you are expecting some twisted plot endings or some unexpected tragedy to occur in Jon Favreau's sandwich selling rampage, you are going home with a disappointed heart and stomach. For I believe that this is his ' vacation' in film making and I also believe whatever his interests and ideas that were in this film , it surely had me roped in for its entire run time. Its a chef's rags to riches,self discovery story plus a fairy tale ending. All the performances in this movie is equally good and it was a well chosen cast. But still the screen presence of Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johansson was disturbingly short and I guess the movie might have done better without them. They come into the movie to pull out for a minute and remind you that Jon Favreau is the director of Iron Man and then suddenly place you back in the shoes of a poor and misunderstood chef played by Jon Favreau? But then despite this small 'glitch', Jon Favreau did an awesome role as a chef who cooks with passion but seriously misunderstood by his boss and at the same time by his kid. The chemistry between him and his son ,being a little cheesy (sorry for the food reference) at time, manages to strike a few emotional peaks like the time when they sit on the top a van , listening to music and talk about parting ways and also, the time when Jon Favreau lectures about his passion food.to make his son understand the wrong in serving a burnt sandwich. Some people may feel a little sensitive about underage drinking, little kids burning their fingers off and putting cornstarch on his balls but then again, this movie is light hearted as I mentioned. Thinking about wasted talents, poor script, and whining about a sound plot will totally ruin your experience. So just back and embrace the feeling of happiness and the beauty of food and relationship take over you while watching the movie. Trust me this is the only way to appreciate it.",Chef
298,mfiguero,Loved this light hearted and tender movie,8,27 August 2014,"Just wanted to take a couple of minutes to review the movie. First, some disclosure, I cook a lot and I'm overweight also, so just miss the hoy Cuban wife to really see myself in the main character. Watching the characters cook and bonding in a kitchen being happy for making other happy through beautiful and tasty food is totally right. You have to experience it to understand how well depicted the feeling is. Working a kitchen, hot, quick and in perfect synchronization is heartwarming experience that I can relate to. The Cuban music is just another expression of the passion the characters feel and the love they share. As for the lack of a real conflict or big break through is just as things happen in reality. People who can start doing what they love again, just start enjoying and loving others. Really simple and beautiful to watch. Also liked the wise, beyond his years, son character and the Sofía Vergara's one. Besides being pretty, she can convey the true love she feels for both (father and son). It's not a bad thing that there are no bad characters. Artificial conflict just to make plot move is not necessary when simply living and growing does the trick.",Chef
299,aunggebi,Decent Hollywood family movie.,7,12 February 2015,"In Hollywood there always have been movies based on the philosophy of family. These movies simply say that family is the most important thing in the world. In the movies, there comes the guy who didn't realize the value of family. After some events he realize how important his family is, and he started again with his family.In this movie, as you know the guy is a chef in nice restaurant. He already broke up with his wife, and his only relationship with his son is also in jeopardy. Anyway like other movies, he started his own food truck business with his son and suddenly, everything goes really really well.But the reason I can give 7 stars out of 10 is that it is not boring at all. From the beginning, we all know how the story goes, but with that traditional story, it still made good movie. Secret in the movie is in the characters. All the characters are lovely and funny. At some point of view, it is kind of character show.It is recommendable for almost everyone. I cannot say it is great movie, but it is definitely adorable family-movie.",Chef
300,ysamat,Very promising sparks but trails out - And did Twitter bankroll it?,7,22 June 2014,"I didn't know what to expect when i went to see the film. Had not read the reviews and was pleasantly surprised by the energetic start. In the role of Carl Casper, John Favreau performs believably in the midst of an existential crises... torn between his passion, the restaurant, his ex- wife, his work colleague - Scarlett Johansson :-) and his son (Emjay Anthony in a good performance.)The first half rushes quickly and you get all set to see him moving mountains during the second half. This is where my knives are out (contextually :-P) The movie trails out. Its almost as if the write (Favreau) lost interest in the plot halfway and decides to self-dissolve the film into a mushy, self-indulgent emotional flat-line. Not even a roller-coaster. The food critic in the movie got it right. Favreau, as story writer plays too safe in the second half. This film would have been Oscar worthy if there was some risk taken with the story during the second half. But hey, everyone loves tame, happy endings. NO. Everyone needs to be left with a tantalizing sense of wistfulness and this story fails to deliver there.Many bright sparks makes the movie noteworthy. First, the food porn is awesome. Don't see the food hungry. Then, the characters are interesting and varied. Favreau is great, so also Emjay, Leguizamo and then there is Robert Downey Jr. One of the funniest 3-minute conversations ever on cinema happens in this film. And it blindsides you like being punched unawares. Simply hilarious. Then there are pretty scenes of some great American cities. All in all, this film had the potential of a 9/10 but you'v just read it. Maybe they should rework the 2nd half and then go for the Oscar. Scarlett Johannson is wasted. And BTW did Twitter bankroll it?",Chef
301,leifthor-1,A 10 movie if not for a few script flaws *spoiler alert,7,8 February 2015,"For anyone who's left a bad review, if you had any idea how hard it is to make a great movie, you might have written differently. Any one part done poorly can ruin what might be a 10 movie. Bad sound, one or two characters poorly acted, all it takes is one shortcoming and a movie can fall flat, or far more flat if that one thing had been as great as everything else the team had put together. I'd like to offer what I thought great in the film, and then offer what I felt could have made this movie a 10. I felt the acting was great. Each character was played as best as any actor could have played their part given their lines they were given.Cinematography was tip top, and I spent most of the film wanting to jump in and eat some of the amazing food the footage and build up generated. So to every one of the team save 1, I'd give this film a 10.Where the film fell short, and where it fell short, it seriously fell off an opportunity cliff was in the script. It's a given you could have everything else in a movie production succeed 100%, but if the script isn't there, the movie will get reviewed poorly. And the script itself for Chef was a fantastic script for so very much of it.I say opportunity cliff though because where many bad reviewers point out the flaws within the script, those minor flaws could have been turned in to the movie's highlights, and perhaps as viewers we were waiting for them to come out, but just never seeing them, felt ripped off a bit by the end of the film. The gorgeous wife with overweight main character was unbelievable, and yes it was, and it was glaring. What could have made her character work though was just a minor tweak around food. If she was normal in every way except her addiction to good food, especially his food, like she hated him as a person, but was addicted to his cooking, and her struggle, could have been some great comic material. The son, who's character was too one dimensional, if he expressed a passion for social networking in ways that sounded like eating great food, thus like father to son transferring his passion but to a different venue, could have been a good struggle between father and son father wanting him to be a cook instead. If the making of the van had been realistic at all, and specifically when John Leguizamo takes the van to his friend to get it painted, the van should have come back looking like a dragon or something ridiculous spurring comic opportunity dialog, another missed opportunity. And lastly, in the ending, had the reviewer had the same addition to his cooking as his wife had shown earlier, that could have been a fun plot ending, while weaving a more realistic film. Oh one last script flaw that no one seems to have mentioned which to me was unforgivable, was this amazing chef who loves to create new amazing things finding happiness in making Cuban sandwiches over and over was so unbelievable, I was insulted. Especially since again even that could have been turned in to an incredible asset to the film if he hated making the same thing over and over but loved the freedom and his son, thus allowing in the end after their road trip to want to cook in a restaurant again. So if the characters had been given more internal comical struggles, this film could have been an American Beauty, and almost was. How the producers allowed the script as is without tweaking it to the 10 area, is a mystery, for the script's shortcomings were few but they were glaring, and the film was great except it's lack of genuine comic material.Now if you'll excuse this budding hope to be some day screen writer, I need to find some great food to feed what this great film completely succeeded in, making me hungry for awesome food!",Chef

To begin with, it is motivational and optimistic and teaches you that if you work hard you will achieve everything you want in your life, as long as you want it with all your heart. It has a good sense of humor, too. I loved the soundtrack as well as the music in the whole film, it travels you to the places they travel too. What they cook and they taste can also help you travel. Finally, it is a very entertaining film and I would recommend this to everybody.p.s. It would be better to watch it after you have enjoyed a really good meal because it is such a delicious film. haha",Chef
305,cronindaniel,A deliciously directed and criminally underrated film,9,1 August 2016,"Before I get into this review I must first ask you a few questions. Do you like food? Of course. But do you love food? Do you truly believe that if food didn't exist then there would be no place left for you on earth? I bet many of you said no. But if there is one person I can name that would answer yes to that question, it is Chef Carl Casper, the main protagonist to a film called Chef, directed by, written by, and starring Jon Favreau.As you already know from the summary the big standout in Chef is it's masterful directing, particularly during the cooking scenes. The first time I watched this I made the terrible mistake of not eating beforehand, and it got to the point where I had to pause the movie, go make a sandwich and come back. Jon Favreau has quite a few directing credits to his name, notably the first two Iron Man films, Elf, and the recent live action remake of The Jungle Book, but it is mainly for this movie that I will continue to consider Favreau as one of the best directors currently working in Hollywood, because I could not pick out a single bad shot in this movie and every other shot was as close to perfect as it could be. You could really tell that Favreau spent as much time behind the camera as he did on it, if not possibly more.The acting is another big credit to give this movie as the whole star- studded cast, including Sofia Vergara, Dustin Hoffman, Scarlet Johansson, and Robert Downey Jr., all do great jobs in their roles. Even an actor who is generally considered less talented, John Leguizamo, gave a great performance, and I love it when I can say confidently that a child actor does a good job, as Emjay Anthony, who plays the titular Chef's son, Percy. Anthony did a great job in the role and has a hopeful career ahead of him. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the film's star, Jon Favreau, who absolutely nails the role of Chef Carl Casper, making it impossible to imagine anybody else in the part.While Chef starts off slow, which is the only reason I didn't give it a 10/10, it really shines in the third act, which I will not spoil. But honestly, Chef is a surprisingly touching family movie, and as long as you think your kid is old and mature enough to handle to the more mature subject matters and language (bear in mind this is still an R rated film after all) I highly recommend watching it with your child. While the film is a comedy, and there are quite a few chuckle-worthy moments, nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud, though this never really bothered me, I still think it's worth mentioning. If you're looking for a side-splitting comedy you won't find it here, but if you're looking for a nice, feel-good movie with a few giggles here and there, then this is the movie for you.Overall, Chef is a really great, criminally underrated, mouth-watering film that you can enjoy with your more mature children.The End",Chef

308,toddeverett,"Terrific, with one technical reservation",9,2 June 2014,"One the whole, I really enjoyed ""Chefs"": story, casting, direction, locations, and the music. One problem, which probably won't bother most casual viewers of the film: the action begins when a powerful reviewer/blogger tears the chef's cooking apart. Fair enough: foodies are a fickle lot, and it's possible that a negative review could hurt business; it would certainly hurt the subject's feelings.But this isn't how legitimate food reviewers (or restaurants) work: while they may be familiar faces (some real restaurants post photos of reviewers for staff to see), they don't announce their visits long enough in advance to pack the restaurant with the staff's friends.Also, unless the menu is table d'hôte, not everybody in the restaurant is eating the same meal, and the reviewer would order any damned thing he or she chooses to.This would have been easy enough to work around with the same end effect, but it's nothing to get really worked up about. And that food -- even stuff I wouldn't eat in real life -- sure looks delicious.",Chef
309,jan-tromp,Childish movie,3,15 September 2014,This is one of the worst movies I've seen lately. When you read the storyline and expect some more then you will be disappointed. That's all there is. A Chef that starts a food truck. I did not fall asleep because of the nice Cuban music.The story is weak (where does all the food come from and where is it stored etc etc etc. The actors are not even bad. The colors of the shots are nice. The music is nice. The movie can be cut till 10 minutes. I would have preferred that.I suppose the movie can be used for a tutorial on editing. I have not yet looked how much money it brought but it can't be much.,Chef
310,zionnoizrecords,Easily the best feel-good comedy in recent memory,10,26 February 2015,"It baffles me when people critique a simple, original movie as if it were pretending to be some epic tale of the human condition. The thing is that 'Chef' is exactly that and more, and not once does it pretend to be anything but a story about a man, his job, and his family.The Chef is by far Favreau's most believable role to date. You can't help but share is joy and passion for making people happy by making them delicious food. The rest of the all-star cast give great performances as well, especially Leguizamo. It is all too rare for a light-hearted comedy to deliver on both sentimental and comedic planes, this movie delivers both in spades. One minute you're laughing at the most simple and realistic banter between a son and father, or between a Chef and his trusted right-hand man, and the next minute you're being brought to tears by the love of a father for his son.I can't give this movie enough stars. It is true to life without being cynical, it is fun without being cheesy or pandering, and it is as satisfying as I imagine all of the delicious food, which played a starring role itself, tasted to the characters on screen.10/10, I really hope Favreau makes many more movies like this one.",Chef

Words cannot explain how much I loved watching this movie and how many times I will watch it again. It is hard to get too in depth without spoiling anything but the plot flows smoothly and the roles were fulfilled with the right actors. I could not have asked for a better movie to watch with friends and/or in my alone time.,Chef
313,winterfog2,"Love this film, Jon Favreau up close and personal",9,20 August 2016,"Chef is a fairly realistic look at the world of high-end restaurants and high-stress chefs. The early scenes in the restaurant show the gritty and often painful life of chefs and line cooks. Dustin Hoffman as the owner of the restaurant is a nice touch. Robert Downey, Jr. as the ex-husband was his usual, manic self, but fun. Sofia Vergara as the ex- wife is an interesting choice, but the scenes in little Havana really give the feel of being there. The sub-plot of his relationship with his son is the icing on the cake. This kid is a scene-stealer, and will break your heart. The Twitter feeds were well-done, and the Miami scenes with the cop were so funny! I highly recommend this movie - it's funny, touching, angry, happy, and hungry! Don't watch this while you're hungry. Food porn at its finest!",Chef
314,javierchaconcastro,Excellent!!,9,7 March 2020,"Masterpiece, the music, the combination of Miami life style and urban, typical and conventional living, make you feel like you know the places where they go and you can almost taste the food (and that's what the movie is about)... make you feel hungry and make you feel like going straight to the kitchen and try to cook something...
must Watch!!",Chef
315,jaygorto,Great film about what is important in life,9,24 November 2018,I love Favreau and I love leguizamo and Canavale so I had to watch. I was very much surprised by the authenticity and story. Great film about spending time with your kids and close friends and family. Great story about second chances and doing what you love. I also love to cook for family and friends and loved the Gary Clark jr cameo too.,Chef
316,sunky14,lovely watch,8,23 February 2015,"It's not always you watch a movie that talks about food, emotions and family in the same phase. So, when you find such a classic combination, its better not to lose out on such stuff!! The movie is one made with a good sincere heart and it can be easily felt. Its a feel good movie and there is nothing to dislike here!! The movie started with a pretty good plot, chef and owner having different views. Chef wanting to please people with his culinary skills . The movie also showcased some lovely insights into relationship between a divorced dad and his son and how spending time actually helped them mending their lives and got them to actually know each other.",Chef
317,dvpumas-612-687454,"Pro Meat, Pro Fat, Pro Sugar, Pro Cigarettes, Sponsored by Twitter but genuine and really funny",7,27 June 2014,"First, if the sight of raw meat and dead animals makes you sick, don't bother watching it. I'm myself not a big meat eater but I must confess this movie was mouth-watering.The script is simple and predictable but entertaining. It tells the struggle of a famous chef, Carl Casper (John Favreau), who cannot fully express his talents in the kitchen as the restaurant owner (Dustin Hoffman) prefers not to take any risks and stick to the same old menu that seems to please his customers. Carl Casper will embark on a new adventure where you will enjoy the dynamics between his character and his son (Emjay Anthony), former partner (Sofia Vergara) and best friend (John Leguizamo). The acting is top notch and Robert Downey Jr deserved some praise for his short but top quality appearance.This is a laid back feel good movie so do not expect a lot suspense that would keep you on the edge of your seat. A nice 1 hour and 54 min movie to enjoy in the summer with a relaxed mentality.Finally, the soundtrack is very enjoyable and varied, and the directing is great making you want to visit some of the cities the main characters go through.The only thing I'd recommend is not to go in the cinema with an empty belly of feeling too full!PS: Stay until the end as there is a behind the scene footage",Chef

320,pace-26-206457,The only people voting on this film must have invested interests.,1,20 August 2014,"No story, bad acting, about as interesting as watching paint dry on a prison fence. What on earth were people thinking by voting on this. You may as well go outside and give your money away.One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time...The story is just so very dull all the way through the movie, you just keep waiting and waiting for something, ANYTHING, to happen. Finally the only part that actually got me excited and jumping with joy, the credits. This movie really goes to show how the media industry is filled with manipulation and propaganda.Its easy to see how a centralized media monopoly is controlling the visual vomit, stuffing it into the heads of people and making them pay for the privilege. What next, a film of grass growing with a star rating of 10.",Chef
321,davidph252,Terrible movie - don't trust the high rating,1,18 July 2021,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Luckily for me I streamed it so could quickly skip large sections of the latter parts. It starts off ok but just goes rapidly downhill from there. The acting is pretty poor, the characters are shallow and seem to have little regard for each other in any meaningful way. Probably the worst thing about it is that it's just totally uninteresting.",Chef
322,us_2,Good Average Movie,5,5 February 2015,"Plays more like a documentary, than a movie. All of the characters and dialogue seemed realistic, especially the restaurant owner (Dustin Hoffman) where anyone who has to deal with a hard-headed, stubborn boss will relate.The Chef (Jon Favreau) is obsessive in his culinary skills, and those who love to cook will completely understand this movie. If you're not so much into cooking, then the relationship with his son (Emjay Anthony) and ex-wife (Sofia Vergara) may draw you in. Or, maybe his loyal friend (John Leguizamo) or the rooting for the underdog vibe.Overall, it was a nice, average movie. Good family movie, if it shows on broadcast TV. Not sure why they made it rated R. Nothing too edgy in it, besides swearing. Chef did play a little too dumb on the social media thing. This would have made a perfect Disney movie with the cliché happy ending. Loved the Cuban music!",Chef
323,zermy,GREAT MOVIE,10,5 January 2021,"Absolutely a great movie. Great story line, great acting, and plenty of famous actors all contributing to an awesome film!",Chef
324,leamca,I didn't want to fall in love with this film,10,31 December 2020,"But I did. It rather sneaks up on you as you realize it's like a real-life chef and the reason is due to Favreau's attention to detail and coaching from chef Roy Choi, who joins him later in The Chef Show (which I'm also hooked on, while I'm again watching Chef right now). This movie is golden, I love all the characters especially John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara. Favreau brought out an excellent nuanced performance from her that is a refreshing change from her Modern Family character.",Chef
325,jafdip,"Started well, finished badly",3,10 December 2014,"This starts out as fast moving clever film about a chef whose creativity is stifled by a dictatorial and delusional boss. After a bad review he gets into a conflict with the critic that goes viral, quits his job and sets out to rebuild his life and career. So far so good. But at about this point it is as though a different writer took over. The film loses its momentum and becomes bogged down in a long and tedious study of the relationships between our chef and his son and ex wife. I know it is sexist to use the expression 'chick flick' but it seems most apt for this rather boring examination of feelings and emotions.",Chef
326,ernorman,Solid But Directionless,7,11 August 2014,"Overall a solid film, surely worthy of a watch. Fairly predictable along the way with a cast of well known actors, Chef is the story of middle-aged chef who is stifled creatively at work and doesn't get to spend as much time with his son as he'd like. After having a meltdown due to a bad review, He ends up running a food truck he takes from Miami across country back home to Southern California. This allows him to grow closer to his son while also being able to express himself more creatively in his work, bringing him closer to his family and experiencing a happiness he had been searching for.However, the film did seem to lack some direction and trudges on rather slowly. It didn't seem to want to commit to the bonding with the family narrative, the redemption of a fallen chef story, or the cross country travel mischief, leaving me feeling slightly empty about each of the under-explored and underdeveloped themes presented. My other main complaint with the film is the overuse of Twitter. At times, it felt like I was watching the longest commercial I'd ever seen.",Chef
327,Xnerdz,Decent movie,7,30 July 2018,"Obviously, I'm a little late to the party on this movie, I just never heard of it before watching Binging with Babish on youtube make a bunch of recipes from it. I decided to give it a go after I saw his episode with Jon himself invited on the show.The movie's got a ""decent"" scenario, it's just a little boring.Coming in, I expected they'd focus more on the food, since it is supposed to be centered around a great Chef. Instead, they focused heavily on the relation between the father and son. Which is not a bad thing in and on its own! ...but a bit typical. I just think it misses a lot of opportunities in a lot of scenes where they could've expended way more on the great dish they presented and the recipes... but all we got was a more or less vague explanation as to how the ""lava cake"" was made.Where this movie shines and it REALLY shines is in the execution of the dialogues. All the actors are great, especially Jon Favreau and the kid. I don't think I've ever seen a play as convincing as in this movie, where the dialogues felt so real, as if they were not scripted at all but genuine and honest. Favreau had a real vision for this movie and he has a great talent for putting it into words and action. So yeah, I really loved the interactions in this movie.Overall, a small yet very interesting emotional ride.",Chef
328,manostheodosis,Yum.,8,8 September 2014,"Chef is the story of a chef (would you guess?) working at restaurant where he's not allowed to make any decisions regarding the menu. Things go bad when he gets reviewed by the same reviewer that called him a ""culinary prodigy"" years back, and he's still not allowed to alter the menu to prove himself. Long story short he goes on a rampage bashing the guy (which ends up on youtube) and the story from then on takes its turn. With his kid and his best friend, the start touring the US selling traditional sandwiches. It's a great movie, the food scenes are amazing, making you wish you were the one eating these goodies (especially the scene with the french toast/grilled cheese sandwich comes to mind). For younger generations, the depiction of Chef's struggling to use Twitter correctly accurately depicts the struggle older folks have using all these new ""features"" of the internet. I was kinda disappointed we didn't see any more of my dear old Scarlett, but oh well! She's still a welcomed addition to the cast, a cast that boasts Sofia Vergara. How can you skip a movie that has Scarlett and Sofia in it? Give it a go, you'll like it :)",Chef
329,dianataylorlondon,Outstanding,10,12 October 2014,"A great feel good movie, an amazing soundtrack from some mighty Latin musicians, such an absolute treat to see a film that doesn't contain one gunshot or a gun... I absolutely recommend this film, but a word of warning, it'll make you feel incredibly hungry. The food is amazing the music will have you tapping your feet and swinging your hips. I initially thought the storyline a little passée and clichéd, but keeping it simple has paid dividends. Robert Downey Jnr is on top form, Scarlett Johansson and Sofia Vergara are suitably hot, Dustin Hoffman great as the restaurateur stuck in the last decade. And last but not least Emjay Anthony pulling the cast and script together really well",Chef
330,kiosilveira,A funny lunch,8,21 June 2017,"I can start by saying that Chef is a simple, light and satisfying comedy that despite not having a great script, conquer you by the charisma of the characters and by the good vibe of the movie, which shows a recognized head chef, who leaves his job in a restaurant after having his creative freedom denied, and starting a new business outside of the professional kitchen, taking advantage to narrow neglected family ties. We still have great performances from Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr. and Dustin Hoffman, in this written, directed and starring Jon Favreau movie.",Chef
331,pm4000,Not really good but not awful,3,7 September 2014,"I don't know what favreau was thinking when he wrote the script. The movie isn't really bad but has little to no substance behind. It is one of the movies that lives more from the feeling that it is trying to create than from character development or a good storyline.The story makes absolutely no sense at all. But the story isn't what I didn't like about the movie it is all the unnecessary stuff that adds absolutely nothing and is just annoying.I kind of expected that there is at least some cooking and maybe eating involved in a picture called ""Chef"" but if you would cut out all the scenes where nothing is happening and you see a super closeup of a piece of meat being roasted, some dish being arranged skillfully on a plate or guys eating the movie would be 20 minutes shorter. At the beginning the character of a waitress is introduced who as nothing to do with the storyline. I wonder why is she in the movie? Just so he could cook for her? There is a scene where the main character (the Chef) is angry and he has apparently nothing better to do than cook. It is just annoying to see all these super close ups of food being prepared.I think Favreau tried to be super cool with all this twitter nonsense (The twitter thing got really on my nerves). It just doesn't add up. I don't want to say to much because I don't want to spoil.In Summary I have to say even though the acting is well done the movie didn't manage to get me engaged and care for the characters. I have seen dozens of movies like this (but not with that much cooking). It is one of these pictures you can only watch if you don't care about storyline and just wan't to feel good even though nothing is happening on the screen- And you have to love watching people either preparing or eating food.",Chef

341,lorgurus,Instant Razzie Classic!,1,31 August 2014,"If given the opportunity to pose just ONE question to Jon Favreau, Chef's writer, director and leading man, it would be, ""Who's been lying to ya, dude""? I admit, I have never seen an Iron Man movie because it just isn't my cup of tea. I know they have done well in the box office, which obviously has left Mr. Favreau with such an overflow of cash that he can afford to pay people to lie to him.Apparently, he was able to pay an entire crew to blow enough smoke up his sorry rump roast to actually convince him he has the Midas touch. I'm even beginning to wonder if he hasn't also paid off legitimate movie critics because when I read some positive reviews, I honestly find it inconceivable that we watched the same flick.This movie is definitely a ""you've gotta see it to believe it,"" Razzie instant classic. As a matter of fact, since wasting twenty bucks and two hours of our lives we'll never get back, my boyfriend and I have not been able to stop picking at it.Let's start with the writing, shall we? From the time I was six years old until about twelve, I loved to drag my suitcase full of Barbie dolls out of my closet and make them come to life as my friends and spun far-fetched tales. This is relevant in this review only because the plot of Chef is absolutely reminiscent of what a second grader might spontaneously concoct.Now, let's look at Favreau as a director. There are several big name actors in this movie, such as Dustin Hoffman and Robert Downey Jr. I speculate they appear in this flop for less than their usual big bucks solely to help out a friend. Perhaps, after he asked them to read the entire six page script, they decided they'd better help save their friend from probable career-ending public humiliation. Alas, they could not.It is further speculation on my part that Favreau thought an an easy way to beef up his scant script was to allow some of the seasoned actors to improvise. Unfortunately, there was not enough meat to the plot nor ambiance on the set to pull that off. Awkward moments that should have ended up on the cutting room floor became...a movie. Ouch!Finally, not-so-renaissance man Favreau as the lead man, the Chef, el Jefe... The late, great actor, John Candy had a quality so endearing that no matter how rotten the movie, the audience couldn't help but love the characters he portrayed. In this, Favreau is the antithesis Of a Candy role. I was also distracted by Favreau's resemblance to comedian Kevin James, so much so that I kept finding myself wishing it indeed were Mr. James. He, at least, is consistently likable and has mastered comedic timing. Yes,you heard me right, I was actually longing for Paul Bart, Mall Cop while watching this piece of waste.When not watching bad movies, I am a Spanish teacher. The cringe factor reached its peak for me in Chef when it became evident that it would serve to perpetuate uneducated stereotyping of Spanish speakers. Speaking Spanish does not culturally unite people from the Caribbean, North, Central and South America, nor Europe. Cuban food is absolutely nothing like Mexican food is nothing like Spanish food is nothing like Argentinian food, etc. The same goes for the music, dress, traditions and accents. Judging from this movie, Jon Favreau is either blissfully ignorant, or perhaps simply does not care.Oh, it would be delicious poetic justice if the result of this atrocity spoils Jon Favreau's career, somewhat parallel to the fate of the half-baked Chef Caspar. This time, however, instead of driving a food truck, we stumble upon the actor on the streets of Florida's Key West, where he appears nightly as a creatively fulfilled street mime.",Chef
342,cool-as-ever-85,This movie is Delicious,6,8 August 2014,"All the foodies in the house, you will love this one. Writer, Director and Actor Jon Favreau portrayals a character of talented yet obsessed chef. He has this internal desire to break the monotony and mundane routine of cooking same food and to evolve and showcase his talent and creatively. His need for appreciation is high as he is genuinely talented but due to opposition from his restaurant owner he is not able to showcase his real talent to a famous food critic who after having his food criticizes him in his review. Here Jon has pretty effectively used ""Social Networking"" phenomenon to make the story progress. Once the review goes viral and starts trending, Jon's life gets changed. In consequent events a video of Jon's break down in front of the critic goes viral. He becomes famous but is out of job. The later half of the movie is how he rebuilds everything from scratch. The actual highlight of the movie is not that he rebuilds his professional career but how he rebuilds his personal life along the way. Performance of Emjay playing his son in the movie is praise worthy. The movie is funny, swift but ends with no surprises. Even then watch the movie for performances of all the actor who had small but good roles (Scarlett, Hoffman, John and Sofia). In the end why is this movie delicious? Its increases you appetite by showcasing yummy food and leaves you with your mouth full of water.",Chef
343,terrifiedcitizen,Cool Change,8,2 February 2015,"Looking over the reviews, maybe the haters need to get back to their dark dramas and sex romps and leave the precious little half-way clean fare left in the world for people who still have a soul to critique.Guess what, not only is there nothing wrong with a bright and cheery story with some unabashed emotion, but we simply have so little of it in cinema anymore that we're forgetting how to feel about it.This type of entertainment has become so rare anymore that professional moviegoers seem to have lost their point of reference; try not to over-analyze this as though you are attempting to pigeon-hole it for an awards show and simply enjoy it.I mean good grief, tantalizing food, loyalty between people, a passion for finding what you do well and enjoying the journey, wonderful music and some truly sexy women...

344,madhattertx,"A movie you want to like, but it stabs you in the back with a chef knife",3,23 October 2014,"I wanted to enjoy this film and have it live up to its hype, but I couldn't. I thought I might be watching a homage to food like ""Sideways"" was to wine, but the last minute was written like like Favreau was running out of ink or paper for his script. It starts out fine, but after the Chef is fired/quits/takes the night off after the bad review, he goes home and preps all this great food. I thought he intended to invite the critic to eat this food, but instead he goes back to the restaurant without the food and screeches at him at the top of his lungs. Wha? Then, I get the buddy/father/son road trip across country in the food truck. I'm thinking ""Sideways""...then they get to LA and the last minutes of the movie derail this movie completely: the critic loves the food truck food a little too much & offers Chef a job at his restaurant. Wait a second: the owner of the first restaurant promised Chef total food control too & later changed their deal so Chef would cook only what the owner wanted. So, I thought the food truck was about having sole control again. Nope: chef decides to accept the deal and enter into another deal working for somebody else, just like how he started at the first restaurant. That makes no sense. The food truck vanishes in an instant to be replaced by the restaurant and we see the chef married to his ex-wife for only the sole reason that she inadvertently blurted out she loved her ex a couple minutes earlier in the film. Wait, what? This could have been a 10 movie, if only Favreau had focused on what the premise of the movie was supposed to be: a chef in love with cooking standing on his own two feet and succeeding. Instead, I'm left with the impression that this movie was more a statement about the good/evil of using social media (mainly Twitter). Maybe the movie should have been called ""Cyberbully""?",Chef

346,Gautam58,Entertaining 'Feel Good' Movie.,7,7 September 2014,"In the movie, 'Chef', John Favreau portrays a celebrity chef, Carl Casper. Under pressure from his employer, he is unable to let his creative juices flow. His life takes a turn for the worse when he's rated negatively by a celebrated food critic. When a squabble between the two of them goes viral on the internet, he loses his job, his reputation is ruined and he is unable to find a job at another restaurant.In course of the movie, he is shown rebuilding his reputation by starting a food truck. He mends his relations with his son. His relations with his ex-wife (Sofía Vergara) seem to improve as well.The acting was pretty decent, with the kid (Emjay Anthony) and Favreau himself doing a wonderful job. All the side actors were good as well. However, I would've liked to see more of Scarlett Johansson's and Sofía Vergara's characters.The movie, obviously fictional, had quite a few plot-holes, as it narrated a larger than life success story. Bottomline: The movie serves to be quite entertaining, and fills you with optimism. Don't expect it to be a serious / biographical movie. I would recommend you to watch the movie if you're in mood for a light comedy.",Chef

So ridiculous and predictable and poorly written. Basically, this movie is a vehicle for some very talented actors to perform (some with small parts), as well as to showcase well-edited food-preparation and presentation scenes. That's it. The acting is great, and the food prep scenes are gorgeous and mouth-watering. But the story and the script are just horrible! Like it was written by a 12-year-old.

I like it, it was entertaining, well acted although it did have a few slightly cringe worthy moments.... These may have been purposeful... All the actors are amazing, I have no doubt a stunt double was used for the dicing scenes as id be shocked if favreau had the years of experience with a knife to pull that off... none the less, he evidently put great time and planning into this film as his labour of love. The Actors of course are without question brilliant. As always, Downey JR was sheer wonder to watch, i cant help but wonder if he is simply being himself!!!! Scarlett, well..... All her writhing around prior to being served pasta was acting genius... completely convincing and perfectly executed.... she also is a master of her craft.... whomever is with her in real life is a lucky man! Vegara was without doubt perfect for the role, hysterical, and entertaining. I loved the scenery and camera work as only a Director of this calibre can achieve. Im not sure if this is an indie film, but it certainly isn't a traditional Hollywood one I know that.We walked out being happy to have seen it, my girlfriend even said she wanted to go straight home and cook something.... that might be cheesy, but its the sign of a story that had an influence.... cant say that about a lot of films these days....

349,jamesowens036,An embarrassment to the film industry.,1,24 March 2016,"I saw this film in the summer of 2014 at the peak of its hype, expectations weren't considerably high going in, but I never anticipated to have two hours of my life wasted by a fat, arrogant, vain, power hungry, woeful director. Who is so desperate to enhance his public image that he disregards most of the desired qualities of a 'good film' such as plot, acting, character development, and screenplay. I would love to go through the plot in detail, but the following summary covers the A-Z of the storyline. We follow the trials and tribulations of a considerably weighty individual who at the start appears to have the perfect life (somehow), owning a massive mansion, a doting model wife (who wouldn't bat an eye lid to his grotesque and ample physique in any dimension) as well as servants, and a top job at a successful restaurant where he is adored by his staff, including an incredibly unlikely love interest of that of another model like character played by Scarlett Johansson. Not surprisingly, Chef Favreau throws a temper tantrum at his restaurant when a critic complains about the food... What would seem to be a small blip in his idyllic life. However this is not the case, THE CHEF then decides to leave his highly paid job on a whim (clearly his model wife bringing in a hefty income on the side) to start a whimsical cross-country adventure in a food truck with his son and half of the staff who abandoned their job security to pander to his bulging ego and damaging mid-life crisis. Again somehow due to the help of his son's social media skills he becomes immensely popular for his ""famous"" Cuban sandwiches. The only presence of any form of conflict in this disaster strewn picture comes with the tiff he endured with his spoilt little son over cleaning a cooker. After this heart-wrenching moment the strong father-son relationship is resumed immediately. Upon returning from his wild trek across country all his problems are resolved as quick as he cultivated them when the same critic pops up as a wealthy benefactor offering CHEF JOOOHN the opportunity of a lifetime, which he duly accepts on the condition he can continue to travel away from his newly entitled responsibilities (seems to be a recurring theme in his life) to continue high tailing across America as a internet born demi-god. All in all a travesty in filmmaking and a stain on the reputation of most esteemed critic sites (not to mention Rotten Tomatoes) and one that pops to mind is IMDb. I am extremely disappointed in the users of this website for giving it a rating of over 2. Don't BOTHER",Chef
350,LowellFan09,"A charming, intimate picture about proving one's worth amid a competitive and changing world",8,1 September 2015,"I've always enjoyed writer/actor/director Jon Favreau in what seems to be his most comfortable and endearing element: small, independent films. After working on many high-profile pictures over the years, including Iron Man and its first sequel, the family-adventure film Zathura, and of course the poorly-received Cowboys & Aliens, starring Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, Favreau turned his attention to the more intimate comedy, Chef (2014), for which he wrote, directed and starred in himself.The movie is a feel-good account of Carl Casper, a crafty Los Angeles-based chef who is now past his once-celebrated reputation, subtlety played for laughs and heart by Favreau. But as washed-up as Casper may first appear, he certainly hasn't lost touch with his craft, a nurtured respect that no doubt comes at the cost of having spread himself thin with his young and idolizing son, as well as an aid to his failed marriage. It also seems to have caused him a bit of bewilderment at socializing with his fans and peers in the more modern of ways, though this is often played to great comical effect. Working at a well-known, yet predictable outfit ran by his content boss, Dustin Hoffman, he yearns to re-establish himself with the critics and prove to those around him - a colorful cast of characters featuring John Leguizamo, Sofia Vergara, Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johannson, and Oliver Platt - that he can still surprise his audience with something fresh.If I were to isolate one aspect of the film I really enjoy, it's in the honesty of its flawed but likable protagonist, Carl. He is so real in fact, that in one scene he wildly confronts a naysayer in an open and populated restaurant and we, like his nemesis, simply take the punishment, almost as if we cannot possibly disagree with his emotional reaction, crude as it may be. In addition to the character's honesty, there is some real chemistry between he and the supporting acts, particularly his bandit of kitchen admirers, and a tasty theme- centric soundtrack, heavy on the Cuban and New Orleans jazz.While there's nothing completely profound on display within the movie, there's an integrity we can't ignore, with plenty of laughs along the way. I wish Favreau did more films like this. They're seen by me as the prized jewels of his filmography, as an actor, writer and director. Currently, you can see the film on Netflix, and it's also available on DVD and Blu-ray via Universal Studios. Great movie. smile emoticon",Chef

Realistic, and Hillarious.Karl, who failed chef's story is giving us to lot of messages and moving humanistic story.The message of movie is 'How the SNS is effective' and this metaphor is keep using at the end of movie.Karl's fail is happens twitter.
Karl's successful return is also twitter.
And Healing relationship with Karl and his son.So, this metaphor is straight through whole the film. And...it's cool. Great metaphor and a well-knit plots mixes and makes great synergy.People who loves Humanism story, that would be love this film.",Chef

This film starts with a Chef at a trendy restaurant who cooks for the joy of cooking and through some crazy circumstances has to start over while trying to figure out how to be a good dad to his 10 year old son. What follows is a great story of redemption, good food, great friends, family bonding and a road trip that you just have to see to appreciate. Favreau is a guy you just find yourself rooting for and Sofia Vergara is just darling in the role of his ex-wife. John Leguizamo plays the role of his best friend and portrays the kind of friend we all could hope to have. Just a thoroughly enjoyable movie to watch.",Chef

358,jtmazibrook,Father and Son Reunion,10,28 May 2014,"Yes - the title of a Paul Simon song - but this is what the movie is about. We have some great food being cooked and some scenes that are about things other than food or relationships, but the basic thrust of this film is about a father and son really getting to know each other and liking the result.The boy only wants to hang with dad, but dad thinks he needs to do things with the boy to make him happy. A mother and ex who really is concerned for the boy, not herself, helps the relationship grow.Through some contrived circumstances, the father and son are together on a trip through the south of America and with social media's blessings, come to realize they really like each other.OK - the foodies have some food porn thrust at them - but the relationship between father and son drives this film.The ending is predicable - but what is not is the friendship and trust that a former employee shows the chef as he helps him with the lessons needed to show the son how to cope in a real kitchen.Being a former Chicagoan - I can only say I give it a full thumbs up!",Chef
359,poppyjmcconnell,Awful,1,23 October 2021,"The worst movie I have ever seen. It's about a guy who is chef and makes rubbish food (Jon Favreau) in a restaurant so he decides to open a food truck with his son percy (emjay Anthony) ,his best friend Marvin (Robert downing jr) and his ex wife Inez (Sofia vergara). They go all around America with it. Don't watch you will waist 2 hours and 34 minutes of your life. It's not funny it is flat it doesn't go anywhere it is pointless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Chef
360,burgernerd,"If you like lining up for food trucks, you'll love this movie.",1,6 August 2014,"Favreau's pet project is like listening to someone telling you about about their dream last night, which is usually boring. Despite some decent performances, this poorly disguised Twitter ad does not feel the need to provide any kind of recognizable story arc, second act adversity or suspense. The unbelievable pablum of the saccharine victory tour road trip was only topped with the essentially emasculating ending. Bad reviews hurt according to 'Chef', but they can also inspire. OK, I got that. But they don't make you go into business with the bad reviewer and renew your marriage. I'm happy for Favreau, for getting this out of his system, I just hope I can pass this turd soon.",Chef
361,Karamungikar,This is Gourmet film making!,8,7 June 2014,"Chef is a medium-rare epicurean delight for your mind that goes down like two decade old French wine, leaving behind a delightful aftertaste and a beautiful smile. Jon Favreau, as the middle aged Chef who is a virtuoso at what he does, but an unfortunate victim of circumstances has registered a performance so magnificent that hence further it is going to be hard to imagine anyone else whenever the word 'chef' comes up. 'Chef' isn't just about the food. It is a love story - a love story of a man who loves cooking and knows that he is damn good at it. The beautiful relationship portrayed between Chef Carl Casper and his smart son Percy is a heart-filling experience in itself. The references to social media like vine and twitter make the film more interesting. I will go ahead and take the liberty of saying that in spite of Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johansson, the sun, in this film continues to shine on Chef Casper and his son. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a wonderful film that teaches you that you can put a good man out for as long as you want, but you can never put him down. Go watch this film, it will fill your heart. 8/10. p.s.- Absolutely loved the climax!",Chef
362,marilyncarien,More than food . . . positive modern values,10,24 July 2014,"The sensuous portrayal of Chef's passion for food reminds me of the wonder and awe of Mozart's music in Amadeus. Great! But there is so much more ! I appreciated the film's modeling of positive modern values. Couples can be divorced but still share love. This film goes further than most -- she lends him money, they dance joyously together, keep in touch, and although he appreciates her beauty and sexuality, they do not go back for a Hollywood ending and ""live happily ever after"" Dads (even single ones) can seriously bond with sons far beyond weekend visits to ""have fun"" and this is emphasized in conversation and action. But, why did they add the scene of the son refusing a direct command to ""clean out that pan""? Kids need to be trained to do things they prefer not to, but also dads can feel sincerely sorry for ""being mean"" and apologize.Another strongly made point is that reviewers (like us!) can do a LOT of harm using words (blah, blah, blah) to folks who are really sweating it out and doing their best to make us happy.We also get a free lesson on technical wonders. We clearly see Twitter's amazing power while also appreciating the way kids can enrich our lives with new technologies. Screen impositions show ""tweeting and re-tweeting"" in a way to make you smile. It was a delight to watch crowds magically line-up at every stop of the food truck. Also, Chef's watching the video clip the son created for him along the trip. .. was a filmic coup. Finally, many will feel gratified at the central conflict of conventional expectations versus creative genius. The restaurant boss orders Chef to serve the conventional ""favorites"" which results in a terrible review. But all is well in the end",Chef
363,jordlol,The worst movie experience ever.,1,27 March 2015,"Let's start at the beginning. The good actor John Favreau has written a script for a movie. It's a simple story about a chef that has reached a dead end when all of his ambition has been taken over by the crass reality of making money. Brilliant, that sounds like a movie I'd really like to watch. But somewhere along the way everything just went wrong. Because John Favreau got stuck in the same trap as his main character. Only difference is that he didn't manage to get out. Instead he was forced to make a movie full of compromises in the sake of the bottom line. All that was left was an endless string of big business actors and really stupid commercials. This might be some kind of brilliant ploy. I don't know. My conclusion is that I won't be upgrading to the new Iphone and I will never get on twitter ever again. When they ruin a movie that otherwise could have been great they won't get my money again. Ever.I hope that John Favreau get's to make another movie without the compromises because he deserves to. He's a good actor and without a doubt a talented script writer and director.",Chef
364,shameema-mallik,Plain Forgettable,6,18 May 2014,"I watched two simplistic movies back to back. While Fading Gigolo succeeded in engaging me enough to actually care about characters that I knew nothing about and had no perceivable mean of relating to, Chef simply failed that test. There is no high point in this movie with a very predictable run of the mill story, where from the strained relationship between the father and son in the beginning to the ego and professional fervor of our protagonist- everything remains unexplored. Favreau touches everything but never dips his feet too deep. Its tragic because the direction was very meticulous and technically there is hardly anything wrong with the film from cinematography to music to use of location.To my mind the point where the film has entirely failed is making any connection between our hero- the chef and the audience. Rather than coming across as someone really passionate about his job the titular chef comes across as a bit of a crybaby not being able to handle negative criticism and most abundantly a self centered person who cannot see beyond himself. John Leguizamo playing his best friend has shown more likable traits than him,what with giving up his position in a restaurant to join his friend's food truck. When the film finishes we have no clue as to whether he is indeed a better person for all that has transpired instead we are to assume due to his success his ex wife has taken him back.I should also mention there is no character development of any of the side characters, the script itself is a bit like the chef himself in this respect.",Chef
365,sowencheung,Had high hope but left with disappointment,7,22 September 2014,"don't get me wrong, I enjoyed most parts of this movie.the high-ego chef part was good, the friendship was touching, and the road trip about father with son was very much enjoyable; however, there are 3 parts particularly I don't like 1) the role of Dustin Hoffman: it's a little unreal or strange that he appeared to be supportive but stubborn at the same time, maybe I read it wrong, but his role is too arrogant and unlikeable, but of course, without him, none of the story would happen; 2) the lack of details, like what's wrong with him and his wife, what's happening between him and Molly, what's wrong with his attitude to his son, and what's the deal with the food critics， what's the deal of Marvel? there are too much, I don't think the director event wanted to talk about them or knew how to talk about them...3) the major of the story is like an advertisement for some social network app... I don't want to give names here... but hey, seriously, running a food truck is not that easy, this movie is too romantic in that part. unfortunately, it failed to find a balance between a movie about father-son bonding and about food.I love food, I saw they talked about it when watching top-chef, Jon Favreau was on as a guest judge. so i was really looking forward to this movie... but I have to say, this movie is lacking some pieces, especially the ending, everything was like shut down suddenly, a little disappointed...",Chef
366,aaronjohn-caudill,"Fun, feel good movie. Much better than expected.",8,11 June 2015,"So without getting too deep, I had passed over this movie many times on Netflix and didn't really look into until yesterday. Curious, I finally clicked on it and noticed it has a really great cast. In short, this is a great movie that moves at a good speed. The acting is good and there is a great dynamic between all the main actors. There are no boring lulls and it doesn't drag on. It also doesn't make you think (that may sound bad but sometimes you just want to be entertained) and you really care about each of the characters. If you want something that you can enjoy watching that makes you feel good, this is a great pick. I wish I hadn't waited so long.",Chef

368,ben-korn,much better than expected,8,13 July 2014,"When i heard the story of the film ""Chef"" i was less than excited i thought that the idea was cheesy and without cinematic merit however when i saw the film i was very pleasantly surprised, the direction of this film is ideal for the overall theme and story and certain camera shots used in some of the cooking scenes where chosen very well. In the vast majority of films regardless of the genre or story there is a segment of the film devoted to a negative aspect of the story however although in this film there is a part upsetting for the main character, he doesn't dwell on that part he gets over it and makes the bad thing good and in doing so makes this film very uplifting and often very funny. Something i often speak about is the use of swear words in films because in my view very few films get the amount of swearing correct, it tends to be either nowhere near enough of far too much, however this film contains what i think to be just the right amount of swearing for a film based around chefs and working kitchens in which there is a lot of swearing. Although the initial introduction of the characters is a little vague the development of those characters throughout the film gets better and better, mainly the development between the main character and his son and their relationship. The overall standard of acting is high with what i think to be standout performances from Jon Favreau who plays the main character "" Carl Casper"" and John Leguizamo who plays Carl Caspers friend and sous-chef ""Martin"". In conclusion i'm going to give this film an 8/10 and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good uplifting comedy although it may not be suitable for young children .",Chef

Boring Boring Boring!,1,18 July 2014,"Behind the fleeting scenes of Robert Downey Jr, Sofia Vergara's good looks and the tasty looking food there is very little substance to this awful movie. Jon Favreau is very annoying in this part, his crappy acting just makes you want to hit him. Full of cringe worthy 'father son bonding' which seems very forced. This movie is basically an excuse to advertise twitter and for Jon favreau to make some lame point about critics. There are also some serious things that needed explaining in this movie, the biggest being how could such a self centered fat git with no money and the personality of a moldy sandwich get such a hot wife in the first place.

372,wahsatchmo,A trite infomercial for Twitter,2,2 October 2014,"Everything about this movie indicates that it was paid for by Twitter as a thinly disguised infomercial for its social networking related platforms. Favreau clearly hired his buddies for a little star power and probably a quick paycheck to give some weight to this blatant advertising vehicle. To their credit, the actors in Chef at least try to act a part, and there is an actual screenplay, which distinguishes it from Adam Sandler movies which are solely designed to insult the audience's intelligence while paying his pals to take vacations.You see the cover and think, ""Hey! Sleeper hit! Favreau! Downey, Jr.! Hoffman! Leguizamo! Vergara! Johansson! This sounds fun!""But it's not fun. 75% of the scenes are either talking about or demonstrating Twitter and other social media in typical Hollywood graphical gimmickry (and hyping its impact), or of Jon Favreau noisily eating something. Jon Favreau chomps on kettle corn. Jon Favreau crunches loudly on a grilled cheese sandwich. Jon Favreau chews a sample of slow cooked pork. Jon Favreau moans through a sample of barbecued brisket. Misophonics, beware.Also, Favreau likes to touch the food that he cooks and serves to customers, a lot. He directs close ups of his hands near groping the food as he cooks and plates it. There has to be a health code violation or two in this movie here somewhere.Your villains are typical straw men: Hoffman is the restaurant owner who won't let Favreau stretch his culinary creativity, and the critic is the snarky word smith who doesn't know how to cook what he critiques. Everybody else is a stereotype: the son who knows everything about social networking; the happy-go-lucky Cubano who drops everything for his beloved Chef; the ex-wife is the good friend who helps him every step of the way; the hostess/sommelier/girlfriend is the sexy/hipster/foodie on Yelp that you'll never meet in real life; and Favreau himself, whom I don't need to describe because you can figure it out from the plot summary.Only Downey stands out, but that's because he's playing his typical fast-talking/random-subject-changing-guy/self that everyone knows and loves. And he's in the movie for about eight minutes.It's all just tired and trope-y, just like Chef Casper's Molten Lava Cake. It's the little story where everybody ""learns a little something about life and love along the way"" crushed under a pile of advertising dreck for the sheer awesome power of social networking (richly undeserved.) Normally I'd have given three stars to this movie because the performances weren't awful and the writing was passable, but I couldn't finish it because of the Twitter crap, so one less star.",Chef
373,sarachann10,Incredible story. It will have you laughing and dancing along.,10,7 September 2014,"It started out very slow and boring. But then it got very interesting. When I went to check the time I realized it was half way over. I was so sad because it just started getting good and then it was ending soon. The father-son relationship that blossomed was truly beautiful. It also showed how important this relationship is. The mom was kind of annoying and whiny. But at the same time she was very supportive and such a good person. It's a great story about a chef who rediscovers happiness in cooking. Yeah sure he was always happy cooking but he wasn't truly happy until he started cooking for himself and not for someone else. This is important because too often we try to make others happy first instead of making ourselves happy. Also it's a reminder to do what you love always.I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because I love cooking shows and movies. It's always so fascinating. Also, the story line was amazing. It's actually very motivational for anyone who wants to start their own business. Also motivational for all new chefs and cooks out there. It's a must-see movie!",Chef

There were many good actors and actresses in the movie but the one who impressed me most was Emjay Anthony, who played the role of Percy. He was 10 years old when the movie was filmed though he showed some emotionally mature acting. I hope he continue to work as an actor and be a great actor someday.

375,bconnelly2014,A highly entertaining movie that you should eat at a great restaurant because you will have many cravings when it is done,9,1 October 2014,"There are many great movies that come out every year but not many really original ones. Jon Favreau's tasty treat CHEF is one of the best movies of the year and will leave you hungry for more and hungry for a great meal I promise. We all love food and making a movie that revolves around it only seems like a great idea so it is kind of a surprise that it took until 2014 for somebody to think about it. Not only was Jon Favreau creative enough to finally come up with it but he is talented enough to take such a great idea for a movie and make it rock. He managed to make a feel good movie really thoughtful and creative. The kind of film that sticks with you and will probably inspire you.Over a career that has spanned over twenty years Jon Favreau has made quite a name for himself in Hollywood and the fact that he was able to get such a great cast for an indie film and get a man like Gary Clark Jr., who is often called ""The new Hendrix"" to play ""Travis County"" and ""When My Train Pulls In"" in this film only shows the amount of respect and connections he must have. Favreau is a man of many talents such as acting, screen writing, directing, stand up comedy, and as he clearly shows in this film cooking. He managed to use all of those skills in this movie perfectly, and the fact that he was the protagonist, director, screenwriter and producer truly makes CHEF his masterpiece.CHEF tells the story of Chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau), a man that is going downhill and hits bottom. He is so wrapped up with pleasing the top critic that he seems to tune everything else out like his son Percy (Emjay Anthony) who he should be making more of an effort with as he is struggling with the divorce of his parents. He is very popular amongst his staff, but he secretly hates working at his restaurant in California as he is from Miami, but the real reason why he hates it is because of his controlling boss Riva (Dustin Hoffman) who refuses to let him cook a different menu telling him to ""play your hits."" Carl has been cooking the same menu for years which he is much to talented and creative to be doing. He hits bottom when the critic gives him a bad review that was very insulting turning his world upside down once it goes viral. He then quits refusing to give up his creative integrity and after he gets into a twitter war with the critic. Then he must rebuild his life, work on himself as a father, and get his life on the right track.What is so interesting about this movie is the dynamic of the social media stuff like twitter adds to this movie. Carl is not very in tune with social media but his son is and that brings them together as Percy teaches him about it, which starts the twitter war and eventually helps him in the end. It starts a great dynamic between him and his son which becomes one of the best parts of the movie. But as for the food OOHHHH MY GOD everything looked phenomenal and you get hungry watching it. He made a grilled cheese sandwich and just seeing him make something basic like that inspires you to want to perfect that. How Favreau learned to cook that way is beyond me but he is sensational. I recommend having a good meal planned to eat after you see this because you are guaranteed to be hungry after seeing this. But a theme that should be expressed is ""play your hits"" which is what Riva told Carl. Well Carl showed that the hits aren't usually the best ones. In fact they never are and you get tired of them. Chef is one of the best films of the year and the best film that Jon Favreau has ever done. A film like no other and completely original. You will spend the whole time wishing that the food you are seeing was actually in front of you and not on a screen. You will also probably want to learn to cook like Carl Casper. Overall a very thoughtful, and inspiring feel good movie that is funny and highly entertaining.",Chef

The chef of the dish Jon Favreau ,who known for expensive cooking( Iron Man film series).He Served a Simple Spicy & Tasty Recipe in a elegant way.Cinematography is superb which is an essential ingredient in this kind of films.The music is a bit of let down to the movie.i don't understand why this much negative reviews.",Chef
377,dj_tknight,Left me hungry but happy!,8,2 February 2015,"His ex-wife is Sophia Vergara... his girlfriend is Scarlett Johansson... I really need to learn to cook!Chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) is stuck in a creative rut, cooking the same popular menu he has been for years, he longs to try some new recipes but his employer (Dustin Hoffman) is content with the current dishes. After the menu leaves a renowned food critic (Oliver Platt) unimpressed and his scathing review spreads online, Casper gets into a heated social media argument, and loses his job. His ex- wife (Sophia Vergara) suggests Carl just gets a food truck, and with a vehicle from her other ex-husband (Robert Downey Jr.), he sets off on a road trip around America cooking the food he loves with friend Martin (John Leguiziamo) and Carl's tech-savvy and enthusiastic son Percy (Emjay Anthony).The story is quite clearly somewhat allegorical, and it has been widely commented on how it mirrors Favreau's film career, sometimes making the big blockbusters that are poorly received by critics but aimed simply at bringing in the money from audiences. Favreau has directed such excellent films such as Elf and Iron Man, but then also made others that were poorly received such as Cowboys and Aliens, and of course Iron Man 2. Interestingly, his film almost appears to be an Indie film, but as often goes with being a big name director, it's stuffed (like a chicken... or a roasted pepper for veggies) full of huge and bankable stars.As well as directing, Jon Favreau is leading this from the front as the main character, and I must say it thankfully feels like a piece of fitting casting rather than a vanity move. Key to the film working is his ability to portray the character well in both the personal side of the story and the professional aspects of being a top chef. To me, his cheffing skills look incredibly authentic, it would undermine the film completely if they were lacking, but I completely believed in him as being a skilled chef. Plus the finished food all looks delicious, it's like watching a feature- length Marks & Spencer food advert, often described as 'food porn'.I enjoyed how the film also comments on some of the pros and cons of social networking. Firstly it's shown as the means of Casper's fall from grace, opening his work up to widespread criticism and going viral, but then on the flip side his son Percy makes clever use of many social networks and features to help promote the food van. Talking of Percy, Emjay Anthony who plays him is really excellent, much better than many child actors I've seen in some recent films. In fact, the whole cast really is very good, a nice mix of recognisable stars in varying sized parts but all feel well suited for their roles, especially Dustin Hoffman as a restaurateur who is mostly interested in profits, and Robert Downey Jr. whose character is so instantly memorable.I must also mention that the film features some great music, as the film becomes a road trip and they tour the different states cooking as they go, the music changes with them, and this provides a lively soundtrack. It's only a seemingly small aspect, but adds to the feel-good tone of the film and helps to really make it exactly that, a very enjoyable film, that if it wasn't for the strong language, would probably be a great movie to enjoy as a whole family.I recently thought that 'The Babadook' is a film you shouldn't watch alone, this is definitely one that you shouldn't watch hungry! Filled with tasty food, tastier ladies, some well seasoned performances and an appetising story, it's metaphorically as close to a well-balanced meal as you're likely to get!For more of my reviews check out my blog at www.tknight.co.uk",Chef

385,sphered,It's all about twitter. Chef is just a cover title,4,14 September 2014,"Not what I expected. It feels like a twitter advertising campaign. Just a few funny scenes with no substance. Looking at the trailer made me think it's going to be a cool comedy but this was not the case. I kept on waiting until the end for something to happen but it was just another ordinary movie mostly boring. I was definitely disappointed at the end. The only good thing is the food, but even that is for the ones that didn't spend to much time in the kitchen :) You can write the story in a few lines because nothing much happens. A chef is fired, buys a food truck and starts selling sandwiches.....and that's pretty much it.",Chef

I am lover of movies that show the viewer raw natural emotion but toss in a dash of the dramatic, and this story is precisely that. If you want to watch a film with an accurate portrayal of real people, this movie is perfect. There is an amount of predictability that satisfies you to your very core and this movie, for me, gratified every inch of me throughout the entire film. The theme of finding your true passion in life and what truly makes you happy, to the theme of prioritizing the love of your family, collide in the most compromising and heartwarming way that put me to tears a couple of times in the movie. Will definitely be rewatching this again for the third time very soon and I'm happy to give this a 10/10.",Chef
388,natneverland,A Favreau Likeness,7,16 March 2021,"Chef is a film that was released in 2014 starring Jon Favreau and Sofia Vergara.
We start the film off with a man who is clearly a chef of a restaurant, a big honcho kind of guy that wants order and knows what he wants. Already I am intrigued by the film since I can only hope to see some serious kitchen drama and some great food on screen.
The drama in this film is excellent, as it gives an insight as far as what can happen in the real world of chefs and the restaurant business. Carl definitely messed up his career and because of that the audience is able to perceive what will happen for the future of his career. The film is great as far as drama yes, but it does lack in some sense of a back story. It would have been excellent to have gotten an insight of who the characters were before the events of the restaurant went down and how Chef Carl came to be, but even without those details we do still have an understanding of who the characters are.
But, the film does get better and better even as we leave the restaurant scene into the world of the food truck and what Chef Carl does with his son in that business for the rest of the film. Overall the film is quite enjoyable and exciting at times, but surely not Jon Favreau's best work.",Chef
389,itasara-1,Loved it! Entertaining,9,30 May 2014,"Really uplifting movie.funny and serious in parts. Nice music also. Has a Moral--important to let your children be involved in your passions and work (when possible.) No one got killed, no one got injured, and the bad language was tolerable. Yes the differences in body and personality types of the characters was noticeable but in a way not much different from what I see in real life, and this was in a way a real-life movie with some ""Hollywood"" leeway. Often the really sincere and honest human beings do not come in the best looking packages!! Of course the ""MOM"" was a knockout so it is a little hard to imagine what the attraction would have been with the Chef, but I've seen relationships with interesting looking couples!",Chef
390,SkyFox1,UGH! So Disappointing!!,2,30 July 2014,"I love to cook and enjoy a good movie about chefs, cooking and food. There are some great ones out there. This is not one of them. In fact, it should go down in history as one of the more worthless food movies off all time.I really was expecting something more significant from Jon F., and it COULD have been. It seems like Jon wrote this in an afternoon and shot it in a week. The plot was so thin you could see through it in a dark room. Worst of all, it made no sense. I will spare the spoilers on the off chance you are trapped in a room with nothing else to do and no way to turn this off but I would rather watch grass grow. Give it a little more effort next time Jon... please.So much wasted potential.",Chef

Second week in a row I'm tricked into watching a ""high"" rated movie and this time walked out of the theater after an hour of torture. ... If you like cooking shows you might relate somehow to the story. Unfortunately for me, the cooking is not my thing. The bland and straightforward story line and only one substantial scene for 60-70 minutes (as I said I walked after this), made me wonder how on earth actors such as Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson and Rober D. Jr. have agreed to participate in this ""movie"". ... To call this movie ""comedy"" is a stretch to the extreme. There was nothing funny about a fat guy with broken family, chopping onions every 5 minutes. The only scene the would have saved that movie would have been Sofia Vergara going full frontal. That however did not appear to be part of the directors intention. Altogether pathetic, bland and... oh God, I don't even know why I'm writing this...Save your money!",Chef

I do not know if the movie will ever be nominated for an award and I truly don't care - I'm glad I stumbled over it and gave it a try.

The movie is not only about cooking although by watching trailer I concluded it would be only fatty foods in the frame. The story is about friendship, family, love and happy ending. Some scenes are very funny, some are very good but some are very awkward. Younger audiences will definitely enjoy it more. At one point you think that the movie is a big Twitter ad but then you realize that mentioning Twitter or Facebook is not advertisement these days, it's our every day reality.

I relied on IMDb's rating for this show, and it appears that it was at an elevated level. Avoid this movie and its actors at all costs. What got to me was the substandard acting by the support actors. it was contrived and coupled with the script, it made for a lousy night out. The subplots, i.e. the Chef's relationship with his son and ex-wife was also bizarre - there was no background or introduction to how the relationship existed and what the Chef was attempting to overcome. The best thing i did was to walk out in about three quarters of the way.",Chef

Favreau's character converges a spotlight on the faceless critics who take themselves too seriously and tear down others in pursuit of their own notoriety; an epidemic in this digital day in age as harsh ideals are spammed across the internet with little recourse.Backed by his star studded cast, Favreau pours his heart and soul into this movie and takes us on a whirlwind trek across the US to pursue passion through a foodies opus. We're inundated with hours of perfectly crafted dishes, social media faux pas, self realization and the path to finding true happiness. Take the Road Trip with Chef and enjoy a film that lets you leave the theater feeling full of love, life and in pursuit of the nearest Franklin's BBQ.",Chef

A broken family is made whole and a career once thought over is restored. This film just runs full circle. I LOVE it. I wish I could rate it over 10/10 because it deserves it. GREAT JOB. I really enjoyed this one!,Chef
399,mgkupris,Watch Chef. It's Good.,7,12 December 2014,"*Note: I am ambiguous in this review to prevent any plot spoilers.Chef is a good movie. It is not groundbreaking, but it is a heartfelt story that combines themes of food, family, loyalty, and relationships. The tying of food to the latter three themes is indicative of Romantic cultures (Italian, Latin, French, etc.), and can pull at the heart strings of those of us who grew up in environments where food meant family, life, vitality, and happiness. Also, Chef gives a dramatized perspective of what it means to ""work the line,"" or be a cook/chef and it's surrounding culture. There hasn't been a movie that has combined these aspects (that I know of), and coming from a service industry employee (both BOH and FOH) I really appreciated the intention of the movie.Negatives:1. The script wasn't the best. It was (at parts) a little predictable, disappointing, and contrived.2. Some interactions in the restaurant environment weren't as realistic as I had hoped. They made their point, but as a former line cook I could see the drama before the reality and it took me out of the movie.3. Critical arcs in the movie that should have been more discreet were plainly spoken by characters. They showed major changes or realizations of characters in the movie without conveying the gravity (or just not showing at all) of the situations. This made it less relatable.4. The ending, while appropriate, lacked gravitas. As a true to life story the ending may have worked, but as a dramatic piece it's slightly boring, and too easy.Positives:1. They took a common story progression and tweaked it to fit a culinary environment. While it is a common story, it was enjoyable to be on the journey. This kind of story has worked for a long time, and I feel the adaptation was adequate.2. I (a non-Latino) felt an immersion in the Latin culture displayed throughout the movie. Good conveyance.3. The comedy writing felt natural and was effective.4. As with many good stories, the good parts were in the journey, not the destination. While this movie did have a destination, it leaves me wanting. The highlight of the movie was the journey of these characters together.Bottom Line:Watch the movie. It is a good movie that I will add to my collection. Film buffs will be disappointed. Foodies will appreciate it. Foodie/Film buffs will either hate it or love it. For the average viewer it is fulfilling, though it may not warrant a second watch.",Chef

The funny lines sneak up on you. You can identify with the frustrations of someone not allowed to do his job. Every character is likable. The story progresses at just the right pace creating many joyous moments along the way. Yes, even the few actual food sequences are well done (sic) and make you a bit hungry. characters. Jon Favreau, Robert Downy, Jr., Dustin Hoffman, John Leguizamo, Bobby Cannavale,Scarlett Johansson,Sofía Vergara and Oliver Platt make a fantastic cast. Each of them make their characters real and endearing. Young Emjay Anthony shows us his extraordinary talent as Favreau's son.

It's not just about the main character's passion for cooking. It's also about his relationships - especially with his son. It's about not giving in to what's expected of you, but striving to continually create something new and exciting - whatever your passion. He plays a character named Carl, whose son Percy (rising young star to keep an eye on) helps him get his spark back by creating a Twitter account. Soon Carl starts his own business, with a little help from Percy's mom's ex-spouse (portrayed by the gorgeous Sofia Vergara and RDJ, respectively). A pivotal moment occurs when Percy is allowed into the ""kitchen"" and helps his father in a hands-on way, strengthening their relationship as father and son.

'Chef' didn't blow me away, but I smiled during most of it.The exposure of especially twitter and 2014 tech is insane, but I caught myself wondering how far it actually is from what I see around me every day... In that sense it didn't come off too much as a branding thing, but added to the entertainment value - it could have gone terribly wrong though, but they got away with it!The theme of the film is a father/son relationship and a light existential crisis on whether to do art or sell out. In general I'd say it's a quite masculine movie - soft masculine that is.Editing was smooth, with some nice cooking shots.If you're interested in more food films I'd recommend: - De Grønne Slagtere - Tampopo - La grande bouffe",Chef
404,jayne-robinson,a moving feast,9,14 November 2014,visually appealing and sweet treat of a movie. Unexpected plot twists and moving family scenes. Yum. It speaks to the power of food and family. And the need to listen and learn from our children -- they have a great deal to teach us. I would watch it again with my husband as he would love the sweet father - son relationship as it plays out. The father is not paying any attention to his son and that relationship is critical to both of their happiness in life. I hate to see parents so self absorbed they don't see how much they are missing by not paying attention to how short a period of time we have with our children and to waste that is sad.,Chef
405,doclizardo,The value of entertainment,9,10 December 2014,"It seems to me that most of the negative reviewers have forgotten WHY they watch movies in the first place. I don't know the director, or most of the cast,just a few catch names from a long life so I can't speak to whom did how well or said what. What I DID want with this flick was just pure entertainment - the suspension of disbelief. Although my wife rented this movie, I can honestly say, I haven't been as entertained since the original Star Wars! I have been in almost all the US States and 19 foreign countries and I am pretty jaded by all the sadness people endure in life. This movie was a real uptrend and socially fulfilling piece of real Americana. The technological challenges, the subtle ethnicity, food, conversation, loves, and fears we all experience are all in there masterfully blended to make the viewer have a great time. How can anyone watch this movie and not come away with a 'yeah, I've been there done that - got the T shirt' sort of memories and enjoy the positive outcomes. Yes there are loose ends, misplays, odd trivia if you want to look for that. For me it was just a couple of hours well spent. I especially enjoyed the kid and his acting. To the naysayers, search your lives and hearts and check if you are writing reviews just to be critical of all that you KNOW or if you are seeking good entertainment thru the venue of a movie.

408,maximuss_ir,Not as good as you might expect!,6,5 June 2014,"(I apologize for my English, I'm not a native speaker). Yesterday, I watched ""Chef"" in the theater. The trailer and cast seemed promising and I was expecting to watch an interpretive movie with plethora of character developments, and probably a very exciting plot. To my bewilderment, the movie was lacking most qualities that constitute a good movie. The casting seemed out of place, both with Robert Downey Jr. and especially with Sofia Vergara. The plot revolved around a happy- ending story about the so-called ""American Dream"". It was so predictable that I felt like I have watched the movie before. In my opinion, and with all due respect to people who liked the movie, I believe it is completely overrated. It is a fun movie to watch and laugh at, and it has its moments, but it is just a feel-good comedy. Yeah, it talks about the interactions between humans (father-son, ex-husband/ex- wife, etc), their challenges, their hopes and despairs, but it does not do a worthy job at that. It mostly sticks to the superficial clichés without succeeding to go any deeper. Although the movie is categorized as comedy, it is not even that funny. So all in all, watch the movie if you have nothing else to watch, but do it with low expectations.",Chef

You see, I thought that this might be a movie about a father that has problems with his ex wife, that tries really hard to reconnect with his son, a movie about a chef that tries to do his job that he loves but is caught up in the mess between an owner that wants only money and the ""food critics"" that want to be some kind of failed art critic, and that was what the first fifteen minutes of the movie tried to sell to me. After that is like they changed the whole film crew and wanted to finish it as soon as possible. It went straight into clisee mode and the father is simply explaing his feelings and problems, the son just understands like he is some kind of psichology major, his wife is secretly still inlove with him because why not, his boss just pats him on the back, the food critic actually loves him and everything just magically turns to be just fine. This movie is just fine. Not good, not bad, just a thing to throw away an hour and something of your spare time. Too bad...they actually god great cast but is wasted.",Chef

421,abinanaaa,Not What I Expected,2,8 September 2014,"I will not get into the particulars of why this is bad- all of the other reviewers have pointed them out (i.e. thin script, mediocre acting...etc...) all true. The entire thing boils down to a father son road trip bonding movie, which is totally FINE as a genre. But, from the trailers, the advertisements, the cast, and what I know of Favreau (Swingers, Made)that is NOT what I was being promised. I expected a comedy, this is NOT that.What I wanted (and coincidentally what I think would have worked) would have been a movie about a chef, stifled by a boss and food critic who figures out a way to do his own thing and proves to himself and to his poor neglected family that he CAN live his dream and make his family life work too. I expected some Anthony Bourdain- esque tirades and lots of back of house restaurant drama. I wouldn't have even minded the food-truck thing (since he needs to find a way to do his own food and has no money- look at that house his alimony was paying for???) or the twitter thing (as that is how a lot of Food-Trucks operate on word of mouth and buzz). The father-son on the road bonding bonanza=LAME. It has been done before, better. Everyone seek out the short lived TV series based on the Bourdain book ""Kitchen Confidential""- THAT is what I expected from this film's marketing. Go in prepared, perhaps none of the issues this film has will bother you. I do not agree with those who say it is ""un-watchable"", for fluffy ""independent"" reasonably low-budget pet project, it is well- made crap and watchable. But, you have now been warned.",Chef
422,bechan-03022,Food Truck Frenzy,10,31 July 2020,"I just watched the film Chef for the second time sense it came out back in 2014. I had forgotten how funny this comedy/drama was for me. This comedy depicts the pleasure of cooking good food chef's like us can have. I am no stranger to the love of food that this movie offers How hurtful it can be when someone you admire downplays or straight up talks unkind words about the food you poured your heart and soul into.
This movie has it all, food, drama, kids, and of course the girl. Filled with some amazing actors like actor and director Jon Favreau as Carl Casper. John Leguizamo as Carl's partner in crime since the good ole days Martin. Let's not forget about his son Percy, played by Emjay Anthony who just wants to hang with his dad and have a good time being together and learning from each other. Lastly, his ex-wife Inez played by the beautiful Sofia Vergara. If you feel a little jealous about him, well his girlfriend Molly is played by the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson. I wish all chefs were so lucky as Carl; when it comes to girls anyway. (Favreau, 2014)
Carl loves the food he designs so much, that he really does not have time for much else. Maybe this is what drove him to divorce from Inez who seems to still like him as a good friend that supports him and pushes him into new adventures with Percy after his dream career as a master chef is destroyed by a food critic. Carl wants to cook more than anything, so he goes back to his roots to start fresh. He wants this so bad that he is willing to put it all on the line and start a food truck with the backing of Inez's' ex-husband Marvin played by the one and only Robert Downey Jr. A somewhat eccentric and extremely wealthy man, he makes Carl suffer a bit before giving him a food truck that is trashed yet has good bones; possibly representing how Marvin feels about Carl. (Favreau, 2014)
The theme of this movie must be about following your gut to make your dreams come true even though that might not mean what you think it does. I mean in the end, Carl does not get the girl, but he does gain a great relationship with his son, and the restaurant of his dreams where he can use his creative genius. This gift comes from the man that once ruined him. In the end, it was all a misunderstanding between a critic and a chef because the critic knows Carl is amazing, he just wanted to get him out from his creative slump. (Favreau, 2014)
Chef is a movie so obsessed with food that it reminds me of a long time favorite of mine; Rattatouille released in 2007. This animated hit is about a rat (Remy played by Patton Oswelt) that has the same flare for food that Carl does in Chef. Remy is willing to do anything including letting a dishwasher boy take the credit for his masterpiece just so he can make people feel good through his food. Both movies use music to set the mood throughout as the soundtracks are brilliant. The director uses a subjective point of view with the camera throughout the film so that you can feel the immense emotions felt by the characters. Carl must find himself again while on a road trip to take the new food truck from Miami to California. In the end this movie is about finding yourself and relighting your soul through the things that you love. The only question this film left me with is; why do I not own a food truck?",Chef
423,kgcantillas,blogging to tweeting,7,5 August 2020,"Includes a ""spoiler""Film Review on IMDB
The movie Chef, starring Jon Favreau as Carl Casper ends up being an uplifting story about the transitions a passionate chef had to make after losing his professional job. This movie included a lot of major stars that played minor parts including Scarlett Johansson as Molly, John Leguizamo as Martin, and Robert Downey Jr as Marvin. Sofia Vergara plays Carl's ex-wife, Inez and the mother to Percy who is played by Emjay Anthony. The acting was very whitty and vulgar language was used a lot, but hey that's what you get in the restaurant industry!
There were three themes that stood out to me: fatherhood/family, hard work and pursuing what you are passionate about, and adapting to the modern generation, like using social media to your advantage. Carl was a great chef but working for someone else's restaurant he didn't have the free reign to create what he wanted to. Until an accidental tweet led him to open up a food truck where he showed his son Percy the importance of hard work and pursuing what you love to do. Percy was able to flip the negative impact Twitter had for Carl to a positive one. The old traditional menu Carl was forced to make matched the blogging tired ways, blogging works, but Percy utilized social media technology to help grow and market their food truck adventures! Opening up the food truck and taking Percy along the ride helped bond the two of them together.
I really enjoyed the cinematography of the cooking scenes. The beginning of the movie, it was very cinematic and professional while he was still in the restaurant, like the opening scenes. One of my favorite scenes is when he was cooking for the hostess Molly while she watched, talk about food porn! The camera angles and lighting worked magically during that scene. As he transitioned to their food truck adventures, those montages became more fun and vibrant! Between the cooking clips, the food truck gang, the crowd, and the music...it matched the fun experience of having a food truck.",Chef

426,johnsj-76659,Relatable Movie any Adult Will Enjoy,8,14 September 2021,"If you are into feel-good movies, this is the movie for you. The cast is full of A-list stars: Jon Favreau, Sofia Vergara, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey, Jr., and Dustin Hoffman. I can compare the movie to an adult-style version of Pixar's Ratatouille (2007), minus the rat. This is the perfect movie to wind-down and enjoy, but keep in mind that the movie is not kid friendly with it being rated R.The film's theme is based on one character's life, Chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau), mostly referred to as ""Chef"" in the film, and the idea of complexity of human relationships. Chef is a highly rated chef that struggles between pursing his true dream or staying with the structure of corporate practices. I advise viewers to eat before they enjoy this film as the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sounds. Every cooking scene was filled with sizzling hot food prepared in a high fashion. Chef pulling out a pan of hot, crispy, sizzling, perfectly cooked bacon from the oven would put any viewer in an imaginary food coma. The use of enhancing the sounds of food cooking and hearing the background kitchen noise gives the movie a certain je ne sais quoi. It feels like the viewer is one of the line cooks in the kitchen.Chef works at a high rated restaurant and the film shows the realistic side of a chef, even highly rated, struggling to see eye to eye with the owner of the restaurant. Chef wants to cook his own menu, but the owner is stuck is his old ways. After a bad review by a critic, Chef and the owner get into a verbal fight, resulting in Chef's unemployment.Chef's relationship with his ex-wife Inez (Sofia Vergara) would be described as they both play well together for their son Percy (Emjay Anthony). A viewer can relate to Carl and Inez's relationship because they act like a normal couple would right after a divorce. There are clear feelings still there, but their differences outweigh the similarities.Percy and Chef would seem to have a unique relationship, but as the film goes on, Chef is just another father trying to make time for both his passion and his son. Chef does struggle throughout the film on his parenting and building the proper relationship with his son. The filmmakers utilize the use of zoom lens in a scene in the film is when Chef and Percy are in Chef's apartment and they have a conversation about the divorce. Percy does not understand the reason for the divorce. The scene was in constant focus when the camera was going back and forth between Chef and Percy as they were talking. Some viewers can relate to this. Explaining divorce to a child can be difficult along with the divorce itself.Filled with ups and downs, most people will be able to relate to this movie. Even though Chef was highly acclaimed, he still had his various roadblocks and real-life struggles, whether it was his relationship with Inez, his relationship with Percy, and wanting to use his passion the way he wants to. Chef is filled with laughs and relatable moments any adult would enjoy.",Chef
427,maggie-208,Chef finds his way back,10,22 June 2014,"This is a well-told and entertaining tale of the journey of an artist stumbling his way back to inspiration to do what he loves and well as the story of a father and son finding each other. Love and redemption with food. The cooking of it and sharing of it left my mouth watering. Quirky and very ""indie,"" there are scrumptious side-trips with Robert Downey Jr, Amy Sedaris as a publicist, and Oliver Platt as the restaurant critic. I must mention the music. IMDb does not list the music supervisor here, but the soundtrack was delicious as well: Soul, Ska, Cuban, New Orleans, a great rendition of ""Sexual Healing"" by Hot 8 Brass Band and an appearance by none other than Gary Clark Jr. for a couple of live numbers! Did I mention I LOVED this movie? However, I do have ONE BIG ISSUE HERE! The very last scene was a gratuitous, contrived ""happy ending"" that I would find hard to believe wasn't added by some executive because they thought it had to be wrapped up like a nice little package. It left questions that couldn't be answered and it's a shame, because this was a perfect movie up until then. Still, it gets an A from me, The Movie Diva.",Chef
428,briandavidrobinson,Celebrity Chef Brian's favorite film ever,10,14 July 2019,"Jon Favreau's best work ever. He is the writer, director and actor in this amazing heart felt moment in the life of a chef at a crossroads in his life. The realism of how the chef goes head to head with the owner and the reaction by the staff is spot on. I have been through many cross roads in my journey as chef. The passion for the food, for the staff and for serving others comes across real and hits home. The challenges with family life and relation ships says it all. A chef's life can get all consuming and drag us in because of our passion for the service to others and the passion for our craft. The art of food is now about how artistic the plates are but rather the flavors that sing to us as a chef that we just lose ourselves in and then we get to share that to others and see them enjoy what we truly love from our soul. All of this is in the film. Mr. Jon Favreau what was your inspiration to write this story and to create this spectacular film. I am a huge fan of your work both behind and in front of the camera and have enjoyed reading about your journey as an actor and in the film/ entertainment industry. This is the best work yet. The cast, the crew and the chef's that helped coach you did your vision justice. It fans the flame of my passion for the culinary industry and myself as a chef every time I watch it. Thank you for creating such a wonderful piece of work. - Brian David Robinson aka ""Chef Brian""",Chef
429,sean-odonovan,Delicious,8,17 November 2018,"I got to see this a little late but so pleased I did. It's not a title that screams ""watch me"" but I recommend. The music, the food, Sophie Vergara, Miami, California, New Orleans and Texas - enough said. The film pops along at a steady pace, great dialogue, touching rebuilding of a father/son relationship. A reviewer had previously suggested, quite rightly in my opinion, that the movie is a metaphor for Favreau's own career - pulling away from the easy menu/buck and getting back to his true love. Really enjoyed this",Chef

So I didn't have high expectations for this movie. However, it turned out to be so good that I've seen it twice. The story, the acting, the cooking, and the music combined to create a wonderful recipe for a beautiful movie. You don't need special effects, explosions, and $100+ millions to make a good movie. All you need is a good script, decent acting, and perhaps some Cubanos :-) I left the theater feeling really good and happy.

433,vance172,Best movie this year,9,21 September 2014,"I've read many of the bad reviews and other than some confusion over the genre I'm not sure I understand their points. This movie is a foodies dream. It touches on the simple truths of food and brings it to its roots. I'm glad this movie wasn't about a chef who makes snooty French cuisine (which I love as well), but is made up of simple ingredients dealt with from a place of passion. The storyline is not original, but effectively tells the story of a boy and a man both growing up at the same time and the passages of manhood that are important for their relationship. It is well crafted and understands the psychology of a boy set in those circumstances. Jon Favreau's character may not have been complex, but stayed true to a simple man, which I have found to be more true to life then these unnecessarily complex people that become overworked and exhausting. Well done Jon. I enjoyed your storytelling fully and am going to go get myself a Cuban.",Chef
434,deemonbat,Good but Uneven,7,9 June 2014,"I liked the movie in that it was palpably made with passion for the project. It sends the message that true happiness will come as long as you are doing what you love for who you love. The uneven aspect comes from the three acts. The first act, when Chef is working for someone that won't allow him to shine, lasts too long. JF spends too much time showing that his main character is unhappy. I feel as though this should have been shorter if only to spend more time in the second act. The meat of the movie is in showing the road trip where he re-finds himself and discovers a relationship with his son. I think if they had shown more than the two city stops and shown more of the budding relationship between the Chef and his son, along with more regional recipes, this movie could have become a classic father/son movie. The potential to be put in the same category as Field of Dreams as a father/son movie was there for JF to grab but it slipped through his fingers. The final act was too short and didn't seem like a logical progression. there was little to show throughout that the wedding was expected. Not too mention that the whole movie was about the Chef not wanting to answer to anyone and create great food for the people. Then *Spoiler Alert* he goes to work for someone else and gives up his chance to be his own master.Good but Uneven",Chef
435,gabrieleohl,Hollywood fairy tale at its worst,1,12 August 2014,Unbelievabley boring! Terrible acting by Jon Favreau.

He walks out of his job one day and gets a food truck from his ex-wife's ex-husband! His former restaurant colleague joins him into an uncertain future despite a recent promotion to sous chef!!

436,kohnigel,"Amazing, truly amazing",8,23 September 2014,"The movie is honestly amazing.Having not seen a movie like this before, I think it opens up possibilities of a simple storyboard with great acting skills. Cameo roles by Robert Downey jr, and Bobby Canavale were just enough to set the tone. And I think John Leguizamo did a splendid job on his part. It blends a good load of comedy with a sprinkle of family goodness. It brought out the happiness of doing what you love and i think this movie sells that out so well. A delicious movie on its own and you just savour at the food on display. I think my only downside on this movie would be how they were unable to show what would happen to his original workplace or how his boss would have reacted. And it might have been draggy at certain parts of the movie. But it is not too big a deal in my opinion. Definitely worth the time watching it and I think for movie lovers, its worth giving it a shot",Chef
437,info-875-633358,Narcissistic Fantasy,1,16 February 2020,"The movie tells the story of a self-obsessed man-child who ultimately prevails by having everyone in his life feed his narcissistic fantasy without him ever having to engage in introspection. The Chef loses his job because he throws a temper tantrum and then plays the victim. His relationship with his estranged son is patched when his son enters the Chef's world. The Chef never has to show any interest in his son's life or interests and doesn't. His ex-wife (who is out of league but that is appropriate when remembers this is a fantasy film) comes back to him when he achieves success because the world recognizes his greatness.

438,oldmrhare,You'll probably love it if you're a Favreau or Twitter fan.,2,15 June 2014,"This flick plays like The Jon Favreau Show where stars come in to interact with host and a movie gets in the way.I had heard good things about this and I love food. What could go wrong? For a start, how about bad writing, a severed pig, stilted acting, awkward casting, and Twitter's first starring role in a movie? Here's the story: Divorced dad(Favreau)reconnects with his son and a forced emotional hayride ensues. Dustin Hoffman shows up for a while, so does Scarlett Johansson, throw in a Robert Downey Jr, cast a hit actress from a hit TV show, air out your anger with critics, and finish the journey with a Love American Style ending.I need to say, coming into this movie, I knew nothing about Favreau, the Director, Writer, Producer, Actor,and Cook. Once I read more about him the movie made a lot of sense. You get the feeling this movie is his thinly veiled effort to use the food truck as a metaphorical/biographical vehicle in which he can air out his love-hate relationship with critics.It simply makes no sense if you don't know Favreau. It still won't be a good movie if you a fan, but you will appreciate his effort.",Chef

440,maha-albadrawi,"A familiar recipe, expertly prepared and served with extra zest!",8,26 May 2014,"At an early point in Chef, the title character cooks a grilled cheese sandwich for his 10-year-old son, Percy. It's a familiar recipe —bread, butter, and cheese — but the way that the camera lingers on the melting cheese, and the care taken in how the food was served, made me want to reach into the screen and take a bite. If Chef were a meal, it would be comfort food. When comfort food is done right, boy oh boy does it hit the spot. Favreau directs and stars as Carl Casper, a celebrated chef at a swanky Los Angeles restaurant, whose creativity and integrity is compromised by the restaurant's controlling owner. After a video of him losing his temper at a food critic goes viral he becomes not only unemployed, but unemployable. With his reputation in shreds, he decides to get back in touch with his roots by opening a food truck and taking it – along with line cook and son - on the road, rediscovering his passion along the way.The pairing of sumptuous shots of food preparation with Latin beats is hard to resist for most audiences, and the food shots in Chef are so luscious and evocative that you can almost smell what's cooking. The music, sensual and spicy, is perfectly matched to the food. There's a beauty and a rhythm in the food preparation scenes and the amount of them included in the film is just right, so as not to feel over indulgent. There is also a lot of enjoyment to be had from watching the performances of the supporting cast, and perhaps this is because each of them play to their strengths: Robert Downey Jr steals the scene as Casper's ex-wife's other ex-husband who is rich, generous, and always looks like he's on the verge of doing something really crazy; Sofia Vegara plays Casper's sweet, sexy, well- meaning ex-wife, who he is still great friends with; John Leguizamo, always an interesting actor to watch, has fantastic chemistry with Favreau and the young actor who plays his son, and some of the more meandering scenes in the film are made interesting by his infectious energy; and Dustin Hoffman adds an element of compassion to a role that could have easily been reduced to a caricature. The stars featuring in the film stay firmly within their safe zone, and I couldn't help but remember what Hoffman tells Favreau early in the movie: play your hits, because no one wants to go to a Rolling Stones concert and not hear 'Satisfaction'. While this can have the potential to be boring, it bodes well for the film: we know we're in safe hands, and we're going to come out of this feeling satisfied. Special mention must be made of Emjay Anthony, who plays Favreau's son Percy with the perfect blend of maturity and innocence, and is really the emotional centre of the film. While the film is certainly a feast for the senses, at its core it's about restoration: restoring the father-son relationship, and restoring passion. It's hard to ignore the parallels to Favreau's own career: after breaking out in the 1996 indie hit Swingers, Favreau has in recent years become a director of the mega-blockbusters: the first two Iron Man movies, and the less well-received Cowboys & Aliens. Here, he cleanses his palate as a director and returns to more down-to-earth, feel-good fare (there's even a dead-on remark about Casper's/Favreau's ""dramatic weight gain"". Ouch). A familiar recipe made with great ingredients, Chef will leave you feeling satisfied.",Chef

So a food critic came by and the chef wanted to prepare a menu just for him but the restaurant owner wouldn't allow it, instead, the owner wanted the chef to serve the restaurant's usual menu which they have been serving for quite a long time. The critic was disappointed, the chef reacted, everything went viral, the chef lost his job, and even disappointed his already broken family. So his ex-wife made a proposition that he may try a food truck business so he can still cook and be happy about it, and be his own boss, so things get better, he has this bonding trip across the country with his son with a friend, and it might look like he may get back with his ex-wife.Watching this movie made me hungry. It made my mouth water and it made me grab a burrito. And that is why I like it. The movie moved me to grab a burrito and eat it while watching it from the start. It may not be the best food movie out there, but it's still pretty good, the acting is good, I mean some of the cast of Iron Man is here, minus Pepper Pots. And there's good use of current technology in this movie, by making twitter, vines, and iPhones crucial in the plot.It shows cooking good food, realistic use of current technology, and shows what usually happens in everyday life. It's a well written movie that not only makes you feel good but also makes you hungry for some really good sandwiches. 7 out of 10",Chef
443,klh5246-261-30844,"Chef, finding what was lost.",9,8 August 2015,"Chef is film written, directed and starring Jon Favreau. This is a film about losing oneself and finding it again. Jon Favreau is a Chef named Carl Casper. He is working at a restaurant owned by Riva, played by Dustin Hoffman. The two main employees working for Carl are Martin, played by John Leguizamo, and Tony, played by Bobby Cannavale. The film stars out with Carl shopping looking for groceries for a very special night at the restaurant. The well-known critic Ramsey Michael, played by Oliver Platt, will be dining at his restaurant that evening. Carl was a highly touted up and coming chef when he was younger. Even though the restaurant he works at does well, he feels he has lost his creative streak. He is using this night to help recapture that creativity that he once had. As he starts to prepare his meal for Ramsey, Riva prevents him from getting creative. Riva believes that the menu they have is good enough for everybody and tonight does not need to be special. Carl submits to this thought process and prepares the same old food for Ramsey. Once the review from that night comes out, Carl finds out that Ramsey was very disappointed in the meal. This is what starts the whole chain of events they take you through this film.After the negative review, Carl starts a bit of a twitter war with Ramsey, with help from his son Percy, played by Emjay Anthony. Carl vows to do a better job and wants Ramsey to come back that night. Ramsey agrees and Carl sets out to give him the meal of his life. During the prep for the meal, Carl and Riva have an argument. Riva does not want the menu to change, but Carl is determined to do better this time. Carl ending up quitting and then going on a trip to Miami with his ex-wife Inez, played by Sofia Vergara, and his son.On this trip he rediscovers what he loves about cooking. He decides to get a food truck and drive it back to LA. With the help of Martin and Percy, Carl once again finds the joy in cooking. He also uses this trip to get to know his son again. He finds that this is what he has been missing. After getting the truck together, with the help of Inez ex-husband Marvin, played by Robert Downey Jr., Carl, Martin and Percy starts their drive across the country. This is the heart of this film. This is the trip where Carl and Percy finally bond as father and son. Throughout the entire film, they keep showing all the different twitter feeds that are taking place. These motifs show the journey that Carl is taking throughout the film.Once arriving back in LA, Carl starts to slip back into his old behavior. They he watches the mini-film that Percy sent him. It includes all the different scenes, from their trip. This montage of their trip together makes Carl realizes that this is what is most important to him. Cooking what he loves and his family.

Robert Downey Jr. was listed as a star and he was in the movie for less than 5 minutes with a horrible roll. Scarlett Johansen was horrible and also in the movie only briefly. The same is true for Dustin Hoffman. I am a big fan of Jon Favreau, but did not like him in this roll. Especially, when he is supposed to angry. It is not believable.

I felt everyone was perfectly cast and came across as truly genuine. Some reviewers mentioned they didn't believe a guy like Casper could get two hot girls like Scarlett and Sofia. I totally disagree with that. I found him to be sexy and charming. And being a chef is a big turn on to some women, like when Casper made Scarlett Jo that pasta dish. She was loving it. I've worked in enough restaurants to know that really good chefs have groupies. Having spent 25+ years in the bar/restaurant biz, I found the kitchen/restaurant scenes to be very authentic. The chaos of it all. And yeah, there are some ""f"" bombs but that's what it's like working in a kitchen. All of the cooking scenes were awesome. They were shot so well. Great lighting, close-ups, sound effects. Very well done.The story, although pretty basic, was brought to life by the people in it. It's not an action movie, it's not a raunchy comedy, it's a road trip dramedy with a quirky cast and it's done masterfully well, IMO. Last but not least...the KILLER soundtrack!! A lot of music I usually wouldn't listen to but I loved it. I bought it and now play it in my car!This is just a feel good movie all around. I immediately added it to my all time fave movies list.

About half way through we get the tiniest twist in the tale and the story just suggests that what's written in Hollywood only follows the outline of documentaries about decent chefs selling popular food in LA today. The reason I think it was accepted by others is because it constantly gives a look at nice looking restaurants, delicious food, beautiful areas of the USA, and of course, Sofia Vergara. I'd say it was acted out reasonably well for what it is.This film is not one for me.

Awesome music (lots of blues) and perfect cinematography for the food made this movie really great for me. I could enjoy every minute and scene here. There are a lot of shots just about food. I got pretty hungry at these moments. So if you watch this, think of getting something tasty to eat before, you will enjoy it much more! I just thought about starting a cooking career after watching this and thinking about if I have gone the right way in my life, haha. So, yeah, the movie took me on a journey. I just can recommend watching it. pjac",Chef

Best film that I can remember for Jon FavreauEmjay Anthony (Percy) was the most fun character to watch.Sophia Vergara still is a an eye catcher along with Scarlett Johansson who had a small role in the film.I would recommend this to any friends who are looking for a nice heartfelt film that isn't too long.I enjoyed it and think you would too.",Chef
450,rag_rox,A must watch.,8,24 November 2014,"I love John Favreau as an Actor and Director, much respect. Saying that, it's quite obvious to predict that I loved this movie too.Chef is a great change from the usual drama that is being screened these days. If you're a food fanatic like I am, you're already sold for this movie in the first 5 minutes.But like many great potential movies, this one lacked a nice, interesting end. Don't get me wrong, I still liked this movie, I have seen it thrice already. But as the movie progresses, I had hoped that there would be a better build up to his business as a food truck chef. But rather, they focused on just one of his dishes that he created and on his bonding with his son. It was adorable. But it made me feel that the focus of the movie had shifted from its title and become more of a ""Dad of the Year"". It would have been really interesting to see what becomes of his business as a whole and how far does it go.If there is a squeal to this movie, I'm booking a ticket for it in advance. Amazing direction, amazing story and a great script. It'll be great if the next one focused more on his food truck dishes and it's creative products.",Chef
451,danyalabbasi,Very predictable story with boring twists,5,15 August 2016,"I started watching this movie because of it's good rating and impressive reviews but it wasn't up to my expectations. The movie starts with this guy whose a famous chef who works at a restaurant and loves cooking food. He is divorced and has a kid with whom he doesn't get much time to spend with mainly because of his work. His divorced wife is insistent on him getting a food truck but he's of the opinion that food trucks aren't for chefs. The movie continues with it's twists where he loses his job over a conflict on a menu that got the restaurant a bad review from a famous food critic, a rivalry starts on twitter between the chef and the critic over the review of his food. Finally, the chef gets himself a truck with help of his wife in Miami where he went with his ex wife to take care of his son while she was busy. The chef starts a journey with his son to bring the truck in presentable condition where his old pal from the restaurant joins him for help. They all start a journey from Miami to LA(where he currently lives) through different cities, where they sell their food, they get an amazing response from people and the chef's son gets them a lot of crowd from social media. Through this journey chef get's along with his son pretty good and they get attached with each other. The food truck also gets chef and his ex wife together, this business becomes successful and in the end the famous food critic tells the chef about how amazing his food is and to partner-up with him, which they do.In the beginning I thought the movie has got a lot to offer but gradually I realized that there isn't much. At some point I thought that the movie has some boring twists to make it long. Story was pretty much predictable, I knew he is going to get a food truck and that it will be a successful business. Things normally workout in movies on journeys with people whom they have issues with or with people whom they haven't given time to previously like in the movie ""Real Steel"", it also happened in this movie. This movie sets very high expectations in the beginning but when the movie ends it leaves you disappointed not because the movie is too bad to watch but because of high expectations in the beginning.This movie falls in the genre of comedy and drama, there is more of a drama than comedy. If there aren't many good options then only I would recommend this movie.",Chef
452,katmama-547-996704,Fantastic!,9,1 February 2015,"There are some wonderful messages in this movie.My husband and I truly enjoyed watching this, although it did not come off as a comedy...fine with us.What was REALLY cool is this movie was not filled with sexist stuff like so many other movies are.It was absolutely refreshing to NOT have naked bodies on the screen! We've gotten so tired of the usual trash/sex/drugs that are in far too many movies.Spoiler :)....you are likely to get hungry while watching this movie; the foods looked delicious!""Chef"" is a winner on many levels as far as I'm concerned.

It got the really cool cooking sequences, a sweet father-son story, picture perfect music and great acting, to mention a few.

Is it the greatest movie ever made? Is it an award winning epic film? Is it full of flashy cars and well-dressed characters? No, but here is what the movie does well (without any spoilers).Chef is a mix of familiar faces coming together to provide a nice blend of light comedy and light drama. A man who is at a rocky point in his career, as well as every other part of his life, has finally reached a cross roads. How he faces these challenges, how the story unfolds and develops, and how perfectly the food and the music accompany the story are all part of the unique charm that is Chef.I watched it with my wife and 12 year old son and it was perfect for a Sunday evening before the busy week starts.

Personally I disagree but regardless the message and the connection between an absent father and son is touching. The son only wanting fatherly guidance is not only warming, welcoming but for many it is soul searching. Every artistic endeavor touches people differently which is what makes this inspired film truly touching. As a single father to me this movie not only touched me personally but it pulled at the fabric of what it means to be a father, a man and mentor. Emotionally rewarding movie that the narcissist amongst you will hate it. For me personally it was one of he best movies of the year... So Money.",Chef

Because I came out of the theater totally satisfied, just like if I had eaten one of the out-of-this-world cuban sandwiches Favreau's character made in his mystery machine like food truck.The movie ended and I felt happy, it left me a warm feeling inside, the kind of feeling you'd have if you ate a bag of delicious beignets or after a night Sofia Vergara. 8 out of ten I would eat it.

459,kitwhitfield490,Jon Favreau serves up excellence in 'Chef',9,27 May 2014,"Last night I had the pleasure of taking in this film at the AMC Theater in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was surprised that I hadn't heard about this film, but when I was on the way to reserve tickets for 'Million Dollar Arm', I discovered that it wasn't playing in this theater. Upon walking back to the car, I noticed a poster for this film called 'Chef.'Still wanting to take in a decent movie for later in the evening, I stopped in my tracks and searched this film on IMDb, just to read up on it. The story follows the life of creative executive chef Carl Casper (Favreau) and his struggle with wanting to cook what he wants for restaurant owner Riva (played by the incredible Dustin Hoffman) who has a knack for sticking to the classics on the menu, and not the creative new dishes Carl wants to make. This of course cause a rift, and Carl to loses his job.The combination of his failed relationship with his wife, his recent job loss and scathing review from a top notch critic sends Carl to a breaking point. With the help of his ex-wife's ex-husband, Carl buys a food truck to get back to roots, and fall in love with cooking again. Close friend, and former co-worker Martin (John Leguizamo) flies down to Miami in order to help Carl achieve his dream. In all of this Carl's son, Percy (Emjay Anthony) craves to be closer with his father and eventually earns his spot to work on on the food truck, as they travel from Miami back to Los Angeles.I've decided to peg this comedy as the first feel good film of Summer 2014. The star studded cast, well timed quips, and intriguing story line make this film what I would consider to just be good cinema. Director, writer and star Jon Favreau has absolutely outdone himself in this film. It has been a pleasure watching his big budget and visual effects extensive blockbusters, but Favreau forgoes it all to go back to basics in his passion project, and serves up a delectable three course meal. If you're in the mood for a tasteful comedy, I would highly recommended 'Chef' for you.The film, now playing nationwide, also stars the talents of Robert Downey, Jr., Sofia Vergara, Scarlett Johansson, Oliver Platt, and Bobby Cannavale.",Chef
460,seven123777,Not enough adversity,6,14 February 2015,"Carl Casper doesn't get fired, he quits when he doesn't want to cook his dad's dishes. He goes home to cook his menu and then does absolutely nothing with it (doesn't take photos on instagram, doesn't invite Ramsey Michel over). Instead he goes and flips out on Michel at the restaurant, which doesn't lead to career detonation. His agent calls and says he can endorse products, have his own reality show ala 'Hells Kitchen.' He opens a food truck. His old sous chef miraculously appears to work for him for free. Every dispute with his son is wrapped up within minutes. His food truck is a hit in every city they go to. Kudos to Jon Favreau for doing the training required, because his prep skills looked professional, but this movie was more a foodie road trip USA than an actual movie that follows a 3 act structure.",Chef
461,BarretBeyer,Truly what a Chef deals with is represented in this Film,8,8 June 2014,"OK so i give this movie 8 out of 10 for more than one reason. First and foremost the actual struggle and bullshit that us Chef's have to deal with on a day to day basis with owners of establishments, food critics & ""Foodies"" is represented very well in this movie... almost too real. The ties and bond that Chef's have with their children (which i have a 6 year old daughter) is also represented very accurately in this movie. I love my daughter more than anything in the world and when it comes to my work, i spend tireless hours in a kitchen crafting my passion for food. Where i think the Film fell short was that it doesn't show what needs to be done to actually have an operational food truck in various cities. i doesn't go into detail about proper health dept regulations for different states and getting permits to operate is not a 1,2,3 thing. What does that mean for a lot of Chef's that see this movie? They will try to do their own food truck and realize how hard it is and possibly fail. The second thing i wasn't too fond of the film was that it didn't tie everything together so well at the ending. I am not a movie critic by any means, i am a Chef. I can relate to this film though in many many ways and think it was well put together with a stellar cast that represents every aspect of the life of a Chef.",Chef
462,brettws,"Food Porn, At Its Finest",7,1 June 2014,"I walked into my local AMC with the intention of seeing Chef, per a friend's recommendation, and expected to see a decent midlife-crisis comedy with some good food sprinkled in between. And that's more or less what I got-- which I'd say is a good thing.Without giving away too much, Chef is a film about a chef (surprising, I know) trying to find a healthy balance between his work, his passion for cooking, and caring for his family. The story is admittedly not the most thought-provoking or insightful script in the world, but expecting so from this film would ruin the heartwarming experience that Chef attempts to convey and succeeds at. Following Carl Casper's changing life and relating to his struggles as a common working American man is the experience that Chef is, and the simplicity of the film's story only helps to convey it better.",Chef
463,harisz4,Decent-not brilliant by any stretch,4,10 August 2017,the movie was like a 2 hour long advertising campaign for twitter. Was quite predictable and monotonous.There were no parts of the movie that were actually exciting. It was mundane. the acting of the lead character was strained in my opinion and i believe it did not fit the role.,Chef
464,davidamonroe,Was it Sweet,4,11 October 2014,"Wow! I struggled to give it a 4. It could have easily been titled Two and a Half Men and a Truck. I thought the writing was weak, the acting was average, and the ending was bad. Of course, I couldn't wait for the ending.Why 2.5 Men with a Truck? Well, the chef, his son and a buddy build a food truck that is an instant sensation. Do they stay in one place to become successful? No! They head out across the country on a typical buddy fantasy. The kid doesn't get lucky, but he gets his first French donut.How did the truck become so successful, the kid can use Twitter on his phone. Yes, it was amazing to everybody in the story.

465,v-andrey,"Awful, not at all charming",1,24 March 2015,"What a disappointment. Robert Downey Jr. appears for just 3 minutes. Awful acting by everyone, to the point you hate them and wish terrible things would happen to them. The characters are portrayed as ignorant wealthy people, with no grounding in reality. Few things behave in real life like they do in chef. Twitter does not behave as shown in the movie. The characters are put in illogical situations, and chose even more illogical choices out of the situation. No one is charming at all in this movie. In fact they behave unreasonably detached from each other, to the point that you cringe when you see them interact. It's like instead of talking to each other in the movie, they are sending small texts to each other. No emotion on there faces at all. The majority of the movie is dimly lit. The restaurants are unreasonably dark, all the windows in chefs apartment are blocked for no good reason. It's like the whole movie took place in a dimly lit smokey bar. The cinematography is crap, cameras are placed in poor potions. Really, I don't want to have to see chef's nose burgers as he is cooking. Who thought that was a good idea. This whole movie, and all the characters are pretentious, which would describes the whole movie. Everyone acts as if this movie is better than everything else. The music is a disappointment, and has nothing to do with cooking, Miami, or Cuban food culture at all.",Chef
466,MrKerbat,A movie about a jerk who gets everything to work out for him without any consequences.,3,4 April 2021,"Chef wants you to fall in love with the characters, but they all are two dimensional and rude. Carl Casper is a dead beat father, and that never really changes, he just becomes richer and more successful so his son likes him more. He somehow seduces all these gorgeous women with a head on their shoulder, despite him treating them terribly. The film pretends to understand and be hip with social media, but it falls short and comes off completely blind to how it really works. The film wants to be a comedy but most the jokes aren't funny or overly sexual. There's absolutely no conflict in the film, the very little it pretends to have gets solved quickly and easily. We don't even get to the food truck part of the movie, the very heart of the film, until there's only 40 minutes left of the film. And to top it all off, the antagonist food reviewer of the film easily forgives Carl, along with apologizes and fully finds him, even though Carl was clearly in the wrong for calling out someone for doing their job. While this film can be considered a feel good movie, it more so feels like Jon Favreau showing he can do whatever he'd like while ignoring the very laws of story, and the reason people go to see movies in the first place.",Chef
467,peter-o-karsten,Surprisingly boring,1,22 August 2014,"This movie sucks so much... you even get surprised with it. Looks like a boring dream of a fat man in which he opens his restaurant, has a son, who only wants to admire his father (that's all he needs, poor little robot)and divorce a super model that suffers of his infidelity with Scarlett Johansson. I don't know who is John Favreau, but his goatee is much more interesting that this tasteless crap. I need 10 lines to be able to post this review. So I want to add something here - words from another movie with Scarlett Johansson: ""This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again"". Don't even download it, boys and girls.

469,rafinsfp,"Enjoyable Movie but,,,",7,7 May 2014,"Although I really enjoyed the movie there were a few things I could not get past. Firstly, Twitter must have been a sponsor of this film, since it was constantly brought up throughout the movie. It was as if the movie was being interrupted by multiple twitter commercials covering: setting up an account, how to send tweets, twitters unique functions, etc. At times it did make of meaningful dialogue and ""flashback"" moments but I think they overdid it with Twitter mentions. Secondly, the cameo of Robert Downing Jr. whose character was once again a ""rich playboy with a sprinkle of neurotic"" for comic relief (No real point). Lastly, Sofia Vergara playing Favreau ex-wife was difficult to comprehend. Not only did the movie never really go into explaining their past relationship, but the scenes with them together via phone or in person lacked good dialogue and chemistry. I did however appreciate the Father and son relationship aspect, as well as the development of Favreau character throughout the movie.Side note, do not eat any food during the movie, there is just so much delicious food being shown on screen that any concession type food will only become more tasteless.",Chef
470,theresonlybigfrank,Brilliant Comedy,8,11 June 2014,"The way the film was wrote and directed was brilliant. Its the best comedy I have seen in a very long time. I liked the fact that it was so real in the hardships of being a chef and all the problems it could create, yet not to the point of becoming a sob story. Not at all what I expected from what I read in the blurb.Jon Favreau really showed what he is capable of in his acting. The range of skills he has shown in the film is amazing. The way he handles the role as a chef is as if he were a chef.The only things I think could have been a bit better is if he went a little more into his background and how he met his wife. It does touch on the subject briefly, but sort of expects you to know more than you do. The other thing I think is that Robert Downey Jr didn't have much of a part and maybe would've been better if he had more of a role and was more involved in the ending, as a pie in the face sort of ending. So my conclusion is that the start needs more background, the middle is brilliant, and the ending needs a bit more comedy",Chef

I give Chef a 8/10 for it's great comedy/drama story and the for the father and son bonding moments.Warning this movie will make you hungry.

I guess when you are the writer, director, and producer you can do fantasy casting like that. The story is a bit by the numbers but it won me over when they made an absolutely perfectly authentic Cuban sandwich.Nothing explodes and the R-rating is earned the hard way, through language alone. And with that cast, it's a shame. Nonetheless, like a perfect lava cake, it's a light confection with a gooey middle that stays just this side of cloying..",Chef

I could not laugh whist I was yawning to be honest why it has a 15 rating I will never know .It was so wooden it could have been made out of oak. It was boring as you can guess what the movie contained . We have seen this type of movie before , battered old van with fifthly kitchen furniture all shinny and new , and where did the chef get the money from to make a dirty old van into a brand new one and he has enough money to purchase all new kitchen utensils and heavy equipment. He uses his small son to scrub and clean the old equipment then the boy cook food , in the UK you have to hold a health and hygiene certificate and no person of that age would be allowed to cook food on a van , it is all wrong this movie and the Hollywood style of unbelievable Hollywood rubbish .Even the A list stars could not help this movie out of the paper take away bag .

474,jeffhickey123,"Don't bother, especially if you don't like gratuitous swearing",3,5 July 2014,"This movie took forever to move along and get to its defining points. All the while, you were forced to watch a glowering Jon Favreau and his cooking buddies curse nonstop and deal with and argue with the demanding restaurant owner, Dustin Hoffman. The dining room confrontation with Oliver Platt, the restaurant reviewer was downright ugly. Too much time spent on tedious close-ups of the chef in action, slicing and dicing and frying. After what seemed like the 50th F bomb, I walked out. The only thing good about this movie is seeing Scarlett Johansson doing what she does best, be incredibly sexy, this time as a brunette",Chef
475,charlenedavid,The movie is about Chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) and his journey to finding what he really needs and wants in his life.,8,8 July 2014,"I could not give enough credit to Favreau because the whole movie was wonderfully made. Especially, the message is about doing what you love without sacrificing your relationships with the people closest to you. Although the movie focuses on the story of a chef, the plot is relatable even to those with a different career and profession; I, for one, being a film student, could relate it to the tight standards of creating mainstream films and the freedom of doing what you love in independent films. Another thing I liked about the story is that it tackled the issue on how media and social networking sites could affect one's life; sometimes it brings good effects, sometimes bad. Although this issue is a serious matter, it was inserted in the film very flawlessly that it seemed like a light topic to be concerned about and not at all did it drag the story down. For the music, I could very much say that it was a crucial element for the scene and mood changes. Because the movie focused on the culture of South America, it was generally playing festive music, but I am amazed with how the film makers handled it especially when the mood is starting to be serious. Making the music stop during serious scenes was a really effective way of giving emphasis for the dialogue to be focused on and internalized by the audience. The music is paired well with the cinematography. It is smart of Favreau to do close-ups both with the food, and the actors. This camera technique, paired with the festive music, left me wanting to fly to America just to satisfy the craving I have of the food Chef prepares. In regards with the actors, the close-ups gave me a deeper connection with the message that they want to convey; as they say, eyes are the windows to our soul. Truly, this film is another success for Jon Favreau. It is as inspiring as it is mouth watering.",Chef
476,jmterry2014,Chef versus Bad Words... and the winner is --,8,17 July 2014,"If you've seen the film Bed Words with Jason Bateman end you liked it, then this film will surely please. They both cover the same emotional ground (""father-son"" bonding""). Although in the first, they are dealing with misanthropic father-figure, end in Chef they are dealing with companionable, sensitive, well-disposed man. Whether the backdrop is getting to National spelling bee or e taking traveling food truck cross- country, the final destination is actually the healing of wounded man by his becoming vulnerable to the needs of 10-yeer- old, sensitive adolescent. Both films are excellent, but f I only could see one I would choose Chef because the first 40 minutes of the film are near-perfect storytelling with incredible performances (by Stars in Cameo performances). Of the two, I personally related to Jason Batteman's charismatic but misanthropic orthographical Hun, whose only crime in life was to be born absent e father or role model that would have ""coursed"" him in decency. Whereas with Chef, the only obstacle to overcome is for successful, herd-working, petricentric pro-creator to wake up and smell the roses. This is e men that takes raw ingredients from nature end by application of his imagination end sheer willpower, he is able to create something extraordinary in the kitchen: he mixes, meshes, pounds, and prunes the earthy nutritional materials into various visually appealing culinary masterpieces (they make you went to leave the theater to dine.) It is no coincidence that you find yourself watching the film imagining the kind of masterpiece he will create of his son, if he would only apply that same raw imagination end talent to create something extraordinary (from disparate parts) on his erstwhile Progeny. Symbolically, this film expresses that cooking can be done in the kitchen with a chicken or, in the reel world with a child. All in all, you leave this film hungry, looking for New Orleans or Cuban gastronomy, end wishing you were ten years old again, end Jon Favreau were your proud parent --- cooking for and with you.",Chef
477,steveredler,Chef's Offering is Bland,4,5 August 2014,"Predictable plot with little character development. Couldn't they have had a little plot twist like a breakdown of the food truck or or getting inadvertently caught up in criminal activity? Most road trip movies have something unusual happen to them during the road trip. A little humor but not enough to be considered a comedy. As others have said, A Feel-Good Movie"". But not enough plot or character development to consider worthwhile to see in a movie theater. The relationship between the father and son was not developed enough. There didn't seem to be much connection between them, even when they had been together for most of the road trip. There wasn't much conflict between Favreau and his ex-wife. I didn't seem to understand why they got divorced. I liked the music though. Also I loved the role of the publicist. She seemed to be an exaggeration of a celebrity publicist but maybe that is how they are! The food seemed tasty but I had already eaten before the movie so it didn't make me hungry. Twitter seems to have been promoted throughout the movie. I wish I had checked IMDb before going to the theater.",Chef
478,robtaylormusic-72-291491,I Enjoyed This More Than the Lava Cake!,8,5 August 2014,"The most recent directorial outing for John Favreau comes with some hype, and with some baggage. Much has been made of parallels between his character here, a divorced chef with unquestionable talent and the director who has helped kick start a revolution for Marvel, given us the best Christmas movie of the last 25 years and yet struggled when given the ""freedom"" he desperately craves.Carl Casper is a one time ""next big thing"" who finds himself in a rut just when he gets the chance to impress. We meet him at a time where he seems to have chosen his kitchen crew and hostess over his rich ex-wife and their son although as they are Scarlett Johanssen and Sofia Vergara respectively kind of makes it hard to feel sorry for him.After he is, against his better judgement convinced to ""play it safe"" by his boss Dustin Hoffman when a famed critic comes in, things go horribly wrong and Casper is soon the new infant terrible of the cuisine world and a media sensation thanks to his lack of awareness of social media.What follows is a sometimes touching, sometimes ""cloying"" (you hear that word a lot in this film) tale of redemption, not by taking the obvious path as the publicist suggests but by going back to his roots with a food truck, his best (and only) friend from the restaurant who believes in him enough to quit and his 10 year old son.There are a lot of cameos that in someways detract but the real star is the food. This isn't full on Nigella style food porn, but ""soft porn"" in that you see glimpses of greatness but never the full ""Po Boy"" so to speak.Robert Downey Jr. is playing another billionaire type who is a bit kooky but this isn't a re-run of Happy Hogan and Tony Stark. Scarlett Johannson character is cute and clearly in love with Carl's food, if not a little bit with him but neither really does anything other than a fleeting nudge in the direction of the plot. Hoffman has a pretty crucial role and you initially get images of every Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmare over, but the character is right in what he says just not on that night. The characters who do recur are good value, John Leguiziamo is on excellent form and he has a great timing with Favreau and the younger actor, who also excels. Oliver Platt plays against type as the critic who causes the situation and it's one of my favorite roles for an actor who nearly always plays the nicest guy imaginable but even he is not a dick.The only ""dick"" in the piece is Casper himself, and there is a very moving scene where he hauls his son off the truck and he explains a lot about himself that really is summing up Favreau. He loves what he does and puts himself into everything he puts out, as an allegory it's pretty thinly veiled but even then he appears to check himself and make nice. It's also telling that the character doesn't run to Hell's Kitchen and make the easy money from his rant at the critic (that in itself would have been a fun film) but takes a more independent path, again classic Favreau.At times this actually feels like a far better version of Over The Top, with sandwiches instead of arm wrestling and a kid who wants to know his dad rather than an Army brat and an overweight, slightly boring dad rather than Sly. That's not a criticism because if you take this as a tale of father-son bonding then it's one of the better ones out there and most dads will want to spend that bit of extra time with them after seeing it.Most will probably see this as disposable fluff and to an extent it is. There are no Oscar nominations in the offing for this, perhaps a Globe nomination if they feel generous towards Hoffman. The product placement for Twitter is borderline embarrassing at times but the movie is a fun film that shows what Favreau does well, simple tales, told in a fun way and when he can create without interference or with the right backers, he can produce the best stuff you've seen, if you mess with his vision, you get a barely molten Lava Cake and probably a meltdown.",Chef
479,adamboursalian,"Lighthearted, Full and Captivating",10,18 August 2014,"Great date movie. Mr. Favreau's achievement with this film is one that should influence other directors. Make wholesome and thoughtful entertaining movies for the people. I think he also got enjoyment making this, and it shows in his portrayal of Carl. I hope all reviewers and patrons alike got the golden message behind this film. We all know of a few food trucks like this one that turned into a restaurant; an inspiring tale surely. Reviewers that turn a deaf ear to his message, and that of kevin smith, will see the lack of fruition in their own lives and careers. A reviewer has a powerful responsibility which many of them do not handle with kid gloves; honestly, but truly judging in reality. Even for a non foodie, I got a lot of enjoyment out of Chef. Go see it in theaters if you can",Chef
480,mswindell-95-228447,"Good idea, flawed but not terrible, some very funny parts",6,31 August 2014,"The concept of Chef is pretty cool, Jon Favreau's character was excellent, and there are some very funny laugh out loud scenes in the first third of the story. But there were editing/story issues with character intro/back stories, and the middle of the movie was extremely slow. Let's start with the good, some of the first 1/3 of the story was very funny - good writing and great performance by Favreau. Favreau's swearing chef divorced dad character was really well done, likable and believable - and funny. Favreau's twitter battle with the food critic is well done, and very funny, and the climax in the restaurant is worth seeing twice. But that's when then story starts to hiccup and slow down. Firstly, the relationship between Favreau and his son isn't clear up front, it's not clear that he's divorced or what his relationship is or was with his ex-wife until after it's important to know. This is a continuing problem with this movie, that important character relationships are not introduced upfront, leaving the audience room to misinterpret or guess as to the status or relationship until later scenes - when in fact the relationship and status was germane to the initial character introductions and scenes. While I like Robert Downey Jr. his entire character could simply be eliminated without affecting the story in anyway at all. In fact, it is never made clear what his gift to Favreau's character is - is it a loan? is it a gift? Are they partners? Downey Jr's character implies they are partners by stating some rules - but it is never clear whether he's joking or whether they are partners. And it's never addressed again in the story. I also never quite ""got"" Hoffman's character or delivery, maybe he'd have been better cast with De Niro or perhaps would have been a better use of Downey Jr. But the nice guy classic Hoffman delivery of a dictatorial restaurant owner just never quite seemed right, or genuine. There are also some pretty big leaps of faith the audience has to take, like that Leguizamo's character would actually leave his job and fly across the country to join Chef on his food truck after just a quick phone call. Or that a business offer of that magnitude would be made after eating one sandwich. These parts of the story seem to be very rushed compared to the carefully built up beginning of the story. There are some of the problems, and I think most could have been fixed in editing and a little better character setup in the writing. But Chef was still an enjoyable movie that got me to care about its characters and their journey - in most part due to the really great setup and Favreau's character writing and performance of the Chef, particularly in the first 1/3 of the movie.",Chef
481,eleventh-attempt,Fairy tale done family style,7,14 September 2014,"This is a family style fairy tale. The middle aged man throws caution to the wind and finds his bliss with nary a downside. His lovers aren't just gorgeous they are uber hot. The ex-wife has two ex-lovers who respect and care for her. She lives in tony digs with enough domestic help that the Whitehouse would be jealous. She also has a job that requires her to fly to exotic places at the drop of a hat but never seems to be doing any work. The young boy has divorced parents who aren't bitter,resentful, back biting, spiteful and using him as a weapon. Guess what? They get back together in the end. Isn't that lovely? Everybody in this movie is redeemable, even when somebody does something shitty it's TV shitty, in the same way TV ugly is a gorgeous woman with glasses and a bun. Finally, this is the kind of movie that tricks somebody into quitting their job and enrolling in cooking school. Terrible idea BTW. When protagonist cooks for his girlfriend she writhes around on a couch in anticipation like a horny alley cat. The last time I cooked for a woman she complained that I used a recipe, WTF? In any case, while I did enjoy the movie, as the acting was superb, the casting director did phone this one in. Robert Downey, Jr. plays the douchebag you love to hate, Sofía Vergara is hot and quirky, Scarlett Johannsen is just hot, John Leguizamo is super Spanish, and Jon Favreau is everyman. Give the people what they want I suppose. Ironically, the script is the equivalent of the menu so reviled in the movie. It's amuse-bouche, meant to delight your sensibilities but not to challenge them. The caution is if you watch expecting more than it promises you'll be disappointed.

But even without such expectations this film is worse than bad. With such an illustrious cast, I starting watching the film and kept waiting for a moment of redemption, which never came. On the contrary, the film starts somewhat promising but degenerates into a predictable, lousy story. It is a totally wasted opportunity because the ingredients were there for a good indy film: a chef that is tired of cooking boring food leaves his well-paid job to pursue his real passion, while juggling a challenging relationship with his son and ex-wife. However the film never delivers: the relationships are utterly superficial, the gourmet cooking scenes disconnected with the rest of the film, the character of Scarlet Johannson is confusing and unnecessary, the road trip boring and dull.

As someone who loves movies revolving around chefs, this movie did not disappoint, but it also added a very human element. The only very real problem was the music - every single time it played (which was quite often!) it was at a decibel much, much higher than the dialogue, which forced us to mute the TV until we figured dialogue was beginning again. The Sound Editor on this should never do this again. Every two or three minutes, the music just took us out of the film again.

490,jester_quester,"""Chef"" Review.. Warning-Spoilers-Warning-Spoilers",9,19 October 2014,"""Chef"" - A Recipe for SuccessIt takes so much more than a love for food to make someone an exceptional chef. In order to be true to one's passion one must also accept the sacrifices that come with success. The life of a successful chef is not an easy one, you will have NO weekends, NO holidays, and NO vacations. You will alienate your friends and become a stranger to those you love the most. You will criticize others food, their work environments, and their on the job mannerisms, and the worst part is you will rarely even notice yourself doing it. These are just a few minor glimpses into the spectrum that is employment in a professional kitchen.So often there are talented, enthusiastic, hard working men and women who put their entire futures on the line in hopes of becoming the next renowned culinary name. However the food industry is a fickle mistress and a rather unforgiving one at that. ""Chef"" is the portrait of a man who had a early rise in the culinary industry, made a promising reputation for himself, and then allowed himself to slip below mediocrity by becoming complacent with his job and himself.This is the story of a once sought after Miami chef, who migrates to the West Coast and found himself at odds with his career. He faces a perfect storm of challenges, a restaurateur with an outdated concept of ""what people want"", a critic who uses social media to make him the laughing stock of the entire nation, and an estranged son that craves the attention that an average professional chef cannot provide, and finally a personal passion that has reignited inside himself and has no suitable outlet which threatens to eradicate the very chakras of his entire being. This forces our protagonist to face his personal demons, free himself from the restraints from those who would see him fail, and embark on a cross country food truck journey of self discovery. ""Chef"" is a bright, robust, and flavorful portrait of of a man who needs to find the things he loves most in life in order to find himself.Jon Favreau, is one of my personal favorites, and also an incredible gift to the film industry. He is tripled billed as the Writer/Director/Star as he portrays Chef Carl Casper and he really did his homework for this one. He had the moves, he had the terminology, he had the painful passion that the restaurant veterans gain after years of the grind. Mr. Favreau blew me away with his performance, he was simply remarkable. John Leguizamo hit it out of the park in the role of Martin. There is a love and admiration between chef and sous chef that cannot be taught, it can only be learned, and Leguizamo fills the role like a veteran.The star studded cameo list in this film was mesmerizing. Favreau brought with him Marvel Universe alumni Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johansson, not to mention seasoned masters such as Dustin Hoffman and Oliver Platt. If you look really close you might even spot Russell Peters swing by for a quick bite. The chemistry between all of these distinguished actors was electrifyingWhen watching fictional shows about cooking I tend to look for the idiosyncratic missteps common to actors who have no real kitchen experience. There is a way to hold each specific knife, a way to hold each specific product you work with, and although these specific methods tend to vary by cook to cook, they still adhere to a consistency that is built bred from routine and discipline. I was so relieved to see these flaws had been anticipated and done properly. 'Chef' accurately revealed aspects of the kitchen life that most civilians don't see, the heat of the rush, the full line white out, the line out the door getting more restless by the second, and ultimately the comradery that is built and fueled by the love of food. To prepare this sexy dish, you will need:1 part amazing screenplay 1 heaping scoop of visionary genius Incorporate 15 pieces of phenomenal talent Mix well until combined Season generously with authenticity Allow to bake for four to six weeks at a budget of $160 million Allow to rest briefly and serve warm for a family friendly tale of loss, journey, and inspiration.Story: 2.8/3 Acting: 3/3 Effects: 2.6/3 Magic: 1/1Total: 9.4 out of 10 Cuban Sandwiches",Chef
491,robertdoranty2,General review,8,26 October 2014,"Chef, in my opinion, is both Tragic, heart-warning and funny all at once. The film follows a down and out, seemingly depressed man as he goes on a life journey in a food truck accompanied by his son and his best friend. John has out done himself this time.Definitely a must see. Visuals and cinematography are outstanding. The script is just fantastic in my opinion. The main good attribute to this film is,that it's easy to relate to. Featuring in this film with relatively small parts are the great Robert Downy Jr. And Dustin Hoffman. The film having many funny moments, also shows the different culture as they travel across America.Chef takes you on an emotional ride full of ups and downs. I would fully recommend this movie to all. It's not perfect of course but still great.",Chef
492,s-wak,awful,3,6 November 2014,"Awful. I'm not sure how it has scored so highly (it was over 7 when I downloaded). It looked a bit dodgy after only 5 minutes but I gave it time only for the film to get worse and worse. Only redeeming features are a good soundtrack, some interesting insight to a few US dishes and some good cameos by big stars (e.g. Robert Downey Jr, Dustin Hoffman) which bring about a few selective laughs. Woeful script, woeful idea, woeful plot and terrible casting! Ridiculous casting, the family just doesn't fit and there's zero chemistry between chef and his ex-wife. Don't waste an hour of your life on this movie! Download that cartoon with the rat in it if you want a decent movie about food! Not sure why the big stars signed up for the cameos. Must have been for free food or something. There's also some kind of annoying product placement/sponsorship deal with 'not going to name because it's so naff' social network. In parts it's even like a advert for this social network, barely veiled. Awful, awful, awful.",Chef

Although created in a Hollywood cast die, this movie still delivers a view into the world of a chef. I have been in the food business for 10 years, and this is the culinary movie I have enjoyed most since Eat Drink Man Woman. Anyone who criticizes this movie has never spent one minute in a professional kitchen. If you had, you would understand how producing a movie for the American public has to walk a fine line between the industry and Hollywood. Once you accept that, and appreciate the movie for what it is, you realize that you have a feel good movie that makes you smile, and gives you a little insight in to what it is like to work in one of the toughest industries to make it in on the planet.",Chef

The movie is about a chef who gets irked by an online critic. The issue gets snowballed in social media wars ultimately leading to chef losing his job. What goes after that ? You must taste it in the theater yourself. Don't except a incredibly motivating plot. It is not what the movie is intended to be. The way the food is shown to be prepared and decorated definitely makes you drool and arouses an immediate urge to eat something tasty (it happened for me). Jon Favreau with his Iron man fame was able to get rich cast for the movie like Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson. I doubt they would have accepted this petty roles, if it is not for Jon. Another prominent mention must be sexy actress with a Spanish accent Sofia Vergara - acting as Jon's Ex wife and Emjay Anthony starring as Jon and Sofia's son. Everybody blended really well into the movie.Finally, the movie is rich with all the ingredients which make up a good movie added in right quantities.",Chef

It has good script, good and convincing acting, good storyline and doesn't need clichéd plot twists to keep the interest going. One could be forgiven for believing that cooking is Jon Favreau's passion, that he is a good amateur chef in his own right and movie making simply his job. If this isn't the case then his acting is even better than it first appears. Even ignoring the well done and touching relationship aspect of this film, it joins the ranks of the great foodie films (eg Babette's feast, Julie and Julia etc) and shouldn't be missed. It has true joi de vivre. I live in a small rural town in outback Australia and I can tell you everyone I know who has seen this film salivates at the prospect of one day trying some of the cuisine Jon presents. Do yourself a favour and see this film. I don't think it's impossible this could get a mention at the academy awards - whether for script or acting (Jon Favreau).",Chef
496,seth_levy,Modern Family meets Anthony Bourdain,3,30 November 2014,"In keeping with our ongoing food in media culture (top chef, iron chef, survivor new guinea (cannibal chef)) we now have simply ""Chef"" the feel good ""indie"" movie of the year. Indie as in some really rich guys got together with some really famous, and quirky!, actors to make a movie. Don't believe for a minute that product placement (tweet) would have any place in an ""indie"" movie, or in independent internet reviews either. (Twitter me at #sethlovestwitter). Tweet, Tweet.The story unfolds with some really great sounding New Orleans style music, briefly raising my expectations that this would be based in New Orleans, have a New Orleans food theme, or even feature some bayou settings like that other indie movie I once saw about some black kid who wanders around the bayou a lot. Some fancy chopping soon made me realize we were being shown the kitchen of either a master chef or possibly a ginzu knife commercial, but that could never happen in an indie film. Nope, if the title wasn't a dead give away I soon learned this must be the chef guy as he barks out orders to his cheerful assistants step-olé and fetch-ye. Wow, this guy is really into dead pigs as he lovingly dissects the porker accompanied by the every encouraging Pancho and Cisco. Luckily before he can get a little too into this awkward pig loving, the chef is yanked from his sanctum to go pick up his kid from school. Now, before you run out to see this film yourself, I should warn you that pork, bacon, ham, deep frying, donuts, butter and more, all feature prominently in this drama. So all you vegans, kosher or halal loving people be forewarned.Is it any wonder W.C. fields warned not to perform with children or animals? The ""little miss sunshine"" of this feature is adorable Emjay Anthony who does a fine job of making his father and pretty much everyone else seem rather unlikable in contrast. We soon find that the chef guy is a divorced dad who has the usual Hollywood tribulations of trying to figure out whether to spoil his kid by taking him to amusement parks, or maybe just New Orleans. But chef is also down on his luck, we know this because his beemer is downright old but still cool in a classic kind of way. His unlikely ex-wife is played by the ever buxom Sofia Viagra who specializes in this kind of role a'la modern family. They could have just brought in the kid from modern family as well but he must be getting too old.Next we find out his boss doesn't want to let him do whatever he wants in the kitchen. Hey hang on a second his boss is DUSTIN Hoffman, Dustin freaking Hoffman! What is he doing running a restaurant? Maybe it's because SCARLETT JOHANSON works there! It all makes sense now. At first I couldn't tell it was Scarlett because her hair is all black, and she had matching star tattoos on her shoulders which completely camouflaged her appearance. Soon enough though Scarlett is up to her old tricks, curled up on the hapless Chef's bed but never quite getting down to it. I'm pretty sure this is the case, or maybe they just wanted to spare us the vision of this poor schlub's hairy back and tattooed arms enmeshed with our flawless Scarlett. Christ, it was bad enough when he tried to kiss her.As if trying to choose whether to bang Sofia Viagra or Scarlett Johanson wasn't enough of a trial, soon the Chef is laid out flat by a bad restaurant review! First Dustin is bossing him around and now this! Jeeze Dustin I can remember the day you were a rebel in an Italian convertible, now look at what a square you turned into.Take this job and shove it, and before you know it we are off to Miami to meet Robert Downey Junior. For some reason RDJ wants to give Chef a food truck, only it's completely wrecked. Don't worry though if Tony Stark can build an Iron Man suit from an Afghanistan cave you can bet that with a little elbow grease, a few life lessons for Emjay, and we are set to go all Thelma and Louise. This happens in less time that it takes to install the hydraulic lift jumpers in a low rider, thanks to our ever resourceful culinary sidekick Tonto-ye.They never do drive off a cliff, instead they just sell a lot of grilled cheese and pork sandwiches which lets the Chef get back to his roots and away from the daily grind of being paid exorbitant sums to to sprinkle caviar over an egg and then serve hot chocolate lava cake for dessert. Well after being mugged by a pack of south beach roller skating bikinis and the mall cop, it's next stop New Orleans (finally) where the Chef bonds with mini-me by introducing him to beignets. Never mind you could induce the same effect on any 10 year old by taking him to the Crispy Kreme in Riverside, do you want to imprint Riverside onto the child? It's bad enough the kid is already developing some disturbing voyeuristic tendencies involving his cell phone and internet videos.But don't worry the ever reliable Emjay is a lot more trustworthy with a camera than say, Paris Hilton, and before you know it Chef has re- conquered the food world, Sofia Viagra and captured our hearts in the process. Lets just hope he has the good sense not to let that vixen Scarlett work in his restaurant again.",Chef

So I looked forward to renting and watching CHEF. But 30 really-trying minutes into the movie, it becomes obvious that every scene is 5x longer than it needs to be and 5x less interesting than it could be. Moving at roughly the speed of wood, the film occasionally offers enjoyable performances from Sophia Vergara, Dustin Hoffman and Emjay Anthony (who plays Favreau's son, who is reaching out to his dad for a richer relationship).

502,missy-228-133040,Feel good movie with great looking food!,7,18 March 2016,"Chef is a movie about the head chef of a restaurant, Carl Casper, played by Jon Favreau, who has a war of words on Twitter with a food critic and ends up quitting his job before getting fired. With no job offers to work at other restaurants, Carl heads to Miami with his ex-wife, Inez, played by Sofia Vergara and their son, Percy, played by Emjay Anthony to spend time reconnecting. While there, Inez's ex-husband, Marvin, played by Robert Downey Jr., offers a run-down old nasty food truck to Carl. The movie chronicles Carl, his friend, Martin, played by John Leguizamo, and Percy driving the food truck from Miami back to California and along the way stopping and selling Cuban food.The central theme of the movie is finding what makes you happy in this life and doing it. The movie showcases how if you are miserable in one area of your life, such as a career, than how that can affect other areas such as your relationship with a partner or child. The film uses Carl Casper's love of cooking to tie to the theme. Carl appears to be happy in the beginning of the film, running a kitchen in a restaurant for someone else. He is being told what the menu should be and he is not able to create. Carl spends so much time focusing on the restaurant that he neglects his son Percy. Carl doesn't have the time or energy to focus on his relationships. Like the movie, Chef, another movie that uses the story of a chef is Burnt which stars Bradley Cooper as Adam Jones who had a rising career but destroyed it by using drugs. He returned to doing what he loved to do, which is cook.For the first part of the movie, the lighting is dark which helps to create a depressing atmosphere. Carl's apartment is dark, very little natural light that comes in. Occasionally you get a glimpse of Carl's passion for cooking like when he is fixing a meal for Molly, played by Scarlet Johansson, or when he was cooking a grilled cheese sandwich for his son. It was almost as if he was dancing to the sounds of the food being cooked. He was taking great care to make sure that it was perfect. When Carl, Inez, and Percy head to Miami, the lighting become brighter, more energetic, you can feel the excitement rising in Carl. The soundtrack for the movie helps to set the tone as the movie progresses. In the beginning the music seemed to be more subdued and as the movie progressed along, the music helped to create excitement, joy, and fun. The theme of the movie reminds us that we need to find what makes us happy and satisfied and carry that into all the aspects of our lives, not just our careers.",Chef
503,reginarizzo,It was a pleasure,8,3 February 2015,"It was a pleasure to experience. It was as if the endearing fool that put Favreau on the map in Swingers grew-up. The reason America first fell in love with Favreau is because he has his finger on the pulse of our generation with a quick wit and Chef solidifies this. Chef speaks to issues that are universal, the divide between generations and how to connect with family while addressing problems specific to our generation, transitioning into the tech world and negotiating family with divorce. He does this, as usual, with painfully honest jokes and heart-warming relationships between characters. The music made me want to move and the themes were inspiring. The poignant humor and mid-life confrontation with dreams of success made me fall in love with Favreau's film making all over again. Road trip anyone?! Thank you Mr. Favreau.",Chef

506,amber_ae,The movie Chef is a very fast pace film. The main focus being in the kitchen of Gauloise restaurant.,7,7 May 2015,"The movie Chef is a very fast pace film. The main focus being in the kitchen of Gauloise restaurant. The head chef and main character of this film Carl Casper is restrained from being the creative cook he wishes to be. Some other main characters in this film are Carl's son Percy, the owner of Gauloise Riva, Carl's ex- wife Inez, and there are a few others you will see play a big role in Carl's life. Jon Favreau is one of the producers of this film and he also plays the lead role as Carl. The producers use a lot of quick screen changes during conversations between the characters which goes along with the fast pace aspect of the film. You can see the passion and love for food that Carl has throughout the film. Another film showing the appreciation for food is the Disney's film Ratatouille. Although it may seem to be an odd comparison, but Remy (a rat) in Ratatouille too has a dream of being very successful in the culinary world. Without going into too much detail and spoiling it for those who have not yet seen this film, Carl cooks for a big well-known critic named Ramsey Michel. Ramsey reviews the restaurant as well as Carl in his blog after his experience and it is not the good review Carl was expecting. There is a lot of focus with Twitter between Carl and Ramsey after Ramsey's food review. Carl sends Ramsey an insulting private message to Ramsey, or is it a public tweet? Then begins a twitter war and leads to another challenge for Carl to impress him. All through the movie Carl has a passion for being creative with new recipes and expressing himself through the culinary art, but he is set to limits by Riva. Carl decides to open a food truck serving Cuban sandwiches and yucca fries and specials depending on what city they are in. Carl and his son Percy work together in the food truck which makes they extremely close.",Chef

It made me feel so content and want just to experience live more and more. Jon Favreau had an excellent performance! He was playing it so well. I forgot it was a movie, I was watching him a real life character. Emjay Anthony, well done! Sofia Vergara is so beautiful and plays a great happy and positive mom. Love the accent! Overall, I would highly recommend this movie for all family and also anyone who wants to bring their mood up! When I watched the movie, I felt I wish I could live that movie: travel in a food track all over USA and Canada selling great original tasty food.",Chef
508,chrisan-39739,Does not make a good impression,2,30 April 2015,"The movie seemed to be quite promising but turned out to be extremely drab. The story is partially borrowed from the animation flick Ratatouille. The dialogs are unimpressive and there are plenty of unnecessary characters who just do not belong. The movie accomplishes nothing. Rather, in the end, it destroys the very ideal it started out to protect--the independence and self-esteem of a chef who is trying to combat the stringency imposed by the restaurant owner. An initially hostile food critic ends up funding a restaurant where the chef is given an opportunity to prepare his delicacies. The chef simply abandons the food truck which was the reason why he shot to fame. This is an incredible downer. I don't find any reason why one should call this a feel-good movie. The chef practically goes back to the drawing board, massacring the chances he had at developing an independent food truck business. What should we feel good about? The fact that the chef remarries his ex-wife? Even that is ludicrous as there is complete lack of emotion in the depiction of this relationship. It remains a mystery why the chef and the ex-wife get hitched again. Absolute dearth of logic and reasoning. The only plus in this movie is the chef's son. He drives the whole course of the movie. But the father-son bonding does not come out flawlessly. There are parts when they don't appear to be getting along at all, and in the next moment, they gee and haw pretty perfectly. In my opinion, this movie is not watchable. One is sure to regret the time wasted over this berserk flick.",Chef
509,shedeceives,"Great movie, light hearted and funny.",8,3 May 2015,"Aside from the food porn which would grab the attention of a chef or anyone with an interest in food and cooking, the story brings a sense of teamwork and family together. Its done in a way that plays on the heart strings along with the humor of real life issues. Even the most novice person in a kitchen will learn plenty about the differences between a chef in a restaurant that loves what he does and someone who is willing to take the risks necessary to make it on their own. Overall, i believe this movie is suited for any age and gender. All around its a heart warming family movie that hooks you with the reality of an everyday person doing what they love.",Chef
510,ellinronee,A Wonderful Film without the Gratuitous Nod Toward Nudity and Violence,9,21 May 2015,"Films must be critiqued for what they are. For their genres and intentions. So those people who see this as insipid because it's not Ingmar Bergman, well, it's not supposed to be.Chef is beautiful and colorful, well-acted and well-written. And, as is the case with other well-developed comedies, it has it's own depth.Chef Casper, the main character, has to deal with losing his job and having an identity-crisis. However, as a result, he discovers a whole other part of himself. He finds that he doesn't need a title to create food that others love. He goes for simple. He gets a food truck. No bosses, no compromising. No sucking up to reviewers. Best of all, he gets to take his son with him and eventually reconnects with the woman he loves.Chef is funny and pretty and well-acted and the music is GREAT. Written,directed, starring and produced (with 2 others) by Jon Favreau this film is a success on every level. What I really appreciated is that Favreau doesn't compromise when it comes to cast or music. From Al Green's ""I Don't Want to Be Alone"" to Perico Hernandez, it was fun.Maybe Chef is self-indulgent, as some reviewers claim, but if it is, it was done just right.",Chef

Then, he got a bad review from a critic, and leave the restaurant! Then what? He opens his own restaurant, with his own recipes (at the beginning of the movie, we can see that he could do much better than actually) and become very famous thanks to the quality and the creativity of his way of cooking. And gets his revenge from the critic (like in Pixar movie ""ratatouille"")But none of that happened!!!!!!He bought a food truck, and start cooking junk food, non-healthy food, without any creativity!

Well instead of reading this review you should really start watching the movie of the century, ""Chef"". Anyways, thank you for reading the review.

If I were at home, I would have shut it down after five minutes.The movie has no plot, the jokes are weak, and the only things worth mentioning are stunning Sofia Vergara and Scarlett Johansson (what's with the hair?).It would make sense if after watching all that food in the movie, the actual chef was selling the real one in front of the cinema.I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.

515,MFEDEN,"Excellent, heartfelt family drama",9,11 March 2016,"Jon Traveu plays the role of Casper, a Chef that's struggling to keep his family life together and feels limited in his artistic freedom in his job. Eventually he gets tired of being told what he can and can't cook and loses it, becoming a viral sensation on the internet and Twitter for melting down in public and in front of a renowned food critic. In an attempt to salvage his family life and salvage the relationship between him and his son Percy by taking a trip to Miami with his ex-wife and Percy and to relax and forget about the loss of his career and his public meltdown. There he meets up with Melvin, the ex-husband of Casper's ex-wife who agrees to help him set up a business selling food out of a van, with the help of his tech-savvy son using the Internet to market and promote their business online and cultivate his crumbling relationship with his career-focused father.The cast for this movie is fantastic, there's a few well known actors in there such as Scarlett Johansson, Dustin Hoffman, Sofia Vergara & Robert Downey Jr. and some lesser known ones that come out on top with an overwhelmingly excellent performance such as Jon Traveu, John Leguizamo and young Emjay Anthony. The whole film is heartfelt and warm, it's definitely a feel good movie and despite not relating to it any way the emotional power it delivered was one I could feel strongly. The film markets itself as a comedy and that's certainly true, but it's so much more than that. It had it's share of funny moments but none of them were over the top and all of them were at the right juncture. Just when they needed to be there. Everything flowed so naturally and nothing felt out of place. Remarkably cliché-free this movie was one I'd heard good things about but yet I found myself liking it much more than I thought I would originally. Stellar performances from everyone involved in this film. The only thing I can call the movie out on is that the movie is sort of predictable, but it's hard for it not to be. Overall a fantastic movie about a Chef and his relationship with food and his son. Definitely something I'd recommend or watch again.",Chef

We have, however, come to a conclusion as to what their symptoms are. These include: Making incoherent sounds, almost uncontrollably, but these could be a warning from within his own body. He could be crying out from the inside, imprisoned in his own former shell. It's sad truly. Another symptom is his hair color. I haven't known him all my life, but I have studied him for multiple years. His hair has an orange hue, and he could have been born with it, or it could have developed over his life. Sadly, Lucas, whom we have all learned to love, even with his crippling disability, is on the verge of losing what shred of life he has left.",Chef

The movie itself was a bit long, and I found myself checking how long was left. Clearly a Jon Favreau vanity project, there was far too much meat in your face. The music was good but the morals were cheesy. The characters were likable, even though the story line was not. Why would you walk away from a woman that loves you and wants you to be happy, to a woman with a cracking figure but only wants you when you're successful, even if you do have a kid with her? There were health and safety issues throughout the film, but Nina remained full clothed. Found myself waiting for something to happen, but it never did, although I loved the women who were completely unbelievable as Jon Favreau would not pull either and she's not even Cuban. It was fine and nice, but how did he afford that kitchen in his flat? I just thought ""Bore off Max!""",Chef
520,parichita-40578,A simple family movie with the touch of taste and cooking,7,12 November 2016,"The movie was interesting. A chef hitting the rock bottom and opening its own food truck. Pursue of professional passion. I loved the characters of the movie-- his sidekick, his son, and even his wife. Even though there is a lot of ""suspension of belief"" in case of the love life of the chef-- I think I found that refreshing, rather than irritating (like some of the other people). Though these differences initially distracted me, but then I think I was okay with the fact by the end of it. I guess mostly because romance was never made an out and out issue with it. It is a story of a chef realizing his dream and passion. It is a story of a father forming a bond with his child. The food shown in the picture look quite delicious, so don't watch with an empty stomach. Overall an interesting movie.",Chef

Very believable story and performances. The story takes us through a journey that the father-son duo embark on. A journey where their relationship with each other and with the audience matures and strengthens. Frustration, loneliness, love, all surface with deep authenticity. To top this beautiful movie are Sofia Vergara's accent and her smile. There is a guarantee of not getting bored while the family explores the intricacies of relationship through passion for cooking and the search for happiness. Irrespective of how you watch it, through a philosopher's eyes or through the eyes of a laid back engineering student, this movie will treat you delicacies whose taste shall linger for some time after the journey ends with a sweet note.

The cast was fine, as was the plot...maybe a little disjointed and stretched, but not to the point of distraction. I am not sure why they couldn't have kept the story entirely in L.A. but certainly that's just quibbling. However I find all the Twitter references and social media reminders to be a turn-off.

526,mwedelheit,Sosososo good,9,13 October 2018,"Some people eat to live, but Chef Carl Casper lives to eat. He has a talent for making delicious food and it ruined his life. His wife and son cannot live with him because he is obsessed with his success in the kitchen. His drive costs him his job in the end after a dispute with his boss. The movie follows his story as he travels with his son and best friend across the country cooking traditional Cuban food. Although some may believe that Chef is a superficial and inconclusive, the journey of passing on the tradition of cooking from a father to a son is captivating and meaningful to everyone, If captures the ""ups and downs"" of life and couples the sad realities with sarcastic and aggressive humor. 
 Since Christopher Columbus discovered Cuba in 1492, Havana has been a major hub for trading and historical enhancement. Different cuisines, from Spain, Africa, the Americas, and the Carribeans entered their port and influenced the native Cuban cuisine. . When Fidel Castro declared his country communist, their relationship with Russia, the world's bread basket, strengthened. Where Africa introduced plantains and quimbombo (a stew base made from okra, pig, and other vegetables), Russia gave Cuba foreign wheat products. The rich history of Cuban cuisine and the integration of different cultures and flavors the Cuban kitchen a place creativity, diversity and creation
The infamous Cuban sandwich, ""Cubano"", is thought to have originated when undocumented cigar and sugar workers travelled freely between the Florida Keys and Cuba. It was a popular cafe lunch for the immigrant workers and a play on the common American ham and cheese. Influences from America and Cuba are seen in the ingredients. For example, ham is an American classic while roasted pork is a staple in Cuban cooking. Before we saw the influences of different countries on food, but the ""Cubano"" is an example of two distinct cuisines combining to create a dish that is unique to both countries and equally enjoyed. 
For Cuban chefs, passion, creativity and innovation are necessary for a successful kitchen. For Chef Carl Casper, when his boss, Riva, demanded he cook a common and unchanged menu for a well renowned food critic, his creativity and hopes for a favorable review were squandered. After eating a 
""bland"" menu, the critic, Ramsey, insults Casper's cooking. The resulting tension between Riva and Capser cause the two to separate. Now unemployed he seeks help from his ex-wife, Inez, who is the primary parent of their son, Percy. She recommends that Casper spends time with Percy to mend their relationship that was strained due to conflicting interests: Casper's interest in the kitchen and Percy's interest in technology and social media. 
He also seeks help from Inez's other ex-husband Marvin, a millionaire, who gives Casper a second-hand food truck as a ""pity gift."" With help from Percy, and Casper's best friend and sous-chef Martin, they renovate the truck and transform it into a sensational Cuban food truck. The truck travels across the country, gaining more attention in each city thanks to Percy's talent with social networking. Percy and Casper bond while they are ""on the line,"" kitchen vernacular for cooking the food, handling the orders, taking the money etc. Casper gives Percy his first chef knife and teaches him how to make a proper Cubano sandwich. The scene is symbolic of Casper reconnecting with the personal side of cooking. While he worked at his previous job his wings were clipped and he lost sight of the meaning behind his food. Once he taught his son how to cook a Cubano, the tradition and the skills were passed on. Travelling in a truck and cooking with his friend and son rekindled Casper's passion, and innovation for cooking. 
The truck becomes so successful that Ramsey returns to critic Casper's cooking in a different and more creative setting. Ramsey raves about the food, and offers Casper a job as head chef in a new restaurant where he will have full control of the menu. The movie ends with Percy returning to school but working with his father in the kitchen on the weekends.
 The movie shows the personal side of cooking. When we order food at a restaurant we read the dishes and only see the words that are printed on paper. We rarely recognize that behind the words are chefs that have tested, altered, and created a dish that captures their passion and emotion. The art of home cooking displays love and care for the people you are cooking for. Although home cooking is semi-obsolete in the modern age, with the availability of fast food and delivery, the relevance of passing a tradition from generation to generation carries more weight now than ever. If the people of this generation do not listen and learn the style, technique, and passion of cooking the skill will be lost. Chef enforces the importance of passing on the tradition. It inspires those who watch it to cook, and experiment with food and share their creations with their close friends or family.",Chef
527,jamabushi,A pleasantly satisfying and unexpectedly tasty treat,8,1 June 2014,"I went into this movie on a whim, on one of my double feature days, with this as the second. I will say that I'd been interested, from seeing the trailer, but not necessarily planning on it being a cinema viewer. How glad I am that I did! As others have said, the culinary cinematography is delightful, especially if you have any ""foodie"" in you, but that is just part of the visual treat- this becomes a road movie as well, with locations treated with unexpectedly non- touristy gusto. It is also a character study, with Favreau showing chops I had no idea he possessed- not the funny-man/straight-man sidekick, but a subtlety that impresses with its depth.Supporting man Leguizamo is a favorite of mine, but I know he can tend to 1-dimensionality at times. Here he fills out slightly more, while still being recognizably himself. The cast of other actors is a veritable feast of talent that really makes this a well-seasoned gumbo. Vergara is solid, and the kid who plays Chef's son is really quite good, as well; ""cute kid"" enough for emotional connection without being cutesy. Okay, enough food metaphors-this one is worth seeing on many levels. I don't know what audiences are like in your area, but this is the first time I've heard one in my local cinemas applaud at movie's end! It was deserved appreciation for a worthwhile effort. It's not Jarmusch arty, and it's not Iron Man bombast, but a lovely course in between. To paraphrase The Most Interesting Man in the World: I don't always review movies, but when I do, it's a damn decent one.",Chef
