0,MartinHafer,A lot closer to the book.....,7,31 December 2011,"I've gotta admit....I'm cheating a bit on the summary. I have never read J.M. Berrie's story ""Peter Pan"". But, my oldest daughter has and sat with me to watch this film and contributed a lot to the review--telling me how close and how different the story and film are. While this movie version is MUCH more adult than the cartoon, the book apparently is even more adult--such as having Peter apparently kill the Lost Boys when they get too old for Neverland! Yes, this IS NOT a story for little kids! In this version of Peter Pan, the story is quite a bit different from Disney's famous cartoon. Captain Hook kills quite a few people, Tinkerbell is even nastier and the film shows the depressed mom pining for her children after they've disappeared. The book, apparently, was darker. What is much different from the book, though, was the emphasis on romance between Wendy and Peter--as, in the book, Peter had little interest in this sort of thing and just wanted to play and live in the moment. I think they added this sexual tension (ewwww!) to try to make the story more cinematic. I think despite this, the film did strike a decent balance between the darkness of the story and how dark to make the film--but I would NOT recommend the film for younger viewers.One final word about the film. Despite good acting, too often I was distracted from this because of all the crazy filters that were used on the print. I am not sure if this was added later using computers (I assume this is the case), but too often it really was hard on the eyes and distracting.Verdict---worth seeing and MUCH better than ""Hook"". Still, despite being very different than the book, give me the Disney version.",Peter Pan
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Near-perfect film, about the boy who never grew up!",9,30 April 2009,"This film is amazing. I also really like the Disney film, but I was really unimpressed by its sequel. Both this and the Disney film are superior to the sequel Return To Neverland, and I also recommend the animated TV series Peter Pan and the Pirates, with Captain Hook at his most complex.I have only two flaws with this film. First, it isn't as complex and meaningful as the book by J.M.Barrie, which I think is one of the best children's books ever written. Secondly, likewise with Bobby Driscoll, the voice of Peter, in the Disney film, Jeremy Sumpter mayn't be to everyone's taste, as he doesn't quite live up to the playful and rather likable character in the book, but it is still a spirited performance.However, this film has a huge amount to recommend it. First of all, is the gorgeous scenery and the cinematography. Such beautiful and vivid colours, that left you in wonder and wanting more. I also liked the fact, the producers made the film darker than the book to some extent, like making Hook more complex and more suave, an idea that they didn't quite explore in the Disney film. The acting was very good indeed. Rachel Hurd Wood is the picture of innocence as Wendy, and Richard Briers does more than a capable job as Smee. Plus Ludivine Sagnier was awesome, one of my favourite interpretations of Tinkerbell actually. Stealing the acting honours, like Dustin Hoffmann, like Hans Conried, like Tim Curry(in the animated series), is the wonderful Jason Isaacs, in a sometimes terrifying portrayal of Hook. And seriously he should have got an award for his brilliant performance. The music score was lovely too, very fantasy-like and sparkling.In conclusion, a beautiful film, not as good as the book, but there is a lot to enjoy here. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Peter Pan
2,SnoopyStyle,Wendy on the edge of adulthood,8,17 November 2013,"This is a much more sexualized Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood), and Aunt Millicent (Lynn Redgrave) wants to teach her while banning her from the nursery. She is on the edge of becoming a woman. Mr Darling (Jason Isaacs) is trying to climb the social ladder. On her last night in the nursery, Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) and Tinker Bell (Ludivine Sagnier) intrude on their lives.There is a lot of talk of kisses. Wendy is resisting the pull of adulthood but there's something happening between her and Peter. It seems to be taken a different tack on the never growing up aspect. It is diving right into the teenage hormones pool. It is a rather dangerous swim seeing how Rachel Hurd-Wood was no more than 12 at the time. In the end, they pull back before anything truly scandalous happened. It's quite a risky proposition to sexualize a children's fantasy. It is darker and not really the same as the Disney classic that everybody knows about. This one did it in a tasteful manner. The CGI especially Tinker Bell looks great. Ludivine Sagnier is actually able to act as a member of the cast. Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan is too effeminate. I think it's the curly hair. Everybody else does a good job. It's a darker Peter Pan movie with an edge.",Peter Pan
3,claudio_carvalho,A Delightful Version for Adults and Children of a Classic Fairytale,8,26 December 2004,"The tale of Peter Pan, Wendy, Captain Hook, Tink, Neverland and the crocodile that ate the hand of Captain Hook with an alarm clock, is told again, in a delightful version, for adults and children, of this classic fairytale. The story is magnificent and the special effects seem to be state-of-art, making the movie very beautiful and a worthwhile entertainment. However, I believe that the important role of Peter Pan deserved a better actor, since Jeremy Sumpter is expressionless in most dramatic situations, keeping the same face along the movie. Another weak choice is Ludivine Sagnier, who is not funny in the role of Tink, using grimaces trying to joke. She is an excellent actress, but she did not fit well to the character of Tink. The pirates are excellent, and belongs to Captain Hook, Smee & Company the best parts of the film. The other children have also great performances. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Peter Pan""",Peter Pan
4,jboothmillard,Peter Pan,5,30 January 2008,"I only heard of this film because the third Harry Potter film wasn't ready, so this was the film that pretty much replaced it for the Christmas period, from director P.J. Hogan (My Best Friend's Wedding). You know the basic plot, the Darling children: Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood), John (Harry Newell) and Michael (Freddie Popplewell) are all adventure seekers, and are whisked away by the boy who never grew up, Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) and the magic dust of Tinker Bell/""Tink"" (Ludivine Sagnier) with their happy thoughts helping them fly to Neverland. Then the rest of the story is just the pretty scary Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs, also playing Mr. Darling, and his hook on the right instead of the traditional left) trying to catch or kill Peter and the other children, including The Lost Boys: Slightly (Theodore Chester), Tootles (Rupert Simonian), Curly (George MacKay), Nibs (Harry Eden) and the Twins (Patrick and Lachlan Gooch). Also starring Lynn Redgrave as Aunt Millicent, Richard Briers as Smee, The Sixth Sense's Olivia Williams as Mrs. Darling, Geoffrey Palmer as Sir Edward Quiller Couch, Carsen Gray as Tiger Lily and Saffron Burrows as the story's narrator. With quite a few sword fights, a cheesy bit where everyone shouts ""I do believe in fairies. I do, I do."" to bring a poisoned Tink back to life, some recognisable names and features I remember from the cartoon and Steven Spielberg versions, and some dark moments, this is an okay film, but like Spielberg's Hook, this is a film I won't be seeing to often, maybe never again. Worth watching!",Peter Pan
5,ma-cortes,Classic history with an enjoyable Peter Pan and colorful cinematography,7,31 December 2004,"The film centers about Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter), Tink (Ludivine Sagnier), Wendy (Raquel Evan-Wood) and brothers who escape from parents' home (Jason Isaacs and Olivia Williams) and they are going to Neverland . They will take on captain Hook ( Jason Isaacs) and pirates henchmen . The argument is similar to Walt Disney's classic , it's alike the cartoon had been made reality. The starring couple as Jeremy Sumpter and Raquel Wood are top notch and Jason Isaacs, sometimes good (the dad) and other bad (Hook) is excellent . Cinematography by Donald McAlpine and James Newton Howard musical score are breathtaking and spellbound . Industrial light magic (ILM , George Lucas production) special effects are awesome and spectacular . Sets are astounding and gorgeous . The picture mingles adventures, action, humor ,tongue in cheek , fantasy and a lot of entertainment . Since the beginning until the end the amusing is interminable . The fable will appeal to adventure and classic tales fans . Rating. 7/10 above average",Peter Pan
6,wes-connors,Peter Breaks Through,8,9 February 2009,"Nothing against the memorable versions featuring Betty Bronson, Bobby Driscoll, and Mary Martin - portraying James M. Barrie's boy wonder - but, this adaptation of ""Peter Pan"" comes closer to the spirit of the original work. For one thing, ""Peter"" is played by a real boy, which enables Jeremy Sumpter (as Peter) and Rachel Hurd-Wood (as Wendy) to more accurately portray Peter and Wendy as the pre-romantic couple. The novel's appealing mixture of ""romance"" and ""adventure"" is more in balance. The young characters, as children, mix ""yin"" and ""yang"". Both characters - Peter and Wendy - are important, and both possess the childlike masculine and feminine attributes.Mr. Hogan's cast and crew present an outstanding production. Jason Isaacs' ""Captain Hook"" supports the engaging younger performers beautifully. And, Lynn Redgrave is a welcome addition to the lore. Although this is a relatively faithful-to-the-original adaptation, it only touches upon Mr. Barrie's powerful ending (""When Wendy Grew Up""). So, a more perfect Peter has yet to be filmed...""Peter Pan"" is about that magical part of being a child, before sexuality (or, puberty) takes over, and becomes the prime directive. It's a time when Pirates and Fairies may still be real - and the difficulty in letting that part of your life go may be recalled by adults viewing director P.J. Hogan's exciting interpretation. If you don't remember the magic, watch your children enjoy ""Peter Pan"" - then, you might remember It's second to the right, and then straight on 'till morning ******** Peter Pan (2003) P.J. Hogan ~ Jeremy Sumpter, Rachel Hurd-Wood, Jason Isaacs",Peter Pan
7,Boba_Fett1138,Bad storytelling but the style compensates for this.,7,21 July 2005,"""Peter Pan"" is lacking on several levels, mainly due to the way the movie its story is told. Still this is a movie that is visually gorgeously looking and has some impressive special effects that all surpassed my expectations.Still ""Peter Pan"" remains a disappointing movie, mainly also because it has so many missed opportunities. The movie doesn't feel one bit adventurous or imaginative. It's almost as if the movie is taking itself way too serious. Also this is one of those movies that could had used some more humor and fun entertaining moments, like you would expect from a fantasy movie such as ""Peter Pan"". Will kids enjoy this movie? Not halve as much as ""Hook"" I'd say. But maybe the biggest missed opportunity of the entire movie is Jason Isaacs. I was excited when I first heard that he was going to play the famous captain Hook, I thought he would be perfect for the role. He was however highly underused in the movie and he didn't had an awful lot to do. I even liked him better in his role as the father Mr. Darling. Also most of the other characters are highly underused and underdeveloped. Smee, John, Michael and the lost boys don't seem to have a purpose at all in the movie and they could have easily been left out.The movie also does not feel coherent. At times the movie just jumps from one scene to another. It's almost as if there was some missing footage in between them.But yes of course the movie does has its moments and strong points. I kind of like the whole fairy dance sequences, which in my opinion is really cute and sweet and I like the way the love story between Peter and Wendy is portrayed. Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood are a nice sweet screen couple and there is some real chemistry between them on the screen. However I'm sure that in 10 years from now these two won't be in the business anymore, they will be one-day-flies. They are simply missing the talent to stay in the business.Really strongest point of the movie is the fantastic visual look it has. It has some really nice sets and some really splendid special effects. Also the musical score by James Newton Howard deserves praise.Even though as a movie this is a better one, I still find ""Hook"" to be a more recommendable movie than this one. This is mainly because this movie is lacking in adventure and fun moments...and it has no Dustin Hoffman as Hook. Yes, I know this movie follows the book of course more closely than Hook, which is an entirely different movie and story of course but I'm sure that the young ones will far more be entertained by it. Perhaps this movie will be best appreciated by adults.This movie could had been a great swashbuckling adventure ala ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" but sadly it ain't so. While watching this movie I also couldn't help thinking about one thing; What if Tim Burton made a Peter Pan movie. How perfect would that be? I couldn't think of one better director to truly capture the magic and story the Peter Pan book has. Wishful thinking, I know.Seriously, you're better of watching ""Hook"" or Disney's ""Peter Pan"" from 1953.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Peter Pan
8,neil-476,Decent,8,17 March 2020,"Siblings Wendy, John and Michael are talked into accompanying determined pre-adolesent Peter Pan to Neverland, where Wendy takes a role as would-be mother, and steps into a blood feud between Peter and the villainous pirate, Captain Hook.JM Barrie's childrens story certainly has legs,not only on paper and film, but also as a stage presentation. Although it is normally staged at Christmas and has its share of audience participation moments, it isn't actually a pantomime, the usual Christmas stage show aimed at British youngsters. Instead, it stands rather on its own, and has proved somewhat difficult to translate faithfully to the screen.This version does quite well. If it falls down, it does so in the casting of Peter. Jeremy Sumpter is actually quite a good Peter, but he is a very solidly American Peter in the midst of a very, very English cast. This, unfortunately, makes him feel rather out of place which, sadly, detracts from an otherwise excellent adaptation.",Peter Pan
9,anaconda-40658,Worthy Live Update.,8,9 March 2016,"Peter Pan (2003): Dir: P.J. Hogan / Cast: Jeremy Sumpter, Jason Isaacs, Rachel Hurd-Wood, Ludivine Sagnier, Lynn Regrave: Glorious live version of the 1953 animated classic with all the glitter and glam one could ask for. It is the story of a boy who would never grow up. He has the ability to take flight and eventually descends from the clouds and into the bedroom of twelve year old Wendy. She is immediately fascinated and accepts his offer to glide through the air joined by her brothers over the clouds and into the mystical Neverland. Once there they must fend off a band of pirates headed by the evil Captain Hook. Beautifully realized adaptation although it is highly unlikely that children could successfully sword fight pirates. Director P.J. Hogan does well combining humour, romance and adventure. Jeremy Sumpter is perfectly cast as Peter Pan whose mind is young yet his body is experienced in the realms of the unknown. Jason Isaacs is fantastic as Hook as well as playing the father of the children. Rachel Hurd-Wood nearly steals the film as Wendy in her curious disposition. Ludivine Sagnier plays pixie Tinkerbell who is small yet not without resources. Lynn Redgrave is cast as an aunt who desires to help Wendy in becoming an adult. Successful live version carries the intended theme of growing up as well as presenting beautiful visual wonderland. Score: 8 / 10",Peter Pan
10,SimonJack,A dazzling spectacle of a delightful fairy tale,8,12 October 2021,"Watching ""Peter Pan"" again recently, I wondered why so few films have been made about J. M. Barrie's creation. The Scottish novelist and playwright developed Peter Pan over a few years, from an introduction in one play, to inclusion in another play and finally fully expanded in two novels. This took place from 1902 to 1911.After the 1924 silent film, ""Peter Pan,"" the fable didn't appear again on the silver screen until Walt Disney's 1953 animated movie. Then, the only other live action film before this one was ""Hook"" in 1991 that starred Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams and Julia Roberts. There had been other stories that borrowed pieces or character types from Barrie's Pan, but no other renditions of the Peter Pan story.To the credit of Universal Studios, this Peter Pan is very close to the character and story as developed by Barrie over those years, more than a century ago. This Pan and Tinker Bell, and Wendy Darling and brothers, and Captain Hook and Smee, and all the various characters are presented in dazzling spectacle in this film. The portrayals by the cast are very good. And that means the mischievousness of Tinker Bell, the impishness and boasting and pride of Pan, and the frightful aspects in parts of the story.From a quality and production standpoint, this is an excellent film. But it touches awake the parent and grandparent senses in one. Young children, especially, should watch it only with parents or adults who need to explain some things to them. Not just about possible physical harm from trying to fly or such, but about boasting, meanness and kindness.In the right family setting, this is a film that can be enjoyed for all the ""magic"" of filming techniques, special effects and movie technology that bring to life such a colorful fairy tale.",Peter Pan
11,KineticSeoul,"Rescue mission after rescue mission, it's alright though",7,12 April 2010,"Now I know this is a retelling of a classic story used for plays, but this film just wasn't that good. Little kids will probably enjoy this movie with it's flashy colors and all with a pretty decent budget. But what got annoying for me was the rescue mission after rescue mission Peter Pan goes through in order to save Wendy. Rachel Hurd-Wood put on a marvelous performance for her age and it felt like she fit the role perfectly. Jason Isaacs playing both Mr.Darling/Captain Hook also did a great job. It clearly shows that the creators put a lot of effort into this movie, but it isn't surprising for not doing so well at the box office the story is something everyone already seen or read about except this one seems to have way too many rescue missions than how it was, if I can remember correctly. It's a charming film that kids will most definitely enjoy and some adult will probably enjoy it as well, I just wished the script was better instead of the rescue mission taking up most of the run time.7/10",Peter Pan
12,cherold,magic with a touch of melancholy,8,11 January 2004,"Absolutely wonderful adaptation of the story stays true enough to the source to retain its charm but adds a thoughtful melancholy undertone that reminded me of the wonderful movie A Little Princess.  Absolutely charming and magical, and full of beautiful, memorable moments like the mesmerizing stare of a mermaid or thousands of fairies in flight.  I would have liked more vivid performances from Peter and more-so from Hook, who were both good but lacked the sort of panache one would expect from the roles, but they served the movie admirably.  I'd be curious to know if children like this; I think of them as liking the sort of bright, Shrek-style movie, but I don't know any children and hopefully the high adventure and impressive special effects would impress them even if they aren't as clear on Peter's role as a symbol of arrested development.  Anyway, wonderful movie, exactly what I was expecting from the trailer.",Peter Pan
13,Robert_duder,The definitive Peter Pan film,8,2 January 2006,"I don't know how many film versions of Peter Pan have existed but it seems pretty common...most common is the Disney version of course but this is one fairy tale that is not short on adaptations. I have to give kudos to any director or producer who chooses to adapt these types of stories because there is so many directions they can take...whether or not they stick with the original ideas or go in their own direction (much like the brilliant film Hook.) This particular rendition of Peter Pan stays so much to the classic fairy tale it's scary and yet is so brilliant, well acted, beautiful shot, and at the same time adds it's own something to the mix.P.J. Hogan directed and wrote the screenplay for Peter Pan and he must be something of a fan of the fairy tale because he captures every essence you could possibly imagine. If J.M. Barrie envisioned Peter Pan...I have no doubt that this would have been it. Jeremy Sumpter plays Peter Pan. This young boy totally creates a Pan that is brilliant. Peter Pan is a boy who has been a boy for who knows how long and refuses to grow up. He has a dislike for all things adult and therefore at times is a bit naive, pouty, childish, stubborn...everything that a parent or adult might discourage in their child. At the same time he's become a great protector of his own land...a legend to those who are his friend and enemy. He lives in a magical land where everything can exist from a child's fantasy without ever aging...Neverland. In her premier role Rachel Hurd-Wood plays the lovely Wendy who is almost blossoming reluctantly into woman-hood. She still has a sparkle of child in her though weaving stories about pirates and fairy tales to her younger brothers. However she is quite reluctant to turn into a woman quite yet. Then she meets her first love...Peter Pan. To her he must seem like a savior, handsome, strong, flies, and wants to whisk her away to a Fantasy land. I suppose I will jump on the politically incorrect band wagon and agree with many reviewers on her that they absolutely establish sexual tension between Wendy and Peter. They are young, and falling in love for the first time and discovering each other (not in the bad let's play Doctor way either.) Wendy is much more mature in life than Peter is however and their relationship is doomed to not last making Peter Pan a true tragedy in the way it plays out. Jason Isaacs brilliantly portrays not only the rather accident prone Mr. Darling (the children's father) but the infamous, dastardly and quite evil Captain Hook. Hogan's hook is quite a bit more evil and mean than Disney's version which is probably far more accurate. This pirate truly is a pirate and a worthy adversary. He's cold and heartless as he should be.This version of Peter Pan is probably not for the real young, stick to the cartoon for that but for the pre-teens...this is a beautiful fairy tale/love story with a great happy ending. It's chock full of action, sword fighting and breath taking images of Neverland. It's definitely darker than any other Peter Pan movie I've ever seen which gives it a real edge but everything you can expect to be there is. Tiger Lily, the Lost Boys, Fairies, flying, Michael's teddy bear, John's top hat, Nana the nurse dog, London England, Neverland, Pirates, Mermaids...anything you can imagine from the original tale shows up in this one. In fact if you watched Hook after watching this version of Peter Pan it's almost a direct sequel which shows what a great job Hogan did of staying true to the original story. I will forever consider this film to be the definitive Peter Pan movie which all others will live up to. It's one you'll wanna see again and again!! 8.5/10",Peter Pan
14,Bored_Dragon,Neverland Romance,8,28 December 2017,"This is probably the best adaptation of Peter Pan and it deserves place in movie classics. The reason it had low success in theaters and it passed almost unnoticed lies not in its quality, but in fact it was released in the middle of Harry Potter mania and at the same time with the best fantasy movie of all time - The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Practically nothing had real chance competing with those two.This is classic version of Peter Pan, but really excellent one. Production is top, although not on LOTR level. Kids are incredibly cute and they played their roles really well and scenery is beautiful. Few times I thought that CGI is bit unconvincing, but I think it's done on purpose to make distinction between real world and world of fantasy. What particularly distinguishes this adaptation is the relationship between Peter and Wendy, which is elevated to a higher level than the one we are used to. Here they are not just children, but preteens who develop early stage of romantic love and even some sort of sexual tension. That deepens their relationship and adds new dimension to the story, that is not just two-dimensional fairy-tale any more, like it was in animated Disney version. Warm recommendation.8/10",Peter Pan

16,johnnyboyz,"I wanted to have more of an affectionate response, but all I could muster was slight tedium.",5,17 January 2009,"'Underwhelming' is the best way to describe most recent Peter Pan adaptation 'Peter Pan', produced in 2003 by Aussie Paul Hogan and no, he has nothing to do with Crocodile Dundee. It's both quite saddening and strange when a film can have so much money thrown at it and yet end up as such a damp piece of work, despite being an adaptation of a much loved and recognised work of writing. I think, rather crucially, that I am not the exact target audience for this particular film and therein lies the problem with both the reaction I had and the situations surrounding most of the content this film presents.The film seems to be in some sort of rush, a rush to get things done and dusted quite briskly. Scenes do not last long and the edits to the next shot move along at a brisk and overwhelming rate despite the stuff going on within the frame as not at all that interesting to begin with. The fable of Peter Pan seems universally known, indeed this being a film directed by an Australian with a cast of which the majority are British but everything has has a lot of American money thrown at it, indeed the IMDb lists the budget at $100,000,000 and has 'USA' as a co-production nation. Pardon my immediate ignorance of literature but the only reason I know of the story is due to the 1950s animated Disney film that I saw many times, many years ago. The story is of a boy, named Peter Pan, who flies to London from Neverland to hear the stories Wendy Darling reads to her younger relatives in the confides of a large house's nursery. Upon detection, Peter springs across the idea to take them back to Neverland so that the 'lost boys' can hear the stories themselves with the storyteller. Wendy, John and Michael all fly off with Peter and the adventure begins. I have no problem with the premise, something that has been done before and will be done again as the prologue so timely reminds us and something that will have the Barrie family and its descendants or people legally linked rubbing their hands in anticipation at a share of the money that'll head their way. But what I find most disappointing is the approach this film takes, a film that places its characters in an enchanting world of everything and then just doesn't do anything bar have them run around, make fools of themselves and then conform to slapstick humour when required.One frustration is the casting of an American in the lead role of Peter Pan. Jeremy Sumpter, whoever he is, plays the role in an outgoing and carefree manner that has no doubt acted as a springboard onto greater things. Whereas most everyone else, including the evil pirates of course, are British of some kind. All I can really say is thank God Wendy was played by an English girl in the form of Rachel Hurd-Wood, otherwise we'd be entering 'Aladdin territory' a theory built around the fact you can make the two romantic leads physically and naturally one thing but everyone else of that 'type' something completely different. A film about two coming of age Americans quite possibly feeling the rushes of affection for one another as they defeat 'evil' British baddies in an adaptation of a British novel for the 21st Century would have been enough for me to label this as one of the worst films ever made.But no, it's better than that although still nothing spectacular. The permutations to do with liking a member of the opposite sex and discovering that these things called a 'kiss' exist is all very well and good, introduced when a scantily clad boy from yonder-nowhere arrives and nonchalantly stands in the window frame of a girl's bedroom; both weary and a little frightened, is certainly one way of introducing the path you're wanting to go down with the material. This in addition to the ultimatum Wendy is given when it comes to 'growing up' herself and moving out of the nursery; and presumably into her own room, oh the horror. To be critical of the film feels as if it is to be critical of the novel, but really I'm not to the latter. Do we really believe Mr. Darling, the father of Wendy and co. is this uncharismatic and quite bumbling fool despite his mansion of a house, beautiful wife and three healthy children? In the 1950s cartoon, Mr. Darling came across as quite aggressive and thorough, the sort of man who might achieve what he has in this film and I got the feeling in the 1950s version that threatening persona reverberated into Wendy when the ultimatum of having to 'grow up' was issued  here is my father and he means business. The father in this film is a wimp and comes across as quite humorous when he's angry. I guess this is where the parallel with standing up to one's authoritarian figures comes into the equation. Like past editions, the father is also Captain Hook who's the antagonist of the piece and the one who must be 'defeated'. The film is confused in its direction, coming across as fun and family friendly with a series of harmless quick fire scenes before branching off and having Hook hold a knife to Pan's throat on one occasion and head-butting him on another. Little things don't feel right in the film like believing the pirates will assume a crocodile can fly and the using of an underdeveloped Native American girl as a mere damsel in distress is disappointing. She as is Tinkerbell, who you felt was jealous and really had an agenda in the cartoon, are both invisible for most of the time rounding off a disappointing and underwhelming film experience.",Peter Pan
17,Vartiainen,"Labor of the 00s, and it shows",6,6 September 2015,"Peter Pan has been adapted into a theatrical live action movie multiple times, but would you believe that this is the first one where the titular role is played by an actual young boy? Early stage versions of the story started a tradition where the character was played by a woman, mostly to give the actor enough experience while still retaining the look. Theatre world is weird like that.Nevertheless, this is the first one, so how does it hold up next to its kin? Well, it's a mixed package. The young man they got to play the part of Pan, Jeremy Sumpter, certainly has the look down pat. He's an imp, quick and agile, with a devil may care grin always on his face, and those attributes transfer to his performance as well. He embodies the cockiness and infallibility of the boy who never grew up, certainly bringing to mind the mythological Pan after which the character is named. Jason Isaacs is also magnificent in his dual role of both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook - another theatre tradition, but one which I heartily approve. Isaacs is easily the best Hook I've seen so far, and also one of the better pirate characters in general. Dark, menacing, hiding behind the veneer of a gentleman, while plotting his nefarious schemes to bring down the one he hates above all else.The rest of the cast is unfortunately merely okay or even slightly below average. The Lost Boys and the Darlings are played by child actors, making their acting rather wooden most of the times, though Wendy's actress Rachel Hurd-Wood at least manages to have some chemistry with Sumpter. They also added in a new character in Aunt Millicent (Lynn Redgrave) who, while played by a talented actress, brings nothing to the plot, making her completely pointless.I also detest the use of CGI in this film. Though to be fair, most every movie in the 00s was doing this, but it has not aged well. Not at all. It's overly bright, often rather rubbery or sleek, and you can spot its fakeness miles away. And it is everywhere. It's like they shot the film and decided to colour saturate every single frame using computers. It looks hideous. And it glitters, making me feel like I've walked into a store for five-year-old girls. Perhaps some would say that's a valid art style for a Peter Pan film, but personally I think it makes the whole film look artificial.The actual plot is captivating, closely mirroring the original play by J. M. Barrie. No complaints there, and if you can stomach the visual style of the film, it is a very good adaptation to check out for all fans of the original tale. My personal pet peeves keep me from appreciating it more, but don't let that keep you from experiencing its upsides.",Peter Pan
18,FiendishDramaturgy,"Stunningly visual, and beautifully dark.",9,7 March 2007,"I love this movie. I don't understand why this one didn't fare well in the box offices. It didn't score half its budget back in its take, so far, and I don't see it doing much more, at this juncture, which is a real shame.This production is magnificent. It retells the familiar story with stunning visuals, beautiful child performances, and a gritty edge. Perhaps the edge was the problem for the box office numbers. Many parents may not have felt this was appropriate. I would disagree. The only way this was more gritty than the Disney version is that it's live action, rather than a cartoon, but that was part of the lure for me.I really enjoy it.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",Peter Pan
19,FilmCriticLalitRao,An excellent film by Australian director P.J.Hogan. Everybody does believe in fairies.,10,28 January 2009,"Scottish writer Sir James Matthew Barrie had no idea in 1904 that his play ""Peter Pan"" would turn out to be one of the most famous works about the dream world of young children.In the history of children's literature,Peter Pan is the only child hero whose popularity is growing incessantly as his phenomenal exploits have been depicted in a successful play,a famous book and various film adaptations.Peter Pan is important not only for children of all ages but also for adults. He is the only character who makes us all feel nostalgic about the lovely days of our childhood.This is precisely what must have motivated talented Australian director P.J.Hogan when he started this film.His film has remained truthful to the idea and the spirit of the book as viewers get a chance to see their favorite hero Peter Pan create magic around the kids from Darling family when he takes them to different adventures.Young actor Jeremy Sumpter looks credible as Peter Pan.This is a perfect film to watch if you want to share your happiness with other members of your family.",Peter Pan

21,r96sk,I would've liked to see them take a bigger spin on the original story,6,11 May 2020,"I'm not a massive fan of this, I found it a little dull to watch to be honest; admittedly, I'm not a big lover of the 1953 production either - but that is better than this.2003's 'Peter Pan' is underwhelming. I would've liked to see them take a bigger spin on the original story, like seeing Hook's background in detail or taking a deeper dive into Neverland itself. The casting could've been greater, just like the camera work and colour palette. The special effects are solid, even if they haven't aged incredibly.Jason Isaacs is OK as the antagonist, managing to look as devilish as you'd expect. Jeremy Sumpter (Pan) and Rachel Hurd-Wood (Wendy) are fine, too. No amazing performances here though, in my opinion at least.",Peter Pan
22,jfgibson73,Disappointed,4,24 August 2009,"For those who have read the play or the book, this 2003 adaption of Peter Pan is probably even less faithful to the source than the Walt Disney version. For a story that has been retold so many times, you still can't beat the original.P.J. Hogan directed a big budget fantasy film with tons of visual effects, but also adapted the story, adding characters and themes not present in the J.M. Barrie play. I thought it added up to a confusing mess, for the most part. I didn't like the look of the settings or the costumes--I thought it was too flashy. The actors aren't much fun to watch, with the exception of Wendy, whose journey to womanhood seems to become the main focus of the story. The way other iconic moments are handled, such as reviving Tinkerbell and Hook's final fate didn't seem very creative or inspiring. In fact, there were almost no choices I approved of.I actually thought Tinkerbell was the worst part of the movie, both visually and in her character. The extras on the DVD reveals that she was played by a French actress who basically got the part because the filmmakers liked all the funny faces she could make. They've made her a silly mime.I had to strain to see what was happening at times because the action moved so quick and the jump cuts were so frequent. If you have a young teen who likes mindless action, maybe this will work for him/her.I watched this movie because I had recently seen a stage production and was blown away by the abilities of the local amateur group to bring the story to life. I went out of the way to track down this movie, where the filmmakers had all the money and resources in the world, and basically produced a hollow, un-fun mess. This is a special story, but I would rather pay to watch the play again.",Peter Pan
23,ShootingShark,"Exciting, Gorgeous-Looking, Delightful Adaptation Of Barrie's Classic Story Of Neverland",7,15 January 2008,"Wendy Darling and her brothers, John and Michael, meet Peter Pan, a strange boy who can fly and who never grew up, and travel with him to the magical world of Neverland, where they do battle with the fearsome pirate Captain James Hook ...This is a beautiful, tenderly-made, exhilarating adaptation of J.M. Barrie's wonderful and timeless fantasy of childhood adventures. It captures the tone of the story just right, is packed with fabulous visuals and rolls along at a terrific pace. All the pleasing elements of this great yarn are here; Peter's shadow escaping him, the children flying across the rooftops of London, Tick-Tock the monstrous crocodile, the Lost Boys listening raptly to Wendy's stories, the Mermaids' Lagoon, Peter's gallant battles with Hook, Tinkerbell drinking the poison, all rendered with charm and style. The whole cast nail their characters well; Sumpter is heroic and sulky in equal measure, Isaacs is excellent as both Hook and Mr Darling, and all the kids are terrific. Even better is the extraordinarily rich music by James Newton Howard - it's completely captivating, whimsical, adventurous and nostalgic throughout, makes you cry, cheer and scream, and is everything a good score should be. Roger Ford's production design is excellent and there are gorgeous visual effects by Eric Brevig and Scott Farrar which truly transport us to Neverland, a place of unlimited beauty and imagination. Apparently this movie had lots of production problems and was not a hit, but - like Dune or The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen - what emerges is a brilliantly-crafted, eye-popping visual feast which takes a classic literary fantasy and does it cinematic justice against all odds. Amazingly, this is the only straight live-action film of this classic story, discounting silent movies, TV versions, the Disney animated feature and variations such as Hook and Finding Neverland.",Peter Pan
24,aimless-46,Really Special,10,12 June 2006,"The mixed reviews for P.J. Hogan's 2003 hit ""Peter Pan"" leave you wondering if adults should be permitted to give a bad rating to a children's film. The vast majority of the reviews were positive ones, as the reviewers either liked the film themselves, or were convinced that it would be very entertaining viewing for children. The negative reviews came from adult critics who found little ""personal"" enjoyment and never really bothered about the children factor.I only bring this up because J. M. Barrie's play, while addressing early adolescent angst, was actually intended for adult audiences who presumably would be prompted to retrospectively analyze the angst of their own dim past. Thanks to the toning down of Barrie's basic theme in the Disney and Mary Martin versions, ""Peter Pan"" became almost exclusively a children's story. Then along came Hogan's version, which fused the thematic emphasis of the original with the children's entertainment emphasis of the others. Meaning that the film hits a home run with three very distinct target audiences. One thing for sure is that this spectacular adaptation has almost universal appeal to preteen children, they will watch it countless times and you can't go wrong buying or renting it for that age group. And perceptive adolescents struggling with their own growing up process should relate to it. And finally, those adults (particularly males) who have consciously resisted the growing up process their entire lives should connect to this film like few others. But if you don't belong to these three groups you will wonder what all the fuss is about. The answer is that this film uniquely focuses on the maturation process, which most girls embrace about sixth grade and most boys resist until 9th grade (and would resist even longer if girls were not luring them with the most obvious benefit of growing up). Some boys stubbornly hold out like Peter Pan, usually because they do not have a Wendy to pull them forward, and when they finally surrender and move forward into adulthood, they are aware that they are abandoning something precious and will look back with regret on the moment for the rest of their lives. Now with that issue addressed this is ""Peter Pan"" and virtually everyone knows the story. It is a live action version superior to the stage version if only because it is unburdened by the play's odd cross-dressing tradition and the preschool Disney fusion of bad songs and lame slapstick humor. The production design should blow away all viewers, child and adult, with a dreamy Maxfield Parrish Victorian look and Barrie's treasure-map Neverland. The pacing is fast and Hogan shows a respectful grasp of how an imaginative child would visualize things while reading Barrie's story. ""Peter Pan"" is really Wendy's story and there is no fault to find in Rachel Hurd-Wood's performance, which would be good enough to carry the film but fortunately is not required to do so. Wendy is second only to Wonderland's Alice as the bravest literary heroine of all time and Hogan nicely incorporates the many admirable qualities of her character into the story.Jeremy Sumpter's Peter is far more obnoxious than appealing, but isn't that what you would expect from a boy who refuses to grow old. Ludivine Sagnier's Tinkerbell provides comic relief to go with her homicidal tendencies; only adults want cute, children want pretend-nasty and this Tink is worthy of Barrie's original characterization. The ""save Tink"" audience chant is nicely incorporated into a full-cast montage.Hook is played with a controlled zest by Jason Isaacs, not quite the self-parody of a Gary Oldham performance but his restraint is exactly what is needed. Adults and children know that ""Peter Pan"" isn't so much suspension of disbelief as it is an exercise in self-knowing whimsy. You know that the mix of fairies, pirates, Indians and ticking crocodiles are devices designed to obscure the difficult facts of growing older. If you can't go with it then you surrendered something a long time ago that Peter is still stubbornly holding onto.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Peter Pan
25,Rob_Taylor,Pan-tastic!,9,31 May 2004,"I'm not normally one to get excited over kids movies, but I have to say I found myself enjoying this version of the classic JM Barrie tale immensely. So what makes this movie different from other kids films that I've hated, such as Jungle Book 2?For a start it's a lot darker. Maybe it's just me, but I remember when I was a kid that children's stories actually could be frightening and no one would bat an eyelid, or say ""That's too scary! You'll have to make it nicer!"" Nowadays, all kids seem to get fed is Happy-Happy Pap-Pap from the likes of Disney and Pixar. Not that those movies don't have their merits, but Toy Story and the like can never be accused of being frightening. The only reason that we, as adults, like them is because of the in-jokes and adult humour injected into them.Now, there have been a number of Peter Pan versions, most notably the aforementioned Disney version, and of course the abysmal Hook! But I feel that this version captures the feel of the original book best. It just feels right.The casting is absolutely spot on. Not since LOTR have I seen actors cast which so perfectly capture the characters they are portraying. Jason Isaacs as Hook is fantastic and just the right side of campness and overacting not to ruin the part, unlike his counterpart in Hook. Likewise the young actors playing Peter and Wendy, whom I had no trouble believing in. Again, Tinkerbell was played to perfection, even though the actress didn't get any real lines to say, just looks and odd sounds! It's also worth noting that Richard Briers, of The Good Life, gives a wonderful performance as Smee and absolutely steals several scenes he's in with some hilarious lines of dialogue.I mentioned that the film was darker than most children's movies. There are a couple of areas that I feel a parent might want to consider before taking very young children to see it. Firstly, the crocodile. It's scarily fast, even though CGI. I could see some kids getting a bit frightened by it. Secondly, there are more than a few occasions where the Lost Boys and Pan get....well....thrown around by Capt. Hook and his crew. Never mind the swordfights, this is honest to goodness brutality towards kids. I actually found it refreshing to see, to be honest, but it might be an area of concern for some.There is a lot of humour in the movie, too. The pirates have a lot of sight gags and Smee in particular gets a lot of good moments. Also watch out for the Teddy-Bear, which very nearly becomes a character in its own right and is the source of much hilarity. Well, I found it funny, anyway. There's also the parrot, which is just funny whenever you see it on screen without even doing anything.The movie is pure entertainment and works for both kids and adults, but, for the most part, it's really aimed at kids, especially those that never really grew up.",Peter Pan
26,mike48128,Best Live-Action Filmed Version to Date-Often Overlooked,9,26 December 2014,"Fairly true to the original written story, this version is often overlooked, as there have been several versions made of this timeless classic tale; some very bad.(Hook) The major change is that a new character was written-in for Lynn Redgrave, who ends up adopting one of the children. Sumptuous sets. Made in Australia. Especially well-staged is the ""Nanna"" dog. Little Michael is shown jumping on ""Nannas' back"" (to take a bath) through the use of multiple dogs and computerized images. The mermaids are there, and they are ""evil"", for the most-part, as they should be. Beautiful musical score, but not the memorable songs from either the Broadway or Disney productions. Too bad. Had this been ""married"" to the Broadway songs, this would have been a perfect version (in my opinion). Other reviewers describe ""sexual tension"" between Peter and Wendy. It's hinted-at in the musical stage versions, as well. Although Peter Pan is quite elf-like and child-like, at least he's played by a boy. Often a $5 DVD bargain at stores and on-line. This is a Universal-Columbia co-release. Make sure it is the live-action version from 2003. It was a box-office success, world-wide, in it's time.",Peter Pan

28,MrGKB,"If only all ""remakes"" were this good...",9,12 October 2005,"...Hollywood might never have to grow up. But then again, this gem of a film wasn't made in Hollywood; instead, it comes to us from Down Under, and the Australian film industry has put yet another notch in its belt.Lovingly directed and co-scripted by P.J. Hogan, along with Michael Goldenberg, the man who ably crafted the screen adaptation of Carl Sagan's ""Contact,"" this version of J.M. Barrie's timeless tale is a more than satisfying joy to behold. All the expected descriptives apply: delightful, entrancing, wonderful, magical, enchanting, charming; take your pick or provide your own. The art direction and production design are superb, as is the costuming. The special effects are indeed special, particularly those involving Tinkerbelle. The casting is perfect, especially that of newcomer Rachel Hurd-Wood (who for whatever reason reminded me of the young Hayley Mills) as Wendy, Jason Isaacs as a marvelous, nuanced Captain Hook and diametrically opposite John Darling, and the wildly expressive Ludivine Sagnier as a surprisingly sexy Tink. Make no mistake though, Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan is no slouch--his work in Tom Paxton's ""Frailty"" was no fluke--and the rest of the cast is remarkable as well. Even James Newton Howard's score is satisfyingly evocative. Having recently seen the beautiful and moving ""Finding Neverland,"" I was very well taken with this virtually flawless production. In fact, I'd have to say that it has placed itself ahead of the much-cherished Disney animated version in the heart of my inner child. My only regrets are that I missed it in the theater and that my first viewing of it was a dreaded full-screen library copy, but I'll be quite happy to add a proper widescreen edition to my DVD library.I think what struck me most (and others have commented on this) was the honest portrayal of the subtext of adolescent yearning and fear, something sorely lacking in both the Disney cartoon and in the various stage presentations. This is, at its core, a story about the delicious frictions between the tremulous anticipation of growing into adulthood and the glorious freedom of childhood innocence, and Hogan steers that tumultuous sea of conflict with a sure and steady hand at the rudder. The relationship of Wendy and Peter is played with great finesse by two gifted young actors, and the film is all the better for it.Though rated PG by the typically namby-pamby MPAA, this ""Peter Pan"" is truly a family film. Only an obdurate curmudgeon could find fault with it.",Peter Pan
29,gkeith_1,Loved It! 20 out of 10.,10,25 December 2003,"Barrie would love it.  Maude Adams would love it.  Sumpter superb, and all actors fantastic.  Beautiful imagery and scenery.  Special effects awesome. Croc always funny and hilarious, as usual.  NO, DISNEY DID NOT INVENT PETER PAN.  As I grew older since the Disney movie came out, I was more disappointed to find out Peter Pan and Tinkerbell weren't real than about the 'there's no such thing as Santa Claus'.  I did see Hook.  I have read life story of Maude Adams' many times, and also that of Barrie.  Maude Adams, the first American actress to play Peter, on Broadway in 1905 or 1906, was the inspiration for Barrie to change the play from emphasis on Wendy to that of Peter as main character (original book name, 'The Little White Bird').  Maude Adams was the most wealthy stage actress in America, due to her popularity as Peter Pan.  It outshone all the plays in which she starred.  MARY MARTIN WAS NOT THE BEST PETER PAN.I saw Peter Pan as live play here three years ago, as a benefit for our Children's Hospital.  Two years ago, it was performed here by Cincinnati Ballet (with our BalletMet Columbus), and as a ballet Peter Pan is just divine.  Mr. Darling and Hook were both played by an African American dancer/actor.  Hooked waltzed with the Crocodile, with hilarious dipping. In another scene, Croc strutted across the stage (actor upright) and did a wonderful hip-hop dance.  So cool!So I've been waiting for this new movie for a long time.  I am disappointed about tiny pre-publicity, but lots for Cat In The Hat + LOTR-ROTK.  I hope it makes lots of money for the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. Visit there when you go to London.  Also visit the Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens.Fantastic.  I want to see it again and again, and get DVD. Bravo!10/10.",Peter Pan
30,gkeith_1,Saw it 4 times so far!,10,28 March 2004,"I saw this movie until it was no longer showing locally, even at our bargain theatre.  Tried to get more nuances each new showing.  Fell in love with the music.  Looking each new time for Hook's sleazy interest in Wendy, but decided that was looking too deep.  Yes, Hook was depraved, lonely, old & alone.  He had no life, no woman, and lived with several grizzled yucky pirates.  He was obsessed with that kid who cut off his hand and threw it to the crocodile, and figured out that to feign obsession for Wendy was a good way to get Peter's attention.  I also kept looking for the so called sexual attraction between Peter and Wendy, but decided that was looking too deep, also.  Maybe kids in those days didn't know about the real birds and bees, and kissing was something one did to one's parents.  Anyway, last week on vacation in New Orleans, my hubby bought me the PP03 soundtrack, and I must say it is exotically wonderful!!!  My favorite tune is ""Fairy Dance"".  Some tunes are scary and not comfortable, such as ""A Note from the Teacher"", ""Come Meet Father"", and of course ""Mermaids"".  I find I re-play ""Fairy Dance"" about 10 times in a row.  I have one beef:  the Fairy Dance in the movie was way too short.  It was so beautiful (I just love ballet) and exotic in a royal and elegant sort of way.  I have the DVD ordered from our Barnes & Noble Store (37 days to go).  Love and best wishes.",Peter Pan
31,gregsrants,A good story with above average production values,7,9 May 2004,"Remember Betty Bronson and Ernest Torrence as both Peter Pan and Captain Hook respectively?  Doubt it.  That is because to even my amazement, the last time the true story of Peter Pan was done in a live action format was in 1924 starring the two above mentioned actors that while appearing in over 80 films collectively, we probably wouldn't recognize them if they walked down the street with name tags on their shirts.Enter December 2003, and P.J. Hogan's retelling of the classic tale that hit theatres amongst all the Oscar hopefuls and faded from memory before recouping even half of its reported $100 million dollar budget.  Thank God for DVD.  To have to spend time telling the true story of Peter Pan would mean that the reader of the critique was robbed of an incredible children's story about a fantasy land where kids never grew up and a pirate by the name of Hook set out on a personal crusade to avenge the hand he lost in an earlier confrontation with his nemesis, Pan.This updated version stars a bunch of newbies or character actors that might seem familiar if unplaced at the time of your viewing.  In the role of Peter Pan is Jeremy Sumpter a young child destined for stardom that first took our notice as the young Adam in Bill Paxton's Frailty.  He, alongside his fairy friend known to us as Tink', he travels from Neverland to England where he hovers outside a families window to hear the stories of adventure as told by the eldest daughter, Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood).  It is not long before the two become acquainted, and Wendy with her two brothers agree to leave their oppressive parentally controlled world and follow Peter and Tink back to a land where children run free and never get old.   But pursued to the ruthless Hook and his pirates entourage, there are lessons to be learned, enemies to be defeated and as is ultimate in any fairy tale, a happy ending to endure.One of the first things you will notice while watching Peter Pan is the incredible production values.  Shot in Australia and New Zealand, Universal Studios spared no expense in bringing the childhood story to life.  How Peter Pan chases his shadow, how the fairies all fly into their tree loft and the incredibly vibrant colors are all testament to P.J. Hogan's unique vision of telling story as it was J.M. Barrie almost 80 years earlier.  Most fascinating is how the art of film flying has evolved from the blue screen laughers almost 80 years earlier.  Most fascinating is how the art of film flying has evolved from the blue screen laughers as seen in the Superman franchise to its perfected state in Peter Pan.   When Pan and Hook eventually fight amongst the clouds and ships masts in the climax, the shadows are just perfect, the effects are not hokey and the style allows for the actors to feel free from the restraints of the conventional wires we were accustomed to seeing in cheaper adaptations.Sure, there was a few things that bothered me a little (the repeating 5 note musical score for one), but I was amazed how transformed I became while watching a movie that I was embarrassed that I coupled with Kill Bill Vol. 1 with my rental at the video store.  A story that I had seen so many times before in so many formats (plays, animation etc.) was made fresh again by the highly entertaining energy that the cast all put into their roles.
I will admit that Peter Pan is not for everyone.  The cynical will call it average and those that are still drinking heavily to try and forget Steven Spielberg's 1991 failed effort Hook, might not be over the nightmares to enjoy this jaunt.  However, with or without a family by your side, this is one of the forgotten films of 2003 that deserves a rental and an open mind.www.gregrants.com",Peter Pan

33,TheNorthernMonkee,"pointless, mind rotting garbage",2,25 November 2005,"SPOILERS Should tales be constantly remade? It's a tough one. In a Hollywood where remakes are endless, it's a strange feeling to actually see another retelling of a Victorian Children's tale. Unfortunately, just like any remake, what actually is the point? If you want a definitive tale of Robin Hood, you watch Errol Flynn, if you want most of the traditional comedies, you watch the original from the 60s or earlier. As Hollywood gets more and more money obsessed, and apparently writers get more and more lazy, so we get more and more remakes of both classic stories and classic films. At the rate we are going, by 2010 the entire Spencer Tracy back catalogue will have been remade, and truthfully it cannot be long before 70s gangster movies enter the recreation arena. It's one of those annoying facts of life that this happens, but what makes it worse is when the remake is not only pointless, but unbelievably dire.PJ Hogan's ""Peter Pan"" is yet another take on the age old story of the boy who wouldn't grow up. Featuring a live action cast of youngsters who are barely held together by the magnificent Jason Isaacs as the evil Captain Hook, the film has no soul. It is a dire affair with weak special effects and some truly vomit inducing moments. There is little reason to feel any love for this film.In the Darling children bedroom, Wendy, John and Michael (Rachel Hurd-Wood, Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell) sleep. When the mysterious flying boy Peter (Jeremy Sumpter) arrives one night, the children are amazed. Taking them far away to the mystical place of Neverland, he introduces them to a whole new world. With pirates, mermaids and Indians, this is a world of wonder and the children are drawn in. Their happiness is not constant however, for around the corner lies Peter's nemesis, the evil Captain James Hook (Isaacs).Let's not be too harsh on the acting of the child cast. Led by the irritating Sumpter, they are mostly awful. Irritating and annoying, they grate on the skin like chickenpox. It is for most however, their first real experience of cinematic life, and like the Harry Potter kids, they deserve time to really show that they have talent.It is never harsh to criticise an adult actor though, but sadly that proves harder than expected here. Out of the novel collection of well known faces involved, the stand out performance in Jason Isaacs. Capturing the menace and despair of Hook perfectly, he rescues the film from being a complete travesty. He snarls, he scratches, he does everything he should, and truthfully he aught to be in pantomime.Away from the actors though, and the film falls apart. With special effects more at home in the 1980s, we have visible strings, we have incredibly bad crocodiles, we even have a Tinkerbell that looks more like a lit flame in a jar. It's a good thing that the story of Pan is meant to be so magical, because the special effects really aren't.The biggest flaw with this film though, and this is hard to get past, is just how pointless it's whole existence actually is. The tale of ""Peter Pan"" is hardly a new concept and has been dealt with brilliantly before. Disney did a near perfect edition of the tale, and we've had alternatives ever since. So why oh why did PJ Hogan even bother. Trying to capture the magic once more, he'd failed magnificently and done nothing to add to the tale. The whole notion of the film is a joke, and it really shouldn't have got past the drawing board.Why bother to remake an already successful story? Like so many films in recent years, 2003's ""Peter Pan"" is an unnecessary remake. Badly shot, mostly acted by amateurs, it is a pointless production with little redeeming features. Jason Isaacs might be excellent as Captain Hook, but that really isn't enough to save the film. The special effects are lousy, the whole concept is pointless. Please, stop trying to make unnecessary re-tellings.",Peter Pan
34,johnstonjames,"""All Children Grow Up. Except For one.""",9,14 December 2010,"""all children grow up except for one"". that's the way JMB's 'Peter Pan' has always began. something director Steven Spielberg seems to have forgotten in his strangely miscalculated movie version 'Hook'. Robin Williams is a wonderful performer, but even he could'nt save the less than magical thinking of turning ""the boy who refused to grow up"" into an adult. hello. that takes the whole point and message away from this story. not to mention a adult looks like an idiot in a 'Pan' suit. unless he's working at a Disney theme park.thank the heavens above that this incredible and magical production got the whole thing quite right. it not only is a perfect and atmospheric adaptation of Barrie, but it still boast some of the most colorful and vivid looking FX to this day. it's been several years since 2003 and time has been very good to this film. instead of being surpassed by more recent fantasy films, it actually gets a more original and unique looking. even today, i seldom see CGI FX this colorful and vibrant.film-goers who might have been uncomfortable with past portrayals of 'Pan' by women, might be relieved to find 'Peter' played by a boy, Jeremy Sumpter, who gives a very straight-male, masculine performance as 'The Pan'. Jason Issacs is no dandy fop as Captain Hook either. as a matter of fact he gives a fiercely savage, lone wolf performance that, in my opinion, was one of the very best in 2003.and of course anyone who has seen this lovely film and adores it, knows you have to mention the enchanting and comical ""tour de force"" performance by Ludivine Sagner who is, along with Disney, entertainment's most memorable and definitive 'Tinkerbells'.i own pretty much all the 'Pan' entertainments on DVD and this one is a keeper to cherish for all 'Pan' devotees.

35,roedyg,"Intense, beautiful",9,20 May 2008,"Even since I was a very little boy I have loved the Peter Pan story. My parents even named the family dogs Peter and Wendy. This is a visually rich, emotionally intense retelling. It great movie for adults too, since it can be taken metaphorically in many different ways, e.g. Peter as drug dealer seducing Wendy into a fantasy world.There is one scene that lasts only seconds, where Peter and Wendy go to visit the mermaids, dark fish-like creatures who try to entice Wendy to drown. The effect was terrifying and strange. It must have taken months to design the costumes, makeup, lighting etc to produce this chilling but beautiful effect. Again and again you see loving attention paid to magical very short scenes.All the characters are much more emotionally complex than in any other version I have seen. There is an underlying sexuality, whose bubble is repeatedly burst with tongue in cheek (as is the violence and threat of violence).Peter is a complex real boy, somewhat sadistic, impudent, vain, athletic, a practical jokester, a bit manic depressive. He is as I wanted him to be when I was a boy when it was the tradition for women to play the part. He is a gang leader vaguely reminiscent of Lord of the Flies.The movie would have been too frightening and too emotionally intense for me when I was a boy, but today's kids are probably toughened.It's a movie that goes straight for the heart, without the usual cloying clichés. My heart aches even an hour after it is over.",Peter Pan

Barrie's classic story.Unlike the Disney version, the filmmakers didn't sugarcoat Neverland. Neverland can be both beautiful, and foreboding both at the same time. As well, the filmmakers wisely left in many of the references to death and love that the Disney version almost all but cut out. This only strengthens this film and allows it to stand amongst the rest as not just a faithful adaptation, but a rich and involving adventure yarn. But don't be fooled, this is a fantastic film for children as well, but I believe many adults will adore this film alongside their children.In the film, Peter Pan is played by spry Jeremy Sumpter, where as Wendy is portrayed by Rachel Hurd Wood. The film depicts young love in a beautiful way, the first brushes of adolescence are poking out. The film focuses the tension between the two, and at the end when they finally kiss, it is magical.On the flip side there is Captain Hook, seen here in this film played by Jason Isaacs, who also doubles as Mr. Darling. They actually give Hook a little bit more to play with in this film than in previous versions of the story. While Isaacs' Hook is not as hilarious as Dustin Hoffman's, Isaacs plays the role with way more menace and grit.I really believe that director P.J. Hogan should be applauded for figuring out an extremely wonderful way to portray the death and resurrection of Tinkerbell in this film. This is probably the most moving scene in the entire film, but there are so many other fantastic moments that bring the magic of this story directly into your heart and allows you to fly and soar above Neverland. This film makes you wish you never had to grow up, and for that reason alone it is worth seeing.I give Peter Pan a 10 out of 10!",Peter Pan
37,EmperorNortonII,Peter Pan's Biggest Adventure,8,20 November 2004,"P.J. Hogan's feature, ""Peter Pan,"" is the latest adaptation of J.M. Barrie's immortal tale of the magical boy who would not grow up. The story speaks to children faced with growing up, and adults burdened with being grown up. Anyway, this version is full of lush visual imagery, including a Neverland full of strange and wonderful sights. Jeremy Sumpter soars in the title role, and Rachel Hurd-Wood holds her own as Wendy Darling. But Jason Isaacs is great in the dual role of Captain Hook, and Wendy's father, Mr. Darling (a tradition of both stage and screen). The story is faithful to Barrie's original text, and even delves into the characters of Peter and Hook, attempting to analyze them. Hogan has proudly created another facet of the Peter Pan legacy.",Peter Pan
38,ruby_fff,"""I do believe in fairies, I do, I do"" - Jeremy Sumpter is the ultimate Peter Pan",8,17 January 2004,"This is a classic tale - full of magic and fantasy: flying over clouds, hopping on clouds, falling through clouds It's Peter Pan, the boy that never have to grow up, veritably brought alive by Jeremy Sumpter, to the never Neverland far beyond the clouds a-flying we follow, accompanied by Tink, mischievously played to the hilt by a vivid Ludivine Sagnier (""Swimming Pool,"" ""8 femmes"") with fairy dust a-sprinkling. Sumpter is the absolute Peter Pan - the whim, smugness, playfulness, boyishness, his smile, laughter and tear, and interaction with Tink. Sagnier's Tinker Bell - a perfect non-speaking role for her being in mostly French films - is delightful to watch even in such a mini-digital scale, and quite a jealously loving, protective fairy she is to Peter. In 2003 we have three seafaring swashbuckling adventure movies: the very successful Gore Verbinski directed ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is graced by the ever artful and lively Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow with fantastic cast and exciting action. Then there's director Peter Weir's ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" which is more of a literary account of the friendship between Russell Crowe's Captain Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany's Dr. Stephen Maturin, the surgeon onboard - may not be for everyone as some might find the first part slow, but a remarkable endeavor nevertheless. And here we have ""Peter Pan"" directed by P.J. Hogan. This is by far the most magical and wholly fantastical - a piece as timeless as ""Mary Poppins"" - such delightful wonders I felt while watching the movie. The joy and wonderment, laughter and tears, and the swashbuckling adventure opposing Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs of ""The Tuxedo,"" ""Passionada"" - is in the plump dual role as Mr. Darling the father) - it's too marvelous for words. James Newton Howard's exalting score and the stereophonic sound effects further enhanced the special/visual effects experience. The equally important role in J.M. Barrie's beloved story is Wendy Darling, played by Rachel Hurd-Wood - it's her debut role and a convincing job she did. (Ha, the cleverness of her.) The lovely Olivia Williams (""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Man From Elysian Fields"") is Mrs. Darling. Lynn Redgrave is Aunt Millicent. (Her Georgy in ""Georgy Girl"" 1966 opposite Alan Bates, James Mason, and Charlotte Rampling, is still the most substantial memorable role to-date). This remake of Peter Pan is truly a grand and worthwhile production. It has an expansive worldwide distribution schedule and one of the executive producers is Mohamed Al-Fayed, dedicating the film in memory of his son. Another executive producer is Jocelyn Moorehouse - she wrote and directed her debut film ""Proof"" 1991, with Hugo Weaving (""Matrix"", ""Lord of the Rings"") poignantly playing the lead role of Martin, a blind photographer, with Russell Crowe as the friendly kitchen-hand turned companion Andy, and Geneviève Picot as the jealous housekeeper Celia - it's an intriguing story simply told. ""I do, I do, I do believe in fairies."" If you do, director Charles Sturridge's ""Fairy Tale: A True Story"" 1997, is another film worth seeing.",Peter Pan
39,Spanner-2,weak retelling,6,31 December 2003,"A new retelling of the classic tale of the boy who won't grow up.. this film has good production values, the familiar story and an impressive debut performance from young Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy... but it still doesn't quite work.. perhaps the story is too familiar and they don't add anything new? Maybe but the bigest flaws are some serioues directorial problems relating to pacing and a weak Peter, played ineffectively by Jeremy Shumpter.. a bit of a misfire, but a nice looking one.

40,ozthegreatat42330,A bittersweet emotional beautiful telling of Barrie's famous Boy!,10,11 April 2007,"I almost opted out of writing a comment here, because so many others have written such glowing comments about this film. It is refreshing to see an actual boy playing Peter for a change, and what a boy. Jeremy Sumpter is exactly as I have always envisioned Peter, with that twinkle in his eye and slightly sly smile that automatically suggests he is up to mischief. Not since the Disney animated version has there been a Peter Pan that has so delighted me, and I have seen most of the stage versions as well. It is also a pleasant change to see Jason Isaacs in a good guy role as Mr. Darling. What a treat also is Lynn Redgrave as the aunt. The film was very well cast, and the direction was tight, artistic and brilliant.I found myself getting very emotional watching this film, at age 57 it still manages to bring out the child in me. What more can one askfor in a film. And I might add, an excellent family film. Would that there were more films like this one.",Peter Pan
41,flicklover,"Enchanting, literate version of a classic fairy tale!",8,2 June 2004,"I missed this movie in the the theater last year, I wrote it off as a kids film, and I've seen most versions of the story anyway. I gave it a try on DVD, and how wrong I was! This is one of the best versions of Peter Pan ever made. The Peter Pan story as we all know is the story of a 12 year old boy that refuses to grow up, he lives in neverland and he fights the evil Captain Hook, The story is done this time with all the magic and fun that one would expect, but it has an underlying theme of sadness running through it. Peter is going to remain 12, but he will not be able to stay with Wendy, the girl that he loves. She knows that even though he has taught her to fly, and that she had all the adventures with Peter, she wants to grow up, and the lost boys are all shown to long for a mother. The movie has a wonderful look, very dreamy, even purposely cheesy, but it all has the right mix of melancholy to work. This is one of those movies that can truly be enjoyed by young and old alike. Grade: B",Peter Pan
42,cosmic_quest,Peter Pan Grow Ups,8,26 May 2005,"Finally 'Peter Pan' is being seen as a story not aimed specifically at small children and has been allowed, quite rightly, to grow up. Unlike the Disney version and many theatre versions of the story, this film is suitably darker and depicts the characters more in-line with how they were portrayed in the James Barrie classic. Peter is no longer a lovable scamp but rather, at times, selfish and obsessive boy whose pranks can lead to danger. Wendy is a confused young girl but with the emotional strength and morals Peter lacks. Hook is a dangerous man who shares much in common with Peter and could have been redeemed had he met a Wendy in his youth.Jason Isaacs definitely steals the show as both the rather spineless yet loving Mr Darling and the dark and psychopathic Hook. And there is something very twisted in seeing the same actor being able to portray the duel roles, one scene as devoted father and the other as murderous pirate. This is how Barrie intended the roles for the theatre play to be depicted and it works.Rachel Hurd-Wood is excellent as Wendy, particularly when one considers this was her debut role. She is able to capture the character's turbulent feelings on love and the trials of growing up but she is also able to show Wendy as a strong, courageous girl who is the main reason why Peter found the strength to defeat Hook once and for all. However, Jeremy Sumpter doesn't fit the mould of Peter so easily. He was just too stiff to be Peter and he seems a year or two too old to play a boy who is meant to be around ten or eleven. His accent was also quite off-putting when the rest of the Lost Boys and Hook and his men all speak with an English accent. I have nothing against Americans but they either should have cast Peter and the Lost Boys all American or all British. Can you imagine plonking an American into 'Harry Potter' or 'Lord of the Rings'? It's just annoying.One of the few failings in the film was that the tension between Peter and Wendy felt wrong. Peter, by the book, is meant to be forever a child (and definitely in pre-adolescence) with Wendy being slightly older on the cusp of puberty. He brought Wendy to Neverland to be his mother not his girlfriend. The 'will-they, won't-they?' tension between the two took away some of Peter's childlike innocence and confusion as to what Wendy wanted from him.Having said that, this film was one of the best novel adaptations I've seen in a long time (in fact, I wish the Harry Potter films were made as equally well and faithfully to the mood of those books). I wouldn't really recommend it for children under six since it is a rather dark, mature film with some frightening moments but I'm glad PJ Hogan wasn't afraid to produce a 'Peter Pan' film that didn't instantly appeal to young primary school kids as too often these days, films are dumbed down just for the sake of hoping to cash in on the kiddie audience.",Peter Pan
43,jpintar,Underrated gem,8,5 May 2004,"This is by far the best filming of Peter Pan I have ever seen.  Unlike Hook, this movie has magic to it.  I think most of the characters, especially Peter Pan and Hook, are three dimensional characters.  Never Never Land looks like a great place to visit.  However, there are disadvantages to living there, such as never falling in love.  I was surprised how much I loved this movie.  The actors are very well cast.  Peter Pan is not an obnoxious kid like he is sometimes portrayed as, but as a boy who refuses to grow but knows there are consequences to this.  The actor who plays Captain Hook is not just a bad guy, but as somewhat of a sad person locked in never ending combat with Peter Pan.  I like this better than the animated Disney movies and the overproduced Hook.  I think this will appeal to everybody, not just young children.  So I suggest you see this movie even if you do not have children.  8/10",Peter Pan

And while it almost made my favorites list due to my spark of excitement while watching it, the feeling left shortly after I saw it.I still have to say that this is the best Peter Pan movie I have ever seen. The best part of the experience is simply seeing it and seeing the special effects.The experience in itself is what makes this movie a 10. This is not one of the best movies ever, like I said, but it is an enchanting and harmless movie to watch with the family.PS, The end credits are 11 mins. long, so the movie is really only 102 minutes long.Extra note: Jason Issacs has a dual role as Mr. Darling and Hook. His latter performance is easily the most impressive.",Peter Pan
46,arieliondotcom,Spoiler? Missing Mary Martin,5,5 September 2005,"The truth is that anyone 50 or older will never be satisfied with any version of Peter Pan after seeing Mary Martin...that's right, a female...as Peter in ""living black and white"" on a tiny screen on their living rooms. As a boy, squatting in front of the screen, I was glad my family couldn't see my eyes tear up at the death of Tinkerbelle and how tough it was not to participate in bringing her back to life, something only little girls and boys younger than I was at the time could do with other brothers in the house...The memories, the magic of the moment (our little box hooked to another little box with an electric eye gazing on the living Peter Pan zooming about a stage, albeit on wires) and Mary Martin...None of it can ever be repeated or ever replaced in the hearts of those of us who experienced it.",Peter Pan
47,Darkest_Rose,A Story that never Grows Old,7,3 January 2004,"Wendy Darling(Rachel Hurd-Wood) is a young girl who loves telling stories and fairytales to her two younger brothers. She doesn't really understand her parents, especially her strict father, Wendy would rather stay a child forever then grow up to be an adult. But when Peter Pan(Jeremy Sumpter), the boy who never grows up, shows up at Wendy's window one night to take her and her brothers to Never Never land with him, Wendy is about to experience an adventure and fairytale of her own. To meeting the lost boys and encountering the dangerous yet beautiful mermaids and to meeting Peter's biggest fiend: Captain Hook(Jason Isaacs), who wants to take revenge on Peter Pan and make sure that he'll never return to Never Never land again. I thought this was a wonderful adaption of the original Peter Pan and a charming and magical movie. The two main characters are very beautiful and talented children and the chemistry between them was very tense and somewhat sexual, if I may say. The story was somewhat flawed and forgettable, filled with too many cheesy moments and lines but it was a family movie so I guess it was alright. It was still very enjoyable, I would give Peter Pan 7/10.",Peter Pan
48,JoshtheGiant,Horrible,2,20 December 2005,"I am a fan of the original Peter Pan story because of its underlying sadness and the questions about sanity and other big questions it asks. This version doesn't just kill all the interesting questions in the original, but it murders the spirit and everything that made the original story so good. It ads a lot to the play, but than takes away more from it and in the end is simply more of a party pooper than I had imagined it to be. The screenplay is one of the places it falls so badly short. The dialogue and characters are horrible, but what is the worst is that the Peter Pan story is really not that good and never has been on it's own. It just really needs the underlying themes which this really lacks. Another thing is the acting which is some of the worst ever put on film. Jeremy Sumpter is especially bad as the famous Pan. Another problem is the horrible direction which simply fails on every single level. The horrible visual effects really don't help but it could have survived them. Do not watch this movie it is horrible, just don't even go there.",Peter Pan
49,wnterstar,The best telling of Peter Pan yet!,10,9 October 2004,"OK...I think we all know the story of Peter Pan, so I'm not going to write a synopsis of the story.There are three things that show that this is the way the story should be told:1. Neverland is a wild place. With savage Indians, blood thirsty pirates, and vicious mermaids, who would drown you as soon as look at you. Even the ""nice"" fairies"" have an edge to them.2. Wendy Darling isn't a wimp. When it comes right down to it, she picks up a sword and starts swinging. It's always bothered me that a girl with the courage to go to learn how to fly, travel to ""the second star to the right and straight on 'til morning"" would have to stand there wringing her hands while all the boys did the fighting. Oh, and in the Disney film, she can't even fly very well...The actress playing Wendy holds her own in this show.3. Jason Issacs.One of the things that makes a good movie great is a great bad guy. Without them, there would be no show. Jason Issacs is without a doubt, the best Hook I have ever seen. He is just sexy, and charismatic enough to make you thing...well, maybe being a pirate could be fun!Issacs is wonderful at playing bad guys. He brought Lucius Malfoy to life for me in the Harry Potter series, but this isn't Lucius Malfoy at sea in a funny costume. He *IS* Hook!On the flipside, he also does a really good, stuffy, proper English father (not to mention having a wonderful shreik!)This movie is a 10. It is on my all time best movie list. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy it. OK...maybe just a kid at heart!",Peter Pan
50,Eddie_weinbauer,Tinkerbell steals the show,4,22 March 2015,"I re watched this today,after first watching it back in 03 when it came out. My first impression was right.The movie is stinker.Well maybe not if you're a child. The sword fighting is really sub par,but I think that comes from the fact that they didn't have time to rehearse them. If they had time to rehearse properly, I think the sword scenes would have been a lot better to look at. Cause the way they come off in the film,they seem like two actors trying way too hard to make it look real. I think they have spent much of the time, practicing flying instead.Captain hook comes off pretty okay. Not too creepy-scary, just evil- scary.The way kids like it I guess.But still a lot better than Christopher walken did as CAPT.Hook. Wendy plays out okay as the slightly worrying mother figure for the boys,but still clenches on to the child in her self Peter pan looks a bit like a girl. Kind of made me wonder if they were opting for a girl all along,but got turned down by the studio exec somewhere along the road. Personally I fell for tinkerbell's acting. She did an excellent job,and I got the impression she was suppose to be the comic sidekick relief. Her acting was just brilliant and she completely steal the show whenever she was on screen. She manage to be both mischievous,with a hint of evil meanness to her, and funny and likable at the same time.What I felt was wrong though, was the sudden use of narrator midway through the movie.I can accept the use of it in the beginning of a movie,but not when they start reusing it midway.Than it just annoys me",Peter Pan

It was easy to tell what was computer animated because there was way too much fast forward movement that didn't blend very well. Neverland looked really dirty. The colors in Neverland were ugly shades of red, purple, blue and the locations in Neverland looked like sets. I don't know if Hook was better or not.

And top-class actor Jason Issacs shows off his acting chops in the dual role of the mild-mannered George Darling, and the irascible Captain Hook. John, Michael and the Lost Boys were absolutely brilliant. (My fav was Sprightly, the ""intellectual"" one). Tinkerbell was irresistible, and one of my favourite actors Richard Briers was an excellent comic foil as Smee. And the set design, special effects and general art direction was absolutely spot on masterful. The one deviation from the standard storyline I could pick is that the Lost Boys do in fact get adopted in the ""real"" world, which actually does work thematically in this version.Of course I will always have a special place for the classic Disney animated version; and I think animation has certain qualities which live-action can't quite match. (And speaking of Disney, there are scenes in here that are very reminiscent of the famed MARY POPPINS movie as well, and they work excellently). But this is in itself totally awesome storytelling that the highest level. I hope it earns a great deal of success and kudos all round. ""I **do** believe in fairies!!! I do! I do!""",Peter Pan

Its goal isn't to reinvent the story as was the case with ""Hook"" (1991), but rather to present a story close to the original work of Barrie. ""Peter Pan"" boasts great sets and effects complemented by an appropriate score.The casting choices for this movie were appropriate. All of the children actors give excellent performances, from Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan and Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy Darling to the Lost Boys and Wendy's brothers. Olivia Williams and Lynn Redgrave perform well as Wendy's mother and aunt respectively. Ludivine Sagnier gives an interesting performance as Tinker Bell. Jason Isaacs has a double role as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook and does well in both. Isaacs has proved adept at villain roles, including as Lucius Malfoy in the recent ""Harry Potter"" films. He is appropriately menacing as Captain James Hook, but also gives Hook a welcome depth. The pirate supporting cast is solid as well, led by Richard Briers, who is an appropriate choice to play Smee.The film's story is well-developed and engaging from start to finish. I was impressed by the degree of characterization in the film. The action scenes were also well-paced and not overdone. ""Peter Pan"" is superb as an adaptation of J.M.

56,Dragoneyed363,What could've easily been a total disaster...,10,26 July 2009,"... turned out to be a completely lovable, totally magical, surprising masterpiece that I can easily say is one of the best films of all time.Well, I'm going to start off by saying that I loved the whole entire atmosphere and feel to this movie; Every single second and scene was sheer joy and it just is one of those films that drags you in and doesn't let go! I have not read the books or seen the play, but a lot of comments say that this is the truest version of Peter Pan and I'm going to stick with them!Another thing is there was no ""over-the-top""ness. Like, all the characters could've easily been portrayed by actors that tried way too hard and ended up ruining the film, but surprisingly no characters were annoying or unlikeable. What fantastic performances! Everyone did an excellent job and made all the characters so enticing and down-to-the-core wonderful! I mean, Jeremy Sumpters is the best Peter Pan there ever was, Ludivine Sagnier was an amazing Tinkerbell, certainly better then Julia Roberts, as well as Jason Isaacs being overly-skilled here with his unforgettable performances as both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook.Another thing I love is that they gave Peter Pan a heart and a passionate personality unlike the Disney version and the dreadful Hook. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the 1953 classic, but one thing they failed to do in that they do in this was give him personality and pizazz, and actually feelings towards Wendy, the sexual tension between them was easy to spot and another great thing about the movie; Don't even get me started on Hook.In the 1953 we only see Peter Pan with a one-sided attitude that keeps throughout the whole film, but in this they took the extra step and actually taught him to love, and as well as change his emotions dramatically. Plus, they couldn't have chose a more beautiful face for Peter Pan. Like I said, Jeremy Sumpters is an incredibly amazing Peter Pan and him being a total hottie only adds to his perfectness for the role. I loved seeing him as the playful, energetic, lovable character that he portrayed perfectly. The graphics got a little edgy and some of the lines became questionable and a little childish, but I really don't care! This movie was beautifully entrancing enough to where I can overlook it's very, very, very few and minor problems. Overall there isn't one thing I would've changed about this movie.Why is this movie still in my head days after viewing?! It is fantastic, unforgettably majestic and truly under appreciated! I enjoyed every second, was so intrigued and astounded by the characters, performances from the actors and actresses playing the characters, plot, and overall mood and atmosphere that they gave this astonishing gem. Yes, it's really as wonderful as I'm making it out to be and like I said, this could've easily been an over-the-top, mediocre, highly unlikeable mess that dishonored the great name of Peter Pan, but it wasn't, it wasn't even close to that at all, look to Hook for that disappointment.Go out and see it immediately if you haven't for it is absolutely miraculous! It is one of the biggest shames in the world that this failed at the box office, but then again it's competition was Lord of the Rings, which was suicide anyway. No matter, I will always love it and have already watched it 10 times in one week. It's miraculous, okay, going to shut up now, you've got my point that this one of the best movies ever made and anyone who hasn't seen it is missing out, tremendously...",Peter Pan
57,neenahhh,My favorite adaptation of J.M. Barrie's tale!,10,27 December 2011,"Ever since I was a child, I always did like fairy tales- the tale of the boy who would not grow up, included. The first version of ""Peter Pan"" that I knew and liked was the Disney version. When I saw that there was another version of ""Peter Pan"" (aka. this 2003 version), my younger self must have thought that she should give it a try. In other words, I had bought this DVD just out of plain curiosity. That was smart thinking of my younger self, because until now, this adaptation remains to be my favorite of J.M. Barrie's tale.I loved this version of ""Peter Pan""! I found that it captured the true essence of the magic tale. Jason Isaacs, Jeremy Stumper and Rachel Hurd-Wood were first class in this one! What I particularly liked was the chemistry between Peter and Wendy. Jason Isaacs was also great here! After re-watching this on Star Movies, I realized that Jason Isaacs really is a superb actor. He managed to play both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook wonderfully.I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. It left me with a happy feeling, and some questions for myself and my life. In general, this film just made me love and appreciate my life.Viewed on: December 26, 2011",Peter Pan
58,AZINDN,Delightful Barrie Interpretation for the Ageless,9,15 June 2005,"Having grown up with Mary Martin's television performances of Peter Pan, I never imagined the character portrayed by anyone other than a middle aged woman. With Jeremy Sumpter's agile and gender correct performance, Peter Pan becomes the screen's most attractive youth who won't grow up with adolescent bravado and impish cuteness. An all-round exceptional cast of actors whose credits rarely include children's stories, this film is a delight, and truly aimed at the young as well as older audiences who might accompany them.The ambiguous ""hidden kiss"" that lurks in the corner of Wendy's full lips is sensuous and innocent as it should be. It is this element of budding sexuality depicted with tact that has no comparison in the innuendo-heavy bathroom humor typical of young teen oriented comedies that Hollywood produces ad nauseum. Wendy's attraction to Peter's seductive grin is a kind of first blush that is girlish and childish, but also exciting. Wendy's desire to follow Pan to the land of the lost boys where she will tell them stories of Cinderella and be a surrogate mother is playing at maturity but also flirtatious and filled with a curiosity of budding womanhood. It is an element rarely handled in film interpretations of children's genre, however, it was an unmistakable element always just below the surface in period 19th century literature. All the young actors in this film are natural, enormously believable, and attractive. So believable are their adventures in Neverland against Hook and with Princess Tiger Lily and the Indians that we too are swept up joining the experience of fighting with swords and flying. This is heady fantasy the director never permits the cast to become over the top. In the lush setting of Neverland, the visual sensation is rich as color is used to convey more than just the physical.While versatile veteran British actors include Lynn Redgrave as the biddy aunt, it is Jason Isaac in a standout performance doing duty in the traditional double role of the nebbish clerk-father James Darling, and dastardly, evil, snidely Capt. Hook. The versatile actor shines with seething vileness and envy at the happiness of Pan and Wendy, while failing to impress in his own home as Mr. Darling. Perhaps no other film to date conveys the transitory beauty of childhood to adolescence on the brink of maturity and physical change with such deft handling, scenic drama, and swashbuckling action that is complex and bittersweet. Charming scenes such as Peter and Wendy's dance in the moonlight underscore the awareness of growing emotional maturity. Although seductive, growing up remains an enemy of Peter. His decision never to grow up, to love, and to experience feelings as an adult is filled with layers of meaning that might be lost on younger audience members. Moreso, it is Hook's dire predictions to Wendy that the very elements she is attracted to in Peter are the ""riddle of his being,"" also hints at Freudian allusions to the father-daughter complex that seem far beyond the comprehension of younger audiences. Wendy can not have feelings for the boy Peter as a lover, nor is she permitted to be attracted to the duo character of the father-enemy, James Darling/Capt. Hook. She is in limbo until imparting on Peter her hidden kiss, a gift that can only be given once in a young girl's life. Wendy's story is one of the inevitable. She must leave Neverland to be the woman, the storyteller, and the mother-wife. It is only in Neverland that faeries and childhood are never ending, and -- where a thimble is a precious and powerful thing.A film for the entire family and holiday perfect. This is a soaring and captivating rendition of a classic that makes the heart smile. Simply sublime.",Peter Pan
59,clydestuff,The definitive version,10,20 July 2004,"When I was very young, the first version of Peter Pan I saw was the annual televised production of the Broadway Musical starring Mary Martin. It was delightful in its own limited way because after all, when Mary as Peter took to the skies you could definitely see the wires. Not to mention that Peter's shadow looked suspiciously like female hosiery sewn together in the shape of a boy. Some years later, when it was first released on video, I finally was able to enjoy the animated Disney version of J.M. Barrie's classic story. The songs, the animation, the characters were all first rate. Later, I caught a special showing of the Broadway Peter Pan again, this time with Cathy Rigby filling the shoes of Mary Martin. She was full of spunk and energy, and certainly had the physical frame for the role but you could still see the wires. Then Stephen Spielberg tried his hand at it, bringing us Robin Williams as a grown up Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook and even Julia Roberts as Tinkerbelle. Spielberg called his film Hook, and it's the first time that character was ever given star billing. I like Julia Roberts, but the beam of light used for Tinkerbelle in the Broadway production gave a better performance. Of course, being a Spielberg film you couldn't see the wires, but surprisingly Spielberg somehow forgot to make his film either interesting or magical. I'd rather have had the magic and seen the wires. The question is, just how many versions of the story does one need? Please don't despair, as it turns out, the latest may just be the greatest of them all.In late 2003, Director P.J. Hogan brought to the screen his vision of the boy who would never grow up and having just viewed it on DVD, I can proclaim with all honesty that it shall forever be the definitive version of Peter Pan. Well, at least for me it will be. Through the spectacular use of CGI, Hogan brings us a wondrous and beautiful Neverland never before realized on film. From the opening scenes in London and the flight to Neverland, to the snow encased ship of Captain Hook and his Pirates, each scene is rendered in illustrious detail. In one of the more humorous bits in the film when Peter loses his shadow, the shadow takes on a life of its own and it sure isn't unused panty hose. When Peter Pan flies, he does so unimpeded by any laws of gravity, twirling, bouncing, and floating, in a whimsical way that not unlike Superman, will convince you that with the help of good thoughts and fairy dust, a boy can indeed fly. With each movement, Tinkerbelle emits a shining sparkling cloud of fairy dust that fills the screen like a thousand Independence Day Sparklers. When Peter, Wendy, John, and Michael first arrive in Neverland, they land on puffy pinkish clouds, which are quickly bombarded by Captain Hook and his cannons. In one of the most compelling and touching scenes in the film, Peter and Wendy are witness to a fairy dance, and then take to the skies themselves in an airborne ballet. When Pan takes flight to engage in swordplay with Hook and his pirates the scenes are nothing short of amazing. These are just a few of the many magical, charming, and energizing moments throughout Peter Pan.As for the story, it pretty much sticks to previous incarnations we've seen in the books, films, and on Broadway. Wendy tells stories, Pan listens and loses his shadow one night, the dog Nana makes a mess of things a few times, Papa tells Wendy she has to grow up, Pan comes back to retrieve said shadow and off we go!There is however, something inherently different about the relationship between Pan and Wendy than anything previously seen. We are made well aware of the fact that Wendy stands on the threshold of womanhood, and all indications are that the process has indeed begun. Peter, on the other hand, had run away from home with Tinkerbelle, before the rites of passage from boyhood to manhood had commenced. It is well within Wendy's ability to love, whereas the concept of true love is a foreign concept for Peter. He cannot love, and will not love, and is firm in his resolve to stay a boy forever. It sets up a much more tense conflict between Wendy and Peter and adds an emotional depth to the story never before realized.Much of the success of Peter Pan also has to go to the young actors portraying Peter and Wendy. Jeremy Sumpter, who shined in Bill Paxton's haunting film Frailty, will make you forget any previous portrayal. For most of the film he is as he should be, the carefree rascal who sees fighting Hook and his crew as the ultimate in playground merriment. Late in the film, as he discovers the darker side of his emotions, he handles the transition as well if not better than many adult actors.For Wendy, Hogan chose English Actress Rachael Hurd-Wood. As far as I can discover, this is her first film role of any kind, yet one would hardly believe that would be possible from watching this film. When she discovers she is on the verge of entering womanhood, she is able to portray both the fear and loathing of the prospect, but yet she depicts a wide eyed curiosity of what is to take place. Later, her anger and frustration in dealing with Peter's vow of perpetual childhood, has the same believability of someone twice her age dealing with the same conflicting feelings.Most of the adult actors are no slouches either. Jason Isaacs does a duo role as both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. How good is he? I didn't realize he was playing both roles until referencing the credits on IMDb. As Mr. Darling, the timid banker, he reminded me a lot of David Tomlinson's Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins. His Hook is as dastardly a hook that has ever taken the screen. Let's just say that when this Hook does away with someone, they pretty much stay dead and you won't see that kind of ruthless in the Disney animated film. Olivia Williams as Mrs. Darling is perhaps the weakest link in the film. She seems not to be able to portray the deep sadness that comes when one's children are missing, and likewise her joy at their return home is equally unimpressive. She is clearly overshadowed by Lynn Redgrave as Aunt Millicent.And what about Tinkerbelle? I certainly can't leave her out. She is played with a lot of panache by an actress named Ludivine Sagnier. She does it with a lot of spunk, a little sass, and a ton of energy. She will quickly make you completely forget the fact that Julia Roberts made a mockery of the same role in Spielberg's Hook.And most importantly there's the biggest surprise of all. Having seen the trailer several times before the film's release last years, I was under the assumption that as it always seems to be the case these days, most of the really good stuff was shown in those few minutes of advertising. I couldn't have been more wrong. Let's just say that if you saw the previews in the theater or on the internet, what you saw is just the tip of the iceberg of the discoveries waiting for you within this film.One may come to the conclusion that perhaps I am going overboard in my praise. Yet, whether you are young or just young at heart, or wish you could fly away from your troubles to the wonderful place called Neverland, there is something in Peter Pan for even the most cynical film-goer. For an hour and fifty three minutes, it certainly made me feel younger than my years, and when a film does that I have no choice but to give it my grade and it's an A sprinkled with a healthy dose of fairy dust.",Peter Pan
60,Keemshave,Underrated adventure movie,8,16 November 2020,"This rendition of Peter Pan is one that honors the source material with care. The casting works very well, and the effects are just good enough to sweep you away to this world of fantasy. When it comes to adventure movies centered around kids, not many discuss this film, but this version of Peter Pan is one of the better movies in that genre.",Peter Pan
61,bosscain,best version Ive ever seen,9,28 December 2003,This version of Peter Pan is the best version Ive seen.while going to the theatre I thought that it would be another poor and lame atempt to this story.but I was plesently surprised at how good it was.Aside from its obligatory happy ending this was much darker and not so cutesy and kiddish like other versions.,Peter Pan
62,pied,Great Adaptation!,10,13 June 2004,"Peter Pan was the first Disney movie I saw.  I remember as a child of six or seven trying to fly off our porch and even looking longingly at the garage roof.  How many broken arms and legs resulted from Disney's Peter Pan.I never thought that a live-action film could do justice to this J.M. Barrie classic.  I was wrong.This rendition of Peter Pan is excellent.  It follows the storyline more faithfully than the animated version.  The acting and special effects are marvelous.I loved the movie.  Hook, by the way, is played by the same man, Jason Isaacs, just as he was played by Hans Conreid in the Disney version.
Children and adults will appreciate Peter Pan.  Young children may be bothered by some stabbings, hook rattling, and a huge computer- generated crocodile.",Peter Pan
63,GuyCC,Beyond Any Expectation I Could Have Had.,10,6 February 2004,"When I went to finally see ""Peter Pan"", I expected it to be ""cute"", and nothing more.  Perhaps the music in the trailer set the mood for me, or it didn't show off the lush vastness of what the film has to offer.  However, I was curious in seeing it, and so with a friend, I sat down to watch.I don't know how I managed to go this long before giving it a chance.Forget the trailers or any associations to the Disney classic.  This is by NO means like Disney's film.    There is a short build up of the children in their boring, ordinary world (which is fine, has its funny moments and doesn't drag down the pace at all), and immediately, the children (and the viewer) are whisked off to Neverland.At this point, the film becomes magic.One can see why Peter Pan refuses to leave Neverland.  It's a world filled with pirates and mermaids and Indians and adventure and danger and everything else that excites the mind's eye and imagination of a child. This film is absolutely gorgeous in its visuals.  It's like watching a two hour painting.This is a darker telling of ""Peter Pan"", with a little more of a danger element added from the Disney film (I compare this as this is what most people likely know), but it has a very playful sense of humor with several tongue in cheek comments made throughout.  It never delves into ""potty humor"", and its wit is quite clever.  Finally, a ""children's film"" that doesn't patronize the viewer.Actually, I hesitate to call it a ""children's film"".  It's more of a ""child at heart"" film.  It's hard to pinpoint what makes it so enjoyably fun: The acting quality (another example of proving that child actors can act when the correct children are chosen), a score that complimented the moods and the actions on-screen, Smee's performance (I loved the breaking the fourth wall antics to make a commentary on the action)....  It all blended so well to make a fantastic movie.My only real criticisms are the criticisms that the film itself has received.  There has been debate registered on how the ""romantic"" overtones of this film are a little too powerful.  To that, I can only say that it is not as bad as it is made out to be.  Both the characters of Peter and Wendy are attracted to each other, but it never goes any further or deeper than most of the ""first love"" feelings of awkwardness and curiosity.  They are pre-teens in this tale, and it's nothing that is shocking, offensive, or anything to be overly concerned about.""Peter Pan"" is a beautiful film.  A film that has been overlooked for the most part, which is a shame, because this is really an amazing experience. This is one to wait for when it hits DVD, but the movie-going public will be denying themself the full experience if they miss these visuals and story in the theater.Truly a remarkable and engaging film.",Peter Pan
64,miken-3,Just didn't work for me!,6,24 January 2005,"I have seen several versions of the Pan story (notably Disney's and Mary Martin's) and while this story are great special effects and fairly good directing, this movie lacked the fun of those other versions. Also, the heavy British accents made it difficult to understand what the actors were saying at times. It was interesting to finally see a ""real"" boy play Pan and I guess the movie is a ""coming of age"" of sorts for him. However, doesn't coming of age mean the end of childhood and everything that symbolized Peter Pan? I saw this film with my young children and both were quite bored. This movie is probably geared more for older adults than children or even teenagers for that matter.",Peter Pan
65,qball_82,Lack-luster.,6,18 December 2003,"The good - stunning storybook visuals, some gorgeous imagery, beautiful soundtrack.The bad - scratch through this highly glossed surface and you will find a rather shallow, lack-luster re-telling of the Peter Pan story.I'm sadly disappointed.",Peter Pan
66,kill-the-boxtrolls,Disappointment,2,6 January 2010,"I was a HUGE fan of Peter Pan when I was little, then within a long time ago, I watched Winn-Dixie and like really liked it, and then this film came on. It was a HUGE disappointment of the classic Peter Pan along with terrible acting, terrible story, and bad script almost as horrid as the horrible Alice In Wonderland series. The characters didn't really seem to fit the characters from the other Peter Pan like Tinker Bell seemed more senseless then happy, she should be pathetic and have a heart attack. Peter Pan didn't seem to act Sonic-like, he wasn't really benefit on the other characters like Wendy or something and Wendy was supposed to be alone after all. Wendy seemed careless in this version like ""I don't care about this, I don't care about that I'll just run home and cry my eyes out."" It's just too much and Wendy seems a little like a Mary-Sue or shall I say uninteresting or boring because of too many ideas for her and throughout the whole movie was boring and uninteresting. The only thing I liked about the movie was The Lost Boys, that's it. I'm not a type of movie goer who likes silly and movies that don't fit my attention. I mean, I like dramas and comedies and all that, but I just don't like emo especially movies that are silly and insensible and just don't make any sense. I'll excuse that.",Peter Pan
67,Jim-Eadon,Pan-tastic. (sorry),10,1 February 2004,"This divine movie took me by surprise. I very nearly didn't watch it, assuming it was a movie for kids. The reality is different, indeed, Peter Pan is too violent/disturbing for little 'uns. Circa 16 year old males may dislike this movie because it's not ""kewl"". At that age you're bored with anything that doesn't contain explosions, sex and action, not a movie swarming with bratlets, and there's nowt wrong with that!But, for me, being a stately (i.e. way too ancient) 35 right now, I eventually twigged that this movie may be interesting, so I have it a spin. And the wager paid off. The Peter Pan story was nebulous to me, I've not read the book or seen any PP movies (though there exists a silent version that is magical, apparently). All I remember is a scene or two from the cartoon of the once-great Disney from when I was a diminutive brat myself. So the plot twists in this movie were, to me, unexpected events - which means I probably got more out this movie than most, for the very reason that most of the time I didn't have a clue what would happen next.I later learned that there had been some grumblings, by righteous do-gooders no doubt, that this movie somehow pandered to paedophilia. Absurd! It's a shameful reflection on any society that mistakes the child-like innocence that this movie delights in as perversion. This is another sign of the lack of perspective in supposedly advanced quarters of our world. It is a deep irony that this blind paranoia is exactly the type of corruption of the adult mind that Peter Pan is opposed to! The magical world of childhood is right here, in this movie laid before us! A world where medicine is feared more than death, a microcosm where fairies are as natural as bees.If indignant adults seriously want to protect kids, then obviously they should they protect them from sexual predators, but likewise we should NOT permit a society that encourages kids to grow fat and ugly on health-wrecking fast food and coke! It's all in the name of profits you know. If that isn't perverse, I don't know what is!I love the look of Peter Pan: it brims with the cosy nostalgia of a lost world. The casting is also perfect. OK, so PP didn't quite come across as a skilled actor, but few would compared to Wendy, more on her in a bit. But somehow he was fine, he got the tone right, and that matters the most. It seemed apt that he's a bit aloof, his role is that of an alien figure from a parallel universe forever elusive and out of reach. He is puck-like, rather than sugary-cutesey.Jeremy Isaacs tackles both Mr Darling and Hook and the contrast draws attention to the fact that he can A-C-T! Another display of thespian virtuosity is by the lass that plays Wendy. She defies the law that teenagers in Hollywood-produced movies are tedious, annoying brats. She is one of the few actresses that can steal scenes in a movie, let alone in a scene-stealing festival such as this! Her ecstatic smile as she gazes upon fairies: that's an unforgettable smile! It is the smile of one that smiles at things with innocence, something that I think I, and perhaps nearly all 'Grown-ups', have forgotten how to do!Fairies! O the ethereal Tink, a dainty sprite of joi de vivre! I only realised afterwards that she is Ludivine Sagnier, the gorgeous seductress in Swimming Pool.",Peter Pan

The adults will understand it more, but the children will cheer, as happened in the theatre where I saw it. It is the best children's film of the year, and is just as good as Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. I loved every minute of it. I saw the trailer by accident and was ""hooked"" or I never would have considered seeing a kid's film. It's certainly not just for kids. See the trailer, and then see the film.

69,critic-2,"Along with Mary Martin's version, this is the best",10,20 January 2004,"After not being able to for nearly a month, I finally got a chance to see this new version of ""Peter Pan"" yesterday. It is nearly everything I could ever hope for, and the flaws in it are so minor that they are insignificant compared with the virtues of the production. This version of ""Peter Pan"" just may become the standard by which all future non-musical versions of the story will be judged--that is, if the film is given the kind of chance it should be given. It does not take a genius to see that the hype given to the latest ""Lord of the Rings"" installment has completely thrown the chances ""Peter Pan"" might have had out of kilter.I am not trying to diminish the staggering magnitude of Peter Jackson's magnificent trilogy. But someone must fairly acknowledge the excellence of this ""Peter Pan"" as well. Director P.J. Hogan has been quite reasonably faithful to the beloved stage classic, even to the point of retaining quite a lot of J.M. Barrie's original 1904 dialogue. All the most famous lines are here:""Second to the right--and straight on this morning"", ""To die will be an awfully big adventure"", ""Hook or me this time"", and so on. There is not a weak link in the entire cast--Jeremy Sumpter is the perfect Peter Pan, although he does tend to speak some of his lines a little too quickly, Jason Isaacs is a truly frightening and unlovable Captain Hook, as opposed to the comical villain we are used to seeing. He is almost unrecognizable as Mr. Darling, and proves his enormous versatility and chameleon-like ability in both roles. Rachel Hurd-Wood is the best Wendy I have ever seen; if things go well for her, she has an assured future as an excellent actress--and so on, and on.The only quarrel I would have with the adaptation is that Tiger Lily's part in the story is severely reduced; it is John and Michael who are kidnapped by the pirates rather than her. But she is given a hilarious bit when the two boys are rescued, and rather than being full of innuendo, as some critics have charged, it comes off as a welcome bit of innocent humor.Which brings me to the way some critics have treated this film--charging that it has an improper sexual undercurrent that other ""Peter Pan"" versions don't. I frankly think that such statements reveal much more about what critics like to read into films than the films themselves. There is absolutely NOTHING SUGGESTIVE about this film, and those who insist that there is frankly are hypersensitive to suggestions of sexual innuendo. The potential sexual humor in this film will go right over children's heads; in fact, I found the humor quite funny without being in the least salacious. Tinker Bell in this version is hilariously cynical in her jealousy of the relationship between Peter and Wendy. The drawing that Wendy innocently makes of Peter hovering over her bed is not intended to be suggestive at all-- it is her teachers who wonder about it--a clear scriptwriter's jab at people with dirty minds, and it is clear that Peter had no improper intention whatsoever.The relationship between Peter and Wendy is more clearly poignant than in other versions. It is clear that she loves him, although more in a puppy-love way than as an adult, and it is equally clear he does not understand her feelings because he is too intent on remaining a boy. In the Mary Martin version this situation was made into a comical moment--in this one, it takes on sadness.The production design, special effects, photography and costumes are excellent, and the full weight of Barrie's tragic overtones has been caught on screen for the very first time. There are some frightening scenes in this version, especially that crocodile, but many truly magical ones as well. Do not wait until this ""Peter Pan"" shows up on DVD, VHS or cable. Rush to see it now, while you have the chance, and let's hope the Academy takes notice of it.",Peter Pan
70,ks4,Solid adaption of a classic story.,7,9 April 2004,"Another adaption of the classic story, one would think there wouldn't be room for another one, what new could yet another adaption bring to this story, this does however, succed most of the way.The story is as usual, Wendy is tired of the worries she faces as the adult life is coming towards her, Peter Pan is watching her in her room, telling stories about pirates and mermaids, one day he loses his shadow in her room, gets caught, and offers her to come with him to Neverland, where there are no worries and one never grows up to face the adult life, there are pirates, and yeah uh, they can fly! However Wendy does face other worries being on Neverland, and it's not the adult life.Lets start with what i disliked, or well i wouldn't say disliked, but what i considering the lower parts of the story, first of all i think the movie stranded somewhere in between trying to be both a mature and thoughtfull movie about development, and being a movie made for kids, the story itself is told very mature, maybe too mature, therefore it feels like they had to make up to this with including random scenes where it suddenly becomes very childish, and yeah i don't believe this movie is really made for kids, it's a very mature version of Peter Pan, especially with the obvious relationship between Wendy and Peter, a part is perhaps a bit too intimate for smaller children, however, as a grown up, i consider this the most important difference from older Peter Pan movies, to this one.P.J Hogan does a good job instructing this movie, it's pretty much average and the only thing i really noticed was the use of color and weather towards Peter Pans feelings, very clearly shown in the final scenes on board of the ship fighting against Captain Hook. A pretty standard, though solid, directing.The real strength of this movie lies in the two main child actors in the roles of Wendy and Peter Pan, the great chemistry between those two is what really gives a lot of heart and thoughts into the story, something that strives to make it more original even though it's told over an already halfway burnout story. Especially Rachel Hurd-Wood does an absolutely stunning job in the role of Wendy, i usually think kid performances are beneath average, which is natural i guess, but this performance is to a top grade without a doubt, she carries the movie together with Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan and Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook.Sum up, i found this movie enjoyable and interesting, however i can't grade it rather high as we all know all the way through the ending and the different twists to the story, you can't exactly call it original, but the movie experiments a bit with an already known story, good movie i recommend it mainly for adult ppl, but it could probably also go for teens and children, for the adult audience i can only say, don't mind the childish scenes, i found them annoying, but overall, a good movie.7/10",Peter Pan
71,HollisWoods,"Beautiful Writing, Beautiful Acting, Beautiful Visuals",10,1 March 2021,"Peter Pan's story was always about how growing up doesn't mean you have to ""grow up,"" and that you should always be ready for an adventure. Life has this way of taking away innocence and fun, and Peter Pan is always a symbol to never let that part go as you transition to adulthood. Yes, there are life responsibilities to take care of, but those responsibilities shouldn't get in the way of having fun or being imaginative.As this film stays true to the original story's morals, it also expands on other issues, such as social status and the role of women in Victorian times. We really get a deeper look into Mr. Darling's struggle to rise up the social ladder amongst his peers. And the character of Aunt Millicent is there to stress the need of Wendy to grow up to be a proper woman, and what the definition of ""proper"" was in this time period.Throw realism out the window! This entire film looks like a painting! And it's not just in Neverland. Even in London, the coloring is so vibrant and mystical, especially in the sky. The sequence of them flying to Neverland is unrealistic in an extravagant way. The visuals of this movie all together don't even try to imitate real life, which enhances the fantasy aspect of this fantasy action movie. The coloring stood out, too, as there were many blues and cool colors until the climatic battle in which there were a lot of reds and warm colors.Speaking of visuals, the fairy dance is the most beautiful scene in this entire film. Between the lights, the music, and Peter and Wendy floating with the fairies, it's a stunning scene.And, Speaking of Music, this is one of my favorite soundtracks by James Newton Howard. I love his work in films like Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them and Disney's Treasure Planet and Atlantis, but the Peter Pan soundtrack stands out in a different way. Very beautiful!The casting of this was perfect. Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan was an absolute heart throb. Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy both did such a good job of giving another layer of emotion to the characters and had such great chemistry together. And of course, Jason Isaacs as Mr. Darling & Captain Hook - I wouldn't have cast it any other way. The Lost Boys were adorable, Mrs. Darling was beautiful, and Smee looked like Smee.This iteration of Peter Pan took time to expand on Mr. & Mrs. Darling and their points of views. The movie gave them more screen time to establish who they were, to get a look into how they dealt with their missing children, and gave them time in the end to develop. Mrs. Darling was a loving mother from start to finish. But even though Mr. Darling only had maybe six minutes of screen time total, he was one of the more developed characters in the whole movie. This made the final scene reunion very touching.Many kid shows try to shove pre-teen romances in our faces to get the naïve kids invested in a cheap love story. These days, we have Stranger Things' Mike & Eleven raising the bar on how natural and believable pre-teen romances can be. But before we had Stranger Things, we had PJ Hogan's Peter Pan.With this live action remake, extra time was put into a lot of story elements, like Peter & Wendy's relationship. Their relationship felt very natural and intimate, and most importantly believable. This is thanks to both the good writing and brilliant acting. As a kid, I gushed about them. And now as an adult, I still found myself hooked to the pair. When Wendy returns home and they say goodbye, Peter looks back and they stare at each other for a good seven seconds, at least, without saying a word. And so much was said in their facial expressions and eyes. Sometimes the best moments don't need spoken dialogue.That final moment between them actually revealed a lot about Peter Pan as a character. Towards the beginning of the film, he says ""To die would be an awfully big adventure."" He later rephrases his statement after saying goodbye to Wendy and says ""To live would be an awfully big adventure,"" as looks down at the Darlings' and Lost Boys being a family. Then he flies off to Neverland and that's the end.What I love about that moment is that Peter still wants to be a boy, he still wants to have adventures, and he'll continue to be some sort of God figure in Neverland. But his experience with Wendy was the only real authentic connection he ever had with anyone. And as humans, we depend on connections like that. Falling in love was something he never thought he'd do, and as he lives as an immortal kid, Wendy will probably always be in the back of his mind.",Peter Pan
72,Juni78ukr,Best family movie of the year,9,19 March 2004,"I watched this recent remake of Peter Pan today, and I found it very good and entertaining. At first this remake followed the classic story closer than any Peter Pan before and P.J. Hogan proves himself as a very intelligent and smart director. He managed to create a bright and beautiful world of Neverland, world of magic and adventure. Peter Pan movie with lots of action, Indians and pirates and at the same time the story is concentrated not not on them. The key points of the story as well as of the play and book is adolescence, growing up, relations between kids and their parents and first innocent love. The excellent script in combination with well-written dialogs successfully carry all those themes. Visual effects are terrific and that's the most important all of them are eminently suitable here. There are no senseless explosions or fight scenes, all here in a right place. Finally the acting is pretty good, particularly for such a family friendly movie. For the first time in a movie title character is played by a real kid, and played exceptionally good by Jeremy Sampter. He is adorable and at the same time he is reasonably athletic and not too youth. Racher Hurd-Wood also deserves best credits as Wendy and Jason Isaacs is equally good in both of his appearances (a nice tribute to old tradition). The soundtrack, written by James Newton Howard was on a highest level as all above mentioned. The music was pretty nice and captivating. In any point of view P.J.Hogan's Peter Pan is an excellent movie both for adult and young audience and best Peter Pan movie so far.My grade 8.5 out of 10",Peter Pan

74,ColeSear,Best Film of 2003,10,10 January 2004,"There should be a rule that bars people from remaking a story when the definitive edition has been made. While I loved the much maligned 'Hook' and Disney's version  PJ Hogan created the perfect version of this tale. It uses more from the book than ever and even improves on some elements. The proper theatrical conventions are kept like Hook and the Father being played by the same actor and also the proper ones were done away with like a woman playing Peter's roleThis is the way the story of Peter Pan should be told The imagery is balanced between fantastical and realistic. Every single character is perfectly cast, especially Jeremy Sumpter as Peter. The special effects were so amazing and unique I was actually surprised to see that Industrial Light and Magic did them. The film flows beautifully with scenes that seem as if they are pulled straight from my dreams.This is a story that has alway been very dear to me and I feel that people are making way to much of this film. Peter's escape embodies a fear all children suffer from at one point or another: growing up. This is the essence of the film and the conflict is heightened by the fact that Wendy loves Peter and for him to love her back he knows he'd have to grow up.  One day we know we must grow up. As children we envy Peter's being but know that our destinies are more those of Wendy, Michael and John. As adults we find Peter's dream of perpetual childhood beautiful but as we see his heart breaking because he cannot change who he is and live with the Darlings, so do ours. For that is our plight. There is not an audience this film can't play to for that very reason. It's a heartwarming, swashbuckling, Funny, adventurous, to say that its an experience doesn't do it justice. This film is truly a dream come true.It's impossible not to like this movie. Open your heart, shut off your brain and watch Peter Pan the way it was meant to be seen.",Peter Pan
75,elu5iv3,Very good movie for Xmas...,8,19 December 2003,"Saw the movie yesterday on it's first day of release in Australia. It was a very, very good Xmas release, I'd probably give it an 8/10. I heard the acting wasn't good, but I totally disagree, everyone was good and charming in their roles. Without spoiling anything (although most people already know how Peter Pan plays out), the movie had a good mix of emotional moments and nice music, the sort that doesn't bring you to tears, but does have you holding them back a little. Jeremy Sumpter was excellent and visually impressive as Peter. He stood out in several ways (great facial expressions for example), one being that he was the only actor in the entire movie with an American accent, which was strange. He made you remember what it was like to be a mischievous child, and really shone. He should have a very bright future, and hopefully won't fade out like many child actors do. Rachel Hurd-Wood was very impressive as Wendy too. The movie did disappoint in a couple of areas. Primarily, we didn't really get to see the true ""wonder"" of Neverland. Much of the movie was shot at night time, which confused me as it's supposed to be a vibrant type flick (which it was, just not as much as I expected). Also, I found Tinkerbell to be quite irritating. Hook was very well done though. The cinematography and soundtrack were both awesome... but again, it was almost like their budget ran out and they couldn't show all of Neverland, I felt like something was missing. But overall, very enjoyable and nice movie. I hope it doesn't get overshadowed by Return of the King's release, because it deserves to do very well. By the way, I'm 21 and never get tired of ""children's movies"" like this and ""Finding Nemo""... and especially Hayao Miyazaki's anime movies.",Peter Pan
76,ufo0001,****/4,10,10 March 2004,"Excellent film, fast paced, funny and awesome special effects plus the directing and acting is really good. Wendy darling and her brothers get taken to neverland by peter pan where they have all sorts of adventures. My pick for best ""hollywood"" movie this year. People have said the film is a bit raunchy but it wasn't bad and really it depends on what kind of person your are they way you view the film ""sexual"" content. I wasn't too surprised when this movie tanked in the box office, marketing was bad because i hardly saw any trailers for the movie and i was the only one who knew it was coming out. But i expect it to be a success in DVD.Pros: Acting, score, directing, script.Cons: None.Bottom line: Better than hook.",Peter Pan
77,ivony,Rather Enchanting...An Unexpected Gem,9,31 May 2004,"I had put off seeing this newest version of Peter Pan after sitting through countless horrid renditions of the magical fairy tale and not wanting to endure another.  But, my kids really wanted to see this one (and honestly, my curiosity was piqued) so I was convinced.  And glad I was! 
While I agree with some of the comments that director Hogan doesn't spend nearly enough time fully exploring Neverland, he does create a beautiful realization from book to movie of the famed faraway fairytale land.  It simply would have been wonderful for Hogan to have allowed the viewers more time to explore Neverland and the rich wonders it holds.  Another downpoint was Jeremy Sumpter's accent (or lack thereof depending on where you're from).  I do believe his mannerisms and characteristics were fabulously portrayed for Peter Pan, but his American accent made him sound more like Huck Finn than our beloved Peter Pan.  In my opinion, this was his only real fault.With the 'negative' aside, let's move on to the positive, for there truly was much more of that in this film.  Jeremy Sumpter's performance as Pan was, overall, fantastic.  Aside from the accent, he portrayed Pan with all the boyishness and bravado that one would expect.  He giggles at the right moments, is brave at the right moments while exhibiting just the right amount of uncertainty, for he is, afterall, only a boy.  Not only were his actions on target, but the voice inflections and facial expressions were as well; and along with that, Sumpter conveyed necessary emotions with his eyes that is difficult even for the most seasoned of actors. 
The true star of the movie, however, is Rachel Hurd-Wood whom I think Barrie could have modeled Wendy after had she been around when he wrote Peter Pan. Rachel Hurd-Wood is absolutely fantabulous as Wendy.  Through every step she has you believing she is Wendy, born to tell fantastic stories, fight pirates, and to love Peter.  Quite simply, she was made for this role.The movie itself is a great mixture of what it should be: love, romance, fear, bravery, happiness, sadness, hope, and most of all a remembrance of youth.  This isn't the Disney ""happy time"" Peter Pan, but one that has it's darker, more sinister moments...as it should, and yet keeps it just a step away from the line so as to remain a film that the whole family can enjoy.I highly recommend this movie to young and old alike...to anyone who enjoys fantasy, fairy tales, family movies and the like.  A very fantastic re-telling of a wonderful story. 4 1/2 out of 5 stars",Peter Pan
78,perlner,magical,10,25 December 2003,"I had been anticipating this movie for a long time and so was setting myself up to be let down - however, it was as magical as I expected, perhaps even more so. I'd been wondering what the critics were talking about when they said it was ""grown up"" and ""rife with sex"" - parents should not worry; it deserves its PG. Yes, there are some latent feelings but that is what childhood is about - this movie is truly a classic for the ages.Production values great. Acting great (especially Ludivine Sagnier as Tinkerbell). Story great.If I could find one flaw it would be that this movie wasn't long enough - the adventures were there but unlike Pirates of the Caribbean, which overstayed its welcome by about an hour, this one flitted from one to the next and by the end I was left wanting more. Perhaps there'll be more in the DVD, but meanwhile it is certainly worth seeing on the big screen!Thumbs up.",Peter Pan
79,RosalieBustingMyBowls,Started my Peter Pan obsession all over again....,10,16 June 2004,"This movie is, in a word, BRILLIANT. I've always been a fan of Peter Pan, and LOVED the Disney and Mary Martin versions we all grew up on, but this film is 100000x better than any other version! This is THE definitive Peter Pan. I can't say enough about it! This has quickly become my favorite film of all time. It's hard for me to explain why, but, NO movie has touched my heart like this before, ever. It's dark, funny, SEXY, intelligent, and a bit scary; just like the original novel.In her film debut as Wendy, I thought Rachel Hurd-Wood was nothing short of brilliant. She really does look like she belongs in another era! I can't believe they found this girl at an open casting call! Amazing. If she chooses to continue acting, Rachel surely has the power to become one of the biggest actresses in the world within the next few years.As for Jeremy Sumpter, he was, in my opinion, equally as brilliant. I've been a fan of his since his first film!! Frailty was obviously a different kind of movie, and Jeremy was good in that, but, he just IS Peter Pan!! I'm not ashamed to admit I have a crush on this boy. His smile melts me every time, and he has the indescribable boyish charm that is essential for the role. I know a lot of people get on his case about his little lisp, and about his supposed ""wooden"" acting, but, I thought he was the perfect choice. Where ELSE would they find a kid who looked good, was fit enough to do all the stunts, AND have the same AMAZING chemistry he had with Rachel?! It just wouldn't have been the same movie without him =) Mark my words, this kid will be a HUGE box-office draw very very soon! A lot of people dislike how Tinker Bell was played, but I really enjoyed Ludvines performance!! Tink is everything she's supposed to be: Jealous, petty, and totally devoted to Peter! She is, after all, a very ""common girl"" and I thought that aspect came across great. There isn't one weak performance in this flick. The Lost Boys are all charming and adorable in their own individual ways. Jason Issacs Hook is UNDENIABLY sexy and intriguing. Jason is also effectively meek and mild as Mr. Darling. As Smee, Richard Briars never fails to get laughs. And Oliva Williams plays the PERFECT Mrs. Darling, and she is really one of the most beautiful woman i've ever seen. This movie was far superior than anything i've seen in a looooong time. I just think it's pretty damn near perfect, and it's already a classic in my eyes. We can quibble all we want about the films imperfections, but, I just like to focus on the MANY things that the movie got right. The special effects are often jaw-dropping without feeling overdone. The colors in this movie are drool-worthy. It's like nothing i've ever seen!This is VASTLY underrated by many people, bur i'm pleased that it got as least mostly positive reviews, and has a devoted fanbase that grows every day! Rent this, and the whole family will love it!! What other movie has sword fighting, flying, fairies, mermaids, indians, pirates, AND romance!?!?Long Live Peter Pan!!!",Peter Pan
80,cujoe_da_man,"""Hook"" did it better.",5,18 August 2019,"Yes, that's right, ""Hook"" with Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman did a better job with the look of Peter Pan... and it wasn't the original telling of the story. The problem I found with this movie was the absolutely atrocious CG and camera work. How could you have such big name blockbusters like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter with awesome imagery and yet have something as iconic as Peter Pan look like it was done on a Pentium II in the early 90's?I'm probably being a bit harsh on it, but when a movie's look is so bad that all you do is sit there and say ""why doesn't it look like he's actually standing there?"" to nearly every scene, it really takes you out of the movie and ruins an otherwise great story.The flying just looked fake with no attention to weight and how the human body would carry itself through the air and the backgrounds (mainly green screen) looked very flat, like someone forgot to adjust the contrast. I could have done better and I don't have the high end hardware and software they used. Half the time it looked like they used some kind of blurring brush around the edges of the actor's bodies, it always looked out of place when flying or were in some location that didn't require a set to be built.The acting was decent, they let the kids be kids and the adults be adults, one of the few things that directors forget with movies like this. Often time casting adults as teens and teens as kids. The one thing that I abhorred was Captain Hook. This version of Captain Hook would have been better suited for something like Pirates of the Caribbean instead of Peter Pan. Sorry, but Dustin Hoffman had the look, the voice and the demeanor I would expect of this character. Smee was a better adaptation of his character than this Captain Hook.Overall, it wasn't a terrible movie, but the CG is just simply terrible and almost unwatchable (I'm talking Scorpion King kind of bad), if it weren't for that, I would have rated this much higher, but I just could not stand looking at it. There is not excuse for something like this when you have movies from the same year with much more superior visuals.",Peter Pan
81,Pigalina,Not just for kids,8,11 October 2005,"If you like your family movies with lots of attempted murder, Peter Pan is the one! I had forgotten just how bloodthirsty the characters in Peter Pan were. Not only are Hook and Peter trying to get rid of each other, Tinkerbell tries to get Wendy killed, Hook tries to murder all of the children and the mermaids even get in on the action. Not to mention the crocodile. The effects were great and it was interesting to watch the special features and see how they made them look like they were flying. It was odd, but inevitable, that everybody was British except for Peter, who was of course American. British children are good only at being posh. Hook was played by Jason Isaacs who plays Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies. He also plays Mr Darling, though I didn't realize this until I looked it up on IMDb.com. I really enjoyed this film. The special features were also quite interesting - I liked the mini documentary on J.M Barrie who wrote Peter Pan. It was presented by Fergie (Sarah Ferguson not Fergie from Black Eyed Peas) for some reason. I also enjoyed the feature on the dogs who played Nana, and how they did their scenes.",Peter Pan
82,Keyska2004,This is the best Peter Pan movie to date!,10,18 November 2010,"A movie that will make you laugh and stays true to the story. Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood make the best Peter Pan and Wendy characters that I have ever seen. Jason Isaacs plays Mr. Darling, Wendy's father as well as Captain James Hook. Richard Briers makes an excellent Smee, Hook's side kick and our true comic relief in this comedy. I have always liked ""Hook"" with Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman until this movie came out and stole the spotlight. The special effects with the fairies, and the attraction between Peter and Wendy is something that you will love. To be able to jump off the bed and fly . . I tried it as a kid, and I still have those strong beliefs that I can fly. You just have to believe, and then the adventure of a lifetime will only just begin.",Peter Pan
83,funky_little_angel,Just magical with a touch of pixie dust,10,21 December 2003,"I really liked 'Peter Pan'. It was very colourful, full of life and overall a beautiful movie. The story has been done many times over, but this version definitely stands out.The acting is very good. Jeremy Sumpter is great as Peter, Rachel Hurd-Wood is amazing as Wendy Darling, and Jason Isaacs is brilliant in the dual roles of Captain Hook and Mr. Darling. I even liked Ludivine Sagnier as Tink - I thought she did the role well. The rest of the cast suited their parts really well too.'Peter Pan' is the story that never grows old. This adaptation has done the story very well - my only problem is I think they focused too much on a romance between Peter and Wendy, which isn't really in the original story.Having said that though, it's still a great movie.",Peter Pan

Is in my top 5. I can watch it over and over again. Full of fantasy and love and action. I can laugh, cry, fell the romance, be in the greatest adventure of all. This movie is absolute perfection! The soundtrack is amazing 10/10 I cry every time I hear ""flying"" and oh! ""Fairy dance"" I can't recommend this move enough. It is soooooo perfect. Everything in it.

85,pjpaix,For ages 12 to 90 - and for fathers everywhere.,9,10 January 2004,"What a unique and wonderful gift of a movie. We're very fortunate that P.J. Hogan managed to get this one past the usual Disneyfied Hollywood types. This is one of those films that manages to be what each viewer wants it to be: girls get an intelligent and beautiful Wendy and/or a sexy Peter Pan; boys get an action flick and a wise-cracking gang of loveable losers; Moms get reaffirmation of the wise, enduring and all-powerful love of a mother - and a love story, by the way. And Dads... Ah yes, Dads like me get an astonishingly frank look at balancing our love and sense of protection for our daughters with the realization that they need to grow up, leave and find their own adventures and romances. It was moving to see both Captain Hook's sad failure and Wendy's father's emotional conversion. Both rang True, with that proverbial capital ""T"".Only a couple of things make this film unsuitable for the young 'uns, and both of these scenes are disturbing because they break a ""kiddie contract"" vis a vis mermaids and fairies. In the former case, mermaids are portrayed as scary, deadly creatures; in the latter, Captain Hook nonchalantly kills off a fairy (flicking it away like a dead beetle after killing it). I know these scenes would have added to my younger daughter's sense of dread in a movie that is ""dark"" to begin with. On the other hand, my 14 year-old, who did go to see it, chuckled nervously at those scenes - but loved the movie, along with (surprise, surprise) Jeremy Sumpter, as Peter Pan.",Peter Pan
86,sbrobin,Pretty boring if you're an adult,3,16 May 2004,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, as I love the story of Peter Pan, but this version just didn't work for me. First of all, while staying true to Barrie's original story, the first 30 minutes almost appeared to be a remake of Spielberg's ""Hook"" than a novelization of the story.  Even the music sounded similar to John Williams' 1991 score. I found myself immediately disliking the actor who portrayed Pan, and most especially, his horrible grin that he felt the need to show every 30 seconds. I wouldn't say he was a bad actor, but he definitely was guilty of overacting during MANY instances of this film, and he just wasn't a very likeable kid in general.  The only actor who I disliked more is Ludivine Sagnier as Tinkerbell.  I really wish they would have killed her off in the first few minutes because she became VERY annoying.  She is a fairly odd-looking person, which I guess fairies are supposed to be, but if anyone on this film was guilty of overacting it's definitely her.  All of her ridiculous facial expressions were just plain annoying rather than cute. I really hated seeing her onscreen, and I didn't buy her love for Pan like I did with Julia Roberts in ""Hook.""  She didn't seem to have any remorse about trying to have Wendy killed, so it was hard to like this character.The film also contains some ridiculous action sequences that came off looking absurd.  At one point there's two children riding on the back of a dog, while lying on their backs.   In another, a child is flipped through the air and looks like he's doing cartwheels in space or something.  In the opening scene, Pan is trying to catch his shadow in Wendy's room, and breaks or knocks over half of the furniture in his attempt.  10 minutes later, and after the room is destroyed, we're shown that Wendy's brothers are in the same room asleep!  I don't know if they were on drugs or what but there's no way they could have slept through that.Overall, I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, and most likely it will be enjoyed by a younger audience.  However, it failed to catch my attention as an adult, and it seems like this is something that could have been accomplished with a few small changes and different casting decisions.",Peter Pan
87,PhilauraJ,Beautiful - insightful,10,4 January 2004,"Simply fantastic.  Let me say first that I am a woman who has loved and left my share of Peter Pans.  This movie tore my heart to shreds while delighting my eye.  The story and imagery suggests many things, but I believe some of the comments made below were written by viewers that attempted to disect the movie instead of going with the flow.  Understandably, some men may get defensive having seen a part of themselves in this film that they don't like to admit to.  I found it thoroughly enjoyable and a beautiful tribute to those boys we loved who refuse to grow up - the ones we had to leave behind. 10/10",Peter Pan
88,miss_niss,Pretty but most enjoyable to fans of the book.,7,18 December 2003,"I have never read the book, but everyone knows the story. At first I was cautious of another Peter Pan movie, but forget Hook and the animated version.The stand out is Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy. She is fantastic, her innocence and sweetness captures the essence of the story. Jeremy Sumpter has a smug smile that doesnt suit the character, but still does a pretty good job.All in all, go see it to wipe away the shambles of Robin William's Hook, my friend had it down to beat Return of the King, im afraid not, its good, but not epic. The best part is how the romance between Wendy and Pan is showed, it is sweet, innocent, and touching at the end. Sad, but not the sickly kind where directors overplay the moment, this movie has some special moments, believable and real.",Peter Pan
89,The_unemployed_cynic,Perfect Peter Pan,9,1 January 2004,"The story of Peter Pan is a true classic, but I had never seen a Peter Pan movie that I really liked before. The animated Disney version was not bad, just over the top and too 'Disneyfied'. Spielberg's Hook was simply awful; casting an old guy in the role of the eternal boy was one of the biggest mistakes he has ever made. However, most of his colleagues made matters even worse by letting old women play Peter. Reviewers of those movies sometimes applaud the fact that adults 'and even some children' in the audience managed to suspend their disbelief. Hey, wouldn't it have made more sense to cast a Peter that you could simply believe in?Director P.J. Hogan has certainly managed to do that in this new version. Lead star Jeremy Sumpter was born to play Peter Pan. His role is simply the best by a young actor that I have seen in many years. Let us hope that he will not be pigeon-holed for years to come, as happened to Haley Joel Osment. Somehow, I have a feeling that we do not have to worry about that in Sumpter's case.The rest of the cast is equally good, some are even excellent, but fortunately none of them distract from the story (as Dustin Hoffman did in Hook). The same goes for the action and CGI sequences. It all blends together in a wonderful movie that is capable of keeping both children and adults like me glued to their seats. This Peter Pan is exciting, moving and breathtaking. It is a movie that I definitely want to see again. 10/10",Peter Pan

91,Lily-32,A beautiful event for the eyes and the heart...,8,31 August 2009,"I'm the type of person that the ending can ruin a fabulous movie. The first 90 minutes could be the best thing ever viewed but the ending could wreck it all. That is how I felt the first time I saw this movie. More than a mere delight visually, it was thoroughly enjoyable, a performance of Peter Pan as I'd never seen before. But the ending (as I know is accurate to the original story) left me disappointed and I vowed never to watch it again. Then I was scanning YouTube and - through fan made music videos - was reminded of how visually captivating the film was. So I gave it another chance. I'm still not pleased with the ending but that is an issue all of my own. This really is a beautifully made film that takes you through a journey of fantasy without being too sugary sweet. There is a darkness seen that does not outright terrify but puts into perspective just how dangerous the naiveté of a child can be when faced with actual dangers. The film is romantic and charming and comedic but serious when it needs to be. What once was never to be part of my movie collection, I am seriously considering adding now.",Peter Pan
92,clarason-1,Most Realistic Peter Pan & Wendy Yet,9,10 January 2004,"I personally liked the movie.  Mainly because I liked the Peter Pan and Wendy they chose for the parts.  I was really sick and tired of seeing Peter Pan played by a woman.  Why on earth did they ever start that anyway?  I'll never know.There was a kind of sexual tension in the movie between some of the characters.  But I don't think that isn't true to life.  Children are attracted to each other at this age.  And all it led to was simple kiss on the lips, between the characters.  It certainly wasn't disgusting like the Brittany & Madonna kiss. The only thing I could really complain about in this movie is the treatment of the Indian Princess character at one point.  If you are a Native American, you might get mad, I don't know.  But at least the Native Americans were actually played by Native Americans and not whites painted brown.  And for this time period it was realistic.My daughter thought parts of the movie were scary.  She's 7.  The  pirates scared her.I liked the addition of the nosy Aunt.  I think that was really true to life and was probably pretty normal for that time.The Nanny was great!  I loved the scenes of the Darlings family.Tinkerbell was fabulous as were the other fairies.",Peter Pan

94,D Airey,Why mess with the original story?,4,14 December 2004,"As something of a purist, I enjoyed most of the movie. It appeared to be an attempt to tell the story as Barrie had written it. While I realize that taking a play to a movie invariable involves filling in some parts, the additions spoiled the story for me.The effects and the acting were wonderful. However, the dodgy bit about the Aunt was a total distraction? Why did we need to put that idiocy in the ending where the Lost Boys showed up and everybody jumped up and down for joy? It might have made a nice Hallmark special, but why bother changing an essential part of the story? The one thing this movie had over the Disney version was that it was a more faithful retelling of the Peter Pan story. I don't understand why the director squandered that advantage with an ending that had to be even happier than the original. A spoonful of sugar makes a cake sweet, four spoonfuls spoil the recipe.",Peter Pan
95,ajbo,Breathtaking...,10,4 January 2004,"...That is the ONLY word i can come up with to describe this film. I had been awaiting to see this film for a long, long, long time. Like once it hit the IMDb, i was there almost every day. Not only that, but i also auditioned for the role of Peter Pan...didn't get it, but was close, and i'm glad Jeremy got the role...i met him while i was auditioning, we got pretty far into the finals, and Jeremy and I have now become friends, he's a cool kid and i'm glad he got this part. But that's not what i should be writing about. Anyway, i finally saw this film last night with two of my friends, me and my friend were SO hyped it was unbelievable, as for the other one...she wasn't so hyped...but o well...So the room darkened the opening credits rolled and i was about to enjoy the best movie in the world. I'm so glad i saw this, it's one of the best movies of 2003, and since i saw it in 2004...so far it's the best movie of 2004. Onto the review:The story starts off with a couple of kids playing in their playroom. Normal kids stuff, until their Aunt tells Wendy, that she is now old enough to become a woman. Wendy didnt really take a liking to this, because that meant she would have her own room, not hang out with her brothers and not need assistance from Nana. Later that night, Wendy is visited by Peter Pan, who has been dropping by her window every so often, to listen to the stories she tells. Well he soon leaves, but his shadow stays behind, thanks to Nana. Wendy becomes infatuated with him, drawing his picture and is soon visited by him again, only this time, he needs to find his shadow, Wendy sews it back on after hearing him ""Crying"" and after a little fairy dust and a few flying lessons, Wendy, Michael and John are off to Neverland...little did they know that after they have forgotten about their parents...their parents will soon forget about them...The acting in this film is incredible. That's all i can say, just incredible. Jeremy Sumpter did an EXCELLENT job as Peter as did Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy. For a first time actress, she did an awesome job. I wish i knew everyone elses name, i would comment a lot more. But the Mother and Father/Hook were of course amazing, as were Michael and John. The Lost Boys were funny, and i was surprised by how well they acted, but i just can't give enough praise to Jeremy and Rachel...the chemistry they had was definitly there, and it just added another few points to my liking of this movie. They were just incredible.This film has it all...it's just filled with Drama, Romance, Suspense and everything else you could expect from this film. The film is just amazing, like no other. When this film comes out on DVD i'll be the first in line to get it, the film is incredible, the actors are even more incredible and everything about this film is just incredible. The BEST movie i've seen in a long time, if you're into the Peter Pan tale, i suggest you see this, one of the BEST films of the year and it will be for a long time. Second Star to the Right and Straight On Till Morning...i give this film a 100/100 i usually base it on 10...but i didnt feel right doing that.",Peter Pan

I didn't see Peter Pan's point why he didn't want to leave neverland back then because it seems to me that it's sad he doesn't have parents and he just lives alone with a tiny girl called ""tinker bell"" but now I know exactly why he doesn't want to grow up, I now know why he doesn't want to leave neverland because if I was him I would probably do the same. I thought growing up was fun and adventurous, maybe it is in some kind of way but it's still scary.

99,shaquanda36,"The best Peter Pan to date, unfortunately at the wrong time.",9,20 July 2004,"Up front I will say it: this is the best Peter Pan adaptation yet, and in what follows I will tell you why. Despite the film's quality, it failed at the box office, and for good reason. Insight into that shall be revealed as well. Such sage wisdom ye shall not find in other reviews. Read on.The main thing that sets this adaptation apart from previous attempts is sexual tension. Yes, sexual tension. If you've read other reviews, no doubt it has been mentioned. Many people seem to take offense at said tension. Such people seem to forget what it was like to be in the age bracket of 12 - 14. The makers of this film don't dance around the fact that Wendy has just met the boy of her dreams, and he is ready to whisk her off to fantasy land. Much is made of the fact that they meet in the bedroom and play father and mother to the lost boys. The relationship of these two pre-teens is as complex as any two adults in any other movies. And the young actors handle the relationship with grace and authenticity. The production itself is beautiful, albeit stylized. The filmmakers do not mask that neverland is a fantasy world, and it stays that from beginning to end. Every frame in this movie is beautiful. There are some moments that are literally breathtaking.Ultimately what makes this film excellent is that it tells a story. And this story is centered on Wendy, and the boy of her dreams: Peter Pan. Except he cannot be the man of her dreams, and that is truly tragic. Captain Hook is the opposite: a man who cannot be young. A man who is ""old, alone, and done-for"" according to Pan. We end up exploring Wendy's psyche throughout the film, and it is almost perfectly achieved.But why did this film fail at the box office? Competetion. Who can possibly defeat Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, two bigger and much more commercial adaptations of fantasy books? This film deserves to be a classic and is one of the best fantasy movies to date. All should see it, young and old. It is rich, beautiful, and exciting.9/10",Peter Pan
100,starrywisdom,Fairy-Dusted!,10,27 March 2011,"What an absolute delight. I'm old enough to have seen, as a child, the Disney version when it was first released, and yeah, it was okay, but I'd read the book/play first, and thought it was pretty cheesy, especially the songs.But this is simply brilliant. The casting could not be bettered: the incredibly talented and lovely Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood in particular, and of course the amazing Jason Isaacs. The soaring waltz with Peter and Wendy, and Hook watching from below and lamenting to Tinker Bell, is probably my favorite moment in the film. Well, along with the ""I do believe in fairies! I do! I do!"" part, which is so corny in other versions and instead is so gorgeously handled here...you really do believe, you do, you do! And all this talk here about alleged grossness or oversexualization or whatever: what rubbish. Sure, it has subtext (growing up, the tension between being a kid and being an adult, parent-child relationships), but without getting all Freudian about it, so what? That's what great stories do. They tell stories, but they also have all this other stuff going on.Plus the movie is a total stunner. Art direction, costumes, photography, music...all are exquisite. I went and bought the DVD just to have it around, when I feel just too grownup to feel good about things and could use a little trip to Neverland...and Peter is always there. What a joy this movie is.",Peter Pan
101,janne_w,How could I not love this movie?,9,23 May 2004,"Another beguiling version of the tale just about every daydreamer has loved since it was written. It was fairly accurate and stuck pretty close to the original story, I thought. Jeremy Sumpter is adorable and I'm absolutely sure that one day soon he's going to give the Hollywood Hunks a run for their money! The boy that won't grow up no matter how much he really would like to be part of that world is a beloved part of our fantasy world, and Wendy is just as adorable. Every child in this movie played their parts to the hilt. I was moved by every performance. I thought that the flying scenes were done very well also. The only regret is that my 10 and 12 year old daughters now have yet another young man actor to drool over... :-)Even if you think it's just for kids, go see this movie. Get into it. It reminds you that once you grow up it's really okay to go back there sometimes. I think we could do worse. It's a nice escape.",Peter Pan
102,elainehowie,A beautifully done film,9,22 June 2018,"I have never seen any other Peter Pan films or the plays so I don't have much to compare to, but I really enjoyed this!

103,smit815,Loved it - Can't Wait to See it Again,9,2 January 2004,"My impression is that this is the best adaptation of Peter Pan that I have seen - And I have seen them all. Some movies are all special effects - this movie has wonderful special effects and especially the fairies and Tinkerbell. Among the many parts of the movie I liked, I liked that the director was not afraid to bruise children's sensibilities by having a few pirates shot. So it is not squeaky clean and milk toast in style.Andy Smith",Peter Pan
104,Autlan,It IS possible to confront social taboos whilst appeasing the censors.,5,13 August 2006,"It's a mite rare to find age restrictions in the mainstream that include the intended demographic. The real life issues dealt with over this one hundred and sixty-nine feet flash by like a red warning light to any budding miscreants that might be watching.-The tale begins in the bedroom of our young leading lady, Wendy, who discovers a prowler tripping over her furniture. Ignoring the sage advice of her youth's guardians she feels compelled to investigate how this degenerate fell between the cracks of common decency. She listens intently to his incoherent ramblings of shadows and their hidden threat and before he's finished she's sharing needles and has been introduced to the wonders of 'fairy dust'. In an addled state she agrees to elope with this panhandling vagabond to a far off country; one that all parents have told their kids to never ever visit.Peter and Wendy settle down in this forbidden paradise and the young couple start to raise their six strapping young sons. Still feeling light-headed; she accepts them as her own and tumbles into premature motherhood. Throughout the film there are indications there's something not quite right as the little monkeys don't seem be developing properly. A situation not helped by their father's indifference to their bunking off school to trade acts of bravado with a group of deviants led by a creepy anorak calling himself Hook.Hook, a stalwart progressionist, disproves of Peter's idle conservative ways. He also has his eyes on the vulnerable Wendy and aims to loose the loser's grip on her. In a moment of weakness Peter has second thoughts about giving up his Bachelor lifestyle and sends his spawn into the woods to gather some weeds and reeds to build an outhouse for their mother to live in. Spying his chance, Hook deftly swings manacles over the sleeping girl's wrists and puts her to work on his slave ship -- performing various chores and housekeeping tasks. A situation Wendy describes as being, ""Totally unfair!"" Further squealing that it's an attempt at, ""Completely ruining my life!"" Peter hides his joy behind a guise of indifference and quickly slips into mellow unconsciousness to fully enjoy his ill-gotten peace and quiet.Inevitably supply lines run dry and Peter has to face up to his mistakes. He leaps to and sets off to save Wendy and his children from being plunged into the sea of inconsistency. After a brief bout of frenzied angst-fueled sparring, the determined youngster admits defeat and submits to time. Returning to the country he fled only weeks ago, he narrowly avoids the further shame of becoming a burden upon society by accepting his in-law's generous offer of a festering back room and regular monetary handouts. Here they live miserably-ever-after, dutifully raising their illegitimate gaggle for the remainder of their adolescence.-Let that be a warning to you, you little blighters!",Peter Pan
105,Will_Scarlet,"The ""Grown-Up"" Peter Pan",6,27 April 2004,"Of the many versions of  ""Peter Pan"" onscreen, three standoutmost prominently: First, Steven Spielberg's comical epic ""Hook.""Second, the classic animated Disney version. And third, the late,great Mary Martin's CBS television musical. Which of these three isclosest to this new version? Well, it borrows, putting it mildly, manyscenes and aspects of the Disney film. It is fairly faithful to thebook, like Mary Martin's version. But it is probably closest to ""Hook.""This Peter Pan focuses a little more on the dark and serious sideof the book, and brings out the book's themes of self-denial,fantasy, and the gifts of both innocence, and maturity. This ishandled very well here, but may make this movie dissapointing tothose expecting something more like the lighthearted earlierversions. The most powerful scene of this movie, to me, is Peterwatching Wendy's mother weeping over her child. In grim childishstubbornness, Peter whispers ""We can't both have her, Lady."" andshuts the window. The narration and dialogue capture a great dealof the style of the original text, and there are still plenty of laughs.For the most part, the acting is charming. Wendy and CaptainHook give the best performances. Peter himself, however,somehow fails to capture the essence of his character, and hisattitude seems a bit too....""Americanized"" for this crisply Britishfilm. The weakest point in the film is the last battle. The dialogue inbetween is quick and witty, but the actions themselves are tooexaggerated, too overdone, and distracting. So, for that matter, arethe special effects. Visually dazzling, bringing back memories of achildren's picture book passed down by my grandmother,Neverland is truly the fantasy world promised. But when the actionsequences take over, the movie is too much ""action."" TheCrocodile, for instance, is too menacing, so Hook's cowering doesnot appear comic, as it is meant to be, and we miss some greatcharacter possibilities in him that way. Alas, for its many greatelements, this film is not truly memorable. Perhaps we have toomuch of an idea of what a Peter Pan film should be. But I think thatif there could be a film with the light-heartedness of the Disney andCBS versions, and simultaneously the seriousness of the overallmessage, we would have ourselves a perfect ""Peter Pan.""",Peter Pan
106,alvarax,"The best Peter Pan there is, yes even better than the original.",8,2 June 2021,"All though I've liked Peter Pan for a long time, as an adult this is the only version that I can watch now without getting bored. I don't like how Captain Hook is portrayed in Disney's version, but here he is perfectly portrayed by Jason Issacs, less of a coward and clutz, and more of a serious pirate threat. Everyone is well casted in this film, Jeremy Sumpter gives Peter Pan more charm and likeability than in the original, all though I do miss the original costume. Wendy is more sweet and innocent, but it's the relationship she and Peter have that is the corner stone of this film, the chemistry is real and the mature take on it is very well executed. The music is fantastic, the special effects are dated but still ok, the story is the same but it still manages to excite and wow you. Enjoyed it from beginning to end, highly recommended!",Peter Pan
107,GulyJimson,A glorious retelling of the J.M. Barrie tale,10,6 January 2004,"Tradition be damned! I HATED the Mary Martin, Sandy Duncan, Cathy Rigby productions of Peter Pan! There, I've said it. I realize I'm in the minority on this point, but I have NEVER been able to accept the idea of some actress dressing up in silly green tights, singing equally silly songs, while pretending to be a prepubescent boy pretending to fly on silly piano wires. I fully admit that it's a pet peeve of mine and not meant to denigrate those who have delighted in this tradition. As a long time lover of the J.M. Barrie stories and play, all I can say is that P.J. Hogan's ""Peter Pan"" is the Pan movie I have waited my entire life for. It is simply a glorious retelling of the J.M. Barrie tale. After Spielberg's dreadful 1991 abortion, ""Hook"" I was convinced that the story had been buried forever as far as big budget film-making was concerned. I thought all there would be was the 1953 Disney animated film, which unfortunately is more Disney than Barrie or worse, that I was condemned to a lifetime of endless reruns of Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard. Boy, was I wrong. Taking its visual cue from the wondrous illustrations of Maxfield Parrish, Edmund Dulac, N.C. Wyeth and Arthur Rackham, this new film recreates the storybook Never Land on a level that has never been achieved before, nor will ever be again.But the film is not simply a special-effects fest a la ""Star Wars"". The effects, dazzling as they are, are just the icing on the cake. Hogan understands it is the characters, and our need to care for them, that must carry the film. And this film has a wonderful cast. Jeremy Sumpter is a great Peter Pan. Gifted with a luminous smile and physicality, he captures all the radiant cockiness, the self-delighted impishness of undefeated, indefatigable youth. One almost feels sorry for Hook for having such an adversary. Rachel Hurd-Wood in a very impressive film debut does a marvelous job as Wendy, the young daughter of the Darlings now at the beginning of young womanhood. Hurd-Wood is both child and woman, and she and Sumpter have very warm and charming screen chemistry in their scenes together, capturing the potentially dangerous under-current of adolescent sensuality without ever hitting you over the head with it, or becoming too cloy. Olivia Williams as Mrs. Darling isn't given much to do, beyond being the mother everyone wishes they had, but she does that very well, and she serves the story beautifully. And she is absolutely gorgeous. In the double role of Mr. Darling/Captain Hook, Jason Isaacs finally comes into his own as the cinema's most perfidious villain since Basil Rathbone crossed swords with Errol Flynn. Isaacs is simply magnificent in a role he was born to play. With a sneer and a swash of his buckle he obliterates forever the image of Hook as a buffoon, the mere butt of Peter's jokes. This is a dangerous, deadly Hook, a figure of Satanic dignity, who one can believe might actually best Peter some dark, unlucky night. Lynn Redgrave plays the role of Aunt Millicent, a character created for the film and not in any of the Peter Pan literature. While the new part doesn't really add anything to the story, it doesn't really take anything away either. And Redgrave is always a joy to watch. Finally the performance of the great Richard Briers should be noted. As Smee he steals every scene he is in. It is a delightful comic turn. The one performance I questioned was Ludivine Sagnier as Tinker Bell. While I loved the concept of Tink as a bitch-sprite, capable of murderous intent, I felt at times her performance was a little broad. This may have been the outgrowth of having to play a purely physical role without the benefit of any spoken lines. On the other hand I thought she was vastly superior to Julia Roberts who played the same role in ""Hook"". Nor was she a Marilyn Monroe wannabe from Disney. Sagnier to her credit never plays the part for easy sentimentality. Hogan and company have brought the Barrie work to the screen and have rightly restored to it a child's sense of awe and wonder, of both beauty and terror co-existing side by side and for this reason alone it is the definitive film version of Peter Pan",Peter Pan
108,LordDynamo,The best Peter Pan adaptation to date,10,2 August 2012,"I have loved the story of Peter Pan since I was little; I saw the pantomimes, watched the Disney version god knows how many times and enjoyed Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"". Heck, I chose the novel as a book presentation in school once! In short, Peter Pan became a mark of my childhood.It was no surprise that when this film version of Pan came out, I was desperate to watch it, all the while afraid that it might not be loyal to the original novel and play. I was greatly mistaken, in fact I am so glad I watched this.This is, hands down, the best adaptation of Peter Pan to date. The sheer magic of J.M. Barrie is translated perfectly into the film. The actors fit their roles so well, it's not even funny. Rachel Hurd-Wood is adorable as Wendy, Olivia Williams as Mrs Darling is wonderful, such is Ludivine Sagnier as Tinkerbell, Lynn Redgrave as Aunt Millicent and Richard Briers as Smee. Jason Isaacs, I find, portrays Captain Hook (as well as Mr Darling) the best, rivaling even Dustin Hoffman in Hook. Then again, all the characters are lovable, especially the Lost Boys. However, the real star of the show is none other than the title character and protagonist, Peter himself. Jeremy Sumpter's performance is so fantastic that the tradition of having actresses play the legendary boy will be insignificant. This made Peter Pan my favourite character in the whole film. And the rest? Well, the special effects are stunning (my god, that crocodile is scarier than the other versions!) and the music score, composed by James Newton Howard, is nothing short of captivating. My favourite is definitely ""Flying"", when Peter and the Darling children fly to Neverland.So, to put it briefly, I highly recommend this film, whether you love Peter Pan or not. It is wonderful as a family film and in all other ways besides. I assure you, you will not regret watching it. With a beautiful story and unforgettable cast, you will feel like you're flying and having adventures with them.",Peter Pan
109,understorey,Definitively the best Peter Pan portrayal ever,9,15 January 2020,"Wow... my aching heart :(I have just literally now finished watching this movie for the first time in years. Tears are still streaming down my face, and my chest is heaving.Jeremy Sumpter and I are just a few weeks apart in age (myself the older). I saw this movie upon release in the cinema, when I was 14, and still remember the heartache I felt during and for a long time after the movie finished. I watched the movie again and again on DVD and TV, and it always made me feel that heartache and crush feeling in my chest, so much so that sometimes I feared watching it again because of that feeling, similar to having a strong crush for someone. Perhaps that crush feeling was because of Jeremy himself, as many other people who saw this film would have also felt. His performance was Oscar-worthy, he really personfied the essence of Peter Pan. He was also strikingly gorgeous, his smile was radiant as the love itself which Pan allegorically personifies. I can't think of a better casting in any film I've ever seen. He is beyond perfect as Peter, and it just so happens that many who love the film, would have had Jeremy never grow up, just like Peter himself.The movie was released at the same time as the Return of the King, which seems to have massively overshadowed the potential success of Peter Pan, which is very sad as it so much deserved to be a box office hit.It is still one of my all-time favourite movies, as it makes me feel emotions that literally no other movie does. The entire cast is perfect, the writing is sharp as can be, the direction, cinematography, everything that makes a solid movie is spot on, and Jason Isaacs is superb as Hook.I would give it a 10/10 if one particular element was explored a little more... that which being the relationship between Wendy and Peter, in particular Wendy's psyche and Peter's psyche. Now don't get me wrong, I think it's explored quite well as it is, and the honest portrayal of the confusing nature of young attraction, love and emerging sexuality is very well presented. I just think that the movie hit upon the right chords and it was music to my heart, I only wish to have felt that music dance for a little longer. The line that Hook says to Wendy regarding Peter - ""that's the riddle of his being is that he cannot love"", is just brilliant, and that's the main thread of the story, and it would have been so good to explore that theme more. That, and just spending more time with Jeremy Sumpter's Peter Pan, and the Lost Boys, and their adventures in general. I could go for a half hour more of all that.Nonetheless, I don't think this Peter Pan film can ever be bested by a remake, least not in terms of the beautiful and magical feeling it created. I am perplexed at how it currently only has a 6.8 score, when so many other lesser films have a much higher score.Every frame of this is indeed a painting, thank you to everyone who made it :)",Peter Pan
110,mgr81760,What A Wonderful Movie,10,31 May 2009,"All I can say is that I'm 48 years old, and while of course have heard of Peter Pan, have never read the book nor seen any of the prior productions.Just a wonderful movie. I doubt that reading the book could have been as good as seeing the movie...there was just a magical quality overall that made it a joyful film to watch. I thought the acting was really good. I never ever got the idea that Isaac's playing Captain Hook was aware he was playing captain hook, he got as into the role as Olivier ever did Henry V. There was humor, tears, ya gotta admit, the Tinkerbelle resurrection scene really was tear-jerking, sometimes clever dialogue.Jeremy Sumter, I have to say, did a wonderful job. You had to have an age appropriate kid for the role, it wouldn't have been believable otherwise. And as the central role in the film, he was just really great as the kid who wouldn't grow up.And yes, there was sexual tension in the film. And it was handled very gracefully. The point is that growing up isn't all bad, that there is something more beyond the ""going to school and office"" that Peter dreads. If there were not something for him to offset the bad, the choice he himself made would not have been worth it.This is just a really good movie. Good for everyone, adults and children alike.One last thing. As the credits started scrolling, I noticed Mohamed al Fayed as the executive producer. I briefly thought, ""hey, that's the father of Dodi"", and then ""In Memory of Dodi al Fayed"" came on the screen.The pain of a father who lost his son. His tribute to his son, a movie that would enshrine probably his son's favorite book as a kid. Is it unreasonable to see a younger Mohamed, reading it to his young son, forming a connection with him that they will always have? And a gesture of love that other kids will be able to reap the benefit of for years to come.The rare movie, all things considered, that makes you walk away feeling good to be human.",Peter Pan
111,chrisroberts-5,Positively brilliant!,10,5 July 2015,"Peter Pan, one of the most enduring stories of all time, finds its ideas and visions captured perfectly in this film adaptation.THE GOOD: Just about everything. The script is true to its literary roots, the casting is absolutely perfect, the visuals are wonderful, the score is beautiful, and the special effects are classy and elegant. Special applause for ending the creepy tradition of having women in the lead role. Rather than confusing the crap out of us with Cathy Rigby or Mary Martin, Jeremy Sumpter as the lead *is* Peter Pan. He is convincing, entertaining, and fully believable. The use of colour to convey moods is both beautiful and effective. The climax gives you chills. It is wondrous how much excitement and joy has been squeezed into this gem. The audio is haunting and perfect.THE BAD: There is nothing bad about Peter Pan. It could not have been done any better. This is the definitive version for all time.THE VERDICT: The is a great looking and sounding film. The story is wondrous and exciting. The actors are all uniformly perfect for the roles. Jeremy Sumpter in particular is a revelation. I really believe that this version of Pan is one of the great cinematic achievements of film. Everyone should watch this - it's pure enjoyment that represents everything that the cinema should be. I have also found it to be one of the most re-watchable movies ever; it can give you butterflies in your stomach just as much on the tenth viewing as the first.

112,thereturnoftheking,"Stunning, Magnificent, Brilliant, and Powerful 9/10",9,8 October 2006,"For the past three years this movie has been on my mind brimming over the edges and constantly I've wanted to see it. I hadn't had the chance when it first came out because school was hectic (and still is) and ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy occupied my mind morning, noon, and night. Another big problem back then was that I wouldn't see a film in cinemas if I had to go alone and I can guarantee that if I had asked anyone other than my one good life long friend, I would have been declared gay...because let's face it what thirteen year old guy goes to see Peter Pan.Well I just had to keep it on the side and push it away until my desire to see just how perfect this film was overtook me. So for two months I slowly tried to rent the film to just see how it was. Last night 7/10/06, I finally achieved my goal and rented and viewed Peter Pan. I have to say there is no family film that can touch it. No version of this story can ever be told and be as true to the feeling the book creates...ever. It's just perfect.(Spoilers) It is very very very similar to the book, ladies and gents. It tells the tale of Wendy Darling and her heart stopping stories of pirates. Wendy, after causing a few problems for her father, is told to grow up...but she refuses to go quietly. Her journey begins when a dashing young man by the name of Peter Pan comes to her room that night and offers her an escape from it all. A chance to leave the grown-up world behind and be a child forever. Naturally she agrees, but keeps her grown-up feelings. She has been rather taken with Mr. Pan and finds it hard to let the thought of love go.Needless to say complications arise and are overcome as Wendy enjoys a journey unlike any other.The performances are what make this film. Rachel Hurd-Wood has a bright future if she pursues acting after school. She is incredibly talented and every bit the part of Wendy. She lets you know how she feels without being too obvious or childish. She's trying to grow up while denying it.The performance of Jeremy Sumpter coupled with the dual performances of Jason Isaacs however are what make the film the best. Sumpter is dashing, charismatic, child-like, lovable, and your average boy. He just enjoys having fun and can't give it up. I never really noticed other than in this film that he has a lisp....poor kid.Jason Isaacs however is a masterpiece in himself. The performance of Hook is just beyond perfect. He is both funny and frightening as well as devilishly cunning and charismatic. And yet you see him as the precise opposite when he's Mr. Darling. He's withdrawn, quiet, and somewhat of a walked on rug. You can't help but feel sorry for the poor guy in those scenes with his superiors.The film is spot on truly bringing that feeling of being a kid. I really wish I had seen it in cinemas because it's just one of those that you have to see on the big screen. I really enjoy the special effects being both realistic but at the same time cartoony, Neverland mainly. The clouds in Neverland and the sky and the scenery are just the perfect blend of real and unreal.However I have to say that I kind of wish it would be less of a family film and more of a dramatic film. I mean that's probably the adult in me talking, but I wouldn't watch it with my friends nor would I bring it up to them. I mean that's how the book was but it's just a desire I had. I just enjoy watching it in my free time. It's a film that reminds you of the younger days while still appealing to you now...even without your friends or family there. I do enjoy the way P.J. Hogan directed it and the script by Michael Goldenberg was fantastic. I can't wait to see his interpretation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.So all in all, it was perfect, but I wish it was more applicable to people of all ages, and one they can all watch together. But sadly in today's world if you're caught with this film...things aren't looking good for your social standing.9/10",Peter Pan
113,openapartment,The most beautiful and poignant depiction of Pan.,9,2 January 2006,"This rendition of Peter Pan may very well be better than the classic Disney rendition.Everyone, by now, should know the story of Peter Pan. He runs away from home and is taken to Neverland by Tinker Bell. In this magical place, he and his band of Lost Boys play all day and never grow old. They do not deal with the tediousness of adult life, however they are very comfortable to talk about death and killing. Creating duality, we have Captain Hook. Unlike the Boys, he lives at sea with his adult band of pirates. His sole obsession is to kill Peter, having lost his right arm to Peter in an earlier battle.There is an underlying darkness that is appropriate given the situation of the characters. Peter never grows up, however he experiences much. The movie presents us with a very useful question, ""What is Peter Pan?"" This is a question that Peter himself struggles with.The casting is well done. Few would argue that Jason Isaacs is the star of this film. His dual role as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook is, as another reviewer put it, ""brilliant."" As Mr. Darling, he is shy but quite the gentleman. As Captain Hook, he is dashing and as evil as can be. Unlike Dustin Hoffman and the animated Hook in Disney's Pan, Isaacs is a lean mean pirate. Ultimately, he is as alone as Pan. For that reason, they rely so much on one another.The weakest quality of ""Peter Pan"" is in Peter himself. Here we have a film of fine British actors (or actors with accents) and Peter is an American. While this works to distinguish him from the rest, his lack of an accent makes his dialogue disjointed in comparison. Could they not find a young British actor with the quality to play Pan? He seems as out of place as Hayden Christensen does in Star Wars. It's not that he's bad, it just doesn't feel right. Well, at least he plays a pan flute in this film.There is a beautiful scene where Peter presents to Wendy a gathering of dancing faeries, followed by a touching scene in which Peter and Wendy dance, afloat amidst green trees and twinkling starlight.",Peter Pan

117,gaystereotype,Spoiled by the incessant soundtrack,6,3 February 2005,"This movie had a lot of really fine qualities to it: the child actors, the comic and Mary Poppins-esquire look of old London, the sense of wonder. What bothered me more than anything else was the music. The climactic scenes of love between Peter and Wendy were nice with lyrical oboe solos, but I don't understand why the director insisted on music being written throughout the entire movie, which had the affect of overkill. I don't need a John Williams sound to remind me of what childhood imagination was like, nor do I need it to feel lighthearted, humorous, or to accentuate every dramatic moment in the movie. Many scenes could have used silence, and that would have made the love scenes, and the climactic battle scene (with granted, appropriately exciting accompaniment) more meaningful.",Peter Pan
118,sbamp49,the ethos of the book,8,5 September 2004,firstly may i say i loved the film. I read the original the other day and this is the closest version I have seen! J M barrie succeeded in bringing us a modern day fairytale (no pun intended). amd P J hogan has brought a modern day screen version to life. the casting is perfect both wendy and peter are as they where meant to be. hook and smee are note perfect. and the cinematography is excellent. all I can say about this film is my grandson of 5 years old has watched it every day for 2 months now and I'm not far behind him! the sexuality of the two leading characters is far more to the fore in this version which is truer to the story as peter may have stayed young because of that reason.the jealousy of tinkerbell lends a hand in this respect.,Peter Pan
119,bteigen,Was a good movie,5,25 December 2003,"I guess the thing that annoyed me most about this film is that they advertised it to be scarier and darker than it really was.  But overall, I enjoyed it.  I thought the child acting though, particularly Wendy, was not that good, and everything just seemed sort of rushed (maybe that was because I had just seen LOTR not too long ago), especially with their lines.  The beginning was kind of silly as well.  But I think that Jeremy Sumpter made a great Peter Pan and I liked the little kids that played John and Michael. However, the real star of the film was Captain Hook.  It was really interesting to see Jason Isaacs in his first starring role.  He really delved into the character, the way he did for Tavington in 'The Patriot'. I wish they had more of him AND the other pirates in the movie.  I give it what the website gives it...about a 7/10.",Peter Pan

To me it is a unique film that will be remembered like Wizard of OZ, 2001 A Space Odyssey and Metropolis. The pacing and emphasis are just perfect. Qualities that are very rare for a special effects heavy film. The dance scene in the woods between Peter and Wendy is just right. It shows the same attention to detail of a nuanced hand move in ballet.",Peter Pan
121,Big Huge Doug,The most faithful adaptation to date,9,28 December 2003,"As fans of the written stories and stage musical, my wife and I have waited patiently for *someone* to understand the dark underpinnings of Peter Pan, and bring a truly magical version to stage or screen. This one is it. It is not a perfect 10 for some of the reasons mentioned in previous reviews (dog jokes, imperfect ""flying"" effects) but it is very close. The incredible magic of youth, the fear and tension of trying to cling to that magic, the redeeming power of love--it's all beautifully rendered in a lovely, reasonably well-acted, exciting and funny script. It really is a beautiful movie.",Peter Pan

Jeremy Sumpter is Peter Pan in the flesh; he really makes Peter Pan exist in this performance. He was made for this part. The film is not boring in the least. The scenery and special effects are done extremely well and in good taste. A lot of thought went into making this fantasy classic. It is amazing how they added more detail into the story. It has a tremendous amount of good artistry in the telling of it. It is truly a film for both the young and old alike. I guarantee, you will want to see it more than once.

This was a great adaption to the story and kept very close to the book.  The actors were wonderful and there were excellent effects.  There were no slow parts and I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time.  They mixed in lots of action and humor which made for a great family film.  Definately a must see, I cannot wait for this to be released to DVD/Video so that I can own it. I give it an excellent 10.",Peter Pan
124,Bneidl,Peter made my skin crawl,2,25 March 2006,"I just watched this for the first time last night. Really disappointed. Thought it was downright terrible actually. It's unfortunate, too, because Peter Pan is a great story, and Jason Isaacs is the perfect actor to play Captain Hook.My main problem was that all of the children, except Wendy, were completely uncharismatic. Peter in particular was very stiff, unpleasant, and just weird. He had a creepy, leering way about him. He also never seemed to be genuinely having fun during any of his adventures -- he went through it all with a shallow, unconvincing smile plastered on his face. He had dumb, expressionless eyes. Whenever he tried to flash a Wiley or rascally smirk at Wendy or Hook or whoever, he just ended up looking like he was constipated.To top it all off, I was a little distracted by the odd way in which Peter pronounced certain words throughout the film. (""Come away with me to Neverlaynd!""). I basically wanted to punch this kid in the face every time they shot him in close up. All in all, horrible casting with Peter.Wendy was the only character to pull off a sincere, convincing sense of wonder while in Neverland, and, as I said, Jason Isaacs was very good as Hook. I also appreciate the subplot in which the Vanessa Redgrave character attempts to make Mr. Darling become more career-focused, and pushes him to attend social gatherings so that he can network and climb the business ladder. Thus, even Mr. Darling is being pressured to ""grow up,"" which is a nice little additional iteration of the main theme of the Peter Pan story.But it's not enough. You can't make a passable Peter Pan film if Peter Pan himself is disgusting.",Peter Pan
125,BearGlove,Well made story,8,19 November 2013,"This movie is unexpectedly good. Best movie adaptation of this story so far. Every aspect of the story has been made into a movie and I like that. Actors played their roles very good. They manage to show all emotions and personalities of every character. Petar Pan the boy who doesn't want to grow up, because he doesn't want obligations. Captain Hook, old man who's sad for losing his youth and angry on other peoples success. Wendy, girl who just wants to be girl a little longer, and not act like a grown woman towards what her parents are pushing her. Thinkerbell, best description in today society would be friend zoned. She is always with Peter Pan but only as a friend she will never be more. Which sometimes lead to frustrations and bad decisions. In movie is show clear sexual tension between Wendy and Peter, child just in age so they can feel something is attracting you to someone. But can't quite understand it. Petar bring Wendy so she could be mom for his lost boys. And he will be father. Here in that role playing is clearly visible that tension. Movie is very well made and unfairly underrated. It deserves 8.",Peter Pan
126,shalowfate,"A nice feature, for adults...",7,12 September 2004,"Peter Pan, the everlasting story about the young boy who doesn't want to grow up.This presentation of the peter pan ""legend"" is yet somehow different from all the others. the movie speaks for a somewhat older audience than what you could expect. The characters are more mature and the movie shows you that growing up starts with feelings and particularly love.I didn't like it how the movie was really leaning toward the psychological part of peter pan, and breaking the fun with repeated profound questions about one's feelings and thoughts. The movie lost it's appeal for children I think, and innocence as well, with all those kisses.Never the less, the children discovered what's like to be a parent/grown up and prepared to begin this risky, dangerous, tiresome but beautiful part of their lives. Part that peter pan was never willing to take. These are very well represented, but they might not be well understood by 13 year olds.Peter Pan is a lovely movie suitable for adults and children... Good times and nights ahead.",Peter Pan
127,Josie15-27-292450,Magical movie with a special place in my heart,9,10 January 2015,"This was the first movie i ever saw at the cinema. I was 7 years old,well, quite close to 8. So obviously, it has a very special place in my heart. I bought the VHS tape afterwards and watched it many times.Don't think i ever really watched the cartoon version and if i did,i was probably not a big fan cause i don't remember it. But i saw the cartoon not too long ago now, but prefer this 2003 version so much more. I'll blame it a bit on nostalgia.No but seriously, i have watched this version many times now that i'm older and i think it means more to me now than it did then. Now, i finally understand the whole not wanting to grow up thing. I didn't take that part too seriously as a kid. I focused more on the rest of the film. Now, i'd give anything to be peter pan.Jeremy Sumpter is perfect as peter pan. Playful, adventurous, typical slightly annoying boy and cute. Cartoon-peter felt more like an adult to be honest. Rachel Hurd-Wood is a great Wendy. She feels innocent, but still like a young woman ready to grow up. Jason Isaacs great as Hook and boring dad. I honestly didn't' even notice he was the same person when i was a kid.And let's not forget one of the most important parts of the entire movie. The music. It's as magical as it can get and it is without a doubt one of my top 5 fave movie soundtracks. I think it might be 3rd place behind the Homeward bound-movies and Jurassic park. My favourite song is ""Flying"". After all my nostalgic rambling, i just want to say that it's a magical movie that means a lot to me. Way better than the cartoon if you ask me.",Peter Pan
128,Tom_Nashville,"Beautiful film, beautiful music...",8,31 January 2006,"This is a visually beautiful film and Jeremy Sumpter makes a terrific Peter Pan. All of the kids and adult actors do a fine job, and Jason Isaacs does his usual outstanding work, this time in the dual role of Captain Hook and Mr. Darling. What I remember most about seeing this film at the theater, however, is the music. I believe some of the finest music written in our age, comes from films such as this one (and Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc, etc.). Mr. John Williams ""America's composer"", is responsible for much of the most memorable music from films of the last 20 years. You won't hear this stuff on your car radio. At the end of Peter Pan when the credits started, I sat and listened to 10 glorious minutes of music, credited to Mr. James Newton Howard. When it ended, I was the only one in the theater. Please, don't be in such a hurry to rush out after a film, you may miss out on something very special. It takes a lot of talent and hard work to create beautiful scores such as this one for Peter Pan. I bought the DVD with the music, as much as the film, in mind. I learned my lesson on this after seeing the first Lord of the Rings film, Fellowship of the Ring, with music by Mr. Howard Shore. During the closing credits after Enya sang her beautiful version of ""May it Be"", an incredibly haunting song called ""In Dreams"" was performed by a wonderful children's choir with a solo by a boy with unbelievable control and fidelity in his voice. It was the perfect ending to the three hour film experience. The story of Peter Pan is, of course, well known and very bittersweet. All children seem to be in a hurry to grow up, ...except Peter Pan. He wants to remain a boy forever and at the end of the story he sees what that wish will cost him. He will remain a boy, while the rest of the world and those he cares about, move on without him. Does anyone really think they would like to remain a child forever? I wonder.",Peter Pan
129,danpatter2002,Superb adaptation of a classic,10,1 January 2004,"This stylish and refreshing take on Barrie's classic tale has a lot going for it.  It is very faithful to the spirit of the original, and a lot of Barrie's matchless script has survived.  Both the juvenile leads are charming and believable, but acting honors must go to Jason Isaacs, who gives Captain Hook both menace and malice, as well as a seductiveness I would not have believed possible.  One fears him, pities him, loathes him and relishes him, as he rises to the tragic grandeur of the part.  Just to hear him utter Barrie's wonderful line, ""Back you puling spawn, I'll show you the road to dusty death,"" is itself worth the price of admission. Bravo, Mr. Isaacs.  (I do wish Hook's monologue, ""How still the night air,"" had made it into the film - it would have been nice to see Mr. Isaacs do this.)And bravo to Mr. Hogan for giving us one of the most beautiful films ever made.  It is a pleasure to look at and Hogan wisely never lets the special effects get in the way of the story.  I've taken several batches of kids to see this movie and all were enchanted and excited.  So was I, who grew up on the Mary Martin and Walt Disney versions and have seen both the play and the musical version many times live.  This one's a winner.  Go see it.",Peter Pan

Where there are some discrepancies between the film and the story, I can actually live with them. The changes work better. (And I normally abhor when filmmakers take ""creative liberties"" with already perfect stories. HEAR ME PETER JACKSON!) The choice for Tinkerbell was perfect.

I've always wanted to see a live action version of the movie with a boy in the title role.  (I've always found middle-aged women in the role a little creepy.)

134,kandy5001,The Way It Should Be Done (Magical),8,19 January 2004,"When I first saw this movie advertized, I predicted that the experience would amaze me not only because of the attention to detail depicted in every frame but also because of the Victorian/Sexual Repressive theme that dominates Barrie's book/play juxtaposed with the fantasy world.  No other story, in my opinion, creates such a striking reality/fantasy world contrast like this except the WIZARD OF OZ.Of course, this movie did not disappoint me one bit.  Up until this point, Disney's PETER PAN stood head and shoulders above all other versions (yes, including Mary Martin).  HOOK grew on me, but that movie really did not scream ""Vintage Peter Pan"".  This one does.The familiar story comes to life in full detail and development...but the attention to the little details really impressed me.  Everyone (the darling children, Peter Pan, and the Lost Boys) strolled around on barefeet that picked up more and more dirt as the movie progressed.  The seen in which the tree trap turned John and Michael upside down while displaying their tushes showed me most memorably the bravery of the filmakers to withdraw from sugarcoating this film (even moreso than the violent fights).And finally the best part: Peter Pan FINALLY gets played by a boy rather than a girl-before-adolesence.  This twist allowed me to see Peter and Wendy's adorable courtship (and Tinker Bell's jealousy)take shape with realism.  Touching.I plan to get this one on DVD.Now...I wonder if someone will ever do a faithful version of Madeline L'Engle's A WRINKLE IN TIME?",Peter Pan
135,ozoneliar1,Disappointing,5,25 December 2003,"I went into the movie with high expectations, and was let down. Peter pan was not played well, and the movie did not feel real. It was difficult to feel for the characters. Despite the fact that neverland is not such a serious place, when The kids were in danger, There was no sense of any danger at all.

136,captainblackadder,Better than Lord of the Rings and Star Wars,10,8 January 2004,"One of the best fantasy films ever made. Perhaps the best because it stands alone and is not part of a series. Ranks with the Harry Potter movies in its ability to evoke powerful emotions while being visually wondrous, funny, and wildly entertaining. A must-see for children and adults alike.
The cast is superb - particularly Olivia Williams, who is likely to be overlooked as someone who is only involved in ""real world"" action. And Jason Isaacs performance as Mr. Darling makes me yearn to see him in more dramatic and more heroic roles even as his superb Captain Hook makes me hope to see more of him in the ""Christopher Lee-grandiose villain mold"" more as well.

137,Kerridwyn,"Enchanting, magical, dark, and dashing",10,13 January 2004,"Enchanting, magical, and appropriately dark, this Peter Pan goes back to Barrie's story rather than taking its inspiration from later versions, and is destined to become as much of a classic as the Wizard of Oz.It's hard to know what to praise first - the script, the special effects, the costumes, the lighting, the direction, the performances? Well, I'll start with the performances. Jason Isaacs brings both humor and depth to his dual roles of Mr Darling and Captain Hook; and his Hook is charismatic, dashing, and so sexy there are already adult fan fictions circulating the Internet on him! What I particularly loved about his performance was that as well as getting across Hook's danger, and enough humor for what people expect to be a children's movie, he gave us glimpses of Hook's loneliness, turning him from what could be a caricature into a human being (albeit through Wendy's eyes at most points). He combines threat with alluring sexuality, and human pathos.Rachel Hurd Wood stands out amongst a group of children who all give excellent performances; I was surprised to learn that she hadn't acted before, and wasn't really a few years older than 12!Costumes, lighting, and effects which create a magical world all add to the enchanting atmosphere this movie creates. The score is glorious, and I hope it's recognized at the Oscars.As I mentioned, this movie doesn't shy away from the dark aspects of the story. It rightly places Wendy at the center, and Neverland is her place of fantasy, where she deals with the conflict between growing up and joining the adult world, and the wish to remain a child. The Freudian undertones may be disturbing to some, and those who are expecting a simple children's movie will be disappointed.  This is far more than a kiddie film - it gives as much, perhaps more, to the adults in the audience.See it, and then see it again. I can't wait for the DVD!",Peter Pan

As for the rest, Jason Issacs was great as Capt. Hook, and liked in the ""Harry Potter"" movies! Even his brief scene in ""Elektra"".

This is Peter Pan as it should have been done years ago (although quite possibly couldn't have, effects wise). The movie is highly stylised, which works brilliantly, and very rarely has any cringe-worthy moments.The lead actors, both children, are wonderful. Jeremy Sumpter as Peter has a certain arrogance and cockiness about him that really works for the boy who never wants to grow up, and his chemistry with the actress playing Wendy is very palpable. The successfully manage to hold the movie on their own, though Jason Isaacs as Hook/Mr Darling is wonderful in his own right. Never over the top, as it could be so easy to do, but never forgetting that he's in a make believe land, full of mermaids, flying children, and hugely oversized alligators, one with a specific taste for his flesh.Overall this movie is a joy, not only for children but for adults alike.

140,good_girl,Right....,3,6 January 2004,"This film was not what I expected at all.  I went to see it with a five year old.  He was one of the oldest kids in the cinema.  He was TERRIFIED as were the other children.  There were kids whimpering, crying, hiding and even screaming for the last half of the movie.  It's a dark and sinister version of the beloved children's story.  The thing I found most depressing was that the beautiful, playful mermaids were turned into swimming vampires.  I agree with other comments that Peter was miscast (an American!!???) and that Wendy, while beautiful and talented was not Wendy in any sense.  Nothing was how it is portrayed in the book and the overall theme is depressing.  The only bit of the whole film that I enjoyed was nothing to do with the actual film.  At the end when the narrator says ""there is one boy who will never grow up"" the man behind me said ""yeah, Michael Jackson!""  The only time I felt happy throughout the 2 hour film.

141,nfmadprops04,The stuff fan fictions are made of,9,29 December 2003,"If there's anything that can be said of Peter Pan, it's that it leaves the audience wanting more. The film is quite magical, with Neverland always seeming quite surreal, along with its mermaids, pirates, and faeries. The whole world there is very whimsical with many of its characters. The true gems, in this film, are the actors themselves. The three principles, Jeremy Sumpter, Rachel Hurd-Wood, and Jason Isaacs are all phenomenal in their roles, Sumpter taking the lead as the cocky, confused young boy avoiding growing up. It is in this act, though, that he also forgoes his ability to love. He is placed in an awkward position when he must choose between always being a boy and having fun or growing up and spending his life with Wendy. He can't have both.This film has garnered a lot of hoopla over its sexuality, for the actors (neither of whom are older than 14) manage to flirt and give the impression of sensual tension much better than most adults. We can feel their love, and it scares some people at how well its done. Jason Isaacs takes his role incredibly far, and even creeped some audience members out with his character's obsession with Wendy and Peter. He hates Peter even more once he finds out that he is loved. It adds so much to each character, and takes Peter from being a 2-dimensional stock character to a true child, with emotions whether he likes it or not.This film is an instant classic, worth two or three trips to the theatre.",Peter Pan

I am a sucker for a love story and this film struck a cord with me.Jeremy Sumpter is gorgeous and IS peter pan. His smile makes me melt i have to say! He is Wendy's first innocent love. And this is captured brilliantly.I love a film that makes you feel and i love a film where you feel what the characters feel and in this you are with them every step of the way.It's left me feeling all warm inside, which is the perfect feeling to be left with after watching a film. It is the classic story of peter pan, the boy who never wants to grow up, yet it is also so much more than that.For kids its a fun film about fighting, pirates, swords and never growing up and then for adults there is all this and more. I actually think adults would enjoy this film more than children, just for the fact of how it makes you feel.I have only ever seen the Disney animation of 'peter pan', as a child and 'hook' more recently. In my eyes Disneys 'peter pan' is purely about a boy who doesn't want to grow up and was made for kids and 'hook' is about a man who was once a young boy who didn't want to grow up, then he did grow up, then he became boring, then he visited never land and found his childhood again! I enjoyed both films, but neither of them made me 'feel' anything at end. Whearas this film did and i think thats the difference.Obviously not the only difference, everything about this film was amazing, the colours, the music, the actors who play the characters, the direction, the script and lets not forget the emotion.It was also made for kids and adults, the director definitely wanted adults to enjoy this film as much if not more than kids. he wanted it to be appreciated.Definitely one to watch and i will personally be buying it on DVD so i can watch it again and again.I don't want to give anything else away so i'll leave it at that . .Give this film a chance . . .It's most definitely worth it :) x x",Peter Pan

Like with Pirates of the Caribbean, the reviewers seemed to have missed the greatness of this movie.  Every person in the movie is genius.  Pan, who has been frowned upon for being American, was absolutely perfect.  Isaacs was as well.  And Rachel was perfect as Wendy. I am rarely drawn into young girl characters, but her performance was perfect.  Not to mention a great Tinkerbell, which certainly wasn't the case in Hook.  On top of all of this, the costuming and the dialogue were beautiful, as well as faithful to the story.  The movie really managed to capture some of the bizarreness of the people in the story.

Barrie proud, it sticks to the book exactly! I was a little skeptical about seeing this movie because it was Peter Pan and I thought it would be for little kids. But one night, I saw that it had just started on Starz, so I decided to watch it for maybe 10 minutes and then change the channel. Well, I was instantly ""hooked"". I sat through the entire thing and laughed and cried. I loved this movie so much that I taped the movie when it was on again that night. I must have watched it about 3 times in one weekend. This movie is wonderful, the actors are cast perfectly, the acting is wonderful, there is GREAT chemistry between the actors who play Peter and Wendy, and it's not too babish, but not too grownup for little kids to see. People will love it, whether they are 7 or 77. It's a great movie! Definitely see it!",Peter Pan
149,cowboysaif,The movie is a emotional journey to teenage problems.,10,23 January 2010,"The movie make a 100 year old book alive by making a total internal change. How? By making Peter and Wendy 13 year olds. Then the movie discovered what happens when a 13 year old teen girl who is desperate to be away from horrible grown up things, met a boy of timeless dreamland. Peter is the first boy in Wendy's life. He's amazing and funny and ignorant about many things. Wendy accepted his ""never-grow-up-have-fun-forever"" invitation to neverland. But she does have a romantic feeling over Peter. She want feeling from Peter as they are ""father and mother"" of lost boys.So does Peter, but is too embarrassed to say or think it deeply. And he has a playful life what he likes most.Peter finally had a clash with Wendy what was inevitable. Wendy loves Peter and she finally wants Peter to grow up. Peter also seems devastated by the new foreign feelings about Wendy. He got confused. One time he banishes wendy, next time he makes sure wendy can't return to her house. And then there is enemy hook, who beats Peter at least one point - a grown up person, not a deep feelingless boy like Peter.Wendy gets Peter's answer very rudely and tried to return home. The pirates caught her with lost boys. Peter goes to save her.An epic fight began. But something happened.Though he is a 13 year boy, and always gave a ""no-i-am-not-in-love"" and ""timeless-countless-joys"" impression to wendy, he DOES have feelings for wendy. Hook soon realized it. He asked Peter some questions during the fight.the questions contain some answers Peter was too scared to hear. Wendy was leaving him. She will grow up. the nursery window will be shut. There will be another man with wendy, not Peter.....This thoughts made Peter sick. Peter never bothered to ask Wendy if she loves him. Maybe then it's his fault. He thought ""If i would accept Wendy's love... wait...that's impossible...i doesn't wanna grow up....but don't want to see wendy with another man....""Peter is boy and never had a deep thought before. He soon fall. Hook make a final drama to kill him. But again, something happened between Peter and Wendy that changed the storyline.Wendy said ""Peter, i must grow up. But this is for you, and always will be."" And then she kissed him. Now, this scene is a debating subject for critics. But i like to tell, if you were Wendy what would you do when your loved one dying? Examine the drama-o-meter and sex-o-meter?The boy get thousand answers from the kiss. Ya he might not grow up with wendy, but surely got her heart forever. That's enough.The fight was over. the lost boys and wendy returned home. Peter too, in his home, with a new foreign feeling called ""love"".Now let's go though some questions.1.WHY I SAID THIS MOVIE BEATS THE BOOK?Because it is a 2003 production.the book is 100 years old. it contains internal message for kids that are too old now. Also, it is waste book for teenagers.The movie targets especially teenagers.The book refers 5 year Wendy who has grown up problem. The movie changed it to 13 year old. Now that is more sensible. Because 13 is the age when we start to have deep feelings and starts our journey to adulthood, not in our fifth year of our life. the age conversion is also compatible with the romantic theme settled between Peter and Wendy in the movie. 13 is the age we face the ultimate problem of our life - grow up.13 is also the age we start to like the new foreign feelings that crush our mind and thoughts.The movie discovered those problems by the main characters and make a beautiful finish.It show the romance what is practical in the 13 year age bracket.The movie also has a beautiful message. And it also make a question mark over the original book. Now in the original book, Peter flies back to neverland, keep taking Wendy's child,grandchild and so on.What kind of career the author gave Peter? He is alone in the neverland. Because fairies has a short life, lost boys and pirates are gone. Wendy's gone too. What the hell he do then in the neverland. Play with himself?This is an incomplete finishing of a beautiful story where a playful boy got a tiring, alone life whose job is to keep taking children of Wendy.The movie also fixed that. It deleted the finishing part of the book and make a sad romantic end. It alos make some beautiful quotes.""Peter has countless joys but other children will never know....""""Peter was looking particularly at one joy which he would be forever parted....""It contains a very beautiful message to teens. Growing up is not so horrible business. It is beautiful. You can be young in your heart forever. Not growing up? Be peter - a lonely boy who know how horrible it is to watch your loved ones growing old and dying and you have to bear those memories forever.2. ""This movie has too much love aspect...."" - criticsTrue. But it is cast by 13 year teens. Can you guys remember your 13 year teen life memory? The movie is for teens, not for children. For that it has practical scenes that should happen when a 13 year boy and a girl met. No where in the movie the romance got unbearable. The romance was necessary - it made a 100 year old story more compatible and sensible to teens.3. For teens?Yes. It converts children-grown-up-problem to teen-grown-up-problem. More sensible and deep. It is a emotional journey of teenage problems.",Peter Pan
150,tvnuts,A magical movie that everyone should see!,9,27 December 2003,"This movie is great,ignore all the people who say otherwise,just go see it and enjoy- From the very beginning it was great,and right throughout until the end.The special effects were amazing,the flying looked great and there were great performances all round.",Peter Pan
151,HuntersCreed,Not Too Shabby,7,26 December 2003,"The new adaptation of Peter Pan takes the classic child hood story and brings it to life in an utter eye pleasing adventure. I was astounded when I witnessed what a movie with no name actors and actresses turned out to be. This movie is by no means the best movie I've ever seen, but it is definitely among the stars. I found myself in awe of the stunning visuals and captivating portrayals of some of the most well known scenes and characters from the classic tale of Peter Pan that I witnessed. Peter Pan starts off disappointingly slow but turns up the tempo rather quickly upon the arrival of its star character Peter Pan. I was shocked by the direct portrayal of the book that is so very different from the story I knew as a child. The real story of Peter Pan is better than and previous convoluted tale. Peter Pan also has an appeal to a wide audience. Adults will see the film and get caught up in the drama and underlying romance and special effects. Children will love Peter Pan, because it brings to life a character that they know and love in a new adventure. Kids will be swept away by the fantasy and pirates that they love to hate, and they will forever want to be adventurers like the lost boys, while little girls may find themselves wanting to be mom as Wendy is portrayed in the movie. All in all Peter Pan is a must see for adventure seeking, fun loving kids, and drama seeking, I want to be a kid again parents.",Peter Pan
152,illusoryjane,Beautiful and thematically faithful to the original,9,26 July 2004,"P.J. Hogan's rendering of this classic story is timeless and beautiful. Though in certain instances the events of the story vary somewhat from author J.M. Barrie's stories and play, it is easy to forgive these trespasses when you consider that some things work well in print or on stage, but need to be changed in screen adaptation. Moreover, the movie remains accurate to the themes of the original story (more-so, especially, than previous adaptations), and even the darker side of the ""children's stories"" are captured in this film. The movie was brilliantly cast and superbly acted. The actors loved their characters and it showed. Jason Isaacs, in particular was magnificent as Hook, giving the character the touch of dignity that has been left by the wayside in other adaptations (most notably Disney's Peter Pan), while still maintaining the malignant evil and tortured soul that Barrie himself attributed the villain. The film is lushly beautiful, an elegant adaptation.",Peter Pan
153,lil_m1ss_un1ver5e,Peter Pan,10,4 September 2005,"Peter Pan is an excellent movie... i think its a very good real life version of the original cartoon... although in some areas its a lot darker then in the movie.. like the mermaids aren't happy and pretty they are well mean and on the other side of pretty, Peter Pan has a great cast including Jeremy Sumpter, Jason Isacs, Rachael Hurd Wood and many more. I will speak for teenagers like myself when i say Jeremy Sumpter looks absolutely HOT in this movie... I love him! The special features in this movie are quite good and they did a good job on the flying and sword fighting.... Jason Isaccs was a perfect choice for the role of captain Hook... i think he played it perfectly.... although like i said before this movie has more of a dark twist to it and his character was one that was changed! but over all this really was a great movie and i really enjoyed it!!!!!",Peter Pan

155,char_bishop,Suprisingly Good *Some spoilers*,10,25 December 2003,"First of all, let me say I am a bad speller, so forgive me for any spelling mistakes.I went to see this movie, just because it was a family movie that my parents picked to go see this Christmas. I had no anticipation what so ever. I really really enjoyed this whole movie. It made me smile. I was a big Peter Pan fan when I was little and so it was nice to see some of the original scenes that were in the Disney version, as well as some new scenes. The actual love story between Wendy and Peter was very sweet, and I didn't expect it in the beginning. I have heard that in all versions there was a love story between the two, but I never caught it. It was very evident in this version. I will definitly buy this one when it comes out on DVD, hopefully in the new future. I gave it a 10/10.",Peter Pan
156,wilyfem,For crying out loud! People want a movie summary not a biographical novel of J.M. Barrie's life or an over-analyzed movie critic mimic,10,5 January 2004,"Actually most movie critics have sung the praises of this film. Roger Ebert wrote a great critique on it.Why are people griping about ""Peter"" being so old in this movie? Jeremy Sumpter was 12 when he filmed the movie. I don't think that is too ""old"" of an age to effectively portray Peter. At least this movie has a real boy portraying Peter. At least it's not a woman in a cable harness singing, or a distorted Disney cartoon, or, heaven forbid, the classic butcher of a classic: Hook.This movie is excellent! It stays true to the book for the most part. It is a very haunting, sad and sometimes dark story, and I'm glad they didn't try to gloss over that with this movie, like so many others have done with previous renditions. It is also a love story, with a bittersweet ending. The love story that had yet to be portrayed in previous attempts at recreating Barrie's story. This movie introduced us to many of the elements from Barrie's book, left out of the Disney animation, and most, if not all, play and musical versions.It's got everything you could want in a movie. Violence: Captain Hook is a serious villain in this movie (stabbing and shooting people left and right).Action: Sword fights between Captain Hook and Peter Pan (the actors had months of training in fencing before filming started)Love: The first time any version of Peter Pan (movie or play) has emphasized the romance between Peter and Wendy, that Barrie's original story implies. It's very sweet and innocent, and gives the movie much more depth than if the focus was merely on the action and adventure elements of the story, like in all the other movie/play versions of it.Special effects: The special effects are amazing. It is literally a beautiful movie (thanks to Donald McAlpine, cinematographer of Moulin Rouge fame). The Fairy Ballet is awesome.Humor: There is sort of a dry humor throughout this movie. So you get a fair share of laughs - just enough to keep the movie from being completely dark or sad. But not so much that it could be considered a comedy.
Sure this movie doesn't cover everything from the original story (an impossible feat for any book to movie translation), but it has stayed true to most of it. No other movie/play/musical/whatever has come this close.I recommend everyone give this amazing movie a chance.",Peter Pan
157,MoonliqhtRiver,Come away to Neverland...,10,26 December 2003,"I've had my expectations real high about this movie, since I knew about it. I checked up on it and it's now a 100 yr old classic tale. Then I bought the original book and read it.. absolutely loved it. Almost everyone watched the Disney version and always thinks of Disney when they hear PP, never cared about the Disney version really (e.i. Peter wore tights). The real version is so much better, and is a great tale I'll forever love.Went on the opening day for the movie, X-Mas day, which was def. a very nice present! I first have to say this movie is the best version of Peter Pan, and will always be. Stayed very true to the book (with the few changes). I LOVED it. And it was better than my expectations. It is now my favorite movie.. Have to confess I'm an Orlando Bloom fan and like LOTR,POTC,etc. but Peter Pan topped all them and every other movie there is!! Yep even better than Return of the King. Really what captures me is the tale within PP that is 100 yrs old now... a lot people cherish that. It's a very loved classic.Jeremy Sumpter stole my heart away and is the best PP!! Rachael is a great actress and very talently done for her 1st movie. I really liked the 'love' between Peter and Wendy. Absolutely perfect for each other! All the others had their own personal moments in the film that were great.
::SPOILERS::  Favorite scenes were: the dancing in the air, with the 'Fairy Dance' playing. Very beautiful! Then when Peter has given up and is lying down ready for death, he gives Wendy the sweetest look-And Wendy kisses Peter. Don't care what anyone says.. the love between them is right!::/SPOILERS::All in all please go watch the movie if you haven't done so already! Don't let anyone's negative thoughts/comments stop you... be your own  judge. I think you'll like it very much, if not love it!! Didn't let me down.. didn't drag. Given it a 10/10.I do believe in fairies, I do, I do! Happy Holidays.",Peter Pan
158,thrill-film-dance,Family Magic,10,8 August 2004,This is one of the most magical movies of 2003 because it has chosen the perfect actors/actresses to portray roles and the most fantastic music. Jeremy Sumpter is the perfect PETER PAN. Rachel L. Wood is a awesome Wendy and jason is the most best personality for Hook. I got the soundtrack and the music is such a breathtaking journey on its own. This kinda puts the Disney version of peter pan into a shame.This is one of the most classic stories of our time and we must make sure each time it is redone it shows that this is a story of imagination not just a boy who flies with kids.This is one of the best movies that Universal has ever made.,Peter Pan
159,thrill-film-dance,A story we all new just got renewed!,10,21 January 2005,"Experience the story you thought you always knew as the adventure you will only take once in your life. You imagination holds magical journeys and Peter Pan happens to be one of them.With James Newton Howard en-charge of the soundtrack, there is nothing to bring this film down. Peter Pan(Jeremy Sumpter), Tinker Bell,and Wendy(Rachel Hurd Wood) head off to never land to fight the evil and deadly Captain Hook(Jason Issacs). All Peter wants is to have fun, and that's just one thing Wendy has her doubt about. She doesn't want to grow up or stay young. With the help of all the adventures, risks and the magic of pixie dust. Peter Pan learns that even as you are young that some people have to grow up. The magic of wonder pushes the story to the limits with non-stop wonder, excitement and tense sense of adventure. This is a thrill ride all its own.",Peter Pan
160,casey-99,Charming,8,19 September 2004,"A charming family film that stays pretty close to the feeling the author Barrie was trying to create. The original Peter Pan book is a bit dark compared to the Disney Peter Pan. Hogan manages to capture some of the darker moments and complex themes, but still engage children with visual splendor and wonderful special effects. I love that they went back to the stage version in that the same actor (Jason Isaacs) plays both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. His portrayal of Hook is nothing short of perfect based on the Barrie description. Charm and evil wrapped in the same package. Beautiful musical score also. It is very nice to have a film that you can watch with your children and not feel ashamed about. Getting more rare in this day and age. Happy viewing.",Peter Pan
161,VernSheldon-Witter,Absolutely the best-from a Pan junkie,8,20 July 2016,"This is the closest Peter Pan to the book that has ever been made-I recommend it for Adults-not exactly for kids.When I was a wee young thing my Italian Noni used to read us bedtime stories-usually not the ones with happy endings-more the dark kind. I have been read and read Peter Pan at least 100 times. This movie is possibly the closest to the intent of Barrie,it sticks to the double edge of the book closely. The acting,especially Hook/Darling double role played by Jason Issacs is superb-Who would have thought Hook could be so evil and sexy at the same time.And Lynn Redgrave was amazing. Funny I had not seen it until today.I was in tears from beginning to end.",Peter Pan
162,deepspace93,"Great film, just a couple of minor gripes",8,16 May 2004,"I personally thought this was a pretty good film.  I wouldn't say it was any outstanding epic, nor do I expect it to be.  But for being a fine family film, based on the classic children's tale of Peter Pan, I thought it was great.  It was all I expected and more.The acting wasn't top of the line but it was certainly several steps above the norm for family movies.What was outstanding were the effects and the flying and the sword-fighting.All-in-all an above average family film.  I do just have two little gripes with the film:The first is the fact that Jeremy Sumpter didn't even attempt an English accent.  He was about the only non-British actor in the movie, and it showed.  Especially since the film even establishes that his character was from England before he went to Neverland, and all the many decades he was meant to have been in Neverland he was always around  other people with British accents, and every time he left Neverland he always went to London, where he would have heard the British accent again, so why on Earth would Peter Pan talk with an American accent?  There are after all dialogue coaches that can teach accents and it would have just helped to complete the magic of the movie.My second gripe is the narration.  I felt that most of the time the narration was redundant, explaining things which I think even the younger audience members could grasp from the visual presented.  I feel that overall the narration takes away from the magic of the story by explaining scenes which are either visual enough or actions that should be left to the imagination of the viewer in some cases.  There were some scenes where it particularly offended me by telling me how I should be interpreting a particular scene.  Putting a book to film already destroys some of the viewer's ability to imagine scenes of  the story, but adding a narration to explain what's already visually evident destroys even more.
Looking past these gripes the film is still quite spectacular for its genre and I do recommend it.",Peter Pan
163,princesszainab-09939,Full of imagination,10,24 August 2020,I grew up with this version and it's amazing! The acting is amazing and the sets are beautiful!. It's the perfect adaptation from the books unlike hook.. this was a masterpiece and is not a forgettable movie!! I loved it with all my heart and it deserves more recognition then it has. It's honestly so charming and magical,Peter Pan
164,kozee,Dissappointing,5,6 January 2004,"Maybe it was not remembering the plot but it seemed different. The movie was very sexed up, which offended me, possibly because my vision of Peter Pan was that from Disney's 1953 Classic. All in all the tone of the movie was good. Action was acceptable. The problem with it was Peter Pan himself. The choice was terrible. Jeremy Sumpter was not convincing at all, although his co-star, Rachael Hurd-Wood, was remarkable. Ironic since Sumpter has acted before where Hurd-Wood is a new comer. Overall, the sub performance of Sumpter hurt the movie dearly. Personally, I'd stick to Spielberg's' ""Hook"" and Disney's ""Peter Pan"".",Peter Pan
165,oobrey5,Just....Wonderful.,10,11 February 2007,"I've read a few comments already, and everything I could've ever said has been said already (and with much better word choice than anything I could have ever written). When I was a little girl, I'd read this book (and I was only 9 or 10), and I'd just have amazing pictures in my head of all the adventures Wendy and Peter would have. Real ADVENTURES. This movie...Was just breathtaking. I saw it at the movie theatre when I was 18, and I cried because it was like seeing the pictures in my head unfold and it was so....Beautiful. Honestly, the color and music (oh the MUSIC!!!) was simply fantastic. I'm now a music major in college, and have a deeper appreciation for music, and what James Newton did with this soundtrack was out of this world. Literally.If you want choicer wording, or more explicit details of this movie, you can read the 500 comments before mine, or watch the movie yourself and write one of your own. 'Nuff said.",Peter Pan
166,wbrown62,Disappointed and misled,1,27 December 2003,"First, I have to admit to not having read the book. Therefore, I cannot comment on how closely the movie follows it.  However, I can comment on how dreadful the movie is and how no pre-teen child should see it.
With the exception of some of the lush scenery, there is not much about the movie that I would even call ""fair.""  Acting is phoned-in, Peter Pan and Wendy are unattractive, and the writing makes the movie very uneven. The combined effect leaves the viewer unable to understand the motivations of the characters. Scenes that are meant to draw out emotion from the audience are completely flat.  Special effects are 1990 vintage (with the exception of tinkerbell).Finally, more important than the horrible quality of the movie is the sinister nature of it.  This is a movie without heart; with killing with no reason.  I took my 10 year old nephew and almost walked out because of the content.  I'm no prude, but this movie is VERY dark and unsettling.  Wendy and Mrs. Darling are the only characters that possess even a semblance of ""normal"" emotions.  The rest probably need serious psychological help. Peter Pan is especially off beam and I would worry about any child that would want to emulate him in any aspect of his behaviour.",Peter Pan
167,grailwolf,And straight on til morning,9,17 May 2004,"Simply put, this is one of the finest films I have seen in... well, ever. Sumpter's Pan is the best I've seen portrayed.  I have always loved the elfin Pan from plays and movies, but this Peter is so much richer, dirtier, more human.  I found myself really identifying with this character for the first time.Rachel Hurd-Wood plays Wendy beautifully, shifting seamlessly between the child she is and the woman she will become.  And the chemistry between the leads is perfect. I have rarely seen a portrayal of the innocent sweetness of first love that felt more true.More, Hogan's screenplay really brought out some of the subtexts of the story in a way that made them clearer without knocking you senseless with them (Peter's connection with Neverland, the nature of fairies, the tragic side of never growing up, etc.).If you have any love for the story, whether from films, plays or books, you owe it to yourself to see this adaptation.  Thank you, Mr. Hogan, for letting me visit The Neverland one more time.",Peter Pan
168,jinjaninja,Well at least they tried....SPOILERS,1,25 February 2004,"Honestly, in retrospect I did not like this movie. As someone that was brought up with 'Hook' and the original Peter Pan, I am of course biased. I was led to believe that Neverland was actually a real-world place, like 'Hogwarts Castle' in Harry Potter. This film starts out ok, with decent enough special effects, but what really put me off was the invention of 'the kiss' in Wendy's and her mum's mouth. What the heck are they talking about? And the way that Peter Pan is 'linked' with Neverland. He even states in this film that he ran away, and came to Neverland, and thereafter became the leader of the lost boys. The events in this film also act very strangely. At one point, Hook just up and kills a fairy, but since the fairy had no name in the script it doesnt seem to matter. Not really child's film material. Near the climax, Hook starts slaughtering his own crew (Perhaps to tell us YET AGAIN that he is a 'bad guy' - Which is obvious) and as he is splattering the crew's brains across the deck, the children sitting next to them seem completely unperturbed and the next minute are smiling and merry, as if nothing had happened. I said the special effects in the film started out well, and they do, before the Darling children take off through space (As it seems now that the 'second star to the right and straight on till morning' is no longer a portal or key that opens neverland, it is an actual journey, taking away some of the 'real place' effect) they sail past planets that do not exist and also make their orbits about 2 inches away from each other. The only thing that really appealed to me was the 'Long Tom' cannon, as it showed that Hook wasn't really all that bad as he tries to kill the Children with it. Overall: 2/10",Peter Pan

170,Zoe-Trope,"The best version I've seen so far, good for kids and adults",8,27 December 2003,"Wonderful acting, well-cast characters, gorgeous visuals, and more emphasis on the various layers of the plot than previous versions of this story. This is my favorite version so far, and here's why...Given the fact that the entire premise for this story is that Wendy has turned twelve years old and is torn between girlhood and womanhood, the level of ""sexual tension"" was perfectly realistic and appropriate for the age of the characters -- they started off by playing house, and as things developed they weren't thinking of anything more sexual than holding hands or an innocent, closed-mouth kiss, Peter being even rather clueless to that. Keep in mind that goo-goo eyes between boys and girls starts at this age, if not earlier (and that's not just a modern phenomenon). (Even menstruation begins before age 12 for many girls...) Peter's age was perfectly matched to Wendy's (I haven't read Barrie's original, but an adolescent Peter would seem to make sense). The only possible inappropriate tension might be between Hook and Wendy on the ship, but coming to that conclusion takes a great deal of stretching and over-analyzing.Was the scene with the boys' nightdresses flying up erotic? Only if you look for eroticism in everything. I've been around enough kids to know that there's also just plain old ""butt humor..."" The PG rating was appropriate due to the violence alone, which was comparable to other PG movies (Harry Potter, etc.) and children's stories (including Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks, etc.), but good to be there to discuss things with the kids. It almost bothers me more when a movie is given a G rating, but includes people calling each other idiots and imbeciles (as in 101 Dalmations, which I enjoy nonetheless) because my kids are more likely to imitate that behavior. I was slightly dismayed to see the kids in the film chanting for the croc to get Hook, though... I went to this movie with another adult and two six-year-old boys -- we all loved it. Kids at that age LOVE to make believe that they can do anything -- it's called ""imagination."" It's fun, it's empowering, and it's one of the things Peter and the other children were holding on to in their resistance to growing up. Go see this movie!",Peter Pan
171,Fancyfiddling,Good kid movie,6,22 December 2004,"Overall I thought it was a good movie to see on TV. I wouldn't rent it or see it in theaters. The acting was disappointing. I thought Jason Isaacs portrayed Hook well. The children's acting seemed a little overdone. You could tell they were trying to act, but I guess that comes with inexperience. The children casted haven't been in many movies. Tink had more experience in movies than Jeremy Sumpter, although I do think he did an exceptional job at being Peter. This was more the quality of a TV mini-series instead of a blockbuster hit. I also didn't like how everything was so artificial looking compared to the movie ""Hook"", but if you think about it it was originally a play and would have looked artificial. I guess it is all in your preference. One thing I did like about it though was how it was dark. It had a darker feeling than any other Peter Pan movies or cartoons that I've seen. Over all it is a good children's movie, but if you want something more mature go see ""Finding Neverland."" You can find superb acting there.",Peter Pan
172,Hitoshirenu,Awesome film,7,14 January 2004,"Nowadays, it is so rare for me to see a film that moves me.  Peter Pan is one of those rare gems that can make an adult feel like a kid again. There were wonderful performances and visual effects.  Jeremy Sumpter who plays Pan did a wonderful job, despite his passage into manhood during the filming of the movie.  Rachel is very talented as Wendy, and Jason can make an character seem creepy.  In fact, the only problem I had with the film was Sumpter's speaking problems.  This only happened in one scene, but it did stick out in my mind.  The reason it did was because it is probably one of the most famous lines from the book: ""Second star to the right and straight on till morning.  For some reason I detected a slight Irish accent which made it sound like marning when he said it.  Also his lisp came very prevalent in another line in the same scene, but it was forgivable.Jason Isaacs was a superb choice as Hook.  He made him a monster when he was a monster, but he gave him an interesting human element when it was necessary.  It was so good that I almost pitied him when i came to the realization that he truly is alone.  This makes him hate Pan all the more and he begins to discover Pan's weakness. All in all it was an enjoyable film.  I give it an 8/10",Peter Pan

Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as ""Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds,"" and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including ""embonpoint,"" ""quietus,"" and ""pluperfect."" Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for Peter Pan has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are ""literary"" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as ""youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg,"" and the author interjects: ""This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form."" A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.",Peter Pan
175,BWMonkey,i was unsure,7,27 March 2004,"at first, i was slightly unsure what i thought about this movie. i saw right away that it was charming, exciting, adventerous, etc, but i couldn't decide whether or not i liked it.Rachel Hurd-Wood was a pleasant surprise.  she has talent, though you cannot tell by the trailers.  for the longest time in my younger years (no too long ago, in fact) i hated wendy and wished she had no part of the story, but in this new version, i actually liked her very much.  i think it had something to do with the slight adjustments made on her character.  Jeremy Sumpter was....to tell you the truth, i watched it new years day and it's now march, but from what i can remember, he definitely looked the part.  his acting was at times a bit painful for me to watch, but then again, i've always been overly critical of younger actors.  overall, the kids were great, fun to watch, funny, in no way obnoxious.  i liked tiger-lily (i once had a cat named after her) though i'm still not sure where the little romance between her and john came from.  Smee was great (his parrot irked me, though). pretty much everyone went above and beyond my expectations.
there's one charcter that deserves his own paragraph, and that is Captain James Hook.  by far, the most important villian of all of my childhood adventures.  in the 1953 disney version (which i watched over and over, much to the annoyance of my poor father who had to go out and rent it every weekend and sit through it with me) captain hook was my favorite.  i watched and endured Hook just for him.  and now, to this day, he still lurks in the back of my mind, waiting to leap out with that hook of his and make me grin. bad guys are so cool.jason isaacs quickly rose to my top ten favorite actors of all time before i even saw this movie.  but now....well, geez.  i think i'm in love.  he was brilliant as hook and mr. darling.  we know the characters so i won't bore you with details.  my fist thought when i saw the trailer was ""of course! jason isaacs is perfect.""  and whoever designed the costume and make-up deserves special mention because he looked exactly how i always pictured the villain. i especially liked the twist that was given to his character, making you feel almost sympathetic (or maybe just sorry) towards him by the end.  my my, does mr isaacs play the villian well, though he was equally good as mr. darling, a boring, penny pinching man, unsure of himself but wanting ever so much to do well.  a good soul.now, if i love the charcters so much, why was i unsure?  i think it had partially something minor aspects to the story that struck me as out of place.  i'm the type who loves it when a book is adapted well and this is one of those cases.  from what i saw, it appeared that pretty much every aspects of J.M. Barrie's original story was there, in one way or another, even the ""adult"" over tones.  but hollywood had a hand in it as well, trying desperately to give the movie a ""message"" that children would accept and parents would approve of.  i'm not sure what that message was, though.  it has something to do with the whole ""love"" theme.  i admit that i am not one who gets all teary-eyed when two people profess their love for each other so, when watching those scenes in the theater, i couldn't help but cringe at the failed attempt make love the answer to all of life's troubles. but i won't start philosophising. i've already said enough.in conclusion, i liked it.  it made me want to be there, fighting pirates, running though the luscious forests and flying among the pink clouds.  i an no longer unsure, and when it finally comes out on DVD, i plan to watch it over and over (skipping the more sickeningly love-oriented scenes).  that is, if i ever get a DVD player.  the i'll have to fast forward.",Peter Pan
176,rgmcnabb,Second on the right...,10,28 May 2004,"Well, it's been done - a version of Peter Pan has been made that will set the standard for a generation. This is to the book what Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies are to the book that inspired them...a living film tribute to a story that transcends time and place. Enough good things cannot be said - seldom have I seen a film that had me fighting back tears virtually from the beginning. For starters, the physical look of the film is like an N.C. Wyeth painting - the sky is incredibly blue, the clouds lit by a sunrise you won't believe, etc. etc. It's one of the most artistically gorgeous films ever. The casting is absolutely flawless. Perfect Hook, Tink, Wendy, etc. etc. And Peter is great, just great. He lights up the screen. How lucky we are that they didn't just choose popular kid actors for the roles, instead of carefully casting it with types that are perfect for their characters. The script is the real winner, though. It's written in the same grand, formal prose of the book, and has not been dumbed down at all (a'la Disney, where no matter where you are in time, everyone speaks as though they're from 20th century LA). The characters speak with a literary force and gravity that pulls your mind out of the 20th century and puts it right into Neverland, where it should be. And best of all, there is a moral undergirding in the tale that is brought to the screen with real clarity. This is a profound movie on many levels, and is about a lot more than just growing up. It's about duty, courage, loyalty, love, family, but mostly I think it's about living life to its fullest, which means that when you get the chance to go to Neverland, you DON'T take it. You stay the course and become an adult. Sad in some ways, but in the end very happy for all concerned. Bravo.",Peter Pan
177,madisonpine,So different (in a good way) from the cartoon version!,10,2 March 2005,"When I saw the animated ""Peter Pan"", I thought that it was stupid, period. And therefore was put off seeing the motion picture. Then my friends went around saying that this was this cute-as hottie on screen, so I went, promising myself that if I didn't like it from the beginning, I would leave and never come back. It never got to that. I especially liked the ending, because it tied up with the beginning in that ""for all children grow up. Except one"", speech. One of the weird parts was that Peter and Wendy were ""love at first sight?"" Peter seemed more of the romantic kind in this movie, more romantic than swashbuckling and adventurous. Another part was that Peter ""didn't"" have any feelings. He seemed to have feelings when he couldn't get his shadow back on, when he was accused of crying, so on. But that might be because I heard wrong. The special effects were amazing. The flying scenes were simply so natural and the scenery was beautiful. The mermaids were a change, and I was glad for that. Most mermaids I see are girlie and feminine. The flying dance Peter did with Wendy showed how much they were caught up in a love-hate relationship - Peter because he didn't have feelings (or couldn't feel love), and Wendy because she could. Tiger Lily was funny, and Hook had a brilliant actor behind him. Rating: 10/10 (of course!)",Peter Pan
178,dramaqueen-20,A Magical Experience,10,20 May 2005,"Peter Pan was one of four family holiday flicks that came out at the Christmas season of 2003, along with Elf, Cat in the Hat, and Cheaper by the Dozen. Peter Pan took viewers on a magical adventure to Neverland and back with the three Darling children, portrayed beautifully by Rachel Hurd-Wood, Harry Newell, and Freddie Popplewell.When I saw this brilliant movie for the first time, I was drawn in and flown away to Neverland where I battled pirates, believed in fairies, and truly didn't want to grow up. This movie is portrayed to its brilliance by outstanding actors and actresses from all over the world. I would truly recommend this awesome family film to everyone who has yet to believe that dreams do come true at that fairies do really exist.",Peter Pan

The mermaids, the Indians, the pirates, the Lost Boys, the real life Darling family and even the relationship between Peter Pan and Wendy have new life breathed into them without losing the original, magical story. The movie explores deeper issues yet avoids becoming bogged down in them; in fact, these issues kindle the fires of newness in the movie. An excellent film well worth the rental or perhaps even the ownership. That said, I can't help but feel from the point Tinkerbell saves Peter Pan on this story loses some of its fairy dust, and so fails to win the highest acclamation. But the last part of the movie is still amusing and fun, so much so that this small failing detracts little from a wonderful adventure in Neverland.",Peter Pan

Peter Pan has always been one of my favorite stories and I find this version is an excellent interpretation. Sure, it's a little scary with the huge crocodile and Jason Isaacs' marvelous captain Hook but not more so than other so called children's movies. Jeremy Sumpter did a wonderful job, finally a spunky Peter Pan, that shows both sides of his personality. Rachel Hurd-Wood, a lovely Wendy. Feisty but victorianly feminine.

It was the classic feel good movie with a little bitter taste at the end.  I am sure we all feel sorry for the boy who can have all the joys in the world but is barred from the one he longs for most.  Visually it was stunning.  Effects were clever and convincing enough.  The story was reproduced very faithfully with the pirates adding a comic twist to the tale. The actors were brilliant too.Jason Isaacs is rapidly growing into a legend.  He was convincing both as Mr Darling and as the greatest villian of all.  I must admit that this was one of the best Captain Hooks I've ever seen.Jeremy Sumpter was the dream choice.  His face and his looks are the perfect Peter Pan: naughty, up to trouble, yet harbouring something dark inside. I've seen that many have criticised his American accent but I think that was a bonus. I remember that Peter Brook, considered to be the greatest theatre director alive once directed Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST.  As Miranda he insisted on casting a young oriental girl who had never seen England before and this because he wanted her to be different from the other civilised characters since she was brought up alone on an island.  Peter Pan is different from the other children so that his speaking American when the others speak English is a brilliant idea.  Otherwise, he gets everything right.Rachel Hurd-Wood gives a brilliant performance too.  She's one of the best child actors I've seen in ages.They are supported by a very enthusiastic and talented cast namely Olivia Williams, Lynn Redgrave and Ludivine Saignier.Another good point is the children's costumes.Indeed, a very good movie.",Peter Pan

Imagine Peter Pan meets Tim Burton for this movie.  I enjoyed Hook very much as well, but for entirely different reasons.  This Peter Pan movie takes the story seriously, showing that fairy tales can be more than comic fun, but something which can still appeal to the fantastical side of every adult. Of course, there is still plenty of fun and playful humor to satisfy, and there is a good balance between the action and drama of the story.This really is Peter Pan as it was meant to be told.  The narration is essential to the style of the movie.  The young actors in the movie do extremely well, and Captain Hook is very convincing, eliciting sympathy for this cruel yet tragic villain.

186,jon6810,Peter Pan: The Definitive Coming-of-Age Tragedy,10,15 October 2006,"(Note: Before you see this movie, go see Finding Neverland (2004). You will have a much greater appreciation both for what J.M. Barrie was trying to capture in his original play and how this version nails it.)I guarantee you have never seen the story of Peter Pan told like this before, even though it is probably the most true to Barrie's original intent, in-so-far-as what he wanted you to realize about the suffering involved in growing up. Mary Martin and Walt Disney did not even scratch the surface of the depths to which this movie plunges.In this film we are introduced to two central children of the same adolescent age, Peter Pan and Wendy Darling. Peter is intent on always remaining a kid, while Wendy is actually looking forward to becoming a young woman. They fall in love, but from the opposite sides of puberty, if only narrowly. Peter is barely a boy, and Wendy just barely a woman.This rift creates a sexual tension between the two that Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood deliver beautifully, especially the latter (this is the first version of the story that ever has the two share an on-screen/stage kiss). The confusion as to what really matters, having fun as a child or being accepted as an adult, is the same struggle Barrie had as a boy trapped in a middle-aged man's body. His outlet for that overwhelming battle was the play we all now love, one that has been billed over time as a children's lullaby but is actually a straightforward coming-of-age tragedy.Note the symbolism, which emanates from Barrie's original play. Mr. Darling has always been portrayed by the same actor as Captain Hookadults are the bad guys. Peter is an indestructible boyjust as all adolescents think they are. His cockiness stems from that feeling of invulnerabilitysound familiar? A ticking crocodile is always chasing Hooktime chases us all. The only adults in Never Land are greedy piratesas we age, we become more focused on material possessions than on the common struggle we all face to simply be happy, and that greediness is often the very thing that keeps adults from being such.As a viewer, the hard part to deal with is that it never works out between Peter and Wendy. She grows up and he never does. We identify with Wendy because we all age and are forced to take on responsibility, whether we want to or not, while Peter remains in Never Never Land, torturing himself and us forever. He cannot have both Wendy and the freedom to have fun. But whereas people must eventually grow up, fall in love, take on responsibility and start a family of their own, Peter has found a way to always remain a boy.This version also presents the most evil Hook of them all, and not because he makes Pan walk the plank or kills Lost Boys. He is a representation of adult society, and as such does his best to convince the boyish Pan that he is worthless as a child and cannot provide the woman Wendy with what she needs until he grows up, something that goes against everything Peter believes. The following is Hook's exchange with Peter during their final battle. Peter is cryingHook: She was leaving you. Your Wendy was leaving you. Why should she stay? What have you to offer? You are incomplete. Let's take a look into the future, shall we? You fly to Wendy's nursery and... What's this? The window's closed. Peter: I'll open it. Hook: I'm afraid the window's barred. Peter: I'll call out her name. Hook: She can't hear you. Peter: No. Hook: She can't see you. Peter: Wendy. Hook: She's forgotten all about you. Peter: Stop it. Please. Stop it.In addition to the issues raised regarding youth-hood vs. adulthood, the film seizes your attention with its dazzling mise-en-scene as well. It reminds me of Hero (2002) in many ways. Each frame seems drenched in color, as if they took the finished film and dipped it in bright ink. This means that every moment of this movie can be captured as a screen shot and would still be visually stunning, the mark of truly imaginative and brilliant cinematography.After watching Peter Pan, you will go on living your adult life, acquiring more and more responsibility until retirement and death. Meanwhile, Peter will always remain a child, never knowing what it truly feels like to fall in love or have children. Just as we can only imagine his life, he would only be able to imagine ours. It is a mutually unpleasant experience, and will leave you with a lasting feeling of intangible sorrow, both you and Peter always speculating what the other side might be like.",Peter Pan
187,leanne82nw,A wonderful and beautifully shot adaptation of the book,10,5 January 2004,"I found the 2003 version of the movie Peter Pan a wonderful and beautifully shot movie, with every scene and location definitely having a magical feeling to it.  The child actors in the film each did a tremendous job, in particular Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy who gave a standout performance.The film remained very faithful to the book, indeed lines from the book are read by the narrator at times. This is definitely a family film rather than a children's film as some of the underlying themes are more geared towards an older audience, such as the sexual tension and innuendos between Peter and Wendy and the complexity of the character of Mr. Darling.Tinkerbell I felt was not as good in this movie as in other adaptations as I was left not really caring too much what happened to her, but the whole film's production was outstanding!",Peter Pan

190,MJM5226,The best (and truest) version I have ever seen!,10,30 December 2003,"Okay, I am going to say it: This trumps even the Disney version. THERE!This is by far the best visual interpretation of the story I have yet seen. For many reasons. First off, Peter Pan is FINALLY being played by an actual boy! YIPPEEE!!The first real exposure I had to this story was at the tender age of 7, when, while skimming through a Disney cartoon coloring book, I came across a drawing of Wendy attempting to give Peter a kiss. How deliciously scandalous! I was instantly intrigued, and after reading the book and seeing the movie, I soon realized, even at such an innocent age, that this was not your ordinary fairy tale. Indeed, for all the talk about children staying young forever, this story sure does touch heavily upon many grown-up situations. I have often insisted that the story of Peter Pan is NOT for kids! (But perhaps they realize this too, and that is why they have been entranced by it for almost a century....It's as close to adult material as their parents will allow!)Thank you thank you THANK YOU, Mr. Hogan, for seeing this as well and not being afraid to tackle it. I understand that child labor laws have long kept boys from playing the title role, but I'd be willing to bet that there was/is also an underlying desire to suppress the sensual themes explored in the original story by having the safety of a female playing Pan. As Roger Ebert so aptly put it, ""The sensuality is there, and the other versions have pretended it was not."" (I agree, although the Disney version walked that fine line very delicately, what with the playing up of Peter's ""rock star"" appeal to basically every female he came across, including the mermaids and Tiger Lily....the latter, in this film version, becoming a belle for John instead.)Another intertesting choice in this film was the decision to make Captain Hook a rather attractive in that oh-so forbidden way (which is subtley hinted at in the book). It was an effective choice though, as we are able to fully understand Wendy's moral dilemma when she is faced with the decision of staying underground with the emotionally detatched Peter or to become a pirate alongside the fascinating Hook, whom she describes as ""a man of feelings.""To all the critics out there who have flown into such a tizzy about this movie being so ""overtly sexual,"" alls I hafta to say is Please seek a therapist, because you obviously have some unresolved Freudian issues that you are taking out on this film. This is 2003, not 1903.The only place where I felt this film could improve was in the character (or lack thereof really) of Tinkerbell. Unlike the stage and cartoon versions, she is given little exploration and is basically a pint-sized ""deus ex machina,"" swooping into the storyline whenever it needs a crucial plot point. (Indeed, this is rather how she was portrayed in the book also....perhaps Hogan was just sticking to the original story here.)But on the whole, I would have to rate this film just a hair under Perfect. Every character was portrayed suberbly...there was not a weak player in the bunch. The effects were a bit cheesey, but fortunately the filmmakers did not soley rely on them for the entertainment value. There were so many golden moments in this movie it is hard to pinpoint just which one is my favorite. The whole hour and 45 minutes is just an absolute treasure. :-)",Peter Pan

Well, after all, it was rated G and about 50 years old.But this movie put sparkles in my eyes! It's very divine! The music is delightful and inspirational, the acting is excellent, the sets are beautiful, and Jason Issacs portrays yet another villain we all love to hate!

The acting from both Peter and Wendy was great, not to mention Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook. Jason Isaacs is one of my favorite actors, and this movie just proved why. He was able to play a kind and lovable Mr. Darling, then turn around and play the fearsome James Hook. There were several moments in this film that just hit home. It gave me shivers when everyone was chanting ""I do believe in fairies."" You can't watch that scene and not be touched. It just lifts you into the air with joy and I couldn't help grinning. Another beautiful scene is the fairy dance. It is so pure and sweet. I must touch again on the brilliance of Jason Isaacs. Never before have I seen a character who is so evil, yet, in some scenes, likable. The portrayal of the character was amazing. I recommend that everyone see this movie. It will be enjoyed by adults, children, boys and girls. Girls will especially enjoy seeing young Wendy sword fighting instead of letting Peter have all the fun.

It looks like Revolution will be the Disney of the future; as Disney itself declines, Revolution's star will rise. Hope to see more of both Pan and Wendy in the future! This adaptation stayed more to the original book. The one thing I would have changed would be Wendy and lot staying in Never Land with Peter.

196,JulietsDagger,The good and the bad of Peter Pan.,10,25 August 2004,"Peter Pan (2003) Directed by P.J Hogan. With Jeremy Sumpter, Jason Isaacs, and Rachel Hurd-Wood.PLOT: One night while Wendy Darling (Rachel Hurd-Wood) and her brothers are sound asleep, Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) comes in to their nursery to retrieve his stubborn yet beloved shadow. While Peter is searching, Wendy wakes up and the two make small talk. Eventually, Peter convinces Wendy and her brothers to fly off to Neverland with him. While there, the children encounter many exciting adventures, including encounters with the infamous villain Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs).THE GOOD: Overall I'd say this is a wonderful film. The scenery is beautiful, as is the music. The acting is good, especially from Jason Isaacs who plays both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. The fight scenes are exciting without being too frightening for the little ones in the audience. All of the elements that make a movie good are here. Drama, action, romance, and comedy. ****Spoiler**** There is one kiss between Peter and Wendy, but it is not meant to be sexual, contrary to some belief. ****Spoiler Over**** The romantic chemistry between Wendy and Peter is the equivalent to that of a Disney fairytale. The only thing different is that the heroine of the story has an actual, vivid personality.THE BAD: I can't find much bad in this movie, but if you're the type of person who doesn't enjoy cheesie-ness, there are a few moments in the film that may annoy you. As for me, I like that type of thing so it worked out fine. Not a perfect movie, but in my opinion there is no such thing.MY RATING: 9/10.",Peter Pan
197,awj11,A Nice Attempt,3,20 July 2005,"I've seen this movie several times (mostly because it's often on cable...) and, well, I've seen better. Much better. For a movie so dependent on special effects, there seemed to be absolutely no attempt to merge the actual footage with the special effects, seamlessly. I was so unable to suspend my disbelief for this film, that I spent the entire movie waiting for it to end. I'll admit, I liked the mermaids (although I was very annoyed by the very red hair. I understand that it's fantasy, but there is absolutely no excuse for that hair!), and Jason Isaacs played both of his parts well (although, in most productions I've seen where Mr. Darling and Hook are played by the same actor, the director has enough sense to capitalize on this. Here, it just seems like a money-saver), as well as most of the adult actors. The children in the film were totally miscast, in my opinion. I felt that none of the actors were cut out for their roles, and, cute as he may be, Jeremy Sumpter just didn't pass as Peter Pan. While I can understand those who don't agree with me, anybody who expects a film to include good direction, acting, and editing will be disappointed (I would suggest the silent movie version, which I think was far superior to this one). But if you don't care, help yourself to this film.",Peter Pan
198,marcheatham,"Not the real Peter Pan, but it'll do.",10,18 October 2005,"Until I saw this movie, I never knew that Peter talked in his sleep so much. I'm assuming Jeremy just ad-libbed a little in that scene. I heard a rumor that they had to repeat that one scene over and over 17 times in order to get it right. His head must've really hurt after that. Of course, that's just a rumor so don't quote me on that one.Man, if I see another princess with blue fingerprints on her face...I was hoping someday I'd finally hear Tinkerbell actually talking, and here it is. I can't get enough of her cute little, ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" after Peter accuses her of trying to kill Wendy.I never thought I'd see the day where mermaids were evil. But you, madam, have shown me the light.",Peter Pan
199,dithajusticia,Underrated masterpiece.,10,25 July 2021,PJ Hogan really did something wild here. I love how they interpret the storyline and how they depict Neverland was so beautiful. Deserves at the very least 7. Jason Isaacs's Hook performance is extremely underrated.,Peter Pan
200,clarewashbrook,Truest version,10,17 January 2007,"This film makes the ultimate movie faux pas - it sticks to the original story! Whilst this means that it will inevitably fail at the box office - what it means to us viewers (and literary obsessives)is that this is the most genuine and satisfying film of Peter Pan ever! Many people do not realise that this story began life as a stage play and it is wonderful to see that history acknowledged and homaged with the traditional dual casting of one actor as both Mr Darling and Hook. This is essential for understanding the subtext (for adults).It is a beautiful film and has one of the best feel-good moments ever in it - I dare you not to cry during ""I do believe in fairies""! Jason Issacs is on form in his best role to date - beats Lucius Malfoy within seconds! There can be no other Tinkerbell after this and if one could direct a ""there is no such thing as fairies"" at just the Disney Tinkerbell and Julia Roberts and be certain that no other fairy would be harmed then every viewer would scream it at maximum volume - there can be no other.It is a beautifully imagined and realised world which feels right and believable all the way through. It is a film which ought to have no ""making of"" because it damages the magic - something which this film has in abundance!",Peter Pan
201,Spikeychick117,You'll feel like a kid again!,9,5 March 2006,"I've seen many Peter pan Movies, I love ""Hook"" with Robin Williams. I never liked the idea of a woman playing Peter pan, because she was not very believable plus I think a guy should play Peter Pan! When I first saw this movie I thought ""Oh Godthis is going to be a HORRIBE movie! Because of the stupid special effects"" But when I first started to watch this movie I got sucked in. The Actor who plays Peter Pan is justbrilliant. He's a very good actor for his age. And it doesn't hurt to use his charm to get us to love Peter! I'm not a pedophile or anythingbut the actor is so charming, you just look into his eyes and believe that he really is the real pan! Lol. The Actress is wonderful too! Even though this is a kid's movie, I really enjoyed it! While watching this movie I felt like a kid again (although in a way I am21 really isn't considered ""Old"" But still) I really think people should watch this movie, if you like Pan Peter (Michel Jackson will just LOVE this movie LMAO! ^0~ I Kid!) Then this movie is for you! ^_~",Peter Pan
202,msdebd,Incredible acting,10,11 May 2019,"I love this rendition of Peter Pan. The best by far, due to incredible acting/directing. I still can't decide if Jeremy (Peter Pan), is just a natural, or it's the result of incredible directing, or both. But Peters facial expressions tell the story even without sound. He amazes me in his uncanny ability to have the exact expressions. I think I've watched this movie a hundred times. I recommend adults have their children and grandchildren see this film. Marvelous version of a very old story. It's a hit going out the gate, first incredible choices of actors , they could not have improved on the cast. Then the adventurous telling of the tale. You didn't miss a beat absolutely awesome movie.",Peter Pan
203,msdebd,Best adaptation I have seen of Peter Pan,10,17 June 2019,"Best adaptation I have seen of Peter Pan . I can't get over how perfectly Jeremy gets his facial expressions . You can feel his emotions. I don't know if it's Jeremy's natural acting ability or a combination of awesome directing but is so well done. The story is well told with lots of action. Much better than any other version. The chemistry with Jeremy and Rachel makes it. Jason playing hook has remarkable facial expressions as well. One of my favorite scenes with hook is when he is listening to princess Tiger Lily , the expression on his face after she spits on him is perfectly hilarious. I think I have watched this film a hundred times never get tired of Jeremy Sumpter an incredible actor.",Peter Pan
204,snapie-1,"Boy, why are you crying?",10,6 August 2006,"There's only one word for this film: AWESOME.Okay, so unless you've been living in some bizarre netherworld with no access to any media for the last century and then some, you've heard the story of Peter Pan, the boy who would not grow up. Personally, I haven't read Barrie's book, or play either. But you bet I'm looking for it now.I've seen the pantomimes, I own the Disney version, but both have been far overshadowed by this masterpiece of a film. Whoever started the tradition of an adult female in Peter's role wants shooting, or killing painfully in some way at least. After seeing Jeremy Sumpter's performance as Peter, seeing that cheeky (and heart melting) grin, watching how accurately the emotions that his character is going through shine through in the way he looks and moves, if I happened to meet the critics that were so hard on him, I'd be giving them an earful about it. I am an actress, and to do what he did, put up with the sword fights, the flying and learning that wonderful script, is a damn hard job. Plus, he was only 14 at the time (I think). I couldn't do all that at once if you payed me a million pounds. Rachel Hurdwood does a smashing job of playing Wendy Darling (sooo much envy...), not too over the top, but she knows when to hang back and when to let herself shine. And who could forget Jason Isaacs as Hook? Haunting..and brilliant. Smee got some awesome lines ('Its all a bit tragic really, isn't it?') And the rest of the actors make a seamless cast. I like it how the weather in Neverland ties in with Peter's emotions, and that the director was not afraid to show the darker side of the story. The film will thrill children, no matter what the critics say. My little sister is 7, and she enjoyed it as much as I did. It makes you think very deeply about the characters and particularly the troubles Peter is presented with, if you're older. After all, what Peter Pan has is what every ten year old boy wants..but what they have, Peter will never get a chance to feel. Hook could not have been more wrong exposing Peter as not the golden boy he wants everyone to see him as, but the sad, lonely boy trapped in his own fairy tale that he really is. Wendy and her brothers (even the Lost Boys -slightly was cool-) might be able to return home, but for him the window is shut, and will always be, since in Neverland the only way to die is to be killed perforce. The 'I do believe in fairies' scene was funny, but a bit annoying..and the fact that Hook dies is a bit of a let down. As for the chemistry between Rachel and Jeremy (which, had it not been palpably real, would have ruined the movie), it reminded me of Romeo and Juliet. You know how it ends, but you so hope that one of them will make the ultimate sacrifice, or that something will change so they can be together. But, Pan being Pan, his love of being forever youthful is too great for him to go back on it, even for his Wendy. He would rather she (to nab from the movie) go home, and take her feelings with her than force him to grow up. In a way though, she did. She made him question staying in Neverland for the first time, and when he was looking in at the window at the end of the film, you could see on his face that he was torn in two, at least for a few minutes, before dear old Tink pulled him away.This movie would have been a box office smash, had it not been released between Potter and Lotr. Too much competition. But this film has set a new standard for Pan movies, and a damn high one. I will be very surprised if anyone manages to top it in my lifetime, or indeed my children's. (If I have any) Commendations to all, and to the critics that found anything major wrong about this film, watch it again with an open mind. Your opinion will change. It will. The music is enchanting, the scenes picturesque to the minutest detail, and the entire cast on top form. 14th time of watching it and I'm still not tired of it yet! And remember, All Children Grow Up...Except One.",Peter Pan

206,Jenjenstar85,A wonderful film that gives you goosebumps!,10,29 May 2007,"I was never a huge fan of the Disney cartoon about Peter Pan even though I adore most Disney films. So he has never been my favourite character. But after I saw this film I wanted to believe there was such a person! This is a glorious film supported by a wonderful score and excellent effects. Jeremy Sumpter is a very believable Peter Pan, cute, athletic, very boyish but shows hints of a young adult. It's his chemistry with Wendy, played by Rachel Hurd-Wood, that makes this film great in my opinion. Some may say it borders on sexual tension but it certainly captures those uncertainties that surround adolescence relationships. The two scenes which really boast their acting abilities is The Fairy Dance and when Hook tries to kill Pan towards the end.Hook is played by Jason Issacs who is always amazing in anything he does. He's the horrible villain but also the lovable Mr Darling in this film and portrays both brilliantly. Another group of actors I must mention is the Lost Boys who are really funny. Most of them seem very talented and dish out good one-liners. Tinker-bell is okay, I am not familiar with the actress who plays her, Ludivine Sagnier, but she portrayed a fairy very well. I guess this character has always annoyed me a little but the I Do Believe in Fairies scene is very powerful. You almost start chanting along with them! The music in Peter Pan is probably the best score I have ever heard and I am fan of all music genres. I even let the end credits continue so I could re-live the magical score. It really does give you goosebumps towards the end. This is a very magical film that not only excites children but can also bring out the child in any adult.",Peter Pan
207,tishwolfe,"Beautiful, literate, charming",10,11 January 2004,"Many of the settings look like Maxfield Parrish paintings come to life.The child actors seem very natural.

It's hard to believe that this movie come from Hollywood. The movie (and the book, of course) talk about very importants themes to all human being, from birth to death.

209,redleigh86,Disappointing after such a good trailer...,4,23 December 2003,"I was so excited when I first saw the trailer for Peter Pan while ushing at the theater I work for. Knowing that employees get to go to the movie screenings and see movies before everyone else, I was especially excited. I stayed up until 3 am to see the screening and afterwards I felt as if I had wasted two hours of my life and left the theater early that morning a very sad girl. Peter Pan has always been one of my favorite children's stories (perhaps because I'm 17 and resent having to grow up? haha) but I'd always been interested in seeing a darker version of the story be made, maybe a Tim Burton-esque film...which is what the trailers made it look like. How misleading. As soon as I heard the narrator and saw the opening sequence I knew the movie would be nothing like how I imagined it. The beginning as a whole wasn't terrible by any means and was tolerable up until Jeremy Sumpter (Peter Pan) opened his mouth. My first reaction? Since when the hell is Peter Pan American?! That right there ruined the whole movie. Sumpter doesn't do well as Pan either and I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he was chosen for the role soley based on the fact he's attractive to the pre-teen-OMG-like-Aaron Carter-is-like-totally-the-coolest crowd.I read one review that said Tinkerbell was great...meh. I felt Tink was annoying as all get out and enjoyed the animated version of her much more. The girl that played Wendy was pretty good, however, it was difficult to focus on her performance when the disproportionate features of her face were so noticable (no offense). I was somewhat shocked at how...grown-up the children and movie alike came across, even though it's supposed to be a movie about children who don't grow up... After bashing the movie so much I suppose I should state its good qualities. Captain Hook was fantastic and his swordfights with Pan were fairly impressive given the circumstances. I'm glad they made Hook much more of a real threat than some kind of cartoon villain. I was also pleasantly surprised with the mermaids. If only the movie had been comprised of more scenes with Hook and the mermaids I would have given it a much better score.Overall, the movie was just meh. If you want to see a good Peter Pan movie watch the Disney cartoon and if you want to see a pirate movie watch Pirates of The Caribbean, those two movies far surpass Peter Pan. The few good scenes it did have sadly weren't enough to redeem the entire movie. It was definately made for the younger crowd. 4/10.",Peter Pan
210,clarem-7,Brilliant,10,29 February 2012,"Starting with the introduction: a night sky, the chime of bells and the first lines of the narration, we meet with a magic creation, full of enchantment and nostalgia. A very thorough production, down to the last detail. Thanks to its imaginative wonderland scenery and its focus on an individual language for every character, this film has created a unique atmosphere. The storyline is witty and thankfully lacks the monotonous pattern of many fairy tale adaptations. Most important, throughout excellent acting – from an utterly convincing Peter Pan, to a refreshingly lifelike Captain Hook, and an admirably selfless Mr Darling – turns this film into an unforgettable experience.",Peter Pan
211,Michael-moviemaniac,Peter pan is the king of fairy tales,10,26 May 2014,Peter pan (2003) is a film i grew up with and one that also managed to leave a special place in my childhood. It still holds up and will continue to share it's magic with children in all the years to come. This timeless story is handled perfectly in every way making this a beautifully faithful book to film adaptation. From the score to the atmosphere and the magic this is another example showcasing the king of fairy tales P.PAn it the best film version of the story as far. If you love fantasy films and still didn't give this a chance please do so. A new peter pan origin film is set for next year (2015) and i strongly hope it manages to top or at least be as well made as this film.,Peter Pan
212,wgoldfinger,An excellent rendering of Barrie's work...,10,3 January 2004,"As a huge fan of the story, I found this version wonderful! It is an eye-catching and stunning rendering of J.M. Barrie's vision. I thought the music was wonderful, too (I went right out and bought the soundtrack). I feel like I can finally throw ""Hook"" right in the trash, and I'm eager for this version to come out on DVD so I can add it to my collection.Also, for those users who commented it wasn't for children, I saw the movie with two 5-year-olds who simply loved it. My daughter has asked to go see it again! She normally gets scared if there is a scary part in movies, but she watched the entire movie in fascination.I was pleased to see how P.J. Hogan stayed true to the story of Peter Pan, and the movie brought me to tears of joy more than once. It's a beautiful movie, well done!

213,rlo157,A terrific and fun retelling of the classic tale...,10,13 January 2004,"This latest edition of Peter Pan is a true delight. Jeremy Sumpter is the quintessential Peter Pan. His facial features, his body language, his vocal inflections, all were spot-on in my humble opinion. Oh, and my daughters think he's cute! But it is his bravado, tempered with his boyish charm, that gives the role a new ""feel"" that was always lacking in past renditions of the tale of Peter Pan. He looks as though he is having a great time playing the part, and his delight at being the boy who never has to grow up leaps off the screen and envelopes the audience. Jason Isaacs is also very good as Captain Hook, menacing but slightly charming in a strange sort of way. Rachel Hurd-Wood is fine too, as Wendy. She has a sweetness about her that plays well off of Jeremy/Peter. All in all, this is a fun and beautiful version of Peter Pan, one that I will definitely add to my family's DVD collection as soon as it comes out. In the meantime, I just might have to take my daughters back to see it again at the theater. Yes, it's that good!",Peter Pan
214,prairiedog5413,An unforgettable version of a timeless story ...,10,22 February 2004,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS, BUT PROBABLY NOT**I've never seen a movie quite like this one.  It's a 100 year-old, live-action, big-budget ($100 million) fairytale that makes no attempt to pander to a mass audience in the name of financial success.  On one level it's just a children's story, beautifully told.  But it's more than that - much more.It's about family, sacrifice, responsibility; the joys of childhood and the inevitability of leaving it behind; generational conflict, aging and loneliness; and the wonder, confusion, exhilaration and excitement of first love.  It's a complex tale with elements of Greek mythology and Freudian psychology, but also a simple story of good versus evil.At the ripe old age of 12 or so, Wendy Darling, who lives in Victorian London, is informed that it's time she became a young lady.  She is displeased, and ends up flying off to Neverland with Peter Pan and her brothers,  just like in the stories she tells them each evening (no electronic entertainment back then).  In Neverland there are Indians and pirates and mermaids and the Lost Boys.  There are fairies and castles and forests and the evil Captain James Hook.  There is danger and adventure and yes, even romance.  Of course, this is all really just Wendy's dream, isn't it?The movie is beautiful to look at, and the orchestral score is just right. And then there's the cast ... ohh, the cast.  Lynn Redgrave as Aunt Millicent is a scream (what WAS that book she was reading when Peter returned for his shadow?). Olivia Williams is a beautiful and touching Mrs. Darling. Richard Briers as Hook's right-hand man Smee (oops ... can Hook have one of those?) is very funny.  Wendy's brothers, Tiger Lily, and the Lost Boys as a group are both hilarious and endearing.  Ludivine Sagnier as Tink was appropriately jealous and naughty.  Have I forgotten anybody? Hmmm... oh, of course!Jason Isaacs is great as the unassertive Mr. Darling, and just out-of-this-world as the evil, dashing, depraved, pathetic and manipulative Captain James Hook.  This IS a children's movie, and Isaacs walks a fine line perfectly.  And he can play the harpsichord with a hand and a hook! Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy and Jeremy Sumpter as Peter are, well, ... amazing.  It's truly a beautiful  thing to watch them interact, and it's tough not to love them both before it's over.  Together they embark on a little dance of internal discovery that is funny, cute, heartbreaking and ultimately life-affirming.There are lots of terrific special effects, but the goal isn't Lord-of-the-Rings-type realism.  The fairytale has jumped off the pages of a lushly illustrated book, and we are there.  With a sprinkling of fairy dust together with happy thoughts, we can fly (and LIKE it!).Finally, some parting thoughts.  Except for Jeremy Sumpter as Peter, the cast is British and Australian, and they very much sound like it, so Americans may have to listen extra closely (I might just be getting old). Having a look at the book ""Peter and Wendy"" by J.M. Barrie (Peter Pan's creator) can refresh your memory if you don't  know or have forgotten the story (like me).  To really enjoy the movie, it's best to let down your defenses and become a kid again for a bit.  In fact, if that idea is unappealing, you might want to pass on this film.  However, if you like it the first time you see it, you may well LOVE it the second time ...  and thank you director P.J. Hogan.Rating: 9 out of 10",Peter Pan
215,dianneiest,true to the book <3,8,23 January 2013,"the writers were true to the book. they made a few changes but for the most part they stuck to the book so well that I could tell what chapter they were on. they changed the ending tho, he never came back to get Wendy for spring cleaning and children chanted they believed in fairies instead of clapping other than those I didn't mind the changes so much. Overall...jolly well done :) none of the killings that take place in the book and movie are shown, there isn't more than a few scratches shown as far anyone getting hurt. Peter plays by the rules and always in good form although he never says the words ""bad form"" in the movie like he does in the book.",Peter Pan

There is more fighting, romance and adventure than you could possibly have imagined, and Peter has much more depth to him than you might think. Jason Isaacs is incredible as Captain Hook (who would expect anything less from such a dude), Jeremy Sumpter is amazing as Peter(not to mention gorgeous!) and Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy was so good you would never have thought she was picked from an open audition.

That main theme has never been the main themem in past attempts. It's always been flying and revolved around Peter, yet, this time we learn more and go much deeper into Wendy and Captain Hook. We finally see that Wendy is a real person and not a perfect angel all the time. She can also do more for herself like swordfight and stuff. She doesn't always cry for Peter for help, she can do it herself! That's awesome! We also finally see the main theme come up of Wendy not wanting to grow up! It put a totally different spin on the character and it was a good one.Peter is finally put into perspective as a cheeky little boy! The young, swordfighting, pirate killing flyer is finally played and written well!",Peter Pan
218,danaaki_99,Very good film,8,27 June 2014,"Peter Pan is an adventure film that appeals to all age groups. It combines fantasy and romance at the same time. The Darling family children receive an unexpected visit from Peter Pan, who is a kid that will never grow up. He decides to take the children to Neverland, a place where kids can live without the authority of their parents. In this place, many weird creatures appear such as mermaid, fairies and of course, pirates.I would definitely recommend this film for many reasons. Firstly, Jeremy Sumpter's performance was great, considering the fact that he was a fourteen-year old boy. The costumes were really imaginative. What i liked the most was Jason Isaacs' acting. He was able to play a kind ad lovable Mr.Darling, then changed into a completely different role, the fearsome Hook. The only thing that could be better was the special effects. Fans of adventure and fantasy films will love it. Peter Pan combines good performances and extraordinary costumes. It's a film that should not be missed.",Peter Pan
219,tardisbond1250,Peter Pan(2003),10,5 January 2014,"So another Peter Pan film, this will be interesting. I think is fair to say that this film surprised a lot of people,myself included there. First of all let's get the plot out of the way. Wendy is a girl who is told to grow up but feels that she doesn't want to. Then one night a boy named Peter Pan comes to her window and whisks her and her brothers away on a magical adventure in Neverland.Okay, PJ Hogan's version of Peter Pan released in 2003. I can honestly say that this film is wonderful. It is truly amazing. I was unbelievably surprised. When I was a kid I just saw it as another Peter Pan film, however when I revisited this a few years back I realised just how amazing this film is. First of all the story is an absolute classic and this film executes it really well. I thought the acting in this film was astonishing. The standouts are Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook and Mr Darling who portrays both roles with real fines and this proves to be some of his best work to date. Also making her acting debut as Wendy Darling Rachael Hurd-Wood is terrific and really invests herself into the character of Wendy both physically and emotionally. John and Michael are fine as are the lost boys all providing some comedic moments without being annoying. Ludivine Sagnier as Tinkerbell is really good and gives off a good performance. Smee is funny providing some fantastically funny moments that will make both adults and kids laugh. And of course, Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan. He is a pretty solid Peter. Though it is kind of breaking tradition having Peter cast as an American(not trying to sound racist) it would have been better if they cast a British boy actor or had Sumpter doing a British accent. What really makes this film work is the emotion that is invested into it. I really admire the direction taken here. The first 15-20 minutes are spent with The Darling Family alone showing Wendy's childish actions and behaviour leading the family's reputation downhill and causing more dysfunction. The scene where Mr Darling chucks Nanna the dog outside proves just how tightly the family are all holding together.I think that it is great to get to know the darling family first rather than jumping straight in with Peter. Also I really like how Wendy's character changes and matures over the course of the film. During th beginning Wendy is a child, during the middle she's kind of a teenager and at the end she's almost become a young woman. This proves to be very strong character development partly because of Rachael Hurd-Wood's strong performance. Also the action scenes, well the 2 action scenes of this film are choreographed exceptionally well. The Black Castle segment is the darkest part of the film, providing some thrilling action but also some fantastic comedy from John, Michael and Smee. And the climax is gripping and the duel between Peter and Hook is well done. I love how Hook taunts Peter about Wendy to bring him down. There were 2 ""surprise"" scenes in this film. The first was the dancing scene between Peter and Wendy. Which is accompanied by James Newton Howard's beautiful soundtrack. This scene was very sweet and touching. And the 2nd was the kiss scene at the end between Peter and Wendy which just shows how much he means to her and how much Wendy has grown up in the space of the entire film. Also I love Newton Howard's score for the film, he really captures the sheer emotion of the characters and the tenseness of the action scenes and the heroism of Peter and Neverland, a masterpiece of a soundtrack. Overall this ""Peter Pan"", is a triumph with fantastic acting, fantastic character development, great visuals, great comedy, amazing soundtrack, astonishing acting, well executed story. This version works because the sexual tension doesn't make the film detract from its target audience, it only enhances the main message of the story. ""everyone grows up, and at that age boys and girls become interested in each other and its natural, you can't get away from it.This is a 10 out of 10. What a fabulous film. My favourite childhood movie ever.",Peter Pan
220,little_digger,best film,10,6 June 2005,"This has got to be one of my favourite movies of all time, the story stays true to J.M Barrie's original piece as I'm reading it at the moment, feelings are portrayed so much better and imagination is the key to this successful book and Initiative skills for this amazing and fun film for all ages. The film is a lot darker than any of its Predecessors, and the character of peter played by the much loved (by me) Jeremy Sumpter made an excellent performance as the young boy who never wants to grow up. His boyish manner is superb yet the love you feel he shares for Wendy is beautiful and innocent, though the wonder of his being makes him unable to love. P.J Hogan made a brilliant discovery in Rachel Hurd-Wood, she portrays the character of Wendy to the tee and other characters including Jason Isaacs who comes back from being the evil Mr Malfoy from Harry potter films to play the much loved character of Mr darling a very shy man who likes to make good conversation was a brilliant role for him to play. Olivia Williams as Mrs Darling portrays a beautiful and colourful character who though a very kind and caring mother has a sort of dream like personality, where she is often living in some sort of fairytale world like Neverland. Ludvine Sagneir's part as Tinkerbell put a well balanced comical side to the darkness of the evil captain hook who funnily enough is also played by Jason Isaacs, though hook is evil and complicated, Jason plays him in a comical way that is very entertaining to watch and not so hard on the younger kids watching. All the pirates though menacing as they are, are funny and put a light touch to the evil on board the jolly Rodger. The soundtrack produced by James Newton Howard is Phenomenal and it plays such a significant part in the movie. all in all Peter pan is a must see film for the whole family to enjoy and such actors and actresses as Harry Newell as John darling, Freddie Popplewell as Michael darling, Carsen grey as tiger Lilly and actors like Theodore Chester in his role as slightly one of the lost boys, these parts played so well by such children as young as 9 years old is a brilliant breakthrough for wannabe actors and actresses. well done P.J Hogan you've got a fan in me and have also inspired me to read the much loved classic. Disney eat your heart out.",Peter Pan
221,shannonkellymcelroy,A perfectly retold Classic elegantly put together for children and adults alike,9,8 May 2020,"Peter pan has always intrigued me with it's themes of Youth vs Adulthood, Magic vs Reality and Hope vs Despair. Yet as Classic as the Disney Version is, it failed to address the darker sides of the story in order to keep with the Disney philosophy. This version is different. The screenplay and editing fully embrace both the beauty and the horrors that come with a story involving sword fights, kidnapping, attempted murder, and emerging sexuality. Even more important the movie understands that while eternal youth and innocence may seem like a dream come true, it comes at a heavy price of arrogance, anger, violence and worst of all loneliness. But even more important are the actors chosen to depict this environment and its inhabitants. The child actors all perfectly capture what it feels like to be footloose and fancy free which builds into the timelessness of the story itself. The movie expertly tells the story from Wendy Darling's point of view, as Wendy is the true heroine of the story. Wendy herself has always been my favorite character and Rachel-Hurd Wood did a wonderful job conveying the nuances of the character; she embraces both her adventurous spirit and her emerging maturity and reflective wisdom that many pre-teen girls feel caught between. Like Wendy , as a child I often felt caught between wanting to preserve my imaginative spirit despite everyone else's expectations, and Wendy's refusal to be anything but herself is an inspiration to people of all ages. Jeremy Sumpter is just as memorable as Peter, as he captures both his emotional highs and lows, one minute he could be eagerly slashing at pirates, then next he's falling into despair at the thought of being left behind and forgotten by Wendy as she starts to realize he can't give her the mature love and acknowledgment she needs. From what I've heard Jeremy Sumpter was the one who ensured Rachel's casting after meeting her at the audition and instantly bonding with her. As endearing as their romance is however, both the story and the characters acknowledge that in the end, as fun and carefree childhood is, there are important benefits to adulthood which leave us better than we could ever be as children. For as JM Barrie said, ""All Children grow up, except one.""",Peter Pan
222,angelfrye,Wonderful,10,13 July 2004,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. This is an absolutely beautiful movie, one that I could watch again and again. Pan is perfect and he makes you fall in love with him, wanting to be Wendy so you can fly off to Neverland at the same time you want so badly for there to be a happy ending for the duo. If I was a twelve year-old girl, I would absolutely be in love! This is the best Pan movie I have ever seen. The cinematography is fabulous, the Neverland created is fantastical, and Hook is absolutely marvelous! I loved to dislike him! There is just something about this movie that pulled me in and, though I was at home in my chair watching, my heart was in Neverland, soaring along with Peter and Wendy, fighting the Pirates, and avoiding the wrath of Tink. I have no more words to say than beautiful, wonderful, fantastic.",Peter Pan
223,ZacharyLovesYou,All children grow up... Except one.,9,16 February 2007,"The revised telling of Peter Pan is quite a breath of fresh air. This particular adaptation places the story of Pan in more or less the realms of reality. Gone are the cheerful Disney songs and cute costumes so memorable to those familiar with the story.However, this is not by any means a bad thing.Everything about the movie has been realized in a way that would make JM Barrie proud. From the first time you see Peter's leaf clothing, to the vivid forests of the Neverland.Not only is the aesthetic based in reality, but so are the characters. Past versions of the story have shown what fun Peter has as the boy who is to never grow up. What is so interesting about this movie, is the exploration of the tragedy that must also come with being Peter Pan. There is such a strong sense of Peter's affection for Wendy, you find glimpses throughout the movie where you can see Peter contemplating if it would be worth leaving his world to grow, and have a life with her. This also adds to the movies charm; creating such an emotional relationship with you and Peter.However, one of the best (if not THE best) character in the movie is Wendy. Hurd-Wood is perfect to play the role. She's brave and daring, but vulnerable. Her acting ability is the icing on the cake when it comes to her relationship with Peter. Not only is it believable, but you often find yourself cheering her on, hoping that she might convince Peter that there is more to life than being a child.From the cast, to the settings, to the musical score, Peter Pan triumphs in telling the most true-to-original tale of the boy who would not grow up.",Peter Pan
224,AllisonMendoza,An excellent adaptation of the original Barrie book,9,1 July 2019,"JM Barrie's 1911 novel is one of my all-time favorite books, and this is the film adaptation that most closely captures the whimsy, darkness, magic, and sadness of the original.As much as I enjoy the slapstick-y Disney cartoon, this is the version with all the heart and wonder. From brilliant performances by Jason Isaacs as the haunted Captain Hook and Bob Hoskins as the cluelessly wicked Mr. Smee (reprising the role after playing it several years earlier in Speilberg's ""Hook""), to the good-for-their-time Neverland visuals, it's a wonderful work of art. Tinkerbell is just as feisty and spiteful as in the book, and the crocodile (a clear metaphor for time creeping up on you) is appropriately scary.This is my favorite adaptation of a favorite book. If you're a fan of the original like me, you should enjoy this version too.",Peter Pan
225,tmjackyl-1,Do you believe?,10,25 December 2003,"Absolutely, without a doubt, I believe.About an hour has past since I left the movie theater with my five year old daughter, and my heart still has not slowed down and my mind continues to race. I cannot put into words, just yet, what this movie has done to me. Perhaps by the end of this review, I might start making sense.
Wondrous, magical, jaw dropping, romantic, inspirational, heart warming, bewitching, extraordinary, exquisite...Okay, enough babbling. Did I mention jaw dropping? Yes, I think I did.Not in the last ten years have I enjoyed a movie as thoroughly as ""Peter Pan"". From the first second through the last credit, my eyes were as wide as full moons, my heart was beating like a race horse, and my mind was as stupefied as a year old baby watching the flickering of their birthday candles. I felt like my mother was reading to me the J.M. Barrie book and I was 7 years old again. I do believe. I believe in fairies. I believe that dragons can raze a city. I believe that a witch can cast a spell and put an entire kingdom to sleep. And I believe that a kiss can cure everything. I believe in fairy tales.I've seen Spielberg's ""Hook"" and the Disney version, but they never struck me as something to believe in. Merely stories. I've seen most ""kids"" movies with my daughter, and they have always been so pandering and inane, never giving children (or their parents) the credit they deserve. To say that this movie caters to both parents and children is to completely miss the point. This movie doesn't cater to anyone. No one. It tells a timeless tale of innocence that every single person on Earth has experienced, but somehow misplaced. They haven't forgotten it, just misplaced it. The feeling of a first love is universal. Men, women, black, white, popular, unpopular, smart, not- so -smart, liked, and unliked KNOW this feeling. It can never be taken away. But it can be misplaced for a short while. Experiences like J.M. Barrie's ""Peter Pan"" will open the curtains to your soul and shine the light on that moment that you think you've lost. The moment that some might actually believe never happened.I had stopped believing years ago. Before my child was born. Before my marriage ended. Before it even started. I don't know exactly when, but it's been awhile.But now, I am 7 years old again. And I believe.",Peter Pan

I saw it in play form and in movie form through the years and was always only mildly pleased. I could not have put a specific reason down for this until I saw this movie.Peter Pan lives, he really can fly and he's a REAL boy.Peter is a youngish teenage boy who has been played by much older women my whole life so what a marvelous stroke of genius it was to cast a 14 yo boy to play him. This is the story I would have liked to have seen first, this is the story of a boy becoming a young man who has rejected the troubles of this world, this is the story of 'the Pan'.thr",Peter Pan

230,lei3,An AWESOME adaptation!,9,27 September 2009,"I grew up watching Disney's 1953 version of Peter Pan and I loved it. The story of Peter Pan brings back a lot of memories for me, and I know I would have loved P.J. Hogan's version as a kid.This particular version of Peter Pan came out when I was in high school and (I'll admit it up front) I didn't go see it when it first came out. In fact, it took me a few years before I actually sat down and watched the entire film. When I finally did, I was AMAZED at its complexity and imagery! What had taken me so long?! I think the coolest part of this version is that it REALLY delivers when it comes to the fear we've all had about becoming adults. Most of us can look back on our childhood and realize we had no huge responsibilities, no real worries, and we look back on those days with a kind of sad fondness to how simple life used to be - and we didn't even realize it.Wendy Darling is on the brink of womanhood and is fighting it with all her might. She wants to please both her parents (especially her stuffy father), but feels she is too young to give up her childhood ideals and stories. Peter Pan offers her and her brothers, John and Michael, a chance to come live in Neverland with him and the Lost Boys (who btw are all adorable in this film). Jason Isaacs is hands down the best Captain Hook that's ever been done, and the relationship complexities between Wendy, Peter, and Hook is fascinating! All the acting was extremely well done.As far as the so called ""sexual tension"" of the film goes, I didn't look at it like that. Peter and Wendy may have a little crush going on, but that all stems back to growing up, falling in love, and (ultimately) getting married. Peter cannot grow up and never will. He won't ever be able to experience that kind of emotion, while Wendy realizes that she WANTS to.As far as Wendy and Hook go, I looked at it as a mirror image of the strained relationship Wendy had with her father. Call it an Electra complex if you want, but I didn't completely see it that way...Another amazing thing about this version is the musical score. Its PERFECT. I can't even describe it in words, but it captures every moment as it should. The costumes and the scenery are also beautiful. This film touched me, and I don't say that lightly. It brought me back to when I loved this story in childhood and makes me want to be young again. Its amazing in a way, and sad in another. If you love the timeless story of Peter Pan, you need to see this movie.",Peter Pan
231,Alleyshy,Instant Favorite-the same league as The NeverEnding Story & Harry Potter,10,29 December 2003,"I went into this movie with high expectations. Peter Pan did NOT disappoint. There are such differences between this film and the Disney classic, as well as the Mary Martin version. These differences are beyond good. Peter Pan is a family film that takes itself seriously. We explore Peters feelings, why he does not want to feel them, and how part of him wants to stay with Wendy in the end. For the first time, we see a more graphic side of Hook (Hook without his hook), as well as a softer side. Hook is also a man who has feelings and wants to be loved. The character of Wendy gets to show us that she is starting to grow up quickly. She has all of these emotions bottled up inside (love, adventure etc.) but doesnt know what to do with them. Also for the first time, Wendy shows that she can handle herself in a fight against pirates. This film has a lot more action than the other two popular versions. The action is great. Little bit of stabbing, scratching, cutting, bleeding but nothing too graphic. We are also able to relate to the movie SO much better when the character of Peter is actually played by a little boy. Jeremy Sumpter was perfect in the film and the fact that he had such a young, little boy face whose voice was still soft made his character even more interesting. The ONLY complaint that I have is that I wish the film stayed with the mermaids a little bit longer. I was expecting to see their fins and see them screw with Wendy a little bit. But what you see in the trailer is what you see on the big screen. Other than that, the acting was PERFECT, the script was PERFECT, the set direction was PERFECT etc. This film is damn near PERFECT.            10/10",Peter Pan

It does infringe a bit with the beginning, but still remains the most faithful of all Peter Pan movies.

The movie was breath-taking and I wouldn't change a thing about it. I loved it and recommend it highly for children and adults, alike.Everyone who knows the story of Peter Pan was probably first introduced to it - visually - by Walt Disney and the amazing animated rendition. I feel that P.J. Hogan really did an excellent job at presenting the well-known tale in a new light. Many things in the story were presented the same but it was the manner and the light in which they were revealed that really fashioned the stunning images.",Peter Pan

237,generallyamusing,Wonderful movie,10,8 November 2004,"Thought the movie was excellent!! The imagery was wonderful and the acting was brilliant. It was a cast of virtual unknowns to play much of the characters and they performed great. It was quite a change to see the darker side of the story- much more enlivening. Maybe not something for those 5 or younger, but I'm 31 and caught myself watching it twice just the other day.Such a change from all the other Pan movies lately. I think Hook ruined the story for me for a long time (what a horrid movie). I think that if you want to humanize peter pan than this is the movie to see.

The colors in this film are awesome, and the flying amazing. It is quite well cast, with truly inspired performances by both Jeremy Sumpter (Peter) and Jason Isaacs (Hook/Mr. Darling). Jeremy especially is such an engaging Peter-- sly, clever, witty and charming. His performance is so full of life, you really do believe he can fly! The emotion and feelings between Peter and Wendy are finally explored in this re-telling, and add to the story, making it feel complete this time around, whole and well rounded, as if past renditions of the story (stage and screen) left out the most important part.

241,haleyeah,A pleasure to watch.,10,23 January 2004,"*POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*
Peter Pan is absolutely my favorite fairy tale, and it was amazing seeing it come to the screen! I had often been disappointed that this amazing story had not come to life with a teenage boy as Peter, in a non-animated film. When I heard that they were coming out with it this way, I was extremely looking forward to it. And believe me, I was not disappointed. Jeremy Sumpter played the perfect Peter, and I don't think anyone could have been better for the part. The messy, curly, reddish-brown hair, the sparkling blue eyes, the cocky nature, everything about his appearance and personality was to the T as how I imagined it. Wonderful. Though he was definitely the highlight of the show for me, the other actors were also well-fit for their roles. You could hardly tell that it was Rachel Hurd- Wood's(Wendy) first role in a movie, she was astounding. And Jason Isaacs pulled off another great performance as Captain Jas. Hook. Everything from the coloring and atmosphere of Neverland, to the hilarious, well-meaning Lost Boys was perfect. They put just the kind of humor in the movie that J.M. Barrie had in his book, without losing the sentimental, life- changing message the story held: We must all grow up. Most movies like this have to end happily for the audience to enjoy it, but I thoroughly did, even though the ending was quite sad. The portrayal of the pirates as stupid, clumsy beings was pulled off very well, without making it look too fake. And I have to say that Richard Briers played an amazing Smee, bringing out the bo'sun's desired to please his captain, but also his softhearted nature as well. *Spoiler Warning* Half of the movie had lines straight from the book, making it impossible for viewers to say that J.M. Barrie would have anything against it. The acting in the end fight with Captain Hook, where Hook tries to psyche Peter out by telling him Wendy didn't love him was amazing. Tears were literally standing out in my eyes, and my heart was heavy for Peter as he lost his joy and began to sink. All in all, I believe this movie was the perfect portrayal of the book. The acting, the cinematography, and the characters were put together exactly how I imagined, even better. And I have never enjoyed watching a film so much as I did with this one. I would definitely have to say it's right up there with Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King as best film of 2003.",Peter Pan
242,chewsock,Magical,10,28 December 2003,"I've seen this film twice, and it still has not lost its magic.  It stays somewhat true to the original, and is full of wit.

245,ramacdo0,Dismal,1,1 March 2004,"I went to see this movie in the hope that it would be like the 1953 classic. I was wrong. This movie is awful, its terribly acted, terribly scripted and terribly vulgar. Jeremy Sumpter (Peter Pan) is often inaudible. Whos lame idea was it to make someone with a speech impediment Peter Pan. He seems terrified by the camera, and looks as if he struggles to remember his lines. Jason Isaacs (Hook) leaves little impression, his performance lacked passion and is like a majorly reduced version of his Harry Potter character. The script is rushed and ill-thought out.In the original story, the part about Peters mischievous shadow was a great bit. In this film the problem of the shadow is covered in seconds, badly. This was one of the many rushed pieces in the film. This was allegedly a kids film, well it isn't. Nudity is regularly featured in the film. Seeing young boys nude and close to young girls on their beds, is something nobody wants to see. I left the theatre missing my past 2 hours, you leave wanting to see peter pan. This movie wasnt peter pan, it was a rapid skim over JM Barries' book.

The cast was wonderful (and beautiful) and fit each part to a ""T"". Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood have chemistry on-screen that makes the audience blush. Jason Isaacs is incredible and shows his versatility from beginning to end. The visual effects lean towards surrealism/fantasy, but that is Never Land and how it is meant to be. Coming from a long time Peter Pan fan; if you have any faith in J.M. Barrie's Tale, you will not walk out of this film disappointed.  Instead of all the (seemingly popular) films out lately that are engulfed in tragedy and darkness, Peter Pan will leave a smile on your face and give you something to talk about and believe in for time to come.

All in all it was very good. I thought the actors/actresses did a very good job and i don't understand why it wasn't in theaters longer then it has been. i  would recommend this to anyone who enjoys adventure movies.  i thought it was classical in the I do believe in faires I do I do scene. although the only scene i didn't like was the nudity of John and Michaels butt.

251,Staritza,A great film with great settings and cinematography. The one Peter Pan film yet that truly brought J.M. Barrie's masterpiece to life.,8,5 July 2004,"I first watched this movie, expecting it to be much like the Disney cartoon film, only with greater settings...and a much cuter Peter(ü) but I was proven wrong after watching it. PP03 definitely topples the Disney version off the throne. Yes, the Disney film is a classic, it is one of my favorites...but now watching PP03 and bein older than I was when I first heard of peter, the boy who flew and never grew up...has put the entire world of neverland in greater perspective, one with more colors, more depth to the story...in all its ambiguity and this film really does love its characters.The Disney version was sweet and charming, this was too. Though, with PP03, the entire package is better...one with greater action, the blatant and perennial darkness that is neverland (a side Disney could not have pulled off, be it that little kids are a bigger percent of their audience) is greatly conveyed here. Captain Hook isn't merely constantly and countlessly bugged off by Peter Pan...he too is menacing, with nearly (yes, nearly) every drop of his blood stained with utter evil. Ludivine Sagnier does a great job as Tinkerbell, at first I preferred a younger girl, but she really does grow on you. Her facial expressions are enough to spare her of actual words. All characters were brilliantly cast, Wendy and Captain Hook, to name a few. i wasn't completely sure if Jeremy Sumpter (half the reason why i watched this in the first place.ü) would be a good actor at first...but he IS peter pan. cocky smiles, cheeky smirks (üaawwwü) and all.I have learned to love this film. it is one of my favorites! My one complaint is the fact that they only bothered to show one of their many adventures. It was the same in the Barrie's book version, but making this movie could've been a great way to really stretch the picture of Neverland.I know and believe P.J. Hogan could've thought of great adventures if he wanted to.I am only 13 years old...and watching this film made me want to turn back time and stay being a mere 9 year old. Life was easier then, so free of worries, and full of playing. I watched this film countless times over my entire summer vacation, I too wanted to fly my way to Neverland and fight those ghastly pirates! And as school started, I dreaded it greatly knowing i had to go back. I knew i had to grow up, be 14,study and so on...This is without a doubt the perfect movie for everyone's inner child.",Peter Pan
252,socalledboothy,Really good movie,10,14 May 2005,"I think this was a very good movie. I don't understand why other people couldn't like it. Jeremy Sumpter (who plays Peter Pan) did a very good job, as did Rachel Hurd-Wood (as Wendy) and their chemistry on screen was excellent. The dialogue was really good (at times, yes, a bit weird) and the special effects were extremely well done.Obviously, this isn't a movie for little kids, but whatever. Yes, it's darker, but I believe that was the intent. I'm pretty sure it was probably mentioned in reviews that it was scarier and darker, heck, it was rated PG. It'd be better for the parents if you checked out the reviews and such BEFORE you go see it. This is not the director's fault or whatever; it's totally yours.Anyway, some say Peter's costume was bad considering he's pretty young, but I think it fits Peter's character well and seems how I would picture it. I enjoyed many of the things here.Someone said that Hook just ""randomly"" started killing off his crew. He did that for a reason: they were siding with Wendy when she told her story. I'm watching this movie as I write this. It was very interesting and I'm really glad I was able to watch it. Best two hours I've spent doing anything (well, maybe not the BEST, but at least I didn't regret it, unlike others who apparently are too set in their ways to see a little CHANGE happen to their ""precious"" storyline). I've seen both the original Disney version and the Hook movie and I'm glad the director took a different turn with this movie to distinguish it from the other incarnations.Casting was incredible with this movie, especially with Jeremy Sumpter (can we say HOTTIE?!). Everyone matched their characters well and did a great job acting them out.And I don't care about Hook flying. Whatever; it's not THAT big a deal. It's a movie, pure entertainment. Try not to think about it too much and maybe just maybe, you'll see the movie for what it is: a greatly acted, well written movie.",Peter Pan
253,dailyplanet,It's a powerful thing.,8,16 August 2004,"'Peter Pan' is a classic children's story full of disquieting implications. Masterfully conceptualized, it is a visually splendid retelling of James M. Barrie's fantasy story of what happens when a boy who refuses to grow up meets a girl who must.Director P.J. Hogan gives us a film that plays like live action in a series of stylized paintings. Like a storybook illustrated by artist Maxfield Parrish, this is a deftly crafted, sumptuous experience. The 100-year-old tale tracks over familiar ground yet seems totally fresh  a wonderfully off-kilter recounting of a young girl's coming of age, told with compassion, style and grace.As Peter Pan, Jeremy Sumpter is believable as a selfish child trapped in the never-ending exuberance of youth.. Pan's very name reflects his feral nature and rebellion against convention. When he meets the beautiful Wendy, played by Rachel Hurd-Wood, a child about to transition into womanhood, their interaction is electric  and ultimately heart-wrenching. The way Peter looks at her is considerably more telling than his spoken words.Although the worlds of Peter and Wendy are incompatible, each represents the other's deepest longing. Peter is adventure and childlike wonder; Wendy is warmth, love and family. Much as they are drawn to each other, to stay together one of them must make an unacceptable sacrifice. Wendy explores the Other Side, only to realize her dream is out there but unattainable. She must put it away in a drawer, which is what happens when she saves Peter with a kiss. 'I'm sorry I must grow up,' she tells him.It's significant that Hook and the pirates of Neverland were central characters in Wendy's stories before Peter Pan showed up. Captain Hook is Peter's alter ego. He is trapped in Neverland because he has completely forgotten what it was to be a child and thus is unable to find any joy. For him the ticking clock inside the crocodile is time passing, and time zeroes in on him because he is the only one obsessed with it.In Barrie's story, this is a turning point in Wendy's life, and she needs to witness both character extremes  Pan and Hook  to find a middle path. She eventually realizes Hook is a disappointment but Peter is no better. She may love Peter Pan but he will never give up his heart. He doesn't understand what love means. 'Go home,' he tells her, 'and take your feelings with you.'My personal theory is that Peter Pan is dead -- he's the only one in Neverland who not alive and probably has been in this nether world a very long time, In Barrie's book, Peter's memory lapses and need to play pretend games is pathological. More likely, his life is over and this is the only semblance of reality left for him. Peter has chosen his state of denial, yet deep in his heart he senses the truth: On this fantastic journey only Wendy, her brothers and the Lost Boys have a return option.",Peter Pan
254,neospawn-1,...Under age hitting on?,6,7 October 2004,"Oks well I remember the old Peter Pan and all, this is nothing like it. The girl who plays Wendy....well she is really cute and all but like acting needs work. And these kids are like what 12, 13 why in the world is Wendy wanting to kiss this boy after 5 mins of meeting him! My god i never get that kind of luck. Hehehe =^_^= And she becomes a mother and all to the Lost Boys, well that did happen but not in that way that they show it in the movie.Honestly I gave it a 6 because I know young kids would like it but me being 20 and all, well it doesn't remind me of the original. The movie was moving in such a way that it was really odd, like the scene would suddenly jump. Why I don't know they did this but here is an example. The boys build a house around Wendy, they could of showed them at least getting stuff together. And I would like to hire them for some housing jobs!Ludivine Sagnier is attractive and all, but like what's with the typical blond act and all?

It was great that the actors knew what they were doing. Jeremy Sumpter did a superb job as the role of Peter. Jason Isaacs was perfect as Hook. I have like Jason Isaacs ever since i saw him in ""Harry Potter."" My favorite part was the end when Hook and Peter Pan are fighting, Peter falls, and Wendy kisses him. (I went green with envy.) If you have never seen this movie, I strongly advise you to do so as quickly as possible. I also loved the music. I want the soundtrack so badly.

Of course we all know the story of Peter Pan, a boy who didn't want to grow up. He befriends the Darling children and shows them the magic of Never Never Land. The troupe meets up with the loving lost boys and the daring Pirates, especially Captain Hook. This specific movie of the loved classic shows people the romantic bond between Peter and Wendy and even the emotional side of Hook. Every character is portrayed well, even the little Pixie, Tinker Bell. I give this story a 10 because there are no flaws and I smiled the whole way through. I do believe in fairies. I do I do.",Peter Pan

Her facial expressions seemed to really show me the feeling within the movie. Jason Issac's two characters were good. You would have never thought that he was Hook and Mr. Darling because of how well he acts and the different looks of the characters.The special effects made the movie.The flying and sets were excellent. The effects made the movie come to life. I believed that everything shown was truly there.In conclusion, the movie was excellent. Every aspect made it. I would recommend it to others.",Peter Pan
258,HermioneSnape,"One of the most magical, beautiful, and touching films I've ever seen...",10,30 December 2004,"From the moment when I saw the first preview for this movie in the theaters, I was completely captivated. I've always loved the story of Peter Pan; I grew up watching the Disney and Mary Martin versions, and always thought the story to be one of undeniable power and beauty. When the film was released, I went to see it with my family, and was overwhelmed. I laughed, gasped, and cried, and the movie had my complete and enthralled attention from the opening notes of James Newton Howard's equally magical score through the end credits.The actors and actresses for this film are all superb, Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy and Jason Isaacs doubling as Captain James Hook and George Darling being the obvious and inarguable standouts. Miss Hurd-Wood perfectly captures the spirit of Wendy--maternal, precocious, brave, loving, and loyal--and Mr. Isaacs is endearing as Mr. Darling and both fearsome and deliciously erotic as Captain Hook.Jeremy Sumpter also did a fabulous job as the title character, Peter Pan, and I thoroughly disagree with those who proclaim his performance as ""wooden""; in my opinion, he captured Pan's eternally childlike spirit perfectly, and the chemistry between him and Miss Hurd-Wood was very real and something that was sadly missing from both the Disney-fied version and the stage versions which have cast women in the role of Peter.The Lost Boys were all brilliant, and worked together and with Mr. Sumpter comfortably to create a believable and familiar little family. The pirates were, of course, delightfully evil, and Richard Briers as Smee served often for comic relief, even as Hook thoughtlessly shot down crew members left and right. The lovely and gentle Olivia Williams was a wonderful Mrs. Mary Darling, and her exchanges with Mr. Isaacs as Mr. Darling were believably loving.James Newton Howard did a wonderful job with the musical score for this film, completely capturing with both adult and children choirs, lilting woodwinds and strings, synthesizers, menacing and heroic brass, and magical bells, the spirit of Neverland and of Peter--mysterious, enchanting, innocent, with an undercurrent of darkness just beneath the surface that erupts full-force when Captain Hook is on the screen. I would rate the soundtrack a triumphant 10 out of 10 stars.Everything fit together perfectly, in my mind, to bring forth to the masses a faithful and touching version of the classic story--I left the theater feeling profoundly moved and thoroughly enchanted anew with the story I had known since childhood. Every time I watch this film or listen to the soundtrack, I am haunted by its magical power for days afterward. I love this film dearly, and offer my thanks and praise to its cast and crew. A perfect 10.",Peter Pan
259,spiral_blast,Not your ordinary Hollywood flick,10,16 June 2005,"Frankly, I was never much of a fan of the Peter Pan story. The idea of a leaf-covered flying child plucking children away from their nursery seems a little far-fetched to say the least. But this Dreamworks production will blow you away.The movie's immense charm lies in its unpretentious and faithful manner of retelling an old but familiar reverie. Peter Pan gently takes you on a flight of fantasy, reliving those precious memories you thought were long buried beneath the sands of Time. Its depiction of the stronghold of nursery rhymes and bedtime stories is almost magical. As the story goes, Wendy Darling is soon turning 13 and fears the transition from childhood to adulthood. Along comes Peter Pan who whisks her and her brothers to Neverland where children never grow up and the only evil to fight is a bunch of dim-witted pirates (adults, of course). There, they have their adventure, defeat the pirates and return home. Sounds like a like a simple trip to Nirvana and back, right? Perhaps; the idea of flying off into the night without a care in the world is no doubt an alluring one. It's the stuff childhood dreams are made of.Incredible charms aside, Peter Pan does so much more than merely skim the surface of blissful waters; it plunges the depths and explores themes that will hit you like a brick --of reality-- in the face. It's a story of our fears, courage, imagination, understanding and acceptance.Wendy was daunted by the prospect of growing into the adult world where unknown evils seemed to lurk in every corner. It was, after all, unfamiliar territory compared to the comfortable nursery where she had spent all her life thus far. So flying off to Neverland and staying there for good seemed a great idea. And why not, with pink cotton candy-like clouds, a sprawling jungle, mermaids (albeit nasty ones), pirates to trample over and a vast, endless sea without a matrimonial/ patrimonial figure in sight? But as Wendy slowly discovered, there is no absolute bliss, no Nirvana-- even if you had your greatest fears removed. A world without parents to guide and care for them is decidedly wrong, just as a world without dreams and fantasies would be starkly void of wonders.To live like the timeless Peter Pan would be to escape the bonds of reality while tying yourself down by another set of chains-- that of our own imagination and cowardice. Oh, I'm not saying that Peter Pan is a coward. But Captain Hook couldn't have been more right in his life when he called him ""a tragedy"". Peter Pan, for all his legendary adventures and triumphs over sniveling pirates, could not conquer his one fear of the real world. And that inability to accept ""growing up"" as part of his life is what made him ""incomplete"", to paraphrase Wendy. His self-denial and insecurity was ever so lucid when he said, ""I taught you to fly, to fight with swords... isn't that enough? What more can there be?"". Apparently, his Utopia is one where we will never have to be burdened with heavy issues, like ""feelings"". But Wendy's reply must've sunk it in for him: ""I don't know... perhaps it becomes clearer when we grow up."" So it looks like if we wanted to enjoy life to the brim and experience all that Life had to offer, we'd have to take the plunge and accept growth and change. Otherwise, some things will forever be a mystery to us. And truly, for all his joys in Neverland, Peter Pan was to be forever barred from having the love and care of a family because he chose to live in an adult-less ""reality"". Upon retrospect, is that price any smaller than that which we have to pay for growing up? Really, in this world there is no complete answer to our problems; there is no perfect circle of happiness that can be drawn. What we do have is our imagination to help us get the most out of whatever we have, and pray that our courage and vivacity would be enough to fend off those unknown monsters of the night.The story of Peter Pan teaches us to understand the inevitability of the passage of Time, to accept the necessity of change, and finally, to embrace all that the world has to offer. All is not lost even as our childhood days pass into the faded pages of the calendar. Our dreams do not simply die when we take on the role of an adult; they are ours to keep and savor. Stepping into adulthood does not mean abandoning that child in you. In fact, you should cherish it all the more because it is you past; that which molded what you have become today. There is a fine line between being caught up in the moment of fantasy and learning to keep that fantasy as a part of you even as you're forced to step out of it.The Eternal Child was unable to conquer his worst enemy-- his own fears-- and was so condemned to never truly ""live"", sealing his fate as an evergreen legend of our fantasies.This is truly a film made from the heart-- stunning visuals, directing, music and acting. And for those who are looking for something more than just a few hours of entertainment, this movie gives you something to think hard over. The brilliance lasts long after you exit the cinema.",Peter Pan

However I do remember the saying it would be a credit to Barry and he would be proud. I found that the movie was fairly accurate, but I was disappointed. For those who read the original story and then saw the movie I think you might know what I mean. Mr. Darlining didn't stay in Nana's doghouse and the ending was different- they said it was the same as the novel. I do not know what version they read but it must not have been the original. Other than a few disappointing (deleted) scenes and changes I found the movie pleasing.

These days, it's hard to find a classic kids movie that originated from a good story, without all of the other modern junk. But ""Peter Pan"" was such a cool movie! And oh my goodness; Jeremy Sumpter is only the hottest guy around!(not to mention pretty good actor!) I wonder why I haven't really seen him in any other movies. Anyways, I really like this movie. It was so sweet. But I also think that there should not have been so much romance between Peter and Wendy in the movie, because it angered me in the end how they couldn't be together. I mean, why couldn't Peter just grow up? Oh well: I just hope P.J. Hogan makes a sequel or something, but Jeremy Sumpter might be too old by then to play the role. I still can't believe that he is like 16 or something now.",Peter Pan

Out of 1-10, this movie is a 9,999,999,999,999...etc. etc. Peter Pan (2003) has and outstanding cast, crew, and special effects. Jeremy Sumpter (A.K.A Peter Pan), makes my heart beat.

278,fliesbutterfly,"nice, fluffy entertainment",8,5 January 2004,"Peter Pan is a nice, cute movie that one watches and then forgets. It's visually stunning; it looks great all around. Although the special effects may seem quite fake, I think it adds a certain charm to the film. Peter Pan in general is quite ""cheesy"" in a way (no offence to those who disagree). Even though Peter Pan may seem like a child's movie, I doubt that children will find it as appealing as perhaps the teenagers and adults will. The puppy love romance between Peter and Wendy is pushed quite a bit, and I do admit that it bothered me. There were a few plot holes that seemed to disrupt the flow of things. The two main characters seemed less innocent than I would like. Rachel Hurd-Wood did a lovely job, but it seemed to me that she was more of an ""object of desire"" for Peter than simply a friend and motherly figure. Jeremy Sumpter was cute as Peter Pan. He was as cocky as you could possibly imagine. There's obviously chemistry between the two leads whether I'm referring to the characters or the actors. Overall, It was a lovely movie to watch, but it was fluffy and forgetful.",Peter Pan
279,silverchilla,Absolutely fantastic,10,27 December 2003,"This movie made me sooooooooo happy!  i have always loved the idea ofNeverland, because i don't want to grow up.  i always loved the originalanimated version and i just read the book a couple of months ago.  the moviewas better than i thought it would be and i had very high expectations for it. they followed the book pretty well and what they changed, i really liked. one of the things that they changed that i think was the best change they could have made was that they brought down the whole mother thing.  wendy gavemedicine and told stories and that was as far as the whole mother aspect went. i love how they porterayed wendy.  they kept it to the time period(1910's), but they made wendy more adventurous. all in all i give it 4 stars!",Peter Pan
280,elylevin,A Marvelous experience for those who believe in fairies,10,16 April 2004,"It's very rare those days to be able to watch a children targeted film without cringing from its poor production values. And by production values I mainly mean script and acting. For those of use who read the classic children and youth stories in their tender years and even at the first years of the teenage, it must be quite painful to watch adaptations of those stories, for they usually capture none of the magic the work they are based on had. The movie ""Peter Pan"" does just that. The actors they have chosen are at the right age, no 25 year old playing 13 year olds, and are fit perfectly for their roles, all children performances are delightful to watch not annoying, and the script fits them perfectly. The non children performances are great too, with the best Hook I have ever seen, a very capable Tinkerbell, and marvelous parents Aunt and Nana.The script though is the true marvel here. From the beginning to its end the story captures perfectly the spirit of the book; it stays true to its origin and adopts evenly the apparent level story as well as the deeper messages of the text, which has caused this movie to be quite unpopular with those critics who have no idea what is presentable in a good children story and what is not, because they have not read a children book (and probably ""mature"" book too) in their lives. If they would read it and review it they would most certainly claim that ""Jungle Book"" and "".Tom Sawyer ""and "".Huckleberry Finn"" and ""Treasure Island"" and about every other classic story would be deemed completely unfit for youth, because fit for youth today must apparently be completely stupid simpleminded and goofy lest children might actually think?! Like Harry Knowles called it in his excellent review of Peter Pan a ""21st century prudery"" (I recommend reading at his Aint-it-cool site for he states an opinion identical to mine but has different points) is what plagues most reviews of this film, and I personally recommend to those reviews to read the original story and see if they don't recognize the same there the presence of the subtext (which is actually not too subtle and quite apparent in both since its one of the main themes of the story!).As to a child's opinion, I have taken my 6 year old nephew to watch this film and he was entranced through the whole telling, literally at the edge of his sit and one time even standing up in reaction to some of the tenser adventures seen. He didn't stop talking about it for the whole day afterwards, and was actually thinking about the story and asking questions about it.Needless to day that I enjoyed every moment of this film as well. It's the first film in many years to capture the true feel a good book, it's the first Hook that was truly menacing enough to match Peter Pan, to put him in some mortal dangers even, a fabulous Wendy that captured the puppy love theme perfectly and Peter Pan that truly captured the magic of that character and has made it deep and multi dimensional which is true for all characters in this movie and also so rare in children stories today. Its Neverland is a place of wonder one can easily believe in.This film is pure magic, like ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies it's a gateway to another totally immersive (though naturally happier and lighter) magical world which we all knew existed, it's just that it's the first time we actually see it.I do believe in fairies.-Great Wizard",Peter Pan
281,xoDramaMama96,Just to get the record straight,10,22 March 2011,"I love this movie, but my post is actually about an earlier comment I read. The Disney film does indeed cast the same voice actor for both Mr. Darling and Hook. If you even watch the movie you can hear the similarities. Does he sound 100% the same no, but I think that gives it a bit of a twist, and almost makes it more clever. But it is clearly stated in the credits for the film that it is the same actor. Big Disney fan so I had to clarify that. But this is my all time favorite pan movie. Excellent adaptation of the book!Things I likes about the film: They manage to capture both of Wendy's spirits. Although she is a girl and a mother figure she also has a need to be adventurous and many films portray her as the innocent little girl. I love that they actually have Rachel Hurd Wood participating in the action. I also like the incorporation of Red handed Jill! I may be one of the few. But I enjoyed this Tinker Bell. She is supposed to be feisty and only hold on emotion at a time. I feel the actress playing her portrayed this well for not being able to speak. I also loved the tomboyish feel she gives to the character.I also like that they keep the lost boys in London, instead of the Disney versions (which I love) where they return with peter.",Peter Pan
282,timmylaushinghim,Worst film ever,2,24 January 2008,"In my opinion, this film is so dreadful that I do not want to watch it again.The ""neverland"" in the movie is not beautiful at all. The place is not fairy-like enough. Secondly, there is a character who is an ""aunt"". She is totally useless in the movie, who just appeared at the beginning. I wonder what is this character for. Thirdly, I think the action is poor. The fight between Hook and Peter Pan is short, and the sword-play is boring. I was expecting to see a long fight between Captain Hook and Peter Pan, but it turned out to be short and not exciting enough, which made me disappointed. I think that Rachel Hurd-Wood(the actress acting as Wendy) is not experienced enough. She did not try her best to be Wendy. The only thing which I consider as acceptable is the background music. The music suits the movie a lot and it is quite well done.This is a terrible film in general and I would suggest you not to watch it. It's the most disappointing film I've ever seen.",Peter Pan
283,Jamboni,Fresh version of the Peter Pan story.,10,1 January 2004,I have seen almost every film and many stage adaptations of Barrie's delightful book. This versions uses an actual boy not Mary Martin or an animated character.  Jeremy Sumpter is convincing as the puckish Peter Pan. His innocence and youthful expressions makes him the best Peter Pan.  The children possessed the curiosity and the joy that comes with the age. Jason Isaacs portrayed the opposite characters of Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. One could easily see the good and evil of adulthood.  Lynn Redgrave was perfect as the prudish Aunt. The magic of Peter Pan even survives in the 21st century.,Peter Pan
284,lil_mizz_cheeky42,Great movie.,10,13 January 2004,I loved the movie big time.It has inspired me to become an actress.Only thing I need is a agent.Jermey Sumter is lovely I want to meet him.Everyone else was brill.It has also made the animation come to life.Rating 10/10 Excellent.Nothing can beat it.,Peter Pan
285,kiki_go_round,Beautiful and timeless classic!,10,27 December 2003,"100/10!!A lot of people have said it, but there is truly no other word that can describe it other than magical. The whole story is beautiful, and although parental guidance for younger children is necessary, when you thing about it the original book was just as bloodthirsty. The romance between Peter and Wendy was nothing but sweet, and I have to say a have no idea what people are talking about when they mention sexual tension. I found the story to be sweet and innocent with the common fairytale moral that good triumphs over evil and love conquers all. It's truly a movie for all ages and made me wish I was a little girl again. It'll make you believe and want to fly to Neverland!",Peter Pan
286,lilac_goose,Can not go wrong with this one.,10,10 March 2009,"I have to say the first time I watched this movie (a few weeks ago), I had no idea what to expect. I had at the time thought of it as a straight-forward children's movie, but the 7.1/10 rating gave me some hope. Still, I did not want to underestimate it nor be disappointed.I was far from disappointed.In fact, I was so mesmerized, or in better words, astonished that this movie left me feeling something, the next day I watched it again and paid attention to every scene. The soundtrack beautiful. Perfectly constructed, the right instruments to fit the mood. Listening to the music apart from the movie is equally as beautiful. As we all know, the stars of this film: Jeremy Sumpter, Jason Isaacs, Rachel Hurd-Wood, were nearly flawless in my opinion and stayed true to their role. Sumpter as Pan, charming and witty, is of extreme talent and a lucky find from the director, I must say. Hurd-Wood as said over and over, brilliant and easily to be jealous of. And who could forget Jason Isaacs? Who shined with both of his roles and who almost had me fooled that Captain Hook and Mr. Darling were being played by the same man. When it ended I had a mixed feeling of melancholy and just this serene can't-name-it feeling that made me want to watch it again and again.I do wish I had seen this movie earlier than six years after it released, for maybe I wouldn't feel so late on all this Peter Pan-loving. Still, I can not go through one day without listening to one of the soundtrack songs or re-watching a favorite scene from the DVD. It is far from just your average children's film, with vivid coloring and flowing contrast in scenes and characters, it deserves a lot more love than it already has now. To me, the actors and actresses and the year 2003 may grow old and into the past, but the movie itself will always be a timeless joy. You won't be disappointed.",Peter Pan
287,alexandra-141,"More Than A Movie, This is a Dream",10,15 August 2008,"Peter Pan is one of the world's most well-known children's book characters, but in this remake of the book-based cartoon, the classic story is portrayed in a way never before seen. Countless effects, wonderful casting, and a perfect soundtrack make the movie purely enchanting. Some movies are just images on a screen, but this is different -- it's so much more than that. Peter Pan is a timeless tale of a land far away where children won't grow up, and after watching this movie, you're left with a feeling of longing for that Neverland. The effects in this film are realistic enough to make you believe in a real Neverland, and that in combination with an AMAZING musical score of enchanting notes and quirky rhythms, makes this one of my personal favorite movies, and an adventure to always remain in my mind.",Peter Pan
288,totallykimmi,I'm Leaving My Window Open...,10,18 March 2009,"Now I know that this movie came out like, 6 years ago but I just came back from a sleepover with my friends where we had a marathon of every single remake of the classic Peter Pan we all know and love. I had NO idea that a Peter Pan had been made with an actual real-life boy, mind you.And I have to say, I ABSOLUTELY loved this movie!!!! Jeremy Sumpter melted my heart with his charismatic little smirks, obnoxious ways (for his character) and not to mention, he was ""smokalicious"", in the words of my friend. His acting, well, I'm not old enough to spot an awesome actor very well but for an eleven-year-old, he was pretty great.Wendy was very pretty and she filled the part out very nicely. Of course, me and my friends poked fun at her little ""PetAH"" English accent thing but I liked how she portrayed the oldest Darling. If I were her, I would've stayed in Neverland...but hey, let's not go overboard. I was kinda grossed out by Hook's perverted obsession with Wendy and their little ""almost kiss"" but I got over that quickly because he was only provoking Peter.The only thing that bothers me was the heart-breaking ending. One of my friends shed a tear or two. I was never good with the whole Wendy-leaving-Peter-to-go-grow-up thing and I didn't like how later on Peter starts a pattern of taking Wendy's daughter and then her daughter and so on and so forth. I honestly just wanted Wendy to forget about growing up and stuff and stay with the boy of her dreams. I would. I guess it's just that I always wanted Peter to have a definite love, not just have Wendy, Jane, Wendy's mom (i think), Tink, Tiger Lily and the mermaids pining for him.But one little quirk that the movie had that I really enjoyed was the mature overtone that isn't usually featured in other renditions. The movie featured Peter struggling with his child-like self to really understand what love was and if he could handle such a large emotion that Wendy clearly didn't lack. How Peter has a huge decision to make to either preserve his fun-loving youth or spend the rest of his life with the girl he loves (likes).And what's this nonsense about this movie having ""sexual tension"" or ""sensuality not suitable for minors""?!?!? So what if two 13 or 14 year olds kiss? Don't act like you haven't seen it before. I found the romance in this story cute and enjoyable. I will admit, the scene with Wendy drawing Peter and herself in an awkward position was a bit bold but I didn't give it much thought. And when Peter got too close to Wendy on her bed, all I did was kinda, I don't know...MELT!!! The movie was NOT and I repeat NOT too violent and sensual or anything for kids. My friend's little sister and MOM were there and they certainly weren't complaining. Not even the mermaids scared that little 7-year-old.All in all, I adored the movie. The graphics were pretty, the romance between Tiger Lily and John was comical, the romance between Peter and Wendy was envy-inspiring (I want a cute guy to whisk me off to fantasy place!!!!) and the action was good. I wish that it wasn't so unappreciated. I'm so buying it on DVD...And I don't know about you, but that night my friends and I left the window open. And you better believe I'm doing it tonight as well.",Peter Pan
289,BobbiLayne83,Best Peter Pan Movie I've Seen!,10,29 December 2003,"Don't get me wrong, I loved Disney's version and the Musical, but this is my favorite by far.  My family and I went to see this movie when it came out on Christmas and all of us absolutely loved it.  It was kinda edgy, i.e., serious sexual tension between Peter and Wendy, but still a movie children would enjoy, most wouldn't pick up on it anyway.  I've seen mixed reviews on this movie, some saying it was terrible and how could they make this fairy tale so adult, blah blah blah.  Personally I found it to be awesome.  Who cares how captain hook got there, and why he can't capture a little boys. It's a fairy tale and your supposed to just sit there and enjoy it, not analyze it! lol  Definitely a movie in my top 10.",Peter Pan
290,kjohn1,Peter Pan beautifully explores the bittersweet truths of life.,10,17 December 2003,"We attended the World Premier of ""Peter Pan"" in London and are happy to report that the film is exquisitely lensed, brilliantly cast and resounding with Barrie's original concepts of growth, loss and the bittersweet beauties of life.For young and old, this is definitely a must-see film. Children will be able to enjoy the story on the full-blown adventure/fantasy scale, while adults will be deeply moved by the underlying emotion of Barrie's classic tale.While watching the film I was caught by the memory of being a child again. All the wonder and sheer joy of it. I felt that sensation, as I did so many years ago upon reaching that moment in my life just on the cusp of adolescence, when I realized there was something much more to life than play and schoolbooks. It was fascinating and frightening.PJ Hogan has done a superb job of melding these adult emotional truths and childish delights. The script balances the themes with a touch of magic, adherring to Barrie's works quite faithfully (verbatim at times), while infusing the whole with wit and wisdom. This is not a dumb film to be viewed as mere spectacle. The dialogue will make you laugh and think and most certainly feel.And this thanks to superb casting. One has to admire the producers and directors for casting for talent and appropriateness for role above Hollywood stardom. Rachel Hurd-Wood, in her first performance handles Wendy's emotional struggles with the acting chops of a seasoned veteran. She is a youthful beauty on the edge of bloom and one has high hopes of seeing her yet again. Jeremy Sumpter, excellent in last year's ""Fraility,"" is definitely Peter Pan. Cocky, adventuresome and self-absorbed. He handles the demanding action extremely well, and while at times his American accent is a bit troublesome, he does manage to  capture Peter's uncertainty regarding his choice to remain forever young and therefore left behind.And then there's the leading man in character disguise, Jason Isaacs. In a word, brillaint. And beautiful to behold in the demanding and complex dual roles of the dorky Mr. Darling and the dangerous, handsome Captain Hook. So polar in appearance are these portrayals that if you didn't understand Barrie's tradition of casting the same actor for both roles, you might not recognize him. His Darling and Hook are divergent yet deeply connected roles, and Isaacs never gives in to camp or ham acting. Its a superbly intelligent and mesmerizing performance and he embues the whole with genuine charisma and virile sex appeal. With his leading man looks and leading man talent, one has to wonder why he's not a big star yet.Visually, the film is exquisite to behold. One of the most beautiful films to simply ""look at"" that this viewer has yet to see. The entire screen is awash in vibrant storybook colors and elaborately detailed yet enticing sets. All production values are top shelf and belie the enormous budget.As for the special effects, it is difficult to tell where traditional wire work and set stunts end and special effects take over. This film is a hugely complicated effort that does at times call a bit too much attention to itself to the distraction of the story itself. Less would have been more in some places, particularly in the final battle.James Newton Howard's score is magical and enhances the story without overwhelming. I've been humming the tune since last week. Patterson's costuming is spot-on and imaginative without detracting from the iconic nature of the characters.This tale is iconic and classic after all and for the first time audiences can truly witness and enjoy Barrie's deep and delightful tale as he intended. See the film, you will rediscover so many things lost and now found again. The kids will love it, too!",Peter Pan
291,tabion007,Is there something wrong with me... or everyone else?,2,10 June 2010,"I was not expecting much from this movie to begin with but figured I would check it out since we had it and I was bored. I am a fan of the cartoon, but honestly I could careless how true they were to either that or the play as long as it was good. This was just no good. I understand the actors are kids but still everything felt way to forced. The effects were too corny, they tried to mix storybook effects with real people. The part when the boy got kissed and turned wildly purple gave me a chuckle, but in a sad way. Most of Neverland was like that though, irritatingly corny. The story felt absent, I suppose they figured everyone knew it so lets just put in some cotton candy clouds... woohoo. Tinkerbell.... come one... really, I mean it is one thing be eccentric it is another to be on drugs or insane. People said they liked it? No wonder Hollywood keeps making trash, they can get away with it. I can maybe understand if a kid likes this, they also like the wiggles... both are disturbing. I cannot comment about the end because I popped it out, I'm not sure when must have been in the middle or maybe 3/4.",Peter Pan
292,Andy_Pandy,Absolutely Stunning (My number 1 film of 2003),10,28 December 2003,"The cinematography was magnificent and Industrial Light and Magic did a great job on the special effects (even rivalling the work they did on Pirates of the Caribbean and Terminator 3). The acting was brilliant (I hate to use all these silly adjectives but I mean every word) with all the children doing a wonderful job. I have always been a Peter Pan fan, and also enjoy pirate films. Hogan did a great job as director and all the children in the cinema loved the whole adventure. It left us wanting more, and it was a little short. My previous number 1 film of the year was Return of the King, but Peter Pan is now at the top of the list! So glad I saw it before the year was over and that I took my brother along for the ride.

295,Grumpybear117,I love Jeremy Sumpter in Peter Pan,10,20 January 2004,"The movie Peter Pan so totally rocked! It made me laugh, cry, and swell up with joy. There's more to it than just the classic tale of a boy who refuses to grow up but it also represents how feelings change your life, how growing up can be scary, and how fun your imagination can be. Jeremy Sumpter was a great Peter Pan, able to express every emotion. I also think that Rachel Hurd-Wood played a magnificent Wendy, displaying every fear and joy a young girl has. I give Peter Pan 100,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars!",Peter Pan

297,anime_chocolate,Stunning.,10,4 January 2004,"After walking out of the theaters last friday, i had a few emotions in my mind. I was sad, impressed, and glad for seeing it. I say it's better than Hook, maybe even topping the original cartoon film. what i like about P.J.Hogan's version of Peter Pan, is that it portrays peter as his true, real self. What a real boy would have felt like then, A boy that ran away from home one day. He's rather lonely living in Neverland and wishes to return home, but sadly cannot. Although he is like every other child not wanting to grow up or go to school, he's lonely; all alone without a mother. At the end of the film, again, i felt sorry for him. He and tink should have gone to live with wendy or at least vist frequently. All this boy needed was a home.The thing that bothers me is that everyone says this movie is unoriginal a nd the same as the cartoon. Well duh, it's sort of meant to be, but just with a few alternates done. As for the love story, you wouldn't have found something as priceless as wendy and peter's love in a disney film.",Peter Pan

299,cryselephantine,Endearing romp of a retelling,10,29 January 2004,"Being a great fan of J. M. Barry's story, the news that a new Peter Pan movie was in the making interested me greatly.  Upon discussing it with people before it came out, I was struck by the popular cry of, ""But there's already been two movies made of Peter Pan.""  Grated, Disney made their well-loved animated version in 1953.  ""Hook,"" however, directed by Steven Spielberg, is not the story of Peter Pan, but a continuation.  Similarly, the recent sequel by Disney is just that - a sequel.Nevertheless, most people seemed to think that Peter Pan was an exhausted topic.  I was undaunted, and went to see it.  It not only lived up to my expectations, but also surprised me by its quality.The casting was extremely well-done.  Jason Isaacs proved to the world once again that he is a very convincing villain, and also premiered to the world his versatility, being cast as the dual role of Hook and Mr. Darling. Richard Briars, known for his roles in Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare movies, made for a lovable Smee.  Olivia Williams deserves mention as Mrs. Darling. Her wistful, exquisite portrayal of the mother added sparkle.  Jeremy Sumpter was brilliant, and all the Darling children were just that - darling.  The character that could have been improved on was Ludivine Sagnier's portrayal of Tinkerbell.  She achieved the mischievous aspect, but did not succeed in making one care for the fairy.The music of James Newton Howard was stirring.  The soaring themes left only one thing to be desired - more of them.  The scripting was brilliant, sometimes even profound, and the visual appeal of the film took one's breath away.All in all, I left the theatre wishing I was twelve again.  This in itself could be construed as a negative point of the movie, since it continually reminds the audience that growing up isn't all that bad, and yet makes one feel childhood's loss deeply.  But that is the most I could complain about, and seems to do the movie credit instead of detract from it.",Peter Pan
300,jelloarwen,excellent,10,8 May 2004,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Wendy was portrayed to perfection. She was the exact type of person I would have expected of Wendy. Jeremy Sumpter was an excellent Peter. I will admit that I cry every time I hear ""I do believe in fairies"". Jeremy (Peter) and Rachel (Wendy) look really cute together, so near the end, I can't help smiling and laughing. The both of them are such excellent actors, and they bring so much to the movie. Jason Isaacs must have his bit as well. Captain Hook was absolutely terrifying and very well played. He succeeded in making my eyes. There were several instances when I truly feared for Peter Pan's life. The last thing I have to say is that the whole made me laugh, cry, and have goosebumps from my neck down. My contacts were rather uncomfortable at the end from all the crying and then my eyes being wide with fear. Overall, I must say this is an excellent film.",Peter Pan

I wouldn't suggest it for small children due to the sexual tension between Peter Pan and Wendy and how dark the film is but would suggest it otherwise. The editing in the film was wonderful and the brilliant colors made the movie unforgettable. The film made me feel as if I was in Neverland, in the battles with Captain Hook, and among the daring Lost Boys. Jeremy Sumpter played Peter Pan exceptionally well. Peter Pan never wanted to grow up and Jeremy played it out very well. Rachel Hurd-Wood was beautiful in the film as well as talented for her first film.

303,ryski_16-1,Fantastic,10,23 January 2004,"I think that this movie is bloody fantanstic. its not like most movies that copy a book or remake because it follows it to a T even some of the pictures like nana (dog) sitting barking at the window or how he has his shadow sown on again. its fantastic. i think that jeremy sumpter was great as pan expcept for the american accent and i dont think the fact that his voice was cracky at times ruined it in fact i think it improved it. a fab film and director and cast definetly. My favourite scene has to be the fight just seeing peter get hit about because he is pretty vain (e.g. ""i am peter pan""""im the best"") and the funniest would be the part where hook says i dont believe in fairies and then flicks it when it dies.",Peter Pan
304,cathyroma,Excellent !,9,23 December 2003,"We have been anxiously awaiting the opening of Peter Pan. Our family was lucky enough to be a part of the test audience for the movie at The Block in Orange in October of this year. I can safely say that this movie will appeal to all audiences. After viewing the movie, it motivated me to reread the book that I haven't read since I was a child. It mostly stays with the original story line with a couple of elaborations. Like any great novel, perceptions of the main ideas and characters change with additional readings. What seemed like a great adventure story as a child, is perceived as a more personal story about growing up, first loves, and regrets. What you ""see"" in the movie is subject to interpretation. I read the comments about the relationship between Peter and Wendy, however the author hints at the relationship by talking about Mrs. Darling's youth and how she never found who her ""kiss"" belonged to. Wendy does, and he states this in the ending.  This is Victorian times mind you. I would say overall the acting is excellent. Jeremy Sumpter is wonderful at playing Peter Pan. He brings the mischievous boy to life without being a rude bully with no care for anyone. Mr. Darling and Captain Hook are wonderful characters, as is the rest of the cast. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as we did!",Peter Pan
305,tedious_fool,Excellent,10,26 December 2003,"Ok people...you must not know a good film. For the person who said it was horrible, I dunno...what medications are you taking? I loved this film, and it's my favorite adaptation from the novel. Except for the original JM Barrie play (not the musical). And for you who said the ""I believe in fairies"" few moments part, I'd rather hear everyone say that instead of millions of people clapping as in my musical.The acting is wonderful...Jeremy Sumpter did a great job. Maybe he was a little old, but then I've never heard of an actor actually being age he's portrayed. It's called acting. Ever heard of it? Better Jeremy than Aaron. I cannot stand it when a singer tries to act, it just doesn't work. Sorry J Lo, this goes for you too.I loved the special effects. The flying actually looked real. Unlike Harry Potter and the Quidditch matches.And the wonderful Jason Issacs. You are the father of all villains.",Peter Pan
306,boristhespyder,amazing!,10,27 December 2003,"I saw this movie earlier today and i couldn't stop talking about it. i read the original books as a child and this movie has gotten closer to that story than any other i've seen. it told the pan story as an adventure for the kids but also as a self discovery/ lovestory for the adults. i was very worried about it being corny like all the other ones but it really wasn't. when tink died i swear the whole audience was whispering ""I do believe in fairies"". i even asked some people outside if they were that involved in the movie and they all agreed that they too were saying it under their breath. i totally recommend that everyone see this movie.",Peter Pan
307,snoopybug12,Disappointed,1,27 December 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I was highly disappointed when I sat down to watch this film last night... After the first TEN minutes.  This may be because I'm doing research on PETER PAN at the moment and have become quite particular when it comes to details, however, I still feel I was robbed of my time. First of all, Mr. Darling was depicted as a wimpy character with no back bone at all.  Traditionally the person cast as Mr. Darling also plays the role of Hook because in the children's eyes they have many parallels.  In the movie he was cast the same, but the two characters had nothing to do with eachother. Secondly, since WHEN is there an Aunt Milicent?  Mr. Darling wanted Wendy to grow up, NOT because of some crumy aunt. Now after that has been said, I took into consideration that they might have been creative choices to tweek the storyline.  Then came the time for Wendy to actually meet Peter.  Yes, Wendy loved Peter, but Peter NEVER loved Wendy in that manner, he loved her as a mother.  He doesn't know or want to love any other way.  AND no one is to ever EVER touch Peter Pan.  It's in the original play, musical, and the book.  ""No one must ever touch me."" is the direct quote.  So when they started having all this ""sexual tension""... it was only used as a marketing tool to make some obvious romantic element, when the real romance lies within the story of changing from child to adult. And who has EVER heard of Hook FLYING?!  He can't fly!  He doesn't HAVE happy thoughts!  And Wendy becoming a pirate.  She would never even THINK about it!  Her concern was to get her and her brothers home towards the end of their trip, she never became as hurt as Tinkerbell over Peter to go to HOOK! And to top it off:  the flying looked sooooo FAKE.  The musical version with Mary Martin looked more realistic and she had a harnass on with a string sticking out of her costume. 1 out of 5.  No more, and I can't really give anything less.",Peter Pan
308,sugargrl99,its such a great movie,10,28 December 2003,I loved it. Jeremy Sumpter plays peter pan in a great way. Its like its all true the way every thing is done. The special effects are great.

309,MyFairyTale,The Way It Is Supposed to Be Told...,10,31 December 2003,"Since this had been my favorite fairy tale for as long as I can remember, I have never been satisfied with the movie versions because they were not like the book I had been read as I was growing up. But now, I truly am, not only satisfied, but ecstatic!This version of Peter Pan is not only a cinematic wonder, but it stays frightfully true to the original story. It never strayed far from the storyline, believe me; I know the book forwards and backwards. The mermaids are mysteriously dangerous, as they are supposed to be. The fairies are truly magical and mesmerizing. The screenwriters fully explained the lore of the fairies, Peter Pan, and even the Lost Boys. Peter Pan has been converted back to the cocky boy I knew.The actors were the perfect match for the characters. I was glad to see that the casting director picked actors the same age as the characters so they look the part.This is the way this story is supposed to be told. It was the perfect version of Peter Pan, my fairy tale.",Peter Pan

This is a great movie. I have seen it now twice and am planning to see it a third and fourth soon. I just can't get enough of it. It is so great. If you get a chance to go see it do so.

312,Wikky29,The Story is finally told,10,2 January 2004,"Go see PETER PAN ! If you've read the original, then realize that it is really true to the story. It's never been a little kid's story as I learned as I grew older. But it is a story of youth and imagination growing toward life and maturity.
I saw many earlier adaptations of Peter Pan over the last 40 years and have read the story many times.But this is one time that the non-animated edition of the story hasn't been played as a musical. The major change is that a BOY plays Peter Pan. In all castings previous, as a musical it was always felt that a girl was needed because of the singing. To me that always took away from the relationship and the message that Peter and Wendy must deliver to each other. It is also lighter and the humor shows through in their bantering as kids, especially teenagers are want to do.Oh, the boy(Jeremy Sumpter)that plays PP has a smile that is so important to the story. It focuses to his character so well that there are times you have no doubt that he can ""fly""(symbolism here).You might note that Peter's teeth are not ""hollywood"" straight nor gleaming white and his hands and feet are dirty, so like the waif you think him to be.Peter Pan was one of those stories I grew up with as a 5, 6, 7, 8 year old. Strangely, it coincided at the same time that ""The Adventures of Superman"" with the late George Reeves was on TV. I think in my young mind that the two had a real sameness or a bond in their being. Both remain heroes of mine to this day. Maybe it's the ""flying"". Maybe PP relented on his convictions and grew up to be Clark Kent.Funny, as old as I have become, I still understand the need to let the fantasy world be there to allow your imagination to expand the pathways of your mind while being aware of its message to the real world.See it. You won't be disappointed. I offer one caveat. The ending is true to the original story, so be prepared to let Peter fly....",Peter Pan
313,chadsgirl824,Couldn't possibly have been any better!,10,3 January 2004,"I've seen Peter Pan in several different versions and never really cared much for it.  I'm 18 years old, and probably wouldn't have bothered to see this one since in the past I've always thought of it as nothing more than a kids' story...but then I heard Jeremy Sumpter was going to be in it - I thought he did a fantastic job in the movie Frailty, so my curiosity to watch this movie definitely peaked.  Well I don't think it could have exceeded my expectations any more than it did.First off, the special effects were perfect...Neverland was exactly the way it should have always looked, the scenes of flying over London and out into the stars were beautiful...and of course, Tinkerbell, is by far the best version of the tiny fairy ever.The music was so perfect...meshing so well with the mood of the scenes, I bought the soundtrack almost immediately after the first time I watched it.Casting of the main roles was, in my opinion, one of the best casting jobs ever.  Jeremy Sumpter is and will always be, in my opinion, the only boy that should ever play Peter Pan...he made that role his in so many ways, I loved the cocky attitude, the sly smile, and just the way you could see his emotions in his eyes...so often I watch movies and the feeling just isn't there from the eyes of the actor I'm watching, which definitely takes away from the story, but Jeremy did such a good job there was no chance of thinking him to be anyone else except Peter Pan.Jason Isaacs who I loved as Lucius Malfoy (and loved to hate in the Patriot...we won't mention the Tuxedo) was too perfect for Captain Hook. The scenes between Peter and Hook were so intense and exciting you just couldn't move in your seat, and the scenes with Hook and his crew, especially Smee...were so much better for being done the way I think they were meant to be...Hook is an evil man, not the dumb cartoon character from the fifties' cartoon, and when one of his men pushes the wrong button, he reacts in the only way he can...but at the same time, it wasn't so much violence that younger kids can't enjoy it as well.Rachel Hurd-Wood was also very well cast, and for being her first movie I was completely impressed with how easily she seemed to slip into this role. The first scene between Wendy and Peter, when they meet finally and formally, is just priceless...again, no one else could have ever played that part so well as she did.There was just enough of everything in this movie to stay true to the original story...I was so happy to see not just the light, happier side of Peter Pan, but the darker side as well...The mermaids were creepy and disturbing, but fantastically done, the fighting scenes were wonderful, I swear I was holding my breath!! They're definitely very high on my list of favorites, though the fairy dance scene was just so magical...however, the ""I do believe in fairies"" scene had me smiling and laughing before I even realized it...and that I think, is what I really love about this movie. It's so wonderfully uplifting...you go through the emotions they're feeling right along with them and when it's over you feel as if you were there.
I don't like to watch movies and see clearly that the people on the screen in front of me are just acting because they're not doing their jobs.  And I can't stand all the pointless, stupid, mind-numbing comedies that have been popping out so quickly you can't tell one from the next...but hey, that's what I see a good deal of the time lately...so this movie was exactly what I was looking for...I have nothing bad to say about it at all, and am a bit shocked by some of the negative reviews I've seen.  Everyone's entitled to their opinions though, and I won't ever tell someone else they're wrong...instead I'll just say that I believe movies are there to entertain us, not for us to pick apart every little detail until it's just a bunch of facts on a sheet, that's not the reason I'll shell out $9 to attend a show...I'll go because I want to forget about reality for a while and (hopefully, if I'm lucky) experience something wonderful...something I can never have though I'll love it just the same...and that's what this is for me.So then, I could go on and on about how amazing this movie was for hours on end...but hopefully you'll take my word for it and go check it out yourself.Rating: 5/5",Peter Pan

315,Landosgirl82,Second Star to the Right,10,4 January 2004,"Of all the adaptations of J.M. Barrie's classic Peter Pan, this one outshines them all. True to the original story, P.J. Hogan has brought the magical island of Neverland to life, complete with fairies, pirates and indians. Hogan's Neverland is warm and inviting and at the same time a little dark. His use of color gave the movie a more fantasy-like feel, at the same time drawing you in this fantastic world.The two lead actors, Jeremy Sumpter (Peter) and Rachel Hurd-Wood (Wendy) have wonderful chemistry onscreen. Jeremy's ""Pan"" smile carries the mischievious look that embodies his character and Rachel's wide-eyed innocence is right on par with the young Wendy Darling's. Also of note is Peter's archnemisis, the insufferable Captain Hook (played to perfection by the very talented Jason Issacs). Hook's hatred for Peter comes across clearly in the movie just as it is portrayed in the book.Basically a ""fairy"" story, Peter Pan should be taken that way, with lightness and humor. Neverland is a world of escape, of make-believe, of happiness and it leaves you feeling just that way and with a smile on your face.",Peter Pan

317,adidaz20o4,I think everyone should see Peter Pan (at least once).,10,7 January 2004,"I may just have to see this movie once more. I loved the movie. I always loved the original story of Peter Pan since I was exposed to it with books and Disney's 1953 version. Being a favorite of mine, I was deeply anticipating the Hogan's 2003 version.The special effects and the scenes were awesome. It was the perfect setting for a fairytale.The cast was great, except Tinkerbell. Something didn't work for me and I believe they could of found someone more appropriate.I think Jeremy Sumpter was incredible, even if he was the only one with an American accent in the movie. I think the director was trying to find his ideal boy, which would be at age 12. Even if Jeremy is 14, he was only 5 feet tall when the movie began and grew 10 inches. Also, he worked well with Rachel Hurd-Wood who played Wendy Darling. They had a good chemistry. For a first timer, she did amazing.The musical score was great. It gets a thumbs up.I have been reading/hearing alot about the sexual content in the movie, or the sexual innuendo. I don't understand why one would think of this family movie as sexual. Just because two boys were embarassed by being naked does not mean that there is an underlying sexual tone to the movie. It was humorous and innocent. This movie was targeted at children, not adults. Adults are making the movie seem sexual, not kids. If you were to ask a child, who has seen the movie, if they thought it was inappropriate, they would disagree with you. Children, well some, do not grasp the concept of sex and therefore cannot see this movie to be sexual in anyway. And the flirtatiousness between Peter and Wendy is just that, flirting. This movie is partly about growing up, even learning about adolescent love.In reality, this movie made me want to be a kid again and that is what its purpose is, to bring you into the world of adolescence and childhood. I say its a 9/10 stars. Every should see it at least once.Oh and yes, this is not the original Peter Pan. It is P. J. Hogan's version of the original by J. M. Barrie. So it won't be exactly the same.",Peter Pan

320,hornerman,Amazing telling of a classic,10,6 January 2004,"I can honestly say this is certainly one of the best films of 2003, and I am absolutely shocked that more people haven't discovered it. P.J. Hogan, my hat's off to you.  You have created a world that is not only beautiful to look at, but also one that doesn't seem the least bit out of place for a story like Peter Pan. There are moments in films, I like to call them 'chill' moments, where something happens on screen that hits all the right buttons, and you feel it.  A tingle, that starts at the base of your neck and scurries all the way up and around to your forehead.  Very, very few films have scenes that do this, in my life I can count them on one hand.  I can safely say that Peter Pan has joined this exclusive club, with not one, but two sequences that accomplish this.  The first being the flight to Neverland, the second, well, I don't wanna spoil anything. :) To describe the set design as amazing would be an understatement.  You can tell that alot of love was put into this film (and money).  From the amazing detail of the jungle, to the seedy interior of the pirate ship, it's worth another screening just for the scenery alone.  The acting was totally believable and natural, especially that of Peter Pan.  Not to knock my own country, but the fact is that english child actors seem to be extremely gifted at playing, well, kids.  Compare young darth vader in Phantom Menace, to, say, Harry Potter, and you'll see what I mean. As in Harry Potter, the kids here relax into their roles, and their world, with ease. I truly almost passed this up, thinking the only worthwhile fantasy film out there was Return of the King, as I'm sure alot of the population thinks. I would just like to say that nothing could be further from the truth after seeing Peter Pan.  An perfect film that takes chances I wish others would. I don't know what else to say except see this film, I guarantee you'll leave the theater with a goofy little smile.",Peter Pan
321,belasco,"Great adaption, but slightly flawed.",8,7 January 2004,"I loved the book as a child and still read it occasionally as an adult. So I was looking forward to this big screen version, but even this faithful adaptation was missing something. Even so this is a great film, its heads above the Harry Potter films or most kids movies Disney churn out.In my mind Peter was always a dark, dangerous but charismatic person, something Jeremy Sumpter failed in portraying, but this could be the studio execs fault, too scared to put the real Peter on the screen. Newcomer Rachel Hurd-Wood is the perfect Wendy, a great find. The excellent Jason Isaacs, who made H.P. & The Chamber of Secrets watchable, brings Captain James Hook to life. Ludivine Sagnier(The Swimming Pool) did a good job as Tinkerbell. The Lost Boys, Tiger Lily and the Indians got very little screen time for my liking, would have been nice to see more scenes of them interacting with Peter.But at the end of the day this is the best adaptation of the book I've seen. Don't let all the talk of a sexual tone put you off bringing your kids, there's nothing sinister in Peter & Wendy's attraction to each other.Whatever age you are, I urge you to go see this intelligent, action packed, fun movie.

322,frangelico,excellent,10,11 January 2004,"brilliantly done - just as I imagined producing it as a show when I was a child reading and re-reading the book! The movie has finally captured my dreams and saved me from the dreadful disappointment that was ""Hook""...",Peter Pan
323,Seshenu,"Odds bobs, hammer and tongs -- it was charming!",8,11 January 2004,"(Warning -- some spoilers follow) This film was absolute magic! If you're over 10 and have an imagination, you owe it to yourself to see it, and if you're over 10 and don't have an imagination -- you absolutely owe it to yourself to see it so that you can get one again.Usually I'm a purist when it comes to film adaptations of books, so I'll admit up front that while this version follows much of the plot and most of the atmosphere of J. M. Barrie's fantastic novel, it certainly takes its liberties, especially at the very end of the film, which is rather sugary.
However, this version so thoroughly captures the character of the Neverland, at once beautiful and dangerous, and the script and performances are so well carried out, that it's by far and away the best adaptation of the book that has ever been made. It's thoughtful and, well, lots of fun!
Let's get a brief recap of the story for those who don't know it out of the way: Peter Pan, the one child who never grows up, visits the Darling family unawares to hear stories that Wendy tells her two brothers, John and Michael. One night he is forced to enter the children's nursery to reclaim something he's lost, and then the adventures begin, replete with fairies, mermaids, ""Indians,"" and pirates.Let me say now that I was worried about whether the ""Indians"" would be portrayed with respect and was relieved to find that they were. The actors and actresses are American Indian, not brown-paint-jobs, and the now racist ""redskin"" jargon from the book is thrown out. In fact, there's a joke in the film about the irony of calling both villainous pirates and the innocent Tiger Lily ""savages.""This version of the story has a more difficult job than the prudish middle-aged-female-Peter-Pan theatrical productions or the kiddie cartoons because it's trying very hard to straddle material for children and material for their older siblings and adults. Kids under 10 probably won't get much out of the film, and while watching the movie I've heard kids under 6 telling their parents that they were scared. I think parents are taking them to see it as an excuse to see it themselves. But what unfortunately scares very young children fortunately provides good stuff for the rest of of us.
Jason Isaacs shines in a consummate dual performance as the adorably nervous Mr. Darling and the dashing and charming rogue Captain Hook, and his performance really carries the film. In previous adaptations of Peter Pan, the Captain is a stock villain, but in this version, Hogan's screenplay and Isaacs' dramatic know-how portray a very appealing but conflicted man who yearns to be loved and yet is so poisoned by his loneliness and disillusionment that he is more comfortable with malice instead. Hogan makes the good decision of showing Hook's stump and the painful contraption he wears to hold the hook when we're introduced to him, which not only lends the character depth but also foreshadows that the Peter Pan story itself is a rather dark one. Neverland is dangerous, there is death. And oh by the way, living with pain and a physical disability is not funny.Hook is enraged that Peter Pan cut off his right hand and set the Grim Reaper on him in the guise of a crocodile who swallowed his hand and now has a taste for the rest of him, but the film and book heavily infer that Hook's real problem is that he grew up against his will, which gives the story humor as well as sadness and casts light on Wendy's conflict. For her part, Hurd-Wood does an excellent job as Wendy, a strong and intelligent girl who makes a very difficult decision.Although I've heard some complain that this film is overtly sexual, I don't think it is. Listen, it's coming from a book in which fairies have orgies, literally, so the film is tame compared to Barrie's text. I was very pleased that Hogan developed that tension between Hook, Wendy, and Pan. After all, Wendy is approaching that in-between state called adolescence. It's only right that she finds the grown-up Hook entrancing (and that is in the book) yet frightening and finds Peter inspiring yet deficient (that, too, is in the book). Another source of upset for some viewers, Wendy and Peter's kiss at the end of the film, is not in the book but still works for the movie. It's not crude, and if you're not a prude it's not uncomfortably sexual either.Like Hook and Peter, the film has its strengths and its drawbacks. I've mentioned the strengths but will add to that list the very appealing Lost Boys, who certainly made me wish I were their mother. The drawbacks include special effects that are at times embarrassing and an uneven performance as Peter Pan by Jeremy Sumpter, who is able to show Peter's cockiness and vibrancy but glosses over some of his lines so quickly that it seems he doesn't quite get them. The sugaring of Peter, who is much nicer in the film than he is in the book, was a bit disappointing but understandable considering the age of much of the audience.All in all, though, this is an excellent adaptation, full of wonder and sweetly bitter-sweet.",Peter Pan
324,AirBourne,Made me finally understand why the complex was so named!,8,5 April 2004,"The first half of the movie was very true to the book, using a French Ballerina for Tink was effective and Isaacs was amazing as both Hook and George Darling!I do not remember if Hook flew in the book though...

Even the lost boys could have been a few years younger.The best acting performance belongs to Jason Isaacs who played Mr. Darling/Captain Hook. He fitted both parts perfectly and I thought it is the best performance of his career. Tinkerbell who was played by Ludivine Sagnier( not Julia Roberts, right John Ulmer?) was not how i would have pictured her but still fitted the part fairly well. I would not recommend showing this to anyone under 13. It had kind of a sexual element that at times made my a little uncomfortable. Although i'm sure younger children wouldn't pick these hints up.",Peter Pan
329,ashlyriot,oh the cleverness of pan,10,26 February 2004,"I can't begin to express my joy for this film... i Know there won't be many movies as maligned and turned down by ""hardcore"" movie goers as this one but trust me they don't know jack. The movie is truly brilliant in every aspect of the film. It captures the Neverending Story feel and never lets go. It represents something that every child has wanted at least in there life time and most of the time it succeeds if not all the time. I know that most of the people who haven't seen this movie never will because of that tough mature stubborn thing everyone has going on now but who honestly cares just watch it by yourself then discover how great it is and get on here and tell everyone so it can get the respect it freaking deserves",Peter Pan
330,thejonses,Simply Magical,10,29 January 2004,"This movie exceeded my expectations. To be honest, even as a child I was never really that crazy about the whole Peter Pan thing. I did not want to see this movie, and tried to talk my children into something else. I am so glad they convinced me. I am a mother of 4 and have watched many family movies, but this is the most magical, and enchanting movie that I have ever seen. I loved the little boy that played Peter Pan. His facial expressions and tone of voice were perfect for his role. There was just a perfect blend of innocence and mischief in his expressions. This movie made me want to be a kid again and run away to neverland. I even cried during some of the climatic moments. I recommend this movie to anyone, with or without children. I do believe in fairies, I do, I do! :o)",Peter Pan
331,qwenk,Delightful,9,31 January 2004,"Many adults will enjoy this film along with the kids. In fact some of the best bittersweet moments will only resonate with grownups.  The filmmakers went for a different feel, very English yet quite accessible, and that makes this movie special.  Not to mention the lack of cynicism. As a musician, I can also mention that the soundtrack music is really skillfull and an excellent contribution.",Peter Pan
332,gambit_269,A Hidden Kiss!,10,6 February 2004,"Thrilling action, moving performances, and eye-candy goodness make for an excellent time at the movies! No one has ever done ""Peter Pan"" quite like this, playing out the action so faithfully to the original story, and actually casting a real boy in the role of Peter!! There has also, for the longest time, been an absence of the story between Peter and his Wendy, throughout the history of ""Peter Pan"" films. Their young love is actually hinted at in this film, and it is both wonderful, and yet very sad. Hook is represented as someone truly evil, even though you can't help but love him some of the time. Villains are so much fun! The constant battle between Peter and Hook is more than just sword fighting. They are both really tragic characters with hidden emotions.  The sets, the costumes, the scenery were all so intricate and beautifully laid out. It is absolutely, without a doubt, the best ""Peter Pan"" version to ever be created. Universal Studios has sealed the deal with a hidden kiss!",Peter Pan
333,pixiefairy,In my opinion the movie is everything Peter Pan should be,10,22 February 2004,"Ok first off, Jeremy Sumpter was the perfect boy to play Peter Pan! Second I loved all the great CG animation it was fantastic. All the characters were played so well by the actors as if it was real. When I watched the movie I wanted to stay in Never Never Land for ever!! And the secret conection to Peter and Windy was awesome. The producer of this movie was a genious.",Peter Pan
334,MB20And1,Great Retelling,8,4 May 2004,"This movie did a great job retelling the story of Peter Pan.  I know most people think of it as a kids story and it kind of is, but if you're a fan of good film-making and good storytelling then you should watch this movie. I'm usually not one for family movies, but I wanted to see this from the first time I saw the trailer.  I just thought it looked like it was shot that well.  Also, if you've seen swimming pool (which is definitely an adult film), then its interesting seeing Ludivine Sagnier in such a drastically different role.  Also, the actors portraying the characters all fit the part very well.  The best of which was probably Hook (Jason Isaacs).  Rating: 8",Peter Pan
335,gillenbran,"A fantastic version of a classic, long overdue.",9,11 May 2004,"I have long since adored the adventure and story of Peter Pan, but have heretofore been unsatisfied by the majority of it's performances that lacked a life and spirit that could sweep me up and take me away.  This version--while I wouldn't rush to claim it the definitive Peter Pan, I would say is by far the most fantastic film version so far.  The characters were VERY WELL cast and the dialog very clever at just the right times. The technical work of the sets, costumes and flying were so well done they can either interest me by their rich detail, or allow me to forget the complexity completely and get lost believing in the film entirely.  If not for any of those reasons, I loved this film because when seeing it in the theater, my 5-year-old daughter was so enchanted, she couldn't help but cheer out and giggle excitedly in the heat of the action.  The child in me who hasn't yet grown up was just as enthralled as she.",Peter Pan
336,silverspaceship,Spectacular Remake,10,6 June 2004,"Peter Pan is an amazing tale that has been told to children for one hundred years. However, it wasn't until now that a full feature movie was created. This film is spectacular from beginning to end. Jeremy Sumpter stars as the sly mischievious boy who never wants to grow up. He does the character justice. The scenery and special effects allow you to visualize neverland as it should be. It does it so well that you leave the film envious of the characters portrayed in the movie.The film is an overall success. The actors, script,and scenery depict the story as if J.M. Barrie,himself,was making the film. Definitely a classic that is sure to be remembered by young and old. Well done P.J Hogan! Well done!",Peter Pan
337,Happyfeet313,"What a Beautiful, Magical Movie",9,13 July 2004,"This is Peter Pan as it should be. From the pirates, to the fairies, to the charming young actors themselves, it is truly enchanting. P.J. Hogan's adaptation finds cinematic balance; with layers of both adventure and tender first romance. it is a serious film about children, and is not meant to be written off as just another mindless kiddie special effects spree. Swordfights, pirates, and mermaids have taken center stage in other versions of J.M. Barrie's classic tale, grazing over or ignoring the many deeper themes within it. For the first time on screen, the tragedy of Peter Pan's perpetual boyhood is explored, bringing a whole new element to the story of Peter and Wendy. I congratulate Mr. Hogan on producing a film families can watch, and enjoy , together. Both Jeremy Sumpter AND Rachel Hurd-Wood blew me away. They possess their characters and breathe new life into them. The look and feel of the movie itself is simply breathtaking, if you've ever believed in fairies, you will find your self longing for the color and beauty of Neverland.",Peter Pan
338,lanzasean06,"Love It, a Man's Point of View",10,29 May 2004,"This Movies shines!I love this movie. It shows great scenes, great everything.I thought I was going to be a really stupid movie when I saw the previews when it for came out in Theatre. It looked stupid, and another Peter Pan movie, I thought the Disney one was one enough.Boy was I wrong, the movies shows passion, everything is very convincing. I watch it over and over again.The casting was great, I love Rachel as Wendy, she looks perfect for the part, I thought she did flawlessly. Jeremy Sumpter, Peter Pan, a good actor, haven't seen any other movies with him. He had everything Peter Pan perfect, although he had a lisp, and other bothers of his mouth, nothing should stop an actor of an obvious lisp. I have a lisp and I haven't any care for it. Jeremy did fine as Peter, I wouldn't have chosen someone else. Jason Isaccs, wow, I didn't know that he played both Mr.Darling,and Hook, both looked different, until some time in the end, when I thought to myself that he looked different. Olivia Williams, perfect part for her, not too young or old, perfect. She did great as Mrs. Darling.As a revision of the book, many parts were missing, but nonetheless the movie was superb, and I recommend everyone to buy it for their family and friends, you'll love the movie, and maybe shed a tear or two.Jo L.",Peter Pan
339,dream_chance8,GREAT family film especially if someone likes magical romance and adventure movies,10,3 June 2004,"Fantastic film that puts everything together having to do with romance, adventure and magical beings. Funny scenes take place that make me laugh. Every dream of a kids is to fly and watching this movie has lifted their spirits and hopes for being able to fly. Although many will think its impossible to fly its not. The reality of the movie is realistic and makes everything they are accomplishing look real. Many family's I know have watched this beloved movie time and time again. The haunting figure, captain hook, was scary and mysterious I thought he was well picked. The scenes had a haunting ring to them about reality of love and how Wendy and Peter Pan felt about each other. I thought that was a necessary scene to put in it pulled the movie to be what it is now. The over all grade I give it is 9/10.",Peter Pan
340,Squisher,A great try at capturing the magic,9,7 June 2004,"I've never been a HUGE Peter Pan fan. Yes, I've seen the Disney movie, and yes, I've seen Hook. I've even seen the Mary Martin version. And, I've enjoyed every single adaptation. However, since I've read the book by J.M. Barrie only recently, I didn't realize how different, and how quirky(even darker) the story really was. In fact, news of this new movie, and seeing the trailer, was what inspired me to actually read the book in the first place. I really hoped that this ""faithful"" version would do the book justice. I'd like to say that I wasn't disappointed, but I think my expectations were far too high. I did like the movie, enough to now own the DVD. But there was something just not right about this version, and I hate to admit that it was Peter himself. He's adorable, yes, but listening to him spout out the very proper English dialogue just sounded wrong. It didn't fit him. Also, there were parts that seemed like he was rehearsing for a school play, and yet there were other scenes where he was absolutely perfect - couldn't have found a better Pan - he IS Pan. I guess, in less words, I basically just thought he was inconsistent. And it's a shame, because other than that I can't find anything wrong with the movie. Wendy was played wonderfully by Rachel Hurd-Wood. Jason Isaacs was perfectly evil as Hook, and ridiculously wimpy as Mr. Darling. Ludivine Sagnier WAS Tinkerbell: an excellent portrayal of the mean spirited little pixie. Olivia Williams was a lovely Mrs. Darling. Richard Briers cracked me up as Smee. Wendy's brothers, the lost boys, and Tiger Lily all had me laughing and smiling at how spot on they were in their roles. And even the added in Aunt played by Lynn Redgrave was amusing All right, I will say that Jeremy Sumpter's performance was much better to me on the 2nd viewing. And, the kid is great at facial expressions. In so many scenes his eyes say it all. Still, not perfect, but pretty darn close. In conclusion, I do recommend this movie, because, all in all it's a quality film, that was smart, funny, and enjoyable.",Peter Pan
341,piper_2006,Ever wonder where John's famous black top hat came from? Ha!,10,10 June 2004,"Unlike Mr. London, England's comments, I will say that this movie was truly spectacular. Making Disney's magical story of a boy who will never grow up as real and as true as all other life is no easy task. But this crew hit it.FIrst off, the boy who played Peter -- how perfect. Throughout the whole movie his boyish spirit was without doubt most convincing. His eyes -- they sparkled, twinkled, memorized! No kidding. Wendy - great character. The perfect idea of a girl's mind growing up. Playful, but wanting something. . . The lost boys, John, and Michael -- just fun characters, comic relief in some way I suppose. And Hook!! Magnificent -- the perfect Never Land pirate. And what a wonderful thing to have Mr. Darling casted as both characters.There was never a dull moment, every detail of Disney's story was fine tuned or just plain better! Then the new scene (don't read if you haven't seen it, and don't want a give away!! that's no fun!) . . .the new scene added where Wendy and Peter dance - fantastic!, and Tinkerbelle and Hook have a bit of a pity party - how clever!. But it's also a scene with so much material!! The riddle of Peter's being, his struggles of not growing up - and Wendy's struggles of doing so. Peter loves his life, but Wendy somehow reaches in and draws remorse from him . . .some girls have that effect on boys I guess. Just silly details - like Tinkerbelle doesn't talk, just add to the whole effect. Chanting I do believe in fairies! That was neat. Let's see. . .oh! In Disney's movie, did you ever wonder where John got the famous black top hat from? Ha! They even caught that! - quite splendidly too. And of course the big fight scene - when Peter falls, you fall with him. Everything stops. To live would be an awfully big adventure. What a fantastic line! Oh I don't know what to say! I'm trying to make this movie sound appealing (and hopefully you're not running away at this point...i'm afraid i'm not the best writer) ---but I am honest. And honestly - this movie - this story - is worth seeing, worth owning, worth knowing. I bought it - and guess what? I'm not into happily ever afters, or sickly fairy tales, but this movie is surprisingly neither. I can't explain it, but have you ever had that happy, yet sad - (very sentimental) feeling? well, I guess it's similar. In the end, your sad for Peter because what he can't have, but shouldn't you be happy for him for what he does have? All that is that other boys can only dream of? But if you think about it, maybe boys like Peter dream of things boys here on Earth have. Wow - how extremely deep. oy -- but I watch it many times in one week. Haven't gotten sick of it...not even remotely so. I don't believe I ever will...or ever could!!",Peter Pan
342,DUDASCARUSO,It is GREAT!!!!!,9,27 June 2004,"I was never a fan of the Peter Pan story so when my kids age 14 and 4 wanted to rent this version I was expecting not to like it. But as I watched I found the child actors were very endearing and I really enjoyed the movie. We have since bought the movie and have watched it many times. I found nothing offensive for a 4 year old and my 14 year old liked it as well she did not think it was too childish. It was a beautifully made movie as well. My children like the boy who plays Peter and the lost boys too It is hard to pick a favorite. The adult actors are good, the story is good, the cinematography is good, there was nothing offensive for a 4 year old and not too childish for a 14 or a 40 year old so I was very pleased you can't ask for much more in a family movie. Now I think Peter Pan is truly a classic.",Peter Pan

344,Collins30038,Marvelous,10,29 June 2004,"Finally saw this movie and I was totally enchanted by it. A wonderful adaptation of one of my favorite stories. There is almost an erotic quality to Wendy and Peter Pan, which I'm not sure should be said in the same sentence, but, it's there, non-the-less. Beautiful to look at, and the actors are wonderful. Tinkerbell is done quite nicely as are all the fairies, mermaids, and pirates. Not too much with the Indian tribe, but Tiger Lily is properly feisty. The actor who plays Mr. Darling/Captain Hook is perfect. The director's vision for this movie was right on. This was an interesting mix of fantasy, humor, adventure and love. Really, this is a nicely done movie and I can't think of anything bad to say about it, except for the very end, when I thought Peter should be seen at the helm of the Pirate Ship. Other than that, bravo!!",Peter Pan
345,roxanne_z3,"Words alone don't do it justice, but I'll try",10,31 May 2005,"In this movie Peter Pan is not that flying happy kid we used to know. He has a complex character. There is a deep sadness and fear inside of him which in a way we all can relate to. He is a carefree and fearless boy on the outside, but he really is running away from his fears and real feelings. Characters are deeply shown in this movie; we can see who they really are and what each one of them symbolizes. I was amazed after seeing this movie. It can entertain people from all ages. It has action, adventure, comedy, and a beautiful romance. There are exotic characters such as flying children, fairies, mermaids, pirates, Indians, and the enchanting world of Neverland that is attractive to children and adult alike. Everyone does a great job at playing their parts. Jeremy Sumpter is perfect as Peter Pan, and Rachel Hurd-Wood was born to play Wendy. Jason Isaacs is a really powerful actor; he shows all aspects of Hook's character; From the lost boys to aunt Millicent All the characters are brilliant and hilarious. What really left me speechless and totally in love with this movie was the soundtrack. The music brings the movie to life. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard; It's sensational and marvelous. I really felt like I was flying to Neverland while listening to it; This is definitely James Newton Howard's best work yet. The legacy of Peter Pan is everlasting. The next generation will love this glorious story as much as we do. This movie isn't only for children; it's for everyone young, free, and adventurous at heart. Peter Pan 2003 with no doubt is one of the best novel adaptations of all times.",Peter Pan
346,Aniunia,Pretty darn good!,10,17 July 2006,"I was pleasantly surprised when i watched the movie! It was a very refreshing yet loyal story line which did justice to the renowned classic. Although i found it to be quite more graphic than i had imagined, and very sexual. It was well very done, but i would not recommend it for children under 10 years old. Another thing i noticed myself thinking while watching the movie was how absolutely cute the Peter Pan was! Although now he is 17 years old, he was only 14 when he filmed the movie..kinda makes me feel like a bit of a pedophile :S but i can't help it i like blond guys. All the characters were played out splendidly especially one of the lost boys who never failed to add in the much anticipated comic relief. Overall great movie!",Peter Pan

I thought Jason Isaacs did a terrific job as Hook and as far as Jeremy Sumpter goes as playing the titled role as Peter Pan, I thought he did amazing. Rachel Hurd-Wood playing Wendy was great for a newcomer in the entertainment business. PJ Hogan at his best! This is a fantastic movie to sit down and watch with your family! The imagination and creativity that PJ brought into this movie was just terrific. The special effects were great. It truly felt like you were in Neverland, along with London. This movie has a little bit of everything such as comedy and a lot of romance,action,adventure,pirates,friendship,and drama. Everything you want in a fantasy movie and thats what the actors gave you.

349,live4dancer24,It was the best! U have to see it,10,15 July 2004,Well i liked the movie a lot but the best part of the movie was Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan he was really good at the part (plus he's really cute) The worst part is that i wish i was Wendy but there really was no bad part about the movie besides that Tinkerbell was mean. I felt that i was in Never Never Land the whole time and that it was an exciting and fun filled adventure. I think that this movie was not just great for young kids but also teenagers and some adults. The actors in this movie had very much training i think that it would be a lot of work to be them. They had to learn how to fly and to fight and that must have been hard work and i really think it payed off.I really enjoyed this movie and i hope everybody else feels that way.,Peter Pan

Really all the things seemed to make this movie what it is, the beautiful sets, and the magical music,I could go on and on. There is one word to describe this movie and this is magical, everything about this makes it more and more magical,special, and different in it own unique way. This is a movie for both the old and young, it even appeals to teenagers, in the struggles that most teens face today, growing up, everyone in seems to have someone that they can relate to in Peter Pan.

351,LSkywalkerbabe,"really great, a video for the whole family",10,9 August 2004,"I think this was an outstanding movie. Maybe it's because I am not over 18 or possibly it's because of my love for the story of Peter Pan. If you have not read the book and are comparing this to Disney animated film you know nothing of what you are comparing it to. It was much more true to the book than any Peter Pan movie I have seen. I really love Jason Issacs as Hook because he is a great actor (also in Chamber of Secrets). Jeremy Sumpter was a very good Peter Pan because he had a lot of enthusiasm for the role. Rachel Hurd-Wood is a new comer so I didn't expect her to be perfect, but she shocked me with her talent. She was also very pretty. Olivia Williams was a very good Mrs. Darling, she is described in the book as a very pretty woman and she was. The Darling children did excellent as well. Smee was done pretty well and I liked how he spoke directly to the watcher. Ludivine Sagnier was a very good Tinkerbell. She did very well in her role and it was surprising how well she did knowing that she did not interact with any other actors/actresses.I thought this was a great film and as well as I enjoyed the film I enjoyed the music. That is the only music I can call pure talent because as a composer you have to be able to control the entire orchestra. I think this is a great family film and a very enjoyable story.The blue-screen work was outstanding as well, as most of the film was blue-screened.

353,italia3,lovely,10,23 August 2004,"PJ Hogan's adaptation of Peter Pan is a charming film. Done in a period fashion and sticking close to the book, it depicts what JM Barrie created as Neverland and characters better than the Disney version or any other i've seen.Jeremy Sumpter fits the role as a selfish and mischievous Peter. you can see his emotion in his face and his physicality throughout all of the dramatic scenes. and as Rachel Hurd-Wood's first film, she did a lovely job showing the struggle she has between leaving Peter to go home and staying in Neverland. Jason Isaacs does a nice Hook, but Mr Darling isn't featured very much. Olivia Williams is one of the best parts of the film as a beautiful and charming Mrs Darling.The scenery of Pan also helps to create the fantasy world that Barrie wrote of. the effects, especially of flying, are also very well done. the score fits very well, with a few recurring themes throughout the film, and actually, the techno sound of a few tracks fits well to the fantasy world that is supposed to be portrayed. in short, a wonderful film, not only for family, but for anyone.",Peter Pan

This movie gives a more accurate account of the story that Barrie wrote than any other with a little added romance to appeal to teens as well as adventure that children will enjoy. The story is along the lines of what you thought it to be , but with richer detail and it contains more about feelings and why you would not want to grow up. I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age. It is a timeless classic brought to life for the whole family to enjoy.

360,bamabelle1017,Amazing!!!!!,10,18 December 2004,"I am amazed at this movie! I loved the Disney Peter Pan movie, but this movie just blew my mind. It was so close to the book and play, it was almost as the author directed it himself. The special effects were incredible. And the acting! Jeremy Sumpter made the best Peter Pan. I love how he conveys the change of emotion in his face. You see and feel everything that the character feels. He looks and acts as though he stepped right out of the book. The other actors were perfectly suited for their roles as well, but Olivia Williams was wonderfully delightful as Mrs. Darling. The music should be consider a character in this movie as well. It was the best I've heard in a long time. I give this movie a 10 because it was done well enough to be understood on a child's level but also has the dynamics that capture an adult's interest. I love it!!!",Peter Pan

The first time i saw it i was amazed and then i kept on watching it over and over again,every time i cried because of the heart break of Peter Pan. I just watched it a couple days ago for the first time and i have seen it everyday ever since, and every time i was touched. I am definitely going to be getting this movie. The actors are very gifted and i found out that they are all around my age. This astonished me because they looked so young in the movie but when i looked closer i saw that they did look older at sometimes. And yet again i will say that this movie was the best movie i have ever seen and the most touching!",Peter Pan
363,SlowXRS,Jeremy,10,18 January 2005,"Jeremy Sumpter is a wise choice by P.J.(director) to play the role of Peter in the film Peter Pan. This film is my favorite movie so I rate it a score of 10. Jeremy Sumpter really shines as an actor in this film. In a sense he is the one along side Jason Issacs that really makes this movie a success. The plot and story of Peter Pan the movie and the book are parallel. I am glad P.J. worked it like that. In my life I have few role models that I am able to look up to. After I viewed this film Jeremy Sumpter entered my life and became my role model. This movie is magic and very powerful. I am very glad I viewed the film and got introduced to the fine people in it. I do not know Jeremy personally, I wish I could. It would be a pleasure to know him. In a way, it is my dream to meet him and become part of his life as he has mine. I never looked up to someone in such great respect and admireablity. I believe that Jeremy will go far in life. I just wish I could be a part of it.-- Tony Smith(16) of Sanford, NC",Peter Pan
364,mark_arthur,"A great story, & great effects, but...",7,27 February 2005,"I have never seen or read Peter Pan in any form before, so this was a treat. It brought back ancient memories of incomprehensible Disney rides and finally filled in the definition of ""Peter Pan complex"". I saw this after seeing ""Finding Neverland"", and I was generally excited and pleased by the film. But, I did find Jeremy Sumpter's persona surprisingly flat, and I thought Rachel Hurd-Woods had rather too voluptuous a face for her supposed age. Otherwise, though, the flying sequences are great, the sets terrific, and the writing witty enough for actual adults. Too bad Jeremy wasn't more electric, as kids that age can really be.",Peter Pan
365,jimc1990,Fantastic,9,27 February 2005,"I completely enjoyed the movie. The special effects and backgrounds were breathtaking. The actors did a superb job at making the characters come alive to an extent like never before. I especially enjoyed the scene where everyone said, ""I do believe in fairies! I do! I do!"" I had to watch that again after it ended, especially when Peter yelled and flew up to fight Hook again. I can still hear the music... oh the music was awesome. I've seen many movies in my short existence, and I'm going to make a special effort to get the soundtrack. With it, I could feel the magic. The backgrounds are incredible. I loved the skies, the black castle, and the forest. My favorite was, though, the battle in the stars with Hook and Pan. I had to watch that again also; I loved the clouds and the endless stars. :) I always hated the part in the story of Peter Pan when he leaves and Wendy grows up, though. You know, that's very sad, but if Wendy actually existed... I know she'd cherish the adventures she had had in Never Never Land. I know I won't forget watching this awesome film, and in a way it will never grow up. I will show it to my children, and I hope the story will be passed on again to another generation. The story of Peter Pan is timeless, and the film portrayed that fantastically.",Peter Pan
366,josephsr-1,An enjoyment,10,18 June 2005,"Peter Pan is the best magical movie yet. Entrancing people of all ages, this movie is the top of my list and I watch it as often as possible. Being 13, I love the movie and have rented the movie from the shops for an extra week as I love this movie, especially the actor, Jeremy Sumpter. His smile will put all girls in a trance and I don't blame them. Rachael Hurd-Wood is a very good actress herself and is lucky to be on the set.I think that the effort and time put into this movie is all worth it and I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone! Thankyou to everyones part in the movie as I would be quite lost without it. As I myself have to go and watch the movie, my last few words are, and I hope Jeremy Sumpter reads this, you are cute and your smile just melts anyone! Visit Australia sometime and you won't be disappointed as Australia is full of chicks.",Peter Pan
367,wildestangel_2000,A true classic for the next generation,10,3 October 2006,"I expected beauty from this movie certainly. The previews when it first came out were absolutely dazzling to behold. What I found was so much more. This new Peter Pan is the classic. This is the version I hope to show to my children when I tell them about the story of Peter and Wendy. I've always been a large Disney fan; however, the animated version of this movie has just never quite pulled me in. When I learned of a live action adaptation with a boy playing Peter, I was intrigued. Then, like I said, the imagery from the trailers sealed it for me. I had to see this movie. So, I did. I rented it, brought it home, popped it in the DVD player, and I was hooked. Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan was a wonderful choice. He's young, handsome, and quite confident. I thought he was a more than believable choice for the character. At that age, he still had a child's mischievous glint in his eyes; yet, at times the adolescent chemistry between he and Rachel Hurd-Wood was almost palpable. What a wonderful pair. The romance between the two was just the kind of first that every young girl or boy should experience. It was sweet, innocent, and full of wonder. The soundtrack is mostly instrumental, and in my opinion, sets exactly the right tone and mood for each scene. Not to mention Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy: spectacular casting in that instance. Sensational debut for such an obviously sweet, guileless young girl. She captures everything I always envisioned for a live action Wendy. Rachel has a sort of tenderness about her that makes it easy to envision her as a little mother hen. She's got a young girl's love of fairy tales, which, when coupled with her love of adventure and action, makes her all the more sweet and endearing to the audience.I'm 22 years old, and every time I watch the scene of Peter leading Wendy and the boys to Neverland, I still experience what can only be described as childlike wonder and joy. It's easily one of my top ten favorite movies. I thought it was nice that Jason Isaacs played the dual roles of Mr. Darling and Captain Hook as has always been the tradition. In a nutshell, I feel like a child every time I see this movie. The feeling is wonderful. It's full of discovery, awe, innocence, cockiness, etc...all those wonderful attributes children possess. Like I said, this is the version I want my children to grow up on.",Peter Pan
368,devilish_lil_angel_21,Very Delighted,10,8 July 2005,"The story of Peter Pan always entranced me. This is such a classic story, and this movie is excellent. I really liked the actors that were casted. This just goes to show you can have a cute funny movie meant for children, without sneaking in a bunch of subtle sexual references. I'm also glad they stuck with the original story, instead of ruining it by adding weird twists, as they sometimes do. Especially the part about Hook being played by the same actor as Wendy's father. This is definitely a movie I wouldn't mind to watch more then once. And I suppose it doesn't hurt that every girl wishes Jeremy Sumpter would come after her like that",Peter Pan
369,rrju-13502,"Peter Pan takes Wendy Darling and siblings to Nerverland, where the adventure with the Lost Boys, Tinker Bell, battle the evil Captain Hook.",9,29 September 2015,"Wouldn't it be amazing if you could be a child forever, you would not have a worry in the world, and all you get to do is adventure with your friends all day? Well in Neverland you can. Peter Pan (2003) tells the story of a boy who lives in this fantasy world. Sounds like a dream life, right? No rules, supervision, or worries! It all seems like that until he shows up at Wendy Darling's bedroom window. He takes her and her siblings to Neverland where they go on magical adventures and have a victorious dual over the evil Captain James Hook. In the end, no matter how bad Peter wants Wendy to stay, she knows she must go, she must grow up. He realizes then that even though he is the great Peter Pan, he has to grow up. If you enjoy adventure, fantasy, and a fairytale that teaches you to cherish your childhood, then you will definitely enjoy Peter Pan a much as I did.This film teaches us many lessons. The main one is no matter how badly we would like to stay young forever, we have to grow up sometime, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Another lesson it teaches children is that they should cherish their childhood because it all goes by in a flash. Many of us struggle with these lessons as did Peter Pan in the film. None of us want to face the reality that one day we're going to have to get up early everyday to go to work, pay bills, and live in the real world. In my opinion, since he was a child for so long it kind of devalues his childhood. It's supposed to be quick and fun. You're supposed to have the best time of your life before you enter the real world. The film teaches lessons that I would share with my children: to cherish your childhood, but when the time comes to grow up, there is no escaping it. However, you will always have those memories of your childhood. In a way it makes those memories a little sweeter, rather then having to relive them over and over in Neverland and them losing their luster. So I thank Peter Pan, for helping me realize that as dull as life may get as an adult, it's part of life, and we need to cherish our childhood and adulthood because it all goes by quickly.One aspect of the film that I found particularly interesting was that Captain Hook, who was played by Jason Issacs, was also the role of Mr. Darling! To me it seems as if the director in the movie was trying to send message to the audience. The message that I interpreted from this is that we all have a father figure in our life, even if you think you don't there is always some there to teach you lessons, help you mature, and have a great influence on your life. Captain Hook did all of these things for Peter, even though it might not seem that way. Once you look past all the battles they went through, it is clear Hook had a huge influence on Peter's life such as a father would.In my opinion, this film was very good and a great lesson to children of all ages. It's more of a family oriented film, something that you would watch with small children. They would definitely enjoy all of the special effects such as flying, and how through these effects it makes Neverland look like a magical and very real place. They will also enjoy characters such as Tinker Bell, after little girls watch her they will be wanting to be a fairy just like her. Captain Hook his sometimes goofy and unorthodox ways of running his ship can provide comic relief to the evil side of him. The Lost Boys which all young boys can relate to as their crazy group of friends that they adventure with. Overall it is a very fun, magical, heartwarming, and in some ways relatable movie for all that can tug at your heart strings and give you great exhilaration. I highly suggest this film to anyone, especially those who enjoy fantasy films.",Peter Pan
370,JordanSkywalker,Oh Grow Up!!!,1,29 August 2005,"May have a few spoilers for people who didn't see this, but be warned it's not worth your time. So read at your own risk: I saw this version of ""Peter Pan"" today. Let me start by saying I've seen the Walt Disney animated version, ""Hook"", and ""Mary Martin as Peter Pan"", and ""Finding Neverland"" (Which is not really a Peter Pan film, but has scenes of Neverland.) I would have to say this is the worst movie I've seen in years. I had heard about it a few years before it came out to theaters, and after awhile forgot about it, a few days ago I saw it for rent, and decided I would like to see it, since I'm running out of new films to see. My brother and Roommate (who is a big fan of Peter Pan) weren't sure at first if they wanted to watch it from the front cover. I kept telling them this was the 'True' version and was going to be the best version they had seen. (I was on the IMDb.com reading reviews). So they gave in and I opened the DVD player tray and in it went. First the menu screen plays a scene from the movie, (the part where Peter, Wendy and her brothers are flying to Neverland with the planets in the background.) My brother started laughing and said the special effects looked cheap. I told him to stop it, that there was more to movies than special effects, and that the makers wanted to focus more on the script and overall story. After saying this I pressed 'PLAY' and that's when things really started getting bad. It starts out where you see a CGI looking house and then the same old Peter Pan story starts and goes on, I felt like I was watching the same old Peter Pan movies, only this time filmed poorly with some of the worst special effects ever put to screen. The children actors are so sick! I wish I could have slapped Peter Pan right in the face. All Wendy seems to think about is growing up, and wants Peter to come back with her home. (Like, how was she going to tell her parents about the boy in the leaf outfit!) The script is bad, even for a children's film (which I'm guessing this was meant to be.) Captain Hook was so silly, and looked like a fool. I hated him. My roommate kept asking me how long it was, yes a big Peter Pan fan, can't watch trash like this. You couldn't choose a favorite scene because the whole movie was bad in every way possible! The color of the film in the end fight scene keeps changing from blue to red. It hurts your eyes, and looks so cheap. Really what was the budget on this? They must have used all the money on the cheap effects. I bet the kid actors did this for free, I can't see why they should get a check for their poor acting. It's an all around bad film. Why would anyone like this, they ruined the whole Neverland idea, this was the worst Neverland since Michael Jackson's home. Everything was evil, even the mermaids were killers that wished only to drown people, it was like a horror ad, with these weird woman with evil teeth and eyes and claw type arms. Kids don't like movies like this. Why were they trying to make it out to be a children's romance?? It was so bad. The people who thought of this really should be lined up, and shot. It's just so sick. The whole scene with Hook flying was just... HELP! I hated it. My roommate and brother said next time they would be choosing the movie, because they couldn't sit through more things like that. They now tease me, about how much I must have liked it, since I was talking about how good it was going to be. Don't be fooled by the title, it's the worst film of it's kind. The Tinker Bell character was destroyed! In this version Peter Pan is a boy who takes little girls to his dangerous home and drops them once he gets there. He throws Tinker Bell for no reason, and beats on just about anyone helpless. He even at one point plans to kill all the lost boys, Wendy talks him out of it. OK so it could have been a joke, but how are people to know? The acting is so wooden you don't know what the characters are feeling. All in all, it was bad.Jordan",Peter Pan
371,emperorlightning,Where's the pixie dust?,1,31 August 2005,"Let this be a warning to anyone who hasn't seen this Peter Pan yet. The film is totally flat. As for the acting, let me just say I've seen trees less wooden. Jeremy Sumpter as Peter is a complete nightmare! He's like the worst child actor in the universe. His voice is just weird, should have casted a British kid in the role. What was Jason Isaacs thinking when he signed on to play two roles? He handles the Mr. Darling father character as a weak nervous nerd, with cartoon type stage acting. Was it comedy? I wasn't laughing. As for his role as Captain Hook, the only praise I could give him is he didn't look like the same guy as the father. Hook is a cod fish not a clown fish. His make up was way overboard, he needed a dress to go with that wavy hair. The acting ruins the movie, which could have been descent if the script writing could have been improved. I feel really sorry for James Newton Howard who wrote the background soundtrack for the movie. He seems to have a gift for picking projects that turn out to be lameo. Six people are listed for casting, I can't see how that many people picked so many bad choices. Maybe one casting person would have been more clear on finding right kids for the roles. The Special Effects aren't very real, I would have thought the company that did this (ILM) would have been able to match what they did in films like Pirates of the Caribbean and the three new Star Wars flicks. We're talking about effects that would stick out bad in a 2D animated movie. But really even if the effects are so bad as they are, the acting and writing could have been easily improved, P.J. Hogan must have used the first draft he wrote. They should have had six writers and one casting person. Big mistake that cost this Peter Pan to fall from the sky.",Peter Pan
372,kirkturnsthewheel,Peter Pan is awful .,1,1 September 2005,"Here is what I have to say: 1. Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan. It has to be said, regardless of his background as an actor, he couldn't act. For being around 14, he looked much younger, and came out as a whiny wimpy sissy shrimp. Walt Disney's Peter Pan may not have been ""just like the book"" but I liked the character a whole lot more. For one thing Disney's pan came off as a good leader to the lost boys, and made sport of Hook all the time. He was a child, who didn't want to grow up. not some kid with feelings for a little brat girl. Jeremy is not Peter Pan.2. Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy. She doesn't have the Wendy look first of all. There's no magic in her eyes, she looks like she was having a very hard time acting through this movie. It must be hard to try to act, with no experience, but I think a few months in acting school should have been a must. It wasn't fair to put an unknown in a role so well loved like Wendy. I know most kid actors grow up far to fast to be able to call them ""great child actors"", but I know of a few girls who could have done better, of course they are a little too old for the role now. I just think she played Wendy with one thing, she wanted to grow-up and have a boy friend. It was fake.3. Jason Isaacs in the role of the great Captain Hook. Hook... part bad guy, part comedy is one of the famous pirates in kid stories. I grew up pretending to be him. He was a fun character. Jason acts his way through this movie, taking far to seriously. When ever a Hook joke comes up, I don't think he understood it. He acts like he's half drank all the time too. For the moment I saw him in the first scene I know he wasn't right for the role. Looks like he can now stay being known for Harry Potter.4. Script writing didn't make it. Why did Hook want to kill John and Michael? It was never explained, I know this is a kids movie, but some thought needed to be put in the script.5. Neverland seemed too fake. Why was it always night? I didn't care for all the computer work, I think there are some great places in New Zealand that would make the perfect Neverland. More location filming should have been done, as the movie looks like it was shot in a set.6. The music. It was like everything else that had been written in past Peter Pan movies, with a hint of Lord of the Rings. I think it could have been better.7. The indians. One of my favorite parts of Neverland was the indians. The chief of the tribe was left out. Tiger-Lilly didn't look right. More time with the Indians should have been used.I wish I could say I enjoyed it, I really thought it had promise to be good. At least the Walt Disney one is still around. Let you're kids watch Walt Disney's Peter Pan and Return to Neverland. Those are classics when you compare them with this.",Peter Pan
373,whatever_man05,it was a good movie but most girls will think Jeremy Sumpter's hot!!!,10,4 August 2005,"I think the movie was a good movie with lots of stuff to point out but i think some girls would think who cares about the movie when you could care about Jeremy Sumpter. I think the director made a good movie but with the girls who think that Jeremy Sumpter is hot they aren't really gonna care about the movie. My friend, Jamie, all she could think about was Jeremy. By the end of the movie, i asked her what did she think about the movie all she said was what movie because she spent most of her time looking at Jeremy. I won't say that he's not cute but still most girls will think about Jeremy more than they will the movie. some girls might like the movie more than him i'm just saying some girls like him more than the movie.",Peter Pan
374,outbackaussie16,I tried to like it but I can't - A fan of The Pan,1,5 September 2005,"Peter Pan was my first hero, growing up I would run around the house wearing a play dagger, and carrying a flashlight, that served as Tinkerbell. It was for the sake of my childhood, that I tried to like this film. I can't, it's not a gem. The film like most stories of The Pan, opens at the home of the Darling Family. Wendy and her brothers John and Michael are at play, I was taken back by this scene. Wendy for the most part seems miscast, John is doing his best to look like the animated one from Disney , but this doesn't hold up when he begins to speak, little Michael is far to old to be the youngest of the Darling Children. Then comes Aunt Millsent, {Lynn Redgrave} who was made up for the film, the point of this character seems to be that she rules over Mr. Darling, and what she says goes. So when she says Wendy needs to grow up, Wendy is going to grow up. Now I don't think this character was needed, all she does is make a weakling out of Mr Darling {Jason Isaacs}, which I don't feel was ever part of his character. I can't say I was impressed with any member of the Darling Family, the acting on all parts seems strained, it's just not believable that they are a family. But I still was holding out for Peter, as he is the heart of the story. I was more than let down by the first meeting between Peter and Wendy. Peter {Jeremy Stumper}acts like he is the boy who lives down the road, not The Pan form Neverland. When Wendy {Rachel Hund-Wood} says ""Boy why are you crying?"", I couldn't help but feel it must have been a first take, she just doesn't seem like Wendy, maybe the director {P.J. Hogan} is to blamed for this, I don't find the actors know how to play out the scenes, or their characters. Now when Peter says ""Oh, the cleverness of me."" it hits like a poor joke, I can understand trying to stay true to the works of J.M. Barrie, but it makes no sense to put in new characters, and use outdated dialog. When the three children and Peter, go flying through London, it's not much of a scene, you don't really see them fly over any landmarks of the city, such as Tower Bridge or Big Ben. Still this didn't prepare me for the ""Off to Neverland"" scene, when Peter yells for Wendy, John, and Michael, to hold on, as they start to pass, plastic looking planets. This scene doesn't make you feel like it's Neverland time, it seems fake, and badly outdated.Now I have to say this, the characters never really look like they are flying, it's more like they are floating, or swimming, given the date on this film, I would have thought this would not have been a problem, but the flying in ""Superman"" looked better, and that was made ages ago! Another big let down is Hook. {Also played by Jason Isaacs} In his first scene he is shirtless, covered in a mess of flowing hair, hanging over a desk. {Now I always thought Hook wore a long hair pirate wig} He's not even wearing his hook, which I found poor taste, as who want's to see a stump, where his hook should be? Even when he does put on a hook {he has many, and changes it a few time}, it looks sort of the wrong shape. I don't know, he just wasn't the Hook, I'm use to. I didn't care for this version of Smee either, he didn't show good humor, and looked poorly made-up. The""Jolly Roger"", wasn't much of a ship, I've seen a lot of high sea films, and this ship wasn't on the top ten list. So, the film just sort of goes on, and I can't say I ever found it witty, or sad, or even fun viewing. I'm very indifferent to the ending of the film, it is stated that Wendy never saw Peter Pan again, now this isn't keeping with the story of J.M. Barrie, who says at the end of his works, that The Pan visited Wendy, after she grew up, and takes her daughter Jane to Neverland, and when Jane is grown Peter takes her daughter and so on it goes. I'm guessing the film changed this because they played up on Peter and Wendy as a somewhat would be romance, I guess they felt that making Wendy never see Peter again would get some tears out of the audience, but it seemed off key to me. I don't think this film is a timeless treasure, it doesn't leave you with anything but a hope that someday, someone will do a remake, and hit the mark.",Peter Pan

Rachel Hurd Wood really stands out as Wendy and she is definitely a promising young actress. Sumpter is not as good but he is pretty decent. Jason Issacs is the man. after playing hardcore roles like Tavington(the Patriot) and Capt.Steele(Black Hawk Down)he brings a great humor to the role of Mr. Darling and is very believable as Hook. I've seen a lot of Disney movies and many can't even compare to this. the music is good, the acting is good. There are also awesome special effects- London Neverland, and tinker look great.

As screenit.com gave it a completely clean bill of health in this area, I was able to sit back and enjoy...until I came to the extras. After three bouts of swearing by actor Jason Isaacs (Mr. Darling/Capt. Hook) in the first few minutes, I stopped watching. He seemed so obsessed with his own self-importance that he forgot he was working on a children's film.The film itself was much as you would expect, well made and with a lot of good special effects. As usual, a children's film that is full of magick. Try finding any other sort. The star of the show? Richard Briers as Smee, of course! Oh, and the parrot.",Peter Pan
377,J-M-Pallo,How and why Wendy has lost her childhood innocence. . .,8,28 November 2005,"When thinking about P. J. Hogan's Peter Pan, many would think that the important character is Peter Pan. But, it is really Wendy who is the major character going through the most changes. Throughout the film, Wendy begins to discover herself emotionally and sexually. P. J. Hogan secretly puts this into film and it is not easily discovered. This film review will convey why Wendy is at a loss of innocence in her life.Compared to the Disney film Peter Pan, the film is much more suggestive that Wendy is growing up and losing her innocence. When Peter found out that Wendy must grow up, he invites her to Never Land. When Wendy agreed to go, she had no idea she was losing her innocence, as well as her chance to grow up.After arriving in Never Land, Wendy soon becomes infatuated with Peter. She is interested in him romantically. Wendy has never liked a boy the way she liked Peter, therefore, Wendy is losing her innocence in Never Land. She finds secret ways to tell Peter that she likes him. She even disguises the word ""kiss"", so that Peter does not know what she is talking about. In the Disney classic, Peter and Wendy are just playmates. But, in Hogan's version, they are much more. At the end of the film, Wendy does kiss Peter and he kisses her back. After the kiss, Wendy knows it is now time to grow up. It can be easily said, that Wendy finding herself emotionally and sexually is why she decided it was okay to grow up. That is also the reason why Wendy's childhood innocence is now gone and she became a young lady.",Peter Pan

I've always loved the story of Peter Pan and to see Jeremy Sumpter as Peter doing such a great job, portraying the mischievous boy as quirky and cocky,wonderful, and he is so cute!! I watched it twice in one day. It just makes me feel like I was a kid again. I was swept away by it. I also thought this one more sad than any other Peter Pan renditions, to show the true feelings with such a kiss, and then to never see him again... it's just tragic that the first person she fell in love with, she can never have! Over all, very entertaining. Loved the fights between Pan and Hook, one of my favorite parts of the movie!! ""Ready to lose the other one?"" Just great, loved the witty banter between them! Wonderful!!!",Peter Pan
379,ohkeefe,Brilliant Movie,10,11 December 2005,"This is my favorite movie of all time. I first saw it in theaters on the recommendation of my older sister and I am glad I did. I definitely recommend it. I would not advise it for young children though. It deals with some fairly heavy themes that might be too intense and it is much darker than, say, the Disney version of Peter Pan. I think the casting was wonderfully done, the actor who plays Peter is perfectly impish. The scenery especially in Neverland is wonderfully done and helps to convey the magical world in which Peter lives. No matter how many times I watch this movie I still find it deeply moving. All in all, watch this movie.",Peter Pan
380,Egoist_Nr1,Peter Pan / Jeremy Sumpter,10,19 December 2005,"Magical film and Peter Pan has never been so popular before this production. AND OH MY GOOD Jeremy Sumpter is the best young actor i seen on many years. His emotions he shows are awesome and i have never seen a boy whit so much talent, charm and character. He was perfect for the film! Unfortely i had never seen Jeremy ever in my life before. So i can't comment his other films. This is a movie every one how likes a little bite fantasy should have in their home. Its a children's movie who are so good so every on in every age would love it. The movie was well done and its was sometimes little to much computer anime* but its was't something who's disturbed the rest of the film. Sorry for my grammar I'm from Sweden so you know. Merry Christmas to you all //Malin",Peter Pan
381,chuckm762,Couldn't agree more - Thanks HermioneSnape!,9,20 January 2006,"The comments entered by HermioneSnape are VERY accurate (and distinctly written). I can honestly say I agree totally with every thing she (he?) has written about this version of ""Peter Pan""This is the standard against all future versions will be measured! Excellent move and not just for kids - grown ups will love it also!The only sad part of this story is how little fanfare was made of the movie by the general public. Critics loved it and it did well (ok) but did not garnish near the publicity it should (could) have. I would say this was due to the competition that year (Lord of the Rings, et al.)Still - do yourself and everyone else in your family a HUGE favor and RENT THIS MOVIE TONIGHT!!!TC Chuckm762",Peter Pan
382,januarygirl94,Fantastic,10,15 April 2006,"This is an amazing movie! It is 1000% my favorite movie EVER!!!! It's magical and it you makes laugh, cry, and always keeps your interest. In the past two days I have watched Peter Pan four times, and I'm still not bored of it! This movie makes you wish that you were Wendy and got to do all those wonders. For example: flying. To be able to fly would be amazing, and Peter Pan captures that perfectly. I personally think that J.M. Barrie would be proud of how marvelous this movie is! With the fantasy, fighting, flying, comedy and sheer pleasure, Peter Pan is definitely a movie that the whole family will love! Rent it or buy it on DVD, because this is a movie you won't want to miss! I truly hope that you enjoy Peter Pan as much as I did!",Peter Pan
