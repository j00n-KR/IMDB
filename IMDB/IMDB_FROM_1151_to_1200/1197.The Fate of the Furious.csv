0,Leofwine_draca,Third in a row of entertaining film sequels,6,9 December 2017,"The FAST & THE FURIOUS film franchise has a chequered history for me. I didn't like the first film much and though the next two sequels were pitiful. The fourth and fifth films were merely average and not worth watching twice. Since part six, however, I've enjoyed the ensemble aspect of these movies, and the mix of action staples with car chases and large scale mayhem. FAST & FURIOUS 8 carries on that trend, another huge international adventure with a couple of minor original twists and lots of action.The emoting in between the action and the acting from some of the main players (I'm looking at you, Michelle Rodriguez and Vin Diesel) isn't too great, but at other times this film shines. The two best actors are undoubtedly The Rock and Jason Statham, and their butting-head humour is a highlight. The prison fight scene is the best in the film, but for sheer excess, the CGI-enhanced spectacle in New York takes some beating. The rest will win no awards for wit or originality, and Helen Mirren's awful acting takes some beating, but Charlize Theron is a decent villain and the laughs come thick and fast.",The Fate of the Furious
1,SnoopyStyle,action delivery system,6,6 August 2017,"Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) are in Cuba. He's approached by new villain Cipher (Charlize Theron) to turn against the family. Soccer dad Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has a new assignment. He calls back everybody for the job but Dom goes rogue and steals the EMP device for Cipher. Hobbs is sent to prison where Deckard (Jason Statham) is imprisoned. The two men escape and Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) gathers the group for their next mission.The story almost doesn't matter anymore in this franchise. It's cars, hot bods, and outrageous action. I don't even think the almighty family matters either. It's a mantra that becomes meaningless if one digs too deeply. This franchise has become nothing more than an action delivery system. The collection of action figure roles have made this almost bulletproof.",The Fate of the Furious
2,boblipton,Vroom And Vroom,3,19 December 2020,"Where did they film the sequence of the guys popping up with Gatling guns from the roof of a limousine to fire on street traffic? Was it Atlanta or Cleveland? Did the locals think that there was anything odd about that? How about when it started raining cars onto the sparse traffic below? I know this series likes its practical effects, feeling that, as in other entries, having cars come out of a plane's cargo bay at 30,000 feet cannot be believably done in CGI. I agree. There are lots of things you can say that of. Mutilating your own genitals, say, or swallowing a live cobra. I'm sure you can add to the list. Don't feel you have to on my account. Or think that any of it makes for a good movie.The fiscal success of this franchise means they can hire an ever-expanded cast of solid and even excellent performers. Helen Mirren appears in a nice role here, although she does not appear on the cast list. I imagine that was her choice.",The Fate of the Furious
3,Prismark10,Riding along,6,12 April 2017,"Fast & Furious 8 actually starts out on the streets of Cuba with some street racing as Dom is on honeymoon with Letty. Pretty soon a cyber terrorist known as Cipher (Charlize Theron) forcibly persuades Dom into working for her and betray his comrades. What is it that she has got on him?Dom's action lands Hobbs in jail, right in the opposite cell of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the big bad from the last film. Mr Nobody (Kurt Russell) also returns from the last movie and reluctantly teams up these two nemesis and together with Dom's crew they go hunting for Dom. Rookie assistant of Mr Nobody (Scott Eastwood) joins up with the team and is the butt of the jokes when they tire of teasing Roman.Like the previous few instalments this is a multi national ride, as we go from Cuba to Germany, the streets of New York and then Russia for the finale. The story might not always make sense but this is a big dumb action movie which at least entertains.The best part of the film is the driver-less cars being hacked but the CGI could had been better.The film does miss the late Paul Walker who always provided the heart of the film, his role in someways moves to Eastwood. It is left to Hobbs and Deckard to provide the acidic humour.",The Fate of the Furious
4,nogodnomasters,Looking at you dead in the eye,8,5 July 2017,"The series continues starting out in Havana showing us what a nice guy we have in Dom (Vin Diesel). After a quick meeting with Cipher (Charlize Theron) Dom goes rogue and helps the bad guys steal various weapons and codes so Cipher can have nukes. The action changes to New York City and then ice covered Ladovin, Russia.Bad Guy Jason Statham joins the group. The film had numerous memorable scenes and lines. Most of the laws of physics were violated for our entertainment. The film incorporates the recent revelation that US intelligence agency can spy on people with any device and can remotely control cars and vehicles. It takes this information to an inane degree with dozens of vehicles operating in precision unity. The remote control submarine is clearly not feasible. And I don't know of any subs that have an R-73 type heat seeking missile...torpedo yes, missile no.Helen Mirren in a small role. Scott Eastwood plays Kurt Russell's sidekick.Oh yea, there is a family message include in all the insane action.Guide: No sex or nudity. 1 quick F-word- NYC scene.",The Fate of the Furious
5,kosmasp,Fate is coming for you,6,5 August 2017,"The pinnacle has been reached. It's still a lot of fun to watch this, but there is a certain degree of ""whatever"" involved. Having said, there is the concentration of a lot of people in this and you probably have at least one favorite. I'd argue that Statham and The Rock steal the show. The former probably a bit more having the best lines in the movie arguably I'd say.Charlize is a new addition though her story line reminded me a bit of what had been done in XXX Part 3. And if you want a fun out there movie which still feels fresh, you may wanna take a look at that movie. That was fun and had Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa to sport ... Not to mention some great action sequences. You do have some ridiculous stunts here. I'm certainly not going to be the one who decides if you watch this or not ... just don't expect too much ...",The Fate of the Furious
6,lee_eisenberg,pure brain candy,5,20 January 2018,"""The Fate of the Furious"" is the first movie from the Fast & Furious franchise that I've seen since the original. The original was a focus on street racing, padded with some high action. By now, the series is pure brain candy: lots of explosions and lots of destruction. Basically, the purpose is for the characters - especially Vin Diesel - to kick some serious ass. No need for anything even resembling character development.It was neat to get to see Charlize Theron get to play a villain. Her character is one nasty gal. It was also a pleasant surprise to see Helen Mirren; I mean, who ever imagined the woman who won an Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth appearing in an action flick? (although she did also star in ""RED"" with Bruce Willis) I guess that Vin Diesel will now have to co-star with Maggie Smith, maybe even in a costume drama. I'd also accept seeing Michelle Rodriguez in a period piece.Anyway, the movie is what it is. Pretty neat to see filming locations as different as Iceland and Cuba (I wonder what the Castro brothers thought of such a movie getting filmed in their country).",The Fate of the Furious
7,jboothmillard,Fast & Furious 8,6,14 April 2020,"This was the eighth entry in the non-stop high-octane franchise, and the first (since Tokyo Drift) not to feature Paul Walker, following his tragic death during the making of Furious 7, but there are still no signs that the series is slowing down, directed by F. Gary Gray (The Negotiator, Law Abiding Citizen, Straight Outta Compton). Basically, following the defeat of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) and Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou), Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) are on their honeymoon in Havana. Dom's cousin Fernando (Janmarco Santiago) gets in trouble owing money to local racer and loan shark Raldo (Celestino Cornielle). Dom challenges Raldo to a race, pitting Fernando's reworked car against Raldo's, and wagering his own Third Generation Chevrolet Impala. Dom narrowly wins the high-speed race, but allows Raldo to keep his car, earning his respect, and instead leaves his cousin with his car. The next day, Dom is approached by criminal mastermind and cyberterrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron), who, by showing him an unseen photo, forces him into working for her. Shortly after, Dom and his team: Letty, Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), are recruited. They are assigned by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) to help retrieve an EMP device from a military outpost in Berlin. During the getaway, Dom goes rogue, forcing Hobbs off the road and stealing the device for Cipher. Hobbs is arrested and locked up in the same high-security prison as Shaw. After Shaw and Hobbs both escape the prison, they are recruited by intelligence operative Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and his protégé Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood) to help the team find Dom and capture Cipher. Shaw reveals that Cipher had hired his brother Owen (Luke Evans) to steal the Nightshade device and Mose Jakande to steal God's Eye, Ramsey's software program. Dom and Cipher are tracked down, but the base the team are injured during an attack on the location base, allowing God's Eye to be stolen. Roman suggests bringing Brian in to help them, but Letty reminds them they agreed not to bring him and Mia into any more missions for the sake of their children. When Dom questions Cipher's motives, she reveals that she has got Dom's ex-lover and DSS agent Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) hostage, and their son, who Dom was unaware of. Elena tells Dom that she wants him to decide the child's first name. In New York City, Cipher sends Dom to retrieve a nuclear device contained in a briefcase held by the Russian Minister of Defense (Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa). Before the theft, with some help from Raldo, Dom evades Cipher, hacking the various CCTV sources, to meet with Shaw's mother Magdalene (Dame Helen Mirren), persuading her to help him. Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of many cars, causing them to disable the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Shaw in the process. Letty tries to reason with Dom, but Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes (Game of Thrones' Kristofer Hivju), ambushes and nearly kills her, Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of a helpless Dom. Cipher retaliates by having Rhodes execute Elena in front of a helpless Dom. At a base in Russia, Dom activates the EMP device to disable the security system and a nuclear submarine, enabling Cipher to hijack it to use its weapons to trigger a nuclear war. The team once again intercepts, who attempt to shut down the sub, and use cars to block the gates, preventing the sub from leaving into open waters. Meanwhile, Shaw, who faked his death, teams up with Owen, and at their mother's behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Shaw reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, before re-joining his team. Infuriated, Cipher fires a homing missile at Dom, but in his car, he manoeuvres it away from his team, and causes it to hit the submarine instead. The team quickly form a vehicle blockade around Dom, shielding him from the explosion fire. As Shaw reaches the front of the plane and confronts Cipher, she jumps from the plane with a parachute. Mr. Nobody and his protégé visit Dom and his team in New York City to report that Cipher is still at large in Athens. Hobbs is offered his job back at the DSS, but he turns it down to spend more time with his daughter. Shaw puts his differences with Dom and Hobbs aside, and delivers Dom his son. Dom names his son Brian, after his friend and brother-in-law Brian O'Conner, and he and his friends celebrate. Also starring Patrick St. Esprit as DS Allan and Luke Hawx as Miller. Diesel is interesting going rogue and betraying his friends, Johnson and Statham are good as the bickering heavyweights, and Theron is a suitably nasty villain. The story is just about different to what we've seen before, the hacking element is certainly interesting, there are obviously the over-the-top moments that border on ridiculous (cruise controlled cars being hacked and driven?), but the many cool cars, race and chase sequences, including across the ice, and the exciting stunts make all worthwhile, an pretty entertaining action thriller. Good!",The Fate of the Furious
8,Tweekums,Fast & Furious 8,8,24 November 2018,"This juggernaut of a film franchise continues with protagonist Dominic Toretto being approached by a hacker known as 'Cipher' who has something that causes him to betray his team. He helps his team steal an EMP device before stealing it from them and handing it over to Cipher. This leaves Agent Hobbs arrested and placed in the same gaol as Deckard Shaw, a man he put there. Neither of them are there for long though as they escape and are promptly enlisted to work with Dom's team to find him and Cipher before they can complete her plans which ultimately involve the theft of nuclear weapons from a Russian base in the frozen Barents Sea.If you want realism or anything vaguely believable then this certainly isn't the film for you; however if you want lots of ridiculously over the top action then this is a lot of fun. It starts with street race through Havana which Dom finishes in a car that is on fire. After this prologue the story is introduced; just why Dom betrays his friends isn't immediately obvious but once explained it makes sense. The story provides many exciting set pieces; these include plenty of shooting, explosions, fighting and inevitably lots of fast cars. All these require some suspension of disbelief but for the most part they stays just the right side of silly... the events in New York that involve numerous cars being hacked and remotely controlled by Cipher did unfortunately go from exciting to laughable but I was able to enjoy the rest of the action; especially the finale. The cast are a lot of fun; most notably Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. Charlize Theron and Kristofer Hivju are solid as villains Cipher and her lieutenant, Rhodes. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want some good, over-the-top, brain-in-neutral action.",The Fate of the Furious
9,BA_Harrison,Fast and furious is certainly what it is.,7,27 May 2019,"The Fate of the Furious isn't satisfied wnith just jumping the shark: it launches itself over a nuclear submarine. Although the action starts in familiar street racing territory, it soon becomes apparent just how silly things are about to get, with Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) throwing himself from a speeding, burning car (going in reverse) onto a concrete surface and rising to his feet unscathed (whereas you and I would be a tattered mess of broken bones and mangled flesh). It's quite clear that this is going to be a cartoonish popcorn action flick with no regard for logic, but if you're able to park your brain for a couple of hours, it can be a lot of fun.The plot concerns a cyberterrorist called Cipher (Charlize Theron) who forces Dom to work for her, threatening to kill his ex-lover and their baby son if he doesn't co-operate. Cipher orders Dom to steal an EMP device and some codes for Russian nukes, which will be used to hold the world to ransom. Meanwhile, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) assembles a team (the usual characters) to try and stop this from happening.All of this is an excuse for numerous spectacular action set-pieces which involve vehicular carnage on a massive scale and some brutal hand to hand combat, and as a slam bang slice of mindless cinema it certainly impresses, director F. Gary Gray conducting the special effects laden mayhem with aplomb. Standout scenes include a jailbreak in which Hobbs and fellow prisoner Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) bust some heads, the 'nuclear football' heist in NYC that sees cars raining from skyscrapers, and the crazy finale in which the aforementioned nuclear sub threatens to crush our heroes (one moment involving a Lamborghini door had me laughing out loud at its sheer preposterousness).Clearly, I am not alone in appreciating the silliness of this series, given the film's box-office success, and the fact that there is already a ninth film in production (as well as a spin off due later this year). As long they keep the craziness going, I'll be watching.",The Fate of the Furious
10,paul_haakonsen,"Once you have seen one, you've seen them all...",6,25 June 2017,"Granted that I am not a fan of the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise in any way, but I still have managed to watch every single movie that has been released. Why? Well, because it is brainless entertainment, that still have some visual appeal, and they have managed to put in some good choices for cast.The 2017 addition to the franchise is no different, and you know exactly what you are getting here if you have seen just any one of the previous many movies in the franchise. And there is a sense of 'why is this franchise still going on?' as the movie starts to play.First of all, I have a huge problem with Vin Diesel in the lead role of this franchise. He is barred of any kind of acting talent, he is unfathomably monotonous to listen to as he staggers through his dialogue, and he is just too much of a superman in the franchise that it is atrocious to bear witness to. And I was actually ready to get up and turn off the movie when he continued to drive a car engulfed in flames, then spun the car around and drove in reverse and still managed to win a drag race through the winding streets of Cuba. It was just so pathetically lame that it was an insult to any viewer with just a shred of intelligence.However, I managed to stick with the movie because of Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson.""The Fate of the Furious"" was a visually great movie, but if you have seen any of the previous movies, then you have essentially also already seen this movie. Sure, there were some story twist along the way, that only a true fan of the franchise would and could properly appreciate. For the rest of us, it wasn't a particularly invigorating story being told here.Now, I will say that the cast was good in ""The Fate of the Furious"", and it has been great throughout the entire franchise. And it is especially good to have the cast actors and actresses return to portray their characters time and time again. However, aside from Vin Diesel, then it was also hard to take Charlize Theron serious in this movie, especially when she looked as artificial as she did here in the movie. I don't know what went wrong along the way, but she looks downright strange now.""The Fate of the Furious"" is definitely a movie that caters for fans of the franchise and to people who have an interest in muscle cars of all kinds. I can't claim to have much of an interest in either, so I was just here for the adrenaline and the fast paced action, and to watch a select few of the cast ensemble perform on the screen.So is this 2017 installment to the franchise bigger, badder and better? No, hardly so. It was pretty much running in the exact same lane as all the previous movies, for better or worse.",The Fate of the Furious
11,Quinoa1984,so this is dumb,4,14 April 2017,"I think that with a movie like this in this franchise especially, there are two levels of stupidity: one is the kind that makes a dumb action movie so flavorful with your massive, over-priced popcorn and soda - it knows how crazy it is and it goes for it. The sequence in this movie, which also has some of the *other* dumb, which I'll get to momentarily, that typifies this is when Cipher (Charlize Theron) has not only Dom (Vin Diesel) in his car going after the Russian dude that has the nuclear Macguffincodes or what have you, involves Cipher and her small team using their Special Hacking Movie Skills to hack what seems to be every single car within a many-block radius in Manhattan, NYC, and are able to make every car (driver or not) drive on their own so they can box in the Russian limo and his motorcade.It's a gloriously stupid sequence to behold, but on the surface it appears to be done with a considerable amount of attention paid to the mounting pressure of first a few cars and then a mountain of cars falling out of a multi-level parking deck that makes the Blues Brothers look like they need some Popeye spinach to catch up. Yet while it has a level of entertainment to it, and perhaps I was the dumb one deep down for trying to apply logic to it, there were a lot of things about the sequence that didn't make sense on a simple, logical level. What, apply logic to a seemingly critic-proof, multi-billion dollar franchise that now has China money flowing in like a blood transfusion? Sure, why not?For example - the team that the Rock and Kurt Russell have together (Scott Eastwood joins up this time) should be on the alert for suspicious things going on (maybe one of the hackers in *their* group could, I don't know, try to see if Dominic turns up first somewhere?) and yet it's halfway through this massive carsploitation set piece until they get into their cars (from BROOKLYN no less, sorry but I noticed and I'm sure others will too) and head out to stop what's going on. Aside from them getting to where the action is happening in record time - and even then I could suspend my disbelief - it didn't make sense within the logic (however illogical) the movie had going for it. Not to mention that sort of right before this a meeting happens between Dom (when, shockingly, Cipher and their team can't seem to find him?!) and Helen Mirren's character (her real identity I dare not reveal in case you have the guts to see this popcorn fire of a movie), and yet here it doesn't make sense how he could call her in time considering everything that's happened since Cipher forced him to ""Go Rogue"" as it were.The kind of ""Bad Dumb"" is more things like that, where it's not the fun dumb bad stuff that action movies like this and others have - I'm used to that, after all, and I've seen 75% of this franchise (missing two of the eight, and I don't imagine I'm missing *too* much in the sordid saga, eh) - it's more of the badness that comes from a hacky screenwriter who tries initially to set up cool things, and then says ""f*** it"" and lets the story run amuck. And it's not that this is even hard stuff to figure out; one knows from a story like this, where the ""team/Family"" of the 'F&F' crew (among them return Statham and the Rock, the latter two the best parts of the movie particularly their scenes together) have to deal with a lead who ""turns"" (think, I dunno, friggin Muppets Most Wanted, for example) that all will be revealed to be something shocking or surprising. What Cipher's plan is though relies on a LOT of things that have to fall in to place, and also for us to remember a particular female character who, frankly, I forgot all about. And by the end of it all, when (spoiler?) Dom turns back around to join the F&F crew, it's all so water under the bridge there might as well not be water or bridges ever again.Aside from Johnson and Statham, there's no purpose in pointing out acting, or what is basically asked of these people as posturing or fulfilling their one 1/2 poses and characters - they're funny and charming and Statham especially brings it in a climax that involves a baby, of all things - but I should mention that Theron felt wasted here. She makes what should be a fun thrill park ride into something that's overly serious, like she's, you know, in a *real* movie, and the tone didn't work for me. She's fine of course, don't get me wrong, but she tries to bring subtlety and quiet-voiced menace to a role that should be, possibly, maybe, more over the top or scenery chewing. If there was that, it wouldn't collide so much in tone with the jokier F&F Crew scenes. But as she is acting in a whole other movie (and only doing alright by it, frankly, and she never does action in the way one might've seen in Fury Road or the upcoming Atomic Blonde), and it shows.What else is there to say? These characters and this world are a live-action cartoon or even an anime TV show, where it's loaded for bear with soap operatic twists, while also being PG-13 ""family"" fun that has less than zero consequences to any of its action. I'm sure everyone got paid handsomely, it's morose-looking monotoned star most of all in Diesel, but by the end I felt like I lost more brain cells than when I went in, which, for all of their ludicrous and shameless trajectories, the other sequels didn't do (or at least since '2 Fast').",The Fate of the Furious

13,Theo Robertson,It's Zombie Time And That's Not Really A Criticism,7,20 April 2017,"I gave up on the franchise after the second movie because I thought the movies were nothing more than pop crime drama for the MTV generation. I then watched the seventh film in the series simply because it was breaking box office records and was absolutely surprised at the direction the films were now taking , a sort of James Bond for the MTV generation meets THE EXPENDABLES without the bloodshed. How do you follow that up ? The simple answer is more of the same There are slight differences involving characterisation. With FAST & FURIOUS 8 ( And who'd have thought I would be writing that title away back in 2003 ? ) Dom isn't exactly the good guy whilst Deckard Shaw isn't exactly the bad guy. Okay it's not exactly character development either but you do feel that the producers need to do something to follow the loss of Paul Walker from the franchise and to be fair Jason Statham makes a likable anti hero. The focus of goodness lies with action hero family man Hobbs played by Dwayne Johnson Of course things like plotting and internal logic have not been included - Did I mention this is a franchise movie ? - because this is a movie made for people half my age who grew up with the characters . In fact I've got a problem remembering what the plot was , something to do with a electro magnetic pulse doomsday weapon I think but this is irrelevant and the core focus is car chases , one liners and tongue in cheek humour. If you're not a fan then this movie won't convert you and if you are a fan you'll be more than satisfied",The Fate of the Furious
14,zardoz-13,"Still ""Furious"" But Not As Furious as ""Furious 7""",8,17 April 2017,"The eighth entry in ""The Fast and The Furious"" franchise, ""Straight Outta Compton"" director F. Gary Gray's ""The Fate of the Furious,"" takes demolition derby derring-do to delirious heights, with audacious, high-octane automotive anarchy like you've never seen. Although it doesn't generate the emotional gravitas that fueled ""Furious 7"" in the wake of Paul Walker's tragic death, ""The Fate of the Furious"" still delivers slam-bang, super-charged spectacle with speed and style. Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Luke Evans, Nathalie Emmanuel, and Elsa Pataky reprise their roles and absorb the slack. Franchise newcomer Charlize Theron gives this larger-than-life yarn an electrifying jolt as an ultra-cyberterrorist. She qualifies as the equivalent of James Bond's nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld for the ""Furious"" franchise, and our heroes struggle to set aside their differences so they can neutralize her and save the world. Cipher wants to make the super-powers accountable collectively with the acquisition of some of their WMDs. Unfortunately, the filmmakers keep Theron confined too often to her tricked-out jet that would make Edward Snowden drool with envy. Unlike previous ""Furious"" installments, ""The Fate of the Furious"" plumbs the past for one of its major surprises: Dominic Toretto's treacherous betrayal of both friends and family. The revelation of Toretto's treachery isn't as startling as the treachery itself. Let's chalk it up to the secret life of franchise characters or what happened that neither we know nor more importantly what Dom doesn't know that prompts his duplicity. If you haven't seen ""Fast Five"" (2011), you may be confused, while die-hard ""Furious"" aficionados will remember a similar story-line in ""Fast & Furious 6"" when Letty went rogue. Despite its formulaic B-movie mayhem, ""The Fate of the Furious"" has something to say about computerized automotive technology that unscrupulous cyberterrorists like Cipher could exploit. Long-time ""Furious"" scenarist Chris Morgan's far-fetched but exciting screenplay should make insurance companies, motorists, and passengers wary of computer-equipped vehicles without safeguards that can be hacked. Mind you, getting carjacked is bad enough, but it is entirely something else to be carjacked by your own vehicle. ""Furious 8"" utilizes this provocative premise with pizazz galore. ""The Fate of the Furious"" unfolds in sunny Havana, Cuba, where Dom and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez of ""Girlfight"") are enjoying their honeymoon. The franchise has been burning rubber since 2001 so it was inevitable the lovebirds would tie the knot. Predictably, the action warms up with an exhilarating street race between Dom and an impudent Cuban contender Raldo (Celestino Cornielle of ""Nasty Piece of Work"") who thinks he cannot be defeated. He wants to repossess a ramshackle ride from another driver for lack of payment. Not only is Fernando (newcomer Janmarco Santiago) the owner who fell behind on his payments, but he is also one of Dom's Cuban cousins. Dom challenges Raldo to a race with Fernando's scrap-heap jalopy. Director F. Gary Gray flaunts his style all the way to the finish line with this harrowing little steeplechase, and Dom wins Raldo's respect. Dom's ride literally turns into a space vehicle re-entering orbit with its engine ablaze like an asteroid as he careens Fernando's crate backwards, like Burt Reynolds did in ""Hooper"" (1978), to keep from being cooked alive.Meantime, Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson of ""Central Intelligence"") assembles his team to perform the impossible. Hobbs' superiors warn him he'll do time if he is nabbed. Naturally, Dom and his ""Furious"" bunch buckle up for action. Something inexplicable, however, has affected Dom since he encountered a skinny blonde with dreadlocks in Havana. This inscrutable dame, Cipher (Charlize Theron of ""Mad Max: Fury Road""), showed him something on a cell phone that shocked him. Moreover, she uses it to blackmail our hero. Basically, Hobbs' mission goes sideways as Dom turns ""rogue,"" double-crosses Hobbs, and steals a top-secret EMP device for Cipher. The EMP device can blackout all communication in a city and make it comparable to a day in the Stone Age. Hobbs lands in prison where he clashes with his old rival, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham of ""The Transporter"" trilogy), and the two taunt each other until they manage to break out. The anonymous government agent who reunited the team in ""Furious 7,"" Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell of ""Tombstone""), had a hand in engineering their escape. Dom's old team signs up to work with Hobbs and Deckard and catch Dom. Mr. Nobody reveals that Dom's new accomplice is a mastermind computer hacker who flies around in her own AWACS-equipped jet. Since the departure of Paul Walker's character, the producers have replaced him essentially with Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. If you saw ""Furious 7,"" you know how much these two titans abhor each other. Mr. Nobody orders them to shake and make up. Our heroes barrel off to New York City where Cipher has dispatched Dom to snatch a nuclear football from the Russian Minister of Defense. Essentially, nuclear football isn't a pigskin, but rather an emergency suitcase that contains the launch codes for a nuclear attack. Cipher hacks into every car with a computer to create pandemonium so Dom can locate the limo and steal the apparatus. Hundreds of cars plunge like lemmings from high-rise parking lots so the Russian Defense Minister remains trapped in a traffic jam. This scene alone is worth the price of admission! Afterward, Cipher sends Dom to Russia with the EMP to disable a nuclear submarine so she can hack into it and control it to launch her WMDs. Preposterous pabulum from start to finish, ""The Fate of the Furious"" never runs out of steam during its adrenaline-laced 136 minutes. Eventually, you know Dom will swap sides as soon as he can, and Cipher's grand scheme will collapse. Not surprisingly, our heroes dodge the lots of bullets and rockets simply because they're virtuous while each colossal explosion serves to reduce the ranks of villains. ""The Fate of the Furious"" yields nonstop thrills.",The Fate of the Furious
15,neil-476,A hoot,8,14 May 2018,"Dom and Letty are on honeymoon in Cuba when Dom is approached by Cipher (Charlize Theron) as a result of which Dom goes rogue on the next caper, leading to Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) being imprisoned with Deckard (Jason Statham). The trailer tells you this, but doesn't tell you why. And neither will I.If you go back to, say, From Russia With Love, the James Bond films were actually about spying. They then moved towards increasingly spectacular but outlandish action entertainment. Nobody could claim they were great cinema but, by heaven, they were entertaining. The Fast & Furious films are following a similar pattern. They are no longer about street racing: they have unlikely plots providing a framework for a family of characters to have brilliantly conceived and executed action sequences built around them. They are never going to win Best Film Oscars, but they are incredibly entertaining.And the fact that we are now up to number 8 means that they have history to draw on: there are a number of faces popping up who are surprising, some familiar and some not.Oh, and of course the action sequences are great fun. Some are revealed in the trailer, some not, but they are all ludicrously impossible, and laugh-out-loud delightful, bordering on punch-the-air ""Yes!""-ness in places.I loved it.",The Fate of the Furious
16,morrison-dylan-fan,The Fast & The Furious:Part 8.,8,26 April 2017,"During Easter I realised that I have not seen a single 2017 film! Being a fan of the franchise,I decided that it was time to drive into my first 2017 movie.The plot:Whilst honeymooning with his wife Letty Ortiz, Dominic Toretto is approached by cyberterrorist Cipher,and asked to leave his ""family"" and join her criminal gang. Turning it down,Toretto is shown something by Cipher which forces him to join. Keeping it secret,Toretto betrays Ortiz,Hobbs, Roman and Parker by stealing an electronic bomb that is on Cipher's wish list. Finding their leader to have gone rogue,the rest of the gang start trying to figure out how to remain fast and furious,against Dominic Toretto.View on the film:Coming straight outta Compton,director F. Gary Gray & returning cinematographer Stephen F. Windon follow Furious 7's James Wan's decision to retain some of his own style within the series,as Gray separates the locations with whip-pan chapter headings and surprisingly still group shots showing the friendships, being rolled straight from Gray's Hip-Hop epic. Impressively driving the series into a more living cartoon atmosphere,Gray delivers cracking extravagant set-pieces which strike a fine balance between hard- hitting combat scenes with wonderfully bonkers CGI that takes the car races into flight of fantasy. Revving up the series again,the screenplay by Chris Morgan cooks up a delicious gumbo,that mixes the hyper action scenes with espionage skills,a gritty jail escape,and even some propah British Gangster business. Slightly turning down the action volume,Morgan does well at setting up the next films with Letty's/Toretto's relationship being more prominent,and last baddie Deckard solidly joining the goodies. Being the first lead women baddie in the series, Charlize Theron gives a wonderfully icy performance as Cipher,thanks to the unsettling calm Theron gives Cipher being against the explosive performances of Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and The Stath,who all discover the fate of the furious.",The Fate of the Furious
17,FlashCallahan,You have the time it takes for me to drink this......,9,15 April 2017,"..............And I'm ******* thirsty.......Dom and Letty are on their honeymoon and the rest of the crew have a realisation of a normal life. But when a mysterious woman coaxes Dom back into the world of crime, he can't seem to escape and a betray those closest to him, they will face treachery that will test them like never before. From Cuba to the streets of New York City, and to the plains off the arctic Barents Sea, the team will cross the globe to stop a myth from unleashing chaos on the world's stage... and to bring home the man who made them a family........After the turgid second and third instalments, this franchise should have gone the way of Police Academy, or found a nice home on straight to Blu Ray, but the makers must have sold their souls to something, because how on earth doe this series just get bigger and better with each outing?The simple answer is, it just gets bigger and better with each outing, and the makers know they have their audience now, because although the films have upped the set pieces as the numbers increase, they are basically selling the same film, just adding another elaborate maguffin to the mix, and another special guest star to the cast.We know the characters now, we've known them since 2001, and I for one want to know who will join this extended family, and what will become of them.This is the silliest entry into the franchise by far, and if you've read my previous reviews of the other films, I say this every time, but rest assured, I have not had this much fun in a cinema in such a long time, and that's what the film intends to do, entertain and ask you to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours.It's the perfect cure for the awful world we live in at the moment.But this film isn't about Diesel and his ego, he's letting the rest of the cast loose, and by far this is The Rocks and Statham's film. The set piece involving him in daring rescue on a plane is the highlight of the movie by far, and it reminded me of the 'over the rainbow' sequence in Face/Off, but with far more laughs and chipmunks.The banter between the cast is as good as the action, and whenever The Rock, Statham, and Russell are on screen, the dialogue crackles.Theron is wonderful as the elusive Cipher, and although the franchise has had its fair share of pantomime villains, she is by far the most dangerous one the gang have faced.And then there's Helen Mirren, and as soon as she opens her mouth, you know what involvement she has in the narrative.My only moan is that something happens to a character halfway through the film, and you know it's just a red herring, thanks to the awful camera angle in that particular scene.It's just a bonkers films, from the initial race, to the prison break, to the submarine with heat seeking missile, to the quite spooky zombie car scene.The film has raised the bar for silliness, that's for sure, but my gosh, if your a fan of the franchise, this is wonderful stuff.A lot better than other part eight films, like Jason Takes Manhatten.Let's hope the next one isn't subtitled Mission To Moscow.",The Fate of the Furious
18,gradyharp,'In another life you could've done some serious damage.',6,15 July 2017,"With eight versions of THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS out and two more in production, it is obvious that the audience loves these Vin Diesel blockbusters. Written by Chris Morgan who has been creating from F & F 6 on based on the characters of Gary Scott Thompson, F. Gary Gary directs this a bit overdone epic spreading the story a bit to far around the globe and concentrating on a new female character (Charlize Theron).The basic main characters are noise, crashed cars, and fire, but into this mix is inserted the plot - When a mysterious woman named Cipher (Charlize Theron) seduces Dom (Vin Diesel) into the world of terrorism and a betrayal of those closest to him, the crew face trials that will test them as never before. Or better outlined, 'Now that Dom and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez are on their honeymoon in Cuba and Brian and Mia have retired from the game-and the rest of the crew has been exonerated-the globetrotting team has found a semblance of a normal life. But when a mysterious woman (Theron) seduces Dom into the world of crime he can't seem to escape and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before. From the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, the elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the world's stage... and to bring home the man who made them a family.' Tack on an ending that is about love and babies and the film sort of sputters to a halt.Definitely a movie for Fast and Furious fans – if a bit long and over baked. Of course the other regulars and new characters are well portrayed by Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Ludicrous, Tyrese Gibson, and add Kurt Russell, Scott Eastwood, and a quickie from Helen Mirren and there is a castoff fine actors out having fun. If CGI effects seem to be over done, then take a nap – if you can.",The Fate of the Furious
19,siderite,Meh!,6,30 October 2017,"It was all I expected from the franchise and none of what I hoped. They story doesn't exist, the jokes are stale, the acting is decent for scenes that don't really require acting and the driving part of the film is really weak. I mean, they are furiously driving cars on a frozen lake! How hard can that be? Just drive straight!I wanted to enjoy Charlize as a villain more. She is stunningly beautiful and in a period in her life where I think she just wants to have the most fun out of acting as she can. I wanted the script to give her that, but it didn't quite work. She was great, but the character was almost cardboard.Also, when you talk with the villain face to face, just kill him. A lot of people won't die uselessly in the next half hour just to show how mean the villain is. Weak, Dom, weak!",The Fate of the Furious
20,Hellmant,I really respect how diverse a cast this franchise has always employed!,8,18 April 2017,"'THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS': Four Stars (Out of Five)The eighth installment in the immensely popular blockbuster franchise, and only the second chapter not to include the late Paul Walker (following 2006's 'TOKYO DRIFT'). Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel and Kurt Russell all reprise their roles from the other films; while Charlize Theron, Scott Eastwood and Helen Mirren join the cast. F. Gary Gray (who's best know for helming 2015's 'STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON') directed this installment (he's also worked with Diesel before on 2003's 'MAN APART', and with Theron on 2003's 'THE Italian JOB'). It was once again written by Chris Morgan, who also wrote the last 6 chapters in the series. The film is also (once again) a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics as well (like all of the other recent installments in the series). I enjoyed it too.Dom Torretto (Diesel) and Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez) are on their honeymoon in Havana, when Dom is approached by a cyberterrorist known as Cipher (Theron). She seduces him into working for her, by showing him a picture of something that's obviously very important to him. Dom then betrays his team, and steals an EMP device from them. Agent Frank Petty (Russell) then recruits Letty, Luke Hobbs (Johnson), Deckard Shaw (Statham) and the rest of Dom's team to help them catch Dom, and stop Cipher.The movie is action-packed, but it's also way too long (at over 2 hours and 15 minutes). For me, it definitely starts to drag a little in the middle of the film. I wasn't a big fan of the series when it first started, but I've been really impressed with the last several installments, and I think this is one of the best ones yet. It's not as good as the last chapter in the series, because that was a really fitting (and quite beautiful) tribute to Paul Walker, but it might be the second best one yet. And I really respect how diverse a cast this franchise has always employed; it's probably the most diversely cast blockbuster franchise in cinema history (but 'STAR WARS' is catching up to it though).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/213917579",The Fate of the Furious
21,thesar-2,Number Eight's Fate is Great,8,28 May 2017,"I am NOT one of those people (mostly kids) who see the latest installment in a series and because they liked it a lot and it's fresh in their mind, it's their favorite one. But, dare I say it? This might be my favorite Fast & Furious movie to datefor good reason.(I'll make that decision by the end of this review)The question after each of these Fast Cars/Superhero Spy/Physics-Bending films is: Wow, that was huge! How are they ever gonna top that? Well, that was true to most of them and this one isn't that much of an exception, but how I think they topped the previous ones this time is: they actually made a non-live action cartoon and made a genuine, and really good, action movie.Most of these are, as stated, live-action cartoons where 90% of what you see could never happen in real life which leaves the other 10% of them standing around making plans that would normally take months in mere minutes. This one, this Fate, or the first of the trilogy to end the series, was the first solid action/espionage of the entire franchise and with the exception of the improbability of the cars chasing a sub on ice and the Rock actually Hulking Out, it seemed the most realistic of any of these films.Now, the movie's not without its flaws – the entire movie's premise could've been solved in seconds with the numerous missed opportunities for Dom to tell everyone/anyone what he's up to – but it's a solid thriller from almost minute one. I hate to rest most of it on Charlize Theron, but damnit, she did it again. She is one helluva actress and even though the movie still would've worked with another actor, she still elevated the movie and stole every scene she was in.Last time on The FuriousI guess Dom and Letty got married. (I see these movies only once apiece, never to revisit them, so I barely remember all that happened in this somewhat action soap opera of their ""Family."") Now, while on Honeymoon, Dom is pulled into the dark(er) side of the bad guys. His team, er, ""Family,"" is so confused on his switch, they seem to just wait around until he turns back into Dr Jekyll. Meanwhile, they're all recruited in hunting him down.I said I would probably make my decision by the end of this review and I think I did. Fast Five has been my favorite since it premiered because that one finally stopped taking itself seriously, relished in the cartoon-qualities and asking the audience to suspend all disbelief. And in doing so, I remember having an absolute blast, even (almost) clapping at the end. But, this one took away the cartoon element and grew up, finally. I hate to say Fate might have benefited from Paul Walker's untimely death, as I never minded him at all in the series, but you take him out of the ""Family"" and they all seemed to grow up, somehow.So, I would ALMOST put parts 5 and 8 as equals in the series for #1, but this one slightly overpowers that one since this one was an actual live- action movie. Totally worth checking out, even if you hadn't seen any of the other ones.***Final thoughts: Here's my list in order of best to absolute garbage:1. The Fate of the Furious (#8)2. Fast Five (#5) 3. Fast & Furious 6 (#6)4. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (#3, sorta)5. 2 Fast 2 Furious (#2)6. Furious 7 (#7)7. The Fast and the Furious (#1)8. Fast and Furious (#4)",The Fate of the Furious

A couple of the action scenes were straight up incredible.Well directed, and i don't just mean the action scenes. For the first time since the first (if that), i am listening to actual conversations between the characters, not just exposition and one-liners. Actually made me feel like they were real ppl. And there were some emotional moments that hit right, and weren't super cheesy.Really cool twist on the typical premise. I miss paul walker, but they made the smart move to compensate with some other great characters. I feel like they recaptured the action levels of 5 and 6.

23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Admirably alters the established formula but still hits all the beats you'd expect.,7,15 May 2018,"'The Fate Of The Furious (2017)' is an admirable attempt to alter the established formula. It keeps this franchise from feeling stale eight films in, but the story still isn't the most unique and hits all the beats you would expect. Still, this is a well directed - though some special effects are visually and conceptually dubious, at best - and entertaining action film that is constantly fun as well being one of the deepest in the series. 7/10",The Fate of the Furious
24,ThomasDrufke,Family No More,9,14 April 2017,"The Fate of the Furious is the start of a new trilogy, according to Vin Diesel. A trilogy that continues the ridiculous path taken by Fast 5, 6, and 7, but bringing in more spy elements and pushing aside the heist part of the series.Much like Furious 7, this film finds the team of Dom, Letty, Hobbs, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey once again being targeted by someone. Last time, the team managed to take down Deckard Shaw, played by Jason Statham, who was out for revenge. Now, a tech-hacker-terrorist played by Charlize Theron forces Dom to turn his back on family and help her steal nuclear codes. Let me say this upfront, most of this movie doesn't make any logical sense. In fact, this movie probably makes less sense than all of the other previous films combined. But did that impact my viewing experience in the slightest? Not one bit.So even though this film can be perceived as the dumbest of the bunch, there's no denying just how fun it is. Embracing the silliness is an understatement. Dodging a submarine, redirecting a torpedo with your hand, arm curling a steel bench, and pretty much stopping World War 3 are only a few of the things the team have to do. However, there's a clear difference with this franchise than most. The F&F series has made it clear from the get-go that these stories always come down to family. So it may not seem like there are any consequences when they come out of fights without a single scratch, but if you buy into them as a family than it doesn't really matter how unrealistic the film can get.With the passing of Paul Walker, there's a bit of a gap that may never truly be filled again without Brian O'Conner, but they did the best they could in spreading out what would have been O'Conner's screen time. The Rock certainly gets a boost to second billed, after his limited presence in Furious 7. Between him, Diesel, Statham, Gibson, and Ludicrous, there's probably close to 200 one- liners. And unlike with Triple X early this year, this Vin Diesel film actually made me laugh. They do a great job at giving each cast member their moment to shine. Particularly, the chemistry between Statham and The Rock really pops. If there's a world where Vin Diesel would let them have a spin-off film together, I'd be the first in line.Theron is very good as Cipher, though I'm not sure how much I like the hacking/terrorist side of the villain. The ""God's Eye"" was the least interesting part of the last movie and that's easily the case with Cipher. I'll buy into Dom's crew taking down anybody with the rules (or lack thereof) that the franchise has set, but I'm just not all that invested in street racers taking on techies. I'd rather have a villain that our heroes can punch, which is why the last few films have been so fun. Which makes it even weirder that they didn't decide to make Cipher physically capable, considering how good Theron was in Mad Max and how good she looks to be in the upcoming Atomic Blonde. Perhaps that was a missed opportunity.Overall, The Fate of the Furious once again ups the series in terms of ridiculousness and stupidity, which is exactly what I hoped for. It's not as touching as Furious 7 nor as fun as Fast 5, but it's no doubt a time worthwhile at the theaters.+Upping their game once again+Statham & The Rock+Family, family, family+Reinvents itself-Theron was good, but I don't care for that type of villain9.3/10",The Fate of the Furious
25,ericstevenson,"Over the top, like it should be",8,20 April 2017,"I'm not really a fan of the ""Fast And The Furious"" movies, having only seen about two of them before watching this one. I have still noticed they have become better with most new entries. I admit this wasn't as good as ""Fast Five"" but it's still a good movie. It's hard to get used to a new franchise especially one with so many characters in it. Still, I recognized most of the actors which is good enough for me. Anyway, of the ones that I have seen, this is the most insane and ludicrous of them all. Well, it makes sense as it literally has Ludicrous in it. This film features Dom (Vin Diesel) being forced to help a villain named Cipher or else she'll kill his family.Cipher's plan is to gain access to nuclear launch codes to well, cause a massive war. Yeah, it's pretty over the top even for this franchise and it does seem like the series is changing to a traditional James Bond movie. Still, the action scenes in this movie are tons of fun and the characters are interesting enough to keep you hooked into the story. I admit a lot of it gets really silly and it can be predictable, but I mean, this is just a great movie to watch for the awesome and quite creative action scenes.

I loved 3rd part and 5th - those were the best in the series. 6th, 7th and now 8th are just copy / paste type of money making product, and especially 8th one targeted for kids - it is impossible to see this ""movie"" other way around.""The Fate of the Furious"" (2017) is a big, dumb, impossible, silly and cheeeze to the point were you roll your eyes at screen like every 10 minutes. This is the first movie in a franchise which i skipped from seeing it on a big screen intentionally and after seeing it at home i'm glad i didn't waste my money in theater. I would be ashamed of myself if i would have watched it in theaters. Seriously, this film is that silly. There is nothing to be talked about this movie - performances, script or directing - it doesn't matter who is directing this part or another - he only has to stick to the plan to create this highly formulaic, predictable and cheeze product - and i know i do sound like a hater here but believe me - this movie is that mediocre. Sure there are action here to keep the things moving, but it just doesn't matter - no one dies in these movies. Humor in this movie is like for 12 year old ones.Overall, ""The Fate of the Furious"" is the low point of this franchise.

31,ironhorse_iv,"While, this movie is still Super-Charged & Adrenaline-Fueled Fun. It did hits some speed bumps with me. It had some engine troubles.",6,23 April 2017,"By the end of 2015's 'Furious 7', the franchise was tied together for somewhat a perfect end of the series. After all, the film had everything. Great action, wonderful humor, powerful message, and a beautiful climax ending with two good friends saying goodbye. It should had been 'the last ride'. However, yet again, the leer and greed for more money, mixed with huge egos, pretend that, from ever happening. Instead, we got 'The Fate of the Furious', another notch on the belt for the series of action films, that deals with muscle car chases and little on something else. Don't get me wrong, I do like portions of this movie. After all, it's still high-octane escapism that I can somewhat get aboard with. However, there is parts of this movie, I just couldn't stand. In fact, it's the highly annoying, yet somewhat puzzling overused clichés story that got me, angry. I really didn't like it. First off, seeing Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) betrayed his family and friends at the behest of a mysterious, seductive criminal known as Cipher (Charlize Theron) in order to steal, a government weapon was nothing new. After all, we seen, this story, play out, similar before with Leticia ""Letty"" Ortiz (Michelle Rodriquez) working with the bad guys in 2013's 'Fast & Furious 6'. Second off, the screenwriter, Chris Morgan left no mystery for the audience to solve on why Dominic would had join her. He just outright reveals it, in the beginning of the film. You would think, he would had learn something about the master of suspense in screen writing 101. Instead, he blew it off for other lame sub-plot revealers that wasn't that surprising. Also, I wouldn't call this movie, a stand-alone film. There is a lot of things you wouldn't get if you didn't watch the previous films. The movie does not really recap those events, besides a few mentions. Another thing that bug me, about this movie is pro-wrestling narrative, when it comes to past heels, turning into babyfaces. Seeing characters like Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), join the team with mostly open-arms in the end, after rescuing a baby, seen jarring; seeing how he killed members of their crew in the past. I get that it was trying to lay the ground work for a new phrase in the franchise, but it came across as awkward and somewhat cheesy. Those moments was not that good, as people may think. I was face palming, the moment, the family supposedly name their kid. These family arches is really getting absurd. Like the previous popcorn flick movies, the action scenes, also in this movie is downright ridiculously, especially the nuclear submarine chasing after the heroes, and the 'Carmageddon', Liberty City moment. However, it's also entertaining, even if it's highly unrealistic to see a hero or villain walk away from a car crash, without any scratches; when in truth, they should be dead or serious hurt. The over-the-top, consequence-free action hasn't gotta too tiresome yet, even if there is parts of the film that has some really awful CGI visual effects and mindless filler like the Havana scene. As for the acting, the cast is indeed 'one-trick ponies'. Nobody, really does anything new; they mostly stick to the norm. Vin Diesel still mumbles and looks tiresome. Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson is still, playing his role as Luke Hobbs, over the top and too macho. Are you sure, this guy isn't taking Steroids!? Anyways, it wouldn't surprise me, if this is Dwayne Johnson's last movie with Vin Diesel, seeing how public, their backstage feud was. If Vin Diesel is the arguably the head of the franchise, I doubt, Dwayne could be the backbone. I really doubt it, that they would continue to work with each other, after this. They're probably going to make a spin-off of his character or something. Sadly, nobody can replace, actor Paul Walker, as the original backbone. He is sorely missed. At least, the supporting cast was a little friendly with each other. Their acting was OK, for the most part. As the series' new adversary, Charlize Theron brings the proper degree of villainous. Sad to see, that she doesn't fight Michelle Rodriquez in the end. Despite that, Rodriquez still rocks as the hot-headed Latina. I also like, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous in their roles, even if they are just the same old comedy relief. If there was anybody that stood out in this film for me, it would be, Jason Statham. I can watch this guy, shot guys, while, making baby talk, any day. One actor that really disappointed me, was newcomer, Scott Eastwood as the no-nonsense, Mr. Little Nobody, a law enforcement agent working under Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell). Eastwood seems a bit too old to play such a callow character, and the jokey jabs at his expense don't always land. While, the new cast isn't as big a gear-shift as some fans expected in the wake of original cast member Paul Walker's death. The film still delivers exactly what fans have come to expect, for better and for worse, despite, the natured absurdity of how silly, these films are. Overall: If I learn anything about this series, over the years, it's that just when you think it's about to run out of gas, somehow this old car get outfitted with a new parts. Sometimes, it work, and sometimes doesn't. This time, it doesn't. The ride wasn't smooth. It was just bumpy.",The Fate of the Furious
32,The-Sarkologist,Entertaining as usual,8,14 April 2017,"It certainly seems as if the franchise has basically because a cookie cutter when it comes to these movies, but then again it isn't really a bad thing. In fact I have to admit that I really enjoyed it. Okay, this movie certainly isn't one of those movies that would be renown for its character development, and deep seeded themes, but it isn't supposed it be, though they have changed somewhat since the original films, and even those where they were simply chasing down drug barons. However, I do note that they weren't able to resist bringing in another FBI agent in these later films, he does come across as somewhat less corruptible than Brian was.While the film doesn't begin immediately after the end of the previous film, it does sort of follow on. However it is interesting how there seems to be more and more characters being brought into the franchise. For instance Stratham, who was the bad guy in the previous film, is now on the team, even though there is some animosity between him and Johnson. Also Johnson is playing a much bigger role than he did previously, but then that does have something to do with the previous major star not actually being available any more.This time Dom apparently goes rogue, or at least that is what the trailer led us to believe, Okay, a part of me thought that the trailer had revealed way too much, and I a part of me suspected that I had worked most of the film out. Okay, the submarine chase at the end of the film was probably what I was referring to, though as it turned out there were a number of aspects that I suspected I had an idea about but it turned out that I didn't.The other interesting thing is that they have certainly moved away from the 'let's bust another drug dealer' type of movie to making it one of those black-ops, undercover, lets save the world type of movies, that happens to involve fast cars. This, I have to admit, is a good thing. The other good thing was some of the really subtle humour that popped up along the way, as long as the really blatant jokes, such as the ones involving the orange Ferrari. However, in the end it is one of those pretty cool action films that you can pretty much sit back, enjoy, and completely turn your mind off for the two hours it takes to finish it.",The Fate of the Furious

It also has great acting. It is very fast past. 7.3 is a good ratting. But this such a great movie that 7.3 is underrating it. I give it 9. It is a great movie. See it see it see it see it see it. It is one of the best action movies from 2017. If you like action movies you will like this movie. It is better then The dark knight and that is not easy do to.,The Fate of the Furious
34,Reno-Rangan,Fast + Eight = Fate,7,14 August 2017,"We all miss Paul Walker here, but the franchise has grown bigger with more new casts from a couple of previous installments and with this, still counting. Yes, it marks the arrival of Jason Stathom as hinted at the end of the previous part, as well as Charlize Theron in the negative role. And guest appearance of veteran actors. This is where the bald guys rule. One of the most unique franchise.This is the costliest film in the series, but did not earn as much as 'Fast 7' did. At least it stands second out of the eight. Now the billion dollar club becoming normal. The best thing about this series is, the race days are over. It's now more a cop-thief kind of cat- mouse action-adventure game that moves all around the globe. It opened in Cuba with a small race, which is what it's known for, but soon falls back to the manhunt.Yep, Toretto abandons his family and disappears. Soon he'll be found on the wrong side of the battle between the security/secret agency and the international criminal gang. Now it is the clash within the family that involves outsiders too. A new recruit, Deckard Shaw joins the team, alongside Scott Eastwood as Little Nobody. Finding what they're up to and striking them to avert their plans are followed in the remaining film.The original films had awesome automobile stunts, but what was missing is the fist fight, which came to life with more masculinely since Dwayne Johnson's entry. Now add Stathan as well to it. I hope he stays in the series, rather just for one film as a guest appearance. The regular cast was good as always. The story had a small twist, but mostly predictable. A good film compared to a few earlier films, otherwise a decent watch. Now its time to wait for Fast 9 or is it called Fine!7/10",The Fate of the Furious
35,paulclaassen,Watch it for the action sequences.,6,20 September 2020,"I must be honest, I wasn't really interested in seeing this film. 'Furious 6' started pushing the boundaries of reality, while 'Furious 7' was just preposterous on every level! This franchise has come a long way, and is still going strong. The narration follows like a soap opera, so if you haven't seen the previous films you can easily get lost in the characters. They constantly introduce new characters to the series, and by now there are so many characters that one tends to forget about some of them when they're not on screen.The film is a display of incredible action sequences we've never seen before. Not all of them (well, most of them) are not logical or even remotely practically possible, yet it was fun to watch. I also appreciated the fact they used practical effects for some of the action sequences (using real cars as opposed to CGI). Don't get me wrong, they did use A LOT of CGI, as well. By now I'm able to easily spot the difference.The film's first hour bored me to death. It was also confusing and over-complicated. The typical Hollywood cliches, character traits and macho talk can be listed alphabetically. Off course Tyrese Gibson is annoying as ever as the film's comic relief. This character doesn't contribute anything to the film and might as well not be there anymore. His humor has overstayed its welcome in these films. I thought Charlize Theron was rather good as the antagonist, Cipher.The film certainly does dish up a lot of preposterousness. Why did they have to destroy hundreds of cars and an entire city block just to stop the Minister of Defense? If Cipher and her henchman are so technologically advanced, surely they could have concocted a much better plan to stop the Minister? This scene was for effect only, but utterly ridiculous. And, in the beginning, Dom is sitting comfortably in his living room in one scene, and the next him and his team are in the middle of what appeared to be a war zone, with very little explanation whatsoever! It felt like the film skipped a couple of scenes...Fortunately, the characters improved with development as the film progressed. So much so that I'll forgive them for those annoying cliches during the first half. There's a good twist of events, and an excellent action-packed finale. The film also features stunning slow motion photography. In general, this was far more enjoyable than 'Furious 7' (which I absolutely hated by the way).",The Fate of the Furious
36,briancham1994,Bombastic,7,1 June 2020,"Why does this film exist? The series had wrapped up and there was no need for another instalment. Nevertheless, it does exist, and it has the usual - disposable villain, insane action sequences and a little bit of cars.",The Fate of the Furious
37,tomgillespie2002,"A mess, but delivers when it fires up the nitrous oxide",6,12 July 2017,"By the time Paul Walker bailed and Vin Diesel only bothered to show up for a wink-and-a-smile cameo back in 2003 with the third instalment in the Fast & Furious franchise, Tokyo Drift, it seemed like the series started by Rob Cohen in 2001 as an entertaining Point Break rip-off was done and dusted. 14 years later, the eighth entry sits happily as the eleventh highest-grossing movie of all time, raking in a whopping $1.2 billion at the box-office. Having evolved from low-key crime thrillers with a street-racing twist to all-out, physics-defying spy adventure blockbusters, audiences are clearly not done with Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and his street-hood 'family'. The film's alternate title of The Fate of the Furious - keeping up with the series' trend of frustratingly difficult-to- follow title meddling - suggests that this may be the most ridiculous, balls-to-the-wall spectacle yet, and it certainly lives up to its billing.Ever since previous fan favourites were cherry-picked to inexplicably form the gang of ass-kickers-for-hire the are now built around, the cast has rapidly expanded and individuals have been reduced to little more than the odd one-liner. When Dwayne Johnson's oiled man-mountain Hobbs was introduced to add some spice and charisma to a stagnant series, Vin Diesel found himself in the awkward position of hogging screen-time from an actor everyone would rather be seeing. This is very much Diesel's product and he takes things very seriously, so Fast & Furious 8 sees the two split up into two very tonally different story lines, in a move that may have been made to satisfy the needs of both , or to simply keep the two away from each other. Johnson made comments on social media criticising a certain cast member's behaviour, in a thinly-disguised jab at Diesel. The tension isn't evident in the final movie, but it does mean you're likely to spend half the time wishing you were with the former wrestler, especially when he teams up with the returning Jason Statham.Dom growls and mumbles before turning his back on the gang when his honeymoon with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is rudely interrupted by a hacker known as Cipher (Charlize Theron), who blackmails the big lug into stealing an EMP device. Enter exposition device Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and, for some reason, his partner played by Scott Eastwood, who round up the former car-jackers and criminals to steal it back before chaos is unleashed. And so the two stories unfold: One a moody drama that often turns quite violent, and the weirdly erotically-charged, but nevertheless amusing, penis-comparing adventures of Johnson and Statham. When you're watching a movie in which a submarine is 'jacked', it's clear that the mood of the latter better suits the franchise. Diesel's brooding and Theron's phoning- in don't make for particularly entertaining viewing, especially when it follows a scene of hacked autonomous CGI cars swarming through the city streets like a hoard of fast-moving zombies.Characters seem to fill every inch of the screen, and it was a struggle to remember just what roles returning Elsa Pataky, Luke Evans and Djimon Honsou had played previously, although anoraks will have no trouble. To say it is a convoluted mess driven by a McGuffin would be an understatement, and it could be argued that this plot has been done before a few ago. Nevertheless Fast & Furious 8 delivers when it fires up the nitrous oxide. While there's nothing to match Hobbs' Gatling-gun rampage in part 7, there is a punchy prison breakout scene, Tyrese Gibson ice-skating on a car door, and the aforementioned submarine. You came here for fast cars, and they are worked into the story whether it makes logical sense or not. If only Diesel would lighten up and not take a series built on fun so damn seriously, this could have been so much better. Fingers crossed for the Johnson/Statham spin-off though.",The Fate of the Furious
38,cruise01,"Big, loud, and awesome!",10,14 April 2017,"The Fast and the Furious franchise has always made its way with being fun entertaining films. Cool cars, crazy insane action sequences that usually breaks the laws of physics, and lastly, the story always focuses on the theme of family. That is usually the case with the most of these movies, and the code that Dominic Toretto lives by. Old enemies become good and good go bad, so it seems when Dominic (Vin Diesel) betrays his team and family during an extract mission in Berlin. Stealing an emp device, and reporting to cyber terrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron). Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and the rest of the team that we all know from the previous films have to track down Ciphers next move and stop Dom. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and the new addition (Scott Eastwood) will need Hobb and his team and the help from their former enemy Deckard (Jason Statham). I feel like the fast movies are getting better as it goes on from every movie and amazing to see how it went from a street racing movie to a heist film to a spy action. Also one that should not be taken seriously. It's a blockbuster action movie that you should leave brains and logic out before seeing the movie. Seeing these characters as a team go on glide trotting missions to stop cypher terrorism using sporty cars and tactical fast tanks. Does these missions even require them to use cars? Probably not, sure there is other ways they could have handled it. But than it wouldn't be a fast movie, would it. The action sequences are big, loud, and insane. From the opening sequence, in Cuba, seeing Dom race with a burning car was fun. Until he meets Cipher that persuaded him to betray his team. Without giving away details, on Doms motivation to do such a thing against his family, it's best to see for yourself. The film also takes place in New York and has one insane scene when Cipher hacks into computerized cars for her own control and leading a wave of cars to invade a convoy. Last, the chase sequence with the cars being chased by a submarine was fun in a overlong battle that takes place in Russia. The cast was still great and it was fun to see Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham taunt each other when working on a team. Helen Mirren has a brief appearance and is well worth it. Scott Eastwood was also a fun addition as a rookie to Mr. Nobody. Charlize Theron as the villain was a perfect choice. But sadly, she does not have much to do besides her menacing threats and being in a command room throughout the whole movie. The film does have its twist and turns in the direction, when characters family limit is tested. But in the end, the central theme will always be about family coming together. The Fate of the Furious is awesome and does best for what it is trying to do which is entertain with crazy action sequences. Great cast. Fun to see these characters work together. Has its cheesy dialogue humor. And I hope to see more.",The Fate of the Furious
39,leonblackwood,Not the best in the franchise!,6,7 February 2018,"Review:
Although I liked the action in this movie, and the comedic moments were quite funny, it didn't touch the previous movies, which all brought fresh and shocking stunts that I haven't seen before. I found Vin Diesel's character, Dom, a bit spooky throughout the film, like he was hypnotised, and I wasn't that impressed with Charlize Theron, Cipher, as the baddie. Surprisingly enough, Jason Statham (Deckard), was the best thing in the film, and I enjoyed the banter between him and the Rock (Hobbs) who looked extremely pumped and full of testosterone. Anyway, after 7 movies of Dom proving how important family is, he turns rouge against his loved ones, due to Cipher, who has kidnapped his ex-girlfriend and there son. Whilst on his honeymoon with his long time girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Cipher approaches him with an ultimatum, which makes him steal important weapons so Cipher can become the most powerful woman in the world. The whole of Dom's gang can tell that something is strange about Dom's behaviour, so they team up to try and work out what exactly is going on. They soon realise that Cipher is on course of world domination, with Dom's help, so they attempt to shut her down, whilst trying to save there long time leader in the process. It is very non-stop from the beginning to end, and there is enough twists and turns to keep you glued to the screen but it is quite predictable and some of the corny lines did make me cringe. Like most of the movies in this franchise, the cars are truly amazing and the action does push the boundaries but I personally found the scenes with Statham the most impressive. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch, especially if you enjoyed the previous movies but I don't think that it was the best in this franchise. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by F. Gary Gray, 48, who also brought you Murder Was The Case starring Snoop Dogg, Friday, the unique video by TLC called Waterfalls, Set It Off starring Queen Latifah, The Negotiator, A Man Apart, The Italian Job remake, Be Cool, Law Abiding Citizen and the Straight Outta Compton movie. He's obviously a man who usually makes movies for the urban market but judging by the profit that this movie made, he certainly has crossed over successfully. With a lot of this film being filmed in Cuba, and various other locations, he brought a lot of authenticity to the movie, along with intensity by making Dom go rouge but my expectations were hoping for something a bit more original. After watching a moody Charlize Theron in Atomic Blonde, I was hoping to see another side to her in this film but she seemed to be just as moody, which wasn't totally her fault. This is the second time that Statham has surprised, like he did in Spy but he didn't get much screen time, which is a shame because he made the movie unique in a lot of ways. With this movie being the 12th biggest of all time, with the Fast and Furious 7 being the 6th of all time, this is definitely a franchise that has a huge following, and I personally don't think that this is the last time that we will see this crazy team, saving the world.Budget: $250million

40,matthewssilverhammer,Maybe The Rock and Vin Diesel Should Fight On Set More...,7,27 April 2017,"The only Fast / Furious movie I've ever seen (until Fate) was 2015's Furious Seven, and despite giant box office numbers and widespread critical acclaim, I was less than taken by it. While I didn't care for the juvenile plotting and rampant false machismo, I chalked up much of my disappointment to my own ignorance of the series as a whole. So going into this 8th installment, I wasn't expecting much; in fact, I was straight-up dreading it. Surprisingly though, Fate accomplished something Seven didn't: With its hilariously invincible characters and sincerely ridiculous set-pieces, this over-the-top venture made me wanna dive into the whole series. We find Dom (Diesel) and Letty (Rodriguez) on their honeymoon in Cuba. After a wonderfully outrageous street-race, Dom is coerced by series newcomer Cipher (Theron) to work for her and betray his own family. The driving and action scenes are so far beyond stupid (hundreds of remote controlled vehicles, a drag race with a nuclear submarine, Statham fighting while holding a baby), yet they more than get the job done, pumping adrenaline like gas in a V8. The most impressive feat, however, is its sturdy ethical dilemmas which drive the plot forward (with the blunt force of a flaming semi, mind you, but still). Let's get it straight: an Oscar-contender this is not. The humor isn't always intentional, Theron's villain rides the line of menacing and laughable (dreaded mini-locs? Why?), and the climactic arctic set-piece is absurd and logically incomprehensible (watch for the final explosion). Is it a ""so-bad-it's-good"" kinda movie? Maybe; all I know is I smiled through every stupid minute, and even started to get the hype.",The Fate of the Furious
41,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The series continues to wear thin despite giving the fans what they want,5,14 June 2017,"The ""Fast & Furious"" movies haven't been the most sterling model of how to cultivate a long-term franchise, but they are pretty consistent and people pay up to see them. From a fan perspective, ""The Fate of the Furious"" pretty much falls in line with the last two movies, a.k.a. it belongs right at home with the superhero spy flick trappings that began in ""Fast & Furious 6."" For everyone else, the unrealistic but fun chaos and ingenuity this series has been privileged to serve up thanks to its box office receipts continues to wear thin.After a worthless but true-to-form opening race sequence in Cuba, things take a left turn for Dominic Toretto's (Vin Diesel) crew when Dom encounters a woman (Charlize Theron) who mysteriously compromises him. Obviously she must have something on him if she's able to make him turn his back on family, but the script waits to play that card, and it's not a surprising one either.Writer Chris Morgan must be able to write these films in his sleep by now. The only new thing he brings to the table in this chapter is a manufactured excuse to change up the usual dynamic by turning Dom against the others. It's grasping at straws at this point, and the same can be said about the main action set pieces too. The films have always had the goal of one-upping their predecessors, and to do that in ""F8,"" Morgan has to put cars on ice and have them fend off a nuclear submarine. It's one of the better sequences of the movie, but at some point they're going to run out of unusual terrain and large vehicles. If this series ever goes to outer space New to the franchise, director F. Gary Gray fits right in. Most of the techniques he uses are taken from what was done by his predecessors, Justin Lin and James Wan. These films have a look and feel and Gray delivers what the audience is expecting (e.g. if a car goes upside down, we know the camera will flip with it). The familiar aesthetic of the franchise clicks in right away.Familiarity, however, can lead to complacency. ""The Fate of the Furious"" trots out so much used material in new packaging, and that's going to be good enough for some people and not for others who like to see a franchise grow and evolve. The first film without Paul Walker, there was an opportunity to do something different, but Universal, Diesel (as producer) and Morgan don't take it. Then again, if you consistently like the one thing you order at the same restaurant, why order something different the eighth time?As something new, Theron could have been more of an exciting ""X"" factor, but her character, Cipher, is 100 percent bark and no bite. She's purely a psychological threat and despite Theron's extensive action film experience, the only thing she's asked to do in the action sequences is talk into a headset. So she does what she usually does in her lesser villain roles a la ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" — chew the scenery into powder.Scott Eastwood gets wedged into Walker's vacancy as an assistant to Kurt Russell's Mr. Nobody. He has barely a modicum of Walker's presence, and it was a mistake to try and cast him as a replacement. Better to bring in someone who brings something totally new to the table.Without Walker to share top billing, the story really revolves around Dom, but the pieces are very obviously put in place to do so. There's something really manufactured about the story that makes it hard to buy into the emotional dilemma he's faced with, like the chess board has been prearranged to force certain outcomes.These films are always good for a final act twist, and to Morgan's credit, this movie has a pretty good one that makes for an entertaining climax. The lovable insanity of these films goes on full display in this Russia sequence, helping to counteract a lot of the stale material. And the New York sequence involving an onslaught of self-driving cars is something you'd only ever see in one of these movies.The sheer audacity of the ""Fast & Furious"" movies can only save them for so long, but there's enough that's salvageable in ""F8"" to keep it from being utterly abysmal. Regardless of what I have to say, however, the films are bound to remain as resilient as Dominic Toretto flying through the air in a flaming Dodge Charger that tumbles side over side as it crashes to the ground, throwing himself from the vehicle and walking out of the other side of a massive explosion.~Steven CThanks for reading!

42,Vartiainen,Has the popcorn action flick formula down to science at this point,7,1 August 2021,"I'm still having difficulties wrapping my mind around the fact that we have eight of these films (plus Hobbs & Shaw), with a ninth on the way. I mean... really, The Fast and the Furious saga is the one with the bones to go all the way? Really?Don't get me wrong. I love these films. I really do. They're about the best simple popcorn flicks we have at the moment. They're nothing but elaborate car stunts, tough heroes driving around, fancy spy gizmoz, lots of good music and just enough genuine warmth and feels to tie it up all together.But they're stupid as heavens. They really are. Which is not really a problem, because by gods are they aware that they're stupid.But still... The Fast and the Furious has eight films. Really?That being said, I do like that they don't rest on their laurels too much. I mean, they do, but not enough for it to become annoying. This film takes a bit of a risk and forces one of its characters into an antagonistic role. Which gives the whole thing a new spin. Granted, it's still pretty predictable, but if you're here for Shakespearian drama and elaborate twists, boy are you in the wrong franchise.Nothing much more to say. It's about as good as the last three or so. Very consistent quality. If you've liked the previous ones, you're going to like this one.",The Fate of the Furious
43,subxerogravity,Frankly the best car movie I've seen it my life.,8,17 April 2017,"It puts the Carsploitation genre on another level. I mean, just when you thought The Fast and The Furious did everything with a car in the last seven movies, they do something bigger and better.If you've seen Furious 6 (Which you should) when Tej (Played by Ludicrous) was like ""hey guys, they have a tank"". He thought that was a big deal, that the bad guys are riding around in a tank. Now two Furiouses later, he has a tank, but the enemy now has a submarine! And it was bad ass!! ridiculously bad ass!!! it's amazing how these movies raise the level of ridiculous and somehow not come across real stupid. I mean, they had Dwayne Johnson acting like he was literally made out of rock, with the feats of strength he pulled off. From tossing two bad guys into six with ease, to kicking missiles out the way, and no matter how stupid it got, I could not help but to love The Rock while he's doing it (But you know, it's The People's movie Star).But I have to be honest, if you are a die-hard Fast and Furious fan (I don't know if this name is official but I like to call myself a Furiouso). It's not the best of the 8. Fast Five, Fast Six, and Furious Seven all seemed to go up in quality as the action got bigger on the budget getting bigger, but with F8, it's still a great flick, but the quality is not progressing.Mostly with the character development. I felt other movies in the series allowed everyone in the cast their moment to shine, but the ensemble here is now far too big with too many super stars like Vin, and the Rock and Jason Statham and brand new Charlize Theron as an incredible villain. This leaves most of the other cast under used, like Tyrese Gibson who was funny, but it was all one liner after one liner without Roman Pearce doing anything.Still, it's one of the best blockbusters of the year. It has all the bells and whistles needed to keep you cheering in your seat as you watch all the glorious action unfold.Literally The Fast and The Furious is becoming like Avengers on Wheels.http://cinemagardens.com",The Fate of the Furious
44,jtindahouse,Pretty damn strong for a seventh sequel,7,16 April 2017,"Th evolution of 'The Fast and the Furious' series is quite a severe one. What started out as pretty simple boy racer films, have now pretty much turned into the American equivalent of 'James Bond'. They cover the entire globe and have story lines that involve saving the world. So were they better as the simple films they originated as, or what they have become now? I think they're better as what they've become. Why? Because they can legitimately pull it off. They have the cast, the characters and the budget to do what few films can. 'The Fate of the Furious' is the eighth edition to the series and it seems the only thing that could stop the output of sequels is infighting between the cast. Other than that though I can't see it. They make money and have a very loyal and eager fan-base.The film itself is about what you'd expect. The action is non-stop, the one-liners are plentiful and cars and gadgets are as impressive as you'd hope they'd be. The story line actually worked very well too, cleverly turning a member of the crew against the others.There are of course time where you need to turn your brain off, or simply except the implausibility of certain things. If you happen to have trouble doing that then this may not be the film for you. The acting can occasionally be a little cringe-worthy as well. These guys are great at being action stars, however when they try to get serious their weaknesses tend to shine through a touch.Fans of the series will be quite at home with this film, and others that find themselves in the theatre for whatever reason will have a good time too. To be on your seventh sequel and still have the quality arguably on the incline is an impressive thing. I will await what they come out with next.",The Fate of the Furious

The greatest actor of all time (I refer to Vin Diesel, of course...), oops, he did it again! He performs in this film a super scientist, a little bit wiser than Einstein and Isaac Newton taken together, who discovers the way, long-dreamed by the mankind, of how to destroy as many cars as possible. That's why Karl Benz invented the car in the first place, to be destroyed by Dominic Torretto, Vin Diesel's character in this movie. As the world evolves, I'm sure that, over a thousand years from now, those of then will remember this... If you want to see The Rock, not the asteroid 2014 JO25 ""The Rock"" but Mister Pack Of Muscles The Rock, I'm sure that you can give up to 5-6 bottles of juice of natural fruits(which would help your real physics health) and buy a ticket for this super-production. Especially you can see the sensual Charlize Theron as the Airborne & Atomic Submarine Super-Boss, future Master Of The World(watch out, there is another one coming soon in 2019, Fast & Furious 9!). I don't know what are the sins of Helen Mirren (Magdalene Shaw, Jason Statham's mother) (uncredited) and of the particularly talented Kurt Russell (Mr. Nobody), to be forced to act in this... Wasted for what? For a few dollars more in their bank account? Or, maybe I did not understand well, is it a melodrama and we have to cry?

But the plots are not why they are so much fun to watch now, are they? This one starts with Vin & Michelle living in Cuba, where they are taking it easy, living the retired life. Charlize shows up, shows Vin something on a phone-which we don't find out until later, exactly what it is-and Bam! Vin sabotages the next gathering of his 'family' while they are on a mission, which puts Dwayne in jail and Vin on the run, working for Charlize, who turns out to be a big shot cyber terrorist that has some kind of a master plan involving Vin stealing things for her. While Dwayne is in jail, he runs into Jason, the bad guy from the last movie, and you just know that the sparks are going to fly. There are lots of fights, car stunts, car chases, cars falling out of buildings, Heck, there is even a car chase with a submarine! I can pretty much guarantee that you will not be bored. You might role your eyes in disbelief but you will be entertained! FYI: They do mention Paul Walker's character briefly but he-or any CGI version of him-does not make an appearance on screen. Vin does make a minor tribute to Paul's character, though. There are no scenes during or after the end credits, so there is no need to stick around. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, destruction and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 16 minutes. If you like the series, you should enjoy this one, too.

50,alindsay-al,An average over the top action film,5,14 April 2017,"I started watching this franchise with the last film furious 7 and I enjoyed it for what it was a fun ridiculous action film. So I had some excitement for this film and unfortunately it is a disappointment even though it does keep up some of the excitement. The premise of the film sees Dom toretto turn on his team to work with a cyber terrorist, this sees the team have to track him down and stop him. Vin diesel returns as Dom in this film and he gives one of his better performances in the film as Dom is given a lot of emotional weight to his performance and you end up caring about him. However, I feel like his character got way to much focus and I do feel like he goes on to his usual stoic self which takes away from the latter parts of the film. Jason statham is back as deckard shaw in this film as a reluctant ally and statham is great in the role, he adds a lot of humour to the role and is obviously great in the action scenes. Dwayne the rock Johnson is also back as Hobbs and he does the best he can to elevate this film, he has so great one liners and also sells the action scenes. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast are just not that interesting, Michelle Rodriguez just is pretty bland and I really didn't care about her situation. Tyrese Gibson is ridiculously over the top in this film and I found him annoying in this film and charlize Theron is just a pretty bland villain to be honest. The story has some good emotional weight to it that involves Dom and his story you do care about him. However, this film really fails at the team element that I thought the last one succeeded at and I just feel it didn't have enough depth to it. The script has it's fun dialogue in it especially with some of the rocks dialogue and occasionally the drama was okay. But it didn't hit as much as it should have and some of the one liners are incredibly cheesy. The style of the film has some especially fun hand to hand action scenes that were worthy of any action movie that I enjoyed. It also has some very good car action scenes but my issue is just how ridiculous they are and that the CGI budget seemed to run out with some of the effects. Overall this is an average fun film to have on in the background but unless you are a huge fan of this franchise I don't believe it is worth a watch.",The Fate of the Furious
51,Fluke_Skywalker,The Fast and the Ridiculous,6,4 July 2021,"Every once in a while a movie comes along that challenges all of your preconceptions and resets the bar for what you thought was possible. Fate of the Furious... isn't that movie.Oh it's not a bad movie--Okay, it's a bad movie--but it entertains. Sorta. It's cinematic fast food. Poor quality, probably not good for you, but at 3 AM it tastes good enough.Where it falls short is in comparison to the previous films; Particularly 5-7. Those films, where the formula was reinvented to mirror something like Ocean's 11, but with more nitrous oxide and female butt cheek closeups, really took the phrase ""dumb fun"" to a whole 'nother level. That same blueprint is used here, just not as effectively. I suppose the loss of director Justin Lin (replaced here by the thoroughly average F. Gary Gray), who ushered in that new formula and style, may have something to do with it. As does the lack of the late Paul Walker. Walker wasn't anyone's idea of a great thespian, but all of the focus on ""family"" only serves to highlight his loss, and he's missed.The other factor may just be that the treads on this particular vehicle are getting a little worn down. Eight movies in any franchise likely puts it past its sell by date, but one that focuses on car shenanigans especially so. The cast look over it. The actions is, well, fast and furious, but they look and sound for all the world like they're waiting for the director to yell ""Cut!"" so they can go back to their respective trailers and check on how their Bitcoin stock is doing.If you've come this far chances are you'll find this entry an agreeable enough time waster. But for those looking for the ""heights"" of the series at its best, they're likely to be furious.",The Fate of the Furious

54,kirbylee70-599-526179,Saving the World,8,19 December 2017,"The Fast and Furious franchise is not one that people saw coming. The initial tale of street racers running afoul of the law has morphed over the years to become an action series where those same street level thieves are now the hottest super team saving the world from destruction. And while some (my mother included) would use the phrase ""you expect me to believe that?"" while watching the film, it really doesn't matter. The movies aren't about realism, they're about escapism. Fueled by fast cars, numerous explosions, incredible hand to hand combat and bad guys galore at their center they are all about family. Such is the case with this latest chapter.The film opens in Cuba where Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) are vacationing. Of course the movie opens with a high octane (sorry I had to go there) street race between Dom and a local street racer ending with Dom earning the man's respect with a win. Out getting coffee the next day Dom is hijacked by a woman known as Cipher (Charlize Theron) with a secret she uses to force him to work for her.When the team is called out on a new mission, where should they get caught they will be disavowed, recovering a stolen EMP device in Berlin. Things go according to plan (with plenty of car chases and damage) but then Dom runs team leader Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) off the road, leaving him to be caught and taking the EMP.Hobbs is sent to prison where Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and his protg nicknamed by the group Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood) offer him a chance to work for them if he signs a confession. He refuses and enters the prison, unaware that this is the same location where Deckard (Jason Statham), the villain of the last film is imprisoned. The pair threaten each other constantly when they suddenly find a prison break presented to them. The duo fight their way separately through the throng but exit at the same time into the waiting hands of Mr. Nobody.Now, along with the team, they must work together to find Dom and discover what happened, why he changed sides. As they do so their base of operations is breached by Cipher and Dom and the God's Eye, the top secret computer program that allows them to view any and all around the world, is taken. Left bruised both physically and emotionally the team goes back to trying to locate them using old school techniques.It pays off in the end and the next target they find Cipher stealing is nuclear codes held by a Russian diplomat in New York. The team sets out to make sure it doesn't happen and of course more car chases and action ensues. All of this takes place on the crowded streets of Manhattan and the thrills are on display with plenty of edge of your seat moments. But the codes are stolen and the team almost captures Dom but he escapes. He has a moment where he could take Letty out but lets her live.This leads to a moment that will cement Dom's future plans for Cipher. The secret she has over him involves family, something that she constantly belittles him for and tries to break down with each assignment she gives him. What she doesn't realize is just how important that is to him, how it reaches down into his core being. It is a startling moment in the series but must happen to get to the next level. And it is family that will pursue Cipher and attempt to rescue Dom with the fate of the world now at play.Come on, these movies aren't about Shakespearean drama, these are popcorn movies. They're meant to entertain and thrill us like a roller coaster ride. And the fact remains that this franchise is one that consistently does just that, outdoing the previous film each and every time.That being said the actors involved consistently provide their best offerings. They don't treat it like this is a comic book world of unbelievable stunts, they make their characters seem real and their concerns seem genuine. That's not an easy task when surrounded by 150 mph cars and giant wrecking balls while tracking down rogue nukes. And yet they accomplish it each and every film.Rumors abound that various cast members are unhappy with others, that some are jealous of the roles increased/decreased in the series. That's sad to hear. Perhaps they could take a note of the concept that strikes at the heart of this film, that of family. They've become family to the fans of the series who continue to make this one of the most financially successful film franchises out there. Perhaps they need to set aside the self-importance they seem to feel about themselves and realize that the series helped to make them bigger stars than they were when it started, that the fans long to see them carry on and that in so doing they continue to make enormous amounts of money. When that happens we'll see them once again in the next chapter of the series.",The Fate of the Furious
55,davispittman,Very entertaining well made instillation,8,17 April 2017,"I really had a great time with The Fate and the Furious, or as some call it, Fast 8. It's just as good as the previous film, Furious 7, which was great. The cast is mostly the same as the last movie, with the exception of Paul Walker of course and with the addition of a few new characters. Diesel, Johnson, Theron, Rodriguez, Statham, Eastwood, Russel, and Mirren are all great in the movie. The acting is to the same caliber as the last movie, I thought there were good performances all around. I loved Charlize Theron as Cipher, the villainess the team must deal with and stop from causing a potential World War III. I loved Scott Eastwood as the rookie assistant of Kurt Russel, perfect for the role. The plot was well written and very well executed. The special effects were typical fast and the furious style. Very loud, over the top and extremely exciting/fun effects. You will never ever be bored with the action sequences, that's for damn sure. And even though Brian and Mia aren't present in this movie, they do get a shoutout and the movie gives a very sweet, thoughtful tribute to Brian. Really the only thing I personally didn't care for and got kinda tired of was Tyrese Gibson and his characters jokes. I thought he was funny sometimes but it got to where every time the camera was on him he was making some joke and there were times when they just didn't really work. The chemistry between the actors are just as great as ever and I thought the movie was just a great very fun way to spend an evening, which is how I feel about the rest of the movies in the franchise. All in all it's a good movie that I highly suggest. 8/10.",The Fate of the Furious
56,TdSmth5,Getting duller,6,26 June 2017,"Dom is in Cuba helping his Cuban cousin when he runs into one of the Matrix twins, I mean, Charlize Theron with some ridiculous haircut as super cyber criminal Cypher. She shows him something on a phone which will get him working for her. She's right.Next, the gang is somewhere (Berlin allegedly, at night, so who knows) grabbing an EMP bomb but Dom goes rogue and takes the bomb for Cypher. On her plane we learn what it is that she has on Dom and why he has to work for her. Hobbs ends up happily imprisoned. It takes quite some effort on Mr. Nobody's and his sidekick's (because in this series, you can't have enough actors apparently, and Clint Eastwood seems to have a son who of course has to be an actor one way or the other.) part to get him to work for the government and to get Dom together with the team and Deckard.Dom's job then becomes grabbing a nuclear football from the Russian Defense Minister who is in New York. By now the team nearly manages to get Dom, but even half a dozen of them can't stop the might Dom...Then Cypher wants to steal a Russian sub somewhere in Siberia (Iceland actually). Dom has to go along until he sets things straight.Furious 8 is your usual globe-trotting by countless actors whose purpose in the movie isn't clear. Furious 7 benefited from the strong direction by James Wan. So to go from there to F. Gary Gray is a step in the wrong direction. The overall story is also a bit more tired but at least many of the goofy characters and lines are absent. The concept as a whole is also problematic, you have one of your main characters switch sides, however unbelievable, but it's simply not what you want to see, the team turning against each other. The character of Cypher is your usual talkative villain who gives these pseudo-philosophical speeches about fate and choice, she's evil, sure, but also very annoying. Luke Evans makes a two-second appearance. Now here they have a compelling actor and character but make no use of him. Of all the action set-pieces, only the final one in Iceland manages to impress. Of course, cars and driving are hardly anywhere near the center of these movies anymore. Gray's fighting scenes aren't convincing at all, he cheats with his direction as the camera always arrives late for the punch or the kick.Furious 7 would and should have been a fitting end on a high note to the series in many ways. Unfortunately they can't stop themselves from making more millions that they don't need and this is going to drag on and on. Furious 8 isn't terribly bad but it's nowhere near as impressive and entertaining as 7 or 5.",The Fate of the Furious

61,rgkarim,Fate Smiles on 8,8,13 April 2017,"A couple of years ago, we had what we thought was the final chapter of the Fast and Furious legacy, ending with the montage of the fallen hero Paul Walker. Sadly, it seems that the cinema world can't let it go, and thus comes the subject of my latest review Fate of The Furious (or Fast 8 for short). After the fake, ridiculous of number 7 (minus the ending), I can't say I was happy from the trailers for this film and how it looked even cheesier. What is my verdict? Read on to find out my friends. LIKES:  Action more controlled  Comedy stays strong  Soundtrack  Story Is Much BetterSummary: If you remember Furious 7, you remember how over the top the stunts were and the sheer ridiculous factor they had (e.g. superhuman feats, near invincibility, invulnerable cars). Fortunately, Fast 8 toned the action back to the baseline ridiculous of this action franchise, keeping things reeled in to a point of somewhat believability. While this may tone down the action somewhat, this installment still packs plenty of punch with diverse sequences including: drag racing, gun play, martial arts, and of course car combat. It's suspenseful, it's fun, and at times it is really funny, providing that popcorn flick entertainment value you like. In addition, the stellar soundtrack contains both musical scores and music that fit well with the movie, (I myself enjoyed a few original R&B/rap songs near the end of the film). Speaking of funny, Fast 8 doesn't hold back on the comedic antics that the second film brought. Dwayne Johnson interjects his brand of corny insults and tough talk, establishing a banter rivalry with Jason Statham, who not only has a few clever quips, but finally redeems his pitiful character in this film. Yet the main source of laughs comes from Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous. This comedic duo performs plenty of stunts, deliver plenty of well-written insults, and put their foots in their mouths so many times to keep you chuckling through the entire film. All of the laughs keep things light and relieve the tension to help ground the film into a PG-13 environment. Hands down though, is the improvement over the story. Fast 8 reaches back into its roots for our plot, bringing back the character development and crime element of the film that started it all. Dom's tale of deceit throws plenty of nostalgic shade at our leading hero, including some unexpected twists that help tie together SOME of the loose ends. Fans will find plenty of emotion in this film, and hopefully will enjoy the action built around the plot (instead of the other way around). In addition, the fact that Statham's character is released in this film (making the plot of seven almost useless) was a good thing for all the redemption they brought with his character. I give the group applause for the improved story element, despite how bad it looked in the trailers (guess you can't judge a movie by its trailersometimes). DISLIKES:  Still ridiculous at times  Some Cameos not worth it  Editing Still needs some work  There is going to be a number 9 Summary: Let's face it, this installment is famous for how ridiculous Hollywood special effects teams want to push the limits of cars. Fast 8 does not escape this curse, for it is still filled with absolutely hilarious (though somewhat impressive) stunts. I don't wish to reveal too much, but let's just say the submarine racing them isn't the most ludicrous thing you'll see, nor the biggest stretch (bad guys can't seem to aim) of the imagination. Still it is an improvement over 7. As I said earlier, Fast 8 has some twists you might not see coming, which leads to some unexpected cameos (unless you look at the cast list cheaters!). Some these moments are impressively, or spot on timed to maximize their appearance. Yet there are others that were wasted and could have greatly been expanded upon to further amplify their involvement. I can't say much, but I will admit that almost all the guest appearances held pertinence to the story, they just needed more time. Yet the biggest flaw is still the editing of the films. Fast 8 may have lots of excitement to keep the movie going, but there are plenty of moments that could have been left for the directors' cut. A random cousin at the beginning for an almost pointless race, an overdramatic taunt that gets lost in the scheme of the movie, and even a few punch fests just weren't needed. In addition, some of the characters felt a little robbed, until that one factor comes in where they are needed. These sloppy moments feel disjointed, unnecessary, and dilute the story into those eye-rolling moments that could have been so much better. Perhaps these moments will be strengthened in the next movie, which is a strong hint to come (a shame compared to how well this movie could have tied things up). The Verdict:Overall, this reviewer liked Fast 8 much better than Furious 7. With a much better story (strengthening the limitations of its predecessor), toned down stunts, and an atmosphere that feels much like the earlier installments, this movie is a step in the right direction for the impending sequels to come. Yet, it still doesn't reach the balance some of the previous films have. The editing and character balance still needs some work so that all the characters feel absolutely necessary instead of convenient. Still, it is a worthy theater film, and will provide the aisle stomping entertainment you are looking for. Let's hope ""Fate"" smiles on the next sequels to come from this seriesand hope they can keep the momentum going. Action/Crime/Thriller: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",The Fate of the Furious
62,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Fate of the Furious,6,8 May 2017,"There was a time when MTV was all about music videos. There was a time when Kid Rock was a rapper. There was a time when ESPN was fixated on sports. Finally, there was a time when The Fast and the Furious movies were drive-in fodder and actually about car racing. Now, Vin Diesel and company are into saving the world, redefining the concept of locomotion, and going the veritable Jason Bourne route.The Fate of the Furious (my latest review) is the 8th installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez are the only actors left from the original flick. ""Fate"" has Vin's Dominic Toretto being forced to go seamlessly rogue. It's a nice little wrench in the buildup-free plot and an applicable way to keep this film series going. Expect the usual dose of lame dialogue (""I will beat you like a Cherokee drum""), mediocre acting (with the exception of villain Charlize Theron), power steering that would shame Mario Andretti, and ludicrous depictions of character globetrotting (the cast travels to Havana, Berlin, New York, and Russia all in the blink of an eye). Also, be on the lookout for silly yet heart-pounding action sequences courtesy of director F. Gary Gray (Law Abiding Citizen, Set It Off).Whether it's cars driving themselves and falling out of buildings, automobile chases with the addition of submarines, or fight scenes that would make Chuck Norris jealous, it looks like a billion dollars was plastered on the screen (that's the box office gross ""Fate"" has made already). Watching The Fate of the Furious, you realize that there are enough outlandish, ""yeah right"" moments capable of forming a drinking game (for the record, I don't encourage this behavior).All in all, Gray takes whatever he did in The Italian Job and kicks it up ten notches. His camera moves like a lightning bolt, making CGI, gizmo-ed gadgets, and stunt work the equivalence of a habitual drug. When The Fate of the Furious exhaustively ends, you'll immediately know that another sequel is in the works. Might as well keep the money train rolling with another dose of nonsensical, gear head entertainment. My rating: An amusing and smash-mouth, 2 and a half stars.",The Fate of the Furious

64,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Continues to uphold the bar,7,29 May 2017,"Putting all criticisms aside, it is truly amazing how quickly this franchise has expanded. In a matter of less than two decades, a simple race car thriller known as The Fast and the Furious (2001) has created practically as many sequels as the original Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) did. That's mind blowing. This should prove to viewers who do and don't enjoy it that the producers must know what they're doing when each film passes its predecessor. However being that actor Vin Diesel has clearly stated that there will only be 10 entries in the story, it's rather difficult to think anyone would stop there. Some fans might have hoped that after Furious 7 (2015) was released, would mark the end of the series. Looking at it that way would make sense because of how well the film sent off Paul Walker and his character. With that, there was concern of how the next entry would deal with this absence. Don't worry though, everyone on board seemed to have thought of everything.Sometime after the events of Furious 7 (2015), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) are relaxing when Toretto is confronted by a person called Cipher (Charlize Theron). Not long after blackmailing him, Cipher begins using Toretto to do her dirty work. This in turn betrays the family he has been so heavily involved with from the start. Trying to stop Toretto, Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) arrives and adds Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) to the crew, which many hesitate on. Yet Letty, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris) and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) all know they need all the help they can get. Cipher also has a deadly yes-man by the name of Rhodes (Kristofer Hivju) who isn't afraid to kill. Meanwhile Mr. Nobody added a newbie to his roster too, that being Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood). But that's not all, there's several other character appearances. Writer Chris Morgan seems to know just how to give a wink and nod at every turn.Character development is continuously growing throughout the entries. New roles are added, which then in turn begin to build on their foundation with a series of trials that'll prove themselves to others. All actors within the story give amiable performances. This goes for protagonists and antagonists. The fast crew all have great quips with each other and even manage to respectfully squeeze in a reference or two to Paul Walker's character. The comedic elements are what really help push the likability of these characters. Seeing Tej and Roman or Luke and Deckard bicker, is all for a good laugh. Little Nobody shows that even he can be funny due to his lack of understanding with the original crew. Charlize Theron and Kristofer Hivju as the two baddies are great at being the villains. They show no mercy in their killing. This will also show to the fans that the people working on this movie know how to play with one's emotions. Not everything is green pastures for the fast crew.The sequences involving action are well staged. It's also great to know that director F. Gary Gray utilized as many practical effects as he could. And like always, the action is turned up another notch to the point of being unexpected. Each time, the stunts get crazier and crazier. Lots of cars were destroyed, there's no doubt about that. Unfortunately there is one minor gripe about this. When things start to get harry in New York, the scene will possibly become a little over gratuitous in its delivery. There's a point where so many cars are getting wrecked, it can get comparatively overwhelming. At some point viewers might ask, ""Okay we get it, how much of that is needed?"" kind of question. Labeling that as an isolated issue, the rest of the sequences are fine because it is not so blatant in its destruction. As for the physical possibilities of handling these scenarios, it's highly unlikely. This franchise is at a point though where belief has to be suspended to a point.Camera-work has always been a strong point in the franchise's last few entries and it remains that way. Thanks to Stephen F. Windon, the way the camera captures all action and visuals blends very well together. Again this all goes back to finding ways of being creative. There are several angular shots that work to give the viewer a better of idea of what it's like to be in a certain situation. This also applies to the non action related shots. Wide scope panning shots are also much appreciated in letting the viewer take in the sights to see what and where the characters dwell. All visually pleasing. Another weak point however is Brian Tyler's musical score. Although he has been scoring the franchise for a number of entries now, there's not much to mention over it because its sole purpose is just to elevate the experience with no emotional weight. That's not to say it isn't composed competently, but it does not add to the pressure of what is being presented on screen. All in all though, another solid entry.Fortunately for this franchise, the cast and crew know how to keep pushing each new film to entertain. The music is sadly undetectable and one action scene feels a little too much, but other than that, the rest of the action, the actors, camera-work and story make another great installment in the series.",The Fate of the Furious
65,rannynm,"Ridiculous Action Scenes, Fun Characters, Slick Cars - Just What the Fans Love!",8,14 April 2017,"The Fate of the Furious is an enjoyable entry into the Fast and Furious franchise that brings exactly what fans want to see: ridiculous action sequences, fun characters and slick new cars. Directed by F. Gary Gray, The Fate of the Furious opens with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) on their honeymoon in Cuba when his team is called to assist Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) with a mission in Berlin. Dom ruins the mission by going rogue and leaving Hobbs injured on the side of the road. The team soon figures out that Dom is working with a cyber terrorist by the name of Cipher (Charlize Theron). To take down Dom and figure out why he has changed sides, they must enlist the help of old friends as well as new ones. My favorite part of this film is the jailbreak scene where Hobbs has to stop an old enemy named Deckard (Jason Statham) from escaping prison and wreaking havoc. Seeing two action heroes fighting their way out of prison and preparing to duke it out is exhilarating and had me pumping my fists in the air with excitement. This scene is over-the-top and outrageous but I was having too much fun to care.I am an outsider to this franchise, having never before seen a Fast and Furious film. I really enjoyed this movie. As this franchise has evolved, it has learned what the fans want to see. By not taking itself too seriously, the cheesy dialogue and slow-mo feel a little more fitting with its lighter tone. The way this film works is that it knows it's absurd and has fun with it.I don't love the story because it tries to do too much, a common thing in blockbuster movies today. The opening sequence in Cuba is unnecessary. It barely has anything to do with the plot but it does establish the mood and tone. By upping the ante with ridiculous action from the very start, it prepares the audience for what's to come. There are also a lot of characters to follow and sometimes the plot gets a little too ridiculous for comfort. But if you're going to see this film, it's not for a strong story.Some performances in this film are very funny. Tyrese Gibson is hilarious as Roman. He has a lot of fun with this role and is very energetic. Dwayne Johnson is another standout who delivers an amusing performance. He maintains his action hero persona while also exercising his comedic chops. The lesson of this film is that you should never turn your back on family. Even when Dom goes rogue, his team never gives up on him. I recommend this film for ages 14 to 18 for its mild language and violence. I give The Fate of the Furious 4 out of 5 stars. Overall, The Fate of the Furious is a film that should be appealing for outsiders to this franchise as well as those who have been on this ride since the very beginning.

66,justin-fencsak,"If Furious 7 was The Empire Strikes Back, then Fate is Return of the Jedi..",7,24 August 2017,"When Paul Walker's character drove into the sunset at the end of Furious 7, it marked an end of a famous character as well as its movie star, Paul Walker, who died a few years before the movie came out in a tragic car crash. That movie was Fast and Furious at its peak, when it broke records for the franchise. In this sequel to that movie, a baby boy adopted by Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) is named fittingly enough Brian. The main boss this time around is Charlize Theron's character, who ranks among the sexiest villains of all time. She falls in love with Torretto and kills Toretto's wife (played by Elsa Pataky) with the help of her adviser. Jason Statham is back, as well as Michelle Rodriguez and others, in an epic fight to the finish that takes place over land, sea, and air. The best part of this movie has to be the end in which the crew fights against a sub in icy Russia. I think this movie is my third favorite of the franchise along with Fast Five and Furious 7. Can't wait to see what they bring with the 9th and final installments, as well as the spin off movies.",The Fate of the Furious
67,Rob_Taylor,The Clown Patrol Rides Again...,5,26 May 2018,"Every time I watch one of these films I say to myself ""Well...it can't be any more ludicrous than the last one!""Every time, I am proved wrong.Whatever the Fast and Furious was back in the beginning, it is not that anymore. The simplicity of street racing was lost to someone's bright idea to ""spy up"" the series into a poor man's version of James Bond. The action is beyond ridiculous at this point, paying almost no attention to real world physics and reveling in that fact. I actually laughed out loud at one scene, involving the notion that a man alone on an frozen lake can be protected from an explosive fireball by simply parking cars all around him.But the real tragedy of what the Fast and Furious franchise has become is not its ridiculous, could-never-happen stunts. Nor is it the fact that it has mutated from a simple racing drama to a nonsensical spy thriller.No. The real tragedy is that everyone plays it so straight-faced and serious.When you have such craziness on screen, and all the characters are being deadly serious about it all, the disconnect is palpable. At this point, the franchise should be focusing much more on the comedy aspect. Everything that it throws up on the screen is so laughable, yet everyone on screen is so po-faced and earnest. It just doesn't work.In this episode, I watched with my usual sense of disbelief and the conviction that I was wasting two hours of my time. The movie hurtled along, with the characters reprising their usual roles. All very serious and trying (unsuccessfully) to convince the viewer that there was any real jeopardy or danger. I resigned myself to being disappointed again.Then up pops Jason Statham's character. Lively, and clearly understanding how ridiculous the movie he was in was going to be. Now, I'll be the first to admit that he isn't the world's greatest actor, but he has charm and wit in spades. The moment he appeared, all the others, with perhaps the exception of Dwayne Johnson, looked like the shallow, going-through-the-motions-for-a-regular-paycheck actors that they were.The scene where Statham fights his way through a plane of bad guys with one hand, whilst holding a baby in a cot in the other, all the while uttering one-liners that would make any 80's action hero nod approvingly, was the ONLY highlight of the film. It worked only because it was clear Statham was not taking it all too seriously and was having fun on set.Yes, fun. You remember fun don't you, Vin Diesel? How about you, Ludacris Bridges? What about you, Tyrese... Oh yeah... we need to talk about Tyrese.Remember the Star Wars prequels, people? Remember how annoying and insulting Jar Jar Binks was? How pointless his character was? Well, that is Tyrese Gibson's character. He is Jar Jar Binks. He's not so much the comedy sidekick, as the comedy side kick around. He never has anything to do other than be the butt of everyone else's humour and to constantly remind us, in deed and word, that he is totally stupid and useless.What is worse, he isn't even funny. Just sad. Really, really sad. And in comparison to a genuinely funny character like Statham's, it only amplifies how bad he is. So, then, in a nutshell, F&F8 is just another boring episode in a franchise that lost its way long ago. One can only hope that, with the announced spinoff starring Johnson and Statham (who do work well together on screen), those two actors will be spared the further embarrassment of being fixtures in this series. A series that takes itself far too seriously and has little to offer except more of the boring and ridiculous sameness that you saw in the last episode, or the one before that.SUMMARY: First in the series that made me burst out laughing at the stupidness of it all. Takes itself far too seriously, with insulting characters and over-the-top action even a five year old would have difficulty swallowing. Not recommended.",The Fate of the Furious
68,eric262003,Fast Cars and Tight Alliances,8,27 August 2018,"One of the reasons I was given the task to watch ""The Fate and the Furious was that it promised to be bigger, more explosive, and more extravagant than its predecessor. The swimsuits will be thinner than before, the weaponry will be more menacing and the stunts will be more death-defying. But just like every sequel that comes its way, it offers some new directions for it and it gives the audience a thing or two to reflect upon a familiar theme going for them. Like James Bond who's dependent on his queen and his country, Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto 's loyalties are focused on cool cars and family bonding. Torretto defines the American outcast who relies on teamwork and every stop he makes, he makes it his home.Family has been the top priority in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, and the more they gather, the more fearsome they could get. Since its fruition in 2001, the ""Fast and Furious"" had depended on this formula of fast action, cool cars, hot babes and everyone getting in on the action and having his and her fun in the sun. It's this kind of idiosyncrasy that gains it fan base to come and watch them and because they always bring some thing new to the table to quench the thirst of what new ideas they have next for the franchise. The film always depended on focally on Torretto and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) (though they weren't in all the sequels) and their dependency of their allies, most prominently cop-turned-partner Brian O'Connor (the late Paul Walker).In ""The Fate and the Furious"" much of the film subliminally conceals the fate of Paul Walker's demise much to set pieces of the story. Overtime the tribute becomes more obvious, but before it does, the story is situated in familiar territory as we see cool characters with equally awesome machinery and posed in their cars looking hot simultaneously. Under the direction F. Gary Gray, we find Toretto, Letty and the gang in Havana and he's surrounded by hot women dressed uniformly from the other women in the series all the while the crumbling foundations of the buildings are seen everywhere.As a veteran of the action movie genre, Gray starts the party and it never goes back and meanders. In the newly established post Fidel Castro era Havana, Toretto and Letty are chatting with the locals in both Spanish and English while perusing at an obscure looking car complete boat motor attached to the hood. It's a nice homage to the 2001 opener along with a laid-back pose as Toretto proposes to race in dilapidated old car as we see him storming past all the classic cars, the camera focuses on Toretto's always bare-muscled arms which has been a trademark throughout the franchise and just to show off, but to represent leadership and command.Even though it still contains fast cars and heart-pounding action, and the unsettling predicament Toretto has gotten himself into, the movie can't neglect that the movie esoterically is circling around the death of Paul Walker's death. By doing that, Gray has Toretto leaving behind his gang (Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson) which was the inevitable heartbreak in the movie. Meanwhile all the heavies of an expanding franchise come and do what's best including Jason Statham as assassin Deckard Shaw who's know an ally to Totetto to take down the villain in the movie. Dwayne Johnson returns as Logan Hobbs who still has bad blood for Toretto but willing to to team up when the going gets tough. Kurt Russell returns as Mr. Nobody and he's brought along a new partner named Eric Reisner/Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood, looking more like his famous father Clint everyday). Add in Charlize Theron as the villainous hacker Cipher, a cyber-terrorist who manipulates Toretto to abandon his alliance while holding Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) and his son hostage. Sure she wears silly dreadlock hair extensions, and is seen on her jets while hacking at the speed of sound.When it comes to the action scenes subtlety seems quite non-existent. The film depends heavily on the beat of the roaring score while the exposition contains more explosive, noisier scenes that will make your eardrums explode. The cars zoom as the story gets more surreal by the minute and as the traditions of the franchise, the cars and the character defy the laws of gravity like you would expect. The New York scenes the cars take shortcuts by driving through buildings while sporting gadgets and gizmos that would make James Bond green with envy. There's even a Bond-like fight scene in Russia where even a subterranean vehicle materializes.Sure the screeching of the tires will make you cringe, but one thing I guarantee is that there is never a boring moment. Sure it can fall victim to being predictable to the point of self-parody. And as a rule of thumb, characters must destroy and blow things up as they emerge triumphant so that they can tease us for another sequel. Though Toretto leans away from the group he get lured back in eventually, because unlike Bond he relies on teamwork. Sure the cast is multi-diverse in ethnic and culture, it's the power of teamwork that gets the job done. Toretto may be the ringleader, but it's the crew that dominates.",The Fate of the Furious

This marks the first film in the F&F franchise not to feature Paul Walker (not including Tokyo Drift). But it's still a good overall, I mean you get some epic chases, races & all kinds of really f*#ked up scenarios with cars crashing!The story in the film, Fast & Furious 8, is about Dom going rouge & partially betraying his family & friends. This was quite an interesting direction, though weirdly enough the trailer makes it sounds as though Dom's been framed & he is trying to prove his innocents. But hell the film was still great to watch!The action in this film is simply nuts! I mean, it just got crazier & crazier as it went on!

71,bkrauser-81-311064,Uncomprehensible...But the Action is Okay,6,16 April 2017,"The Fast and the Furious franchise (2001-Present) has been a bit of a sticking point for me over the years. In many ways I admire it for being an outright parody of itself while still maintaining its stone-face veneer - fronted of course by Vin Diesel: the least interesting action hero since Rick Hill. Yet every time I see Dominic ""Famaly"" Torreto jump head first out of a speeding car and onto concrete and live, I can't help but long for the days when these character archetypes were nothing more than Point Break (1991) riffs with faster cars.Seriously, can you give this guy some keys to play with? To be honest, I do not like this series. I don't like that it has taken all the, by comparison, harmless sex, cars and chauvinism of the first three movies and calibrated those elements into a super concise, soulless and frightfully cynical machine shucking materialism and bling-bling tribalism. At the center of this beast is not the need to tell an interesting story - to be honest it's not even about giving audiences high quality action either. This series now exists as a means to its own end. It exists because Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese ""I do absolutely nothing of consequence"" Gibson need it to.But for the sake of audiences who don't know or care that their being duped, I won't go into nit-picky details on Fate of the Furious's questionable physics. I won't call out the plot which at eight movies in is starting to resemble Swiss Cheese with the amount of plot holes. I won't question the bad acting, the terrible character choices, the dubious themes nor will I continue to point out that being able to drive cars good, is not a good enough reason to recruit an aggressively diverse group of pseudo-criminals for a world-saving challenge. I will graciously take that big, wide stick I got up my a** and try to meet this movie half way.Fate of the Furious takes place shortly after the events of Furious 7: Furious and Furiouser (2015), just as Dom and a recovered amnesiac Letty (Rodriguez) are getting the hang of their hip Cuban honeymoon. After the obligatory street race through Havana, Dom rendezvous with notorious super-hacker and three movie retcon Cypher (Theron) who turns him against his ""famirlehr"" for the sake of global domination (and something about a crocodile). Mr. Nobody (Russell) then retools Dom's team - adding 7th movie baddie Deckard Shaw (Statham) because of reasons - so they can all hunt him down and find out what Cypher is really up to.For immediate, unbiased cultural comparison, Fate of the Furious is not as good as Fast Five (2011) but not as bad as Tokyo Drift (2006) (which to me is like asking which poison I'd prefer drinking but, whatever). The action sequences are unique and bombastic enough to sustain regular fans of the series while being just on the cusp of unbelievably and super-unbelievably for causal fans to not say, ""did The Rock just Dr. Strangelove (1964) a f***ing torpedo?"" The supposed zombie-cars that Cypher conscripts is an especially nice techno-phobic touch allowing audiences to easily enjoy the film's signature scene while still playing with their iPhone during the movie - completely unaware of the irony.Yet there's a certain deceased actor's shadow that looms large in this film; a shadow that the movie acknowledges but in a way that only draws attention to the series' larger re-calibrations. It seemed obvious after the series used up its ""law versus lovable rogue"" tropes that it was going to foist its narrative flag behind Johnson's Hobbs character. Johnson, after all, has become a much more successful and marketable action star than the croaky, permanently sleepy Diesel. Diesel and the belated Walker would have remained the brotherly spiritual center, but every time a super-villain who looks like they're swallowing something still wriggling in their mouth ever shows up, Hobbs would be the one to track everyone down. Then Paul Walker died.As it turns out Walker's rather white bread Brian O'Connor was actually holding a lot of this series together; either as a source of undiluted exposition, an audience POV and/or a focal point of F&F's themes of brotherhood and ""feeamerler"". Without him earnestly trying to keep up with the team or casually eye-f***ing Vin Diesel, Fate of the Furious works in parts but never as a cohesive whole.I suppose we should all be thankful that series producers didn't turn around and retool the series like they did when they first realized there was franchise potential. Instead they uneasily passed the baton and will be chugging along on their laurels until either Statham's Shaw bromances the crap out of Hobbs or Scott Eastwood has more star power than being known as the last nameless soldier to die in Suicide Squad (2015). Personally I would have taken the franchise out back and smacked it repeatedly with a tire iron a long time ago. Unfortunately nothing truly dies anymore.",The Fate of the Furious
72,moviexclusive,"Loud, over-the-top action that's also inventively conceived and impeccably executed, this latest FF chapter is everything fans want and love about the franchise",7,17 April 2017,"Coming off 'Fast and Furious 7', this eighth instalment was always going to pale in comparison – not because this latest would not be able to top its predecessor with even bigger stunts but because it would simply be impossible to echo the latter's emotional poignancy brought on by the sudden and tragic death of lead star Paul Walker. To newcomer director F. Gary Gray and recurring writer Chris Morgan's credit, 'Fast and Furious 8' has the dignity to leave the honorable departure of Walker's character intact. Indeed, there are only two mentions throughout the whole film of Brian: one, when the newly wedded Mrs Toretto (Michelle Rodriguez) reminds their peacockish supporting player Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) to leave Brian and Mia to their idyllic family life; and two, Dom (Vin Diesel) makes a personal dedication to Brian. If you've seen any of the ubiquitous promotional materials, you'll know that this first chapter of a brand new trilogy intended as the grand finale of the series is premised on Dom turning his back against his 'family', joining hands with a mysterious cyberterrorist named Cipher (Charlize Theron) to steal an EMP device, a suitcase of Russian nuclear launch codes and last but not least a nuclear submarine. Oh yes, we're a long way from the street racing-centred action/ crime thrillers of before; in the words of former federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), no less than World War III is at stake here. How such a save-the-world mission would fall in the hands of a couple of street racers and some career criminals defies logic or explanation, but neither need be present in order to enjoy the testosterone-driven pleasures which this movie offers; in fact, this joyride is all about indulging in utterly over-the-top action amidst some infectious cast chemistry, both of which it delivers in spades. Demonstrating from the get-go that it is worth every bang for your buck, the movie opens with a terrific street duel in Havana, Cuba, where Dom is honeymooning with Letty. As you may imagine, the race is uneven – whereas his opponent is driving the 'fastest car in Havana', Dom is stuck in a stripped-down jalopy with a tank of nitrous oxide hooked up to the engine. By the end of the chase, Dom will be driving the car in reverse, its engine fully engulfed in flames. It is ridiculous no doubt, but inventively conceived and impeccably executed, and you'll not only find yourself on the edge of your seat by the time Dom crosses the finish line but also pumping your fist in the air. Most race and chase adventures would probably be content to end on such a high note, but it speaks to the spirit and ambition of 'Fast and Furious 8' that this is only warm-up compared to the later two even more outrageous set-pieces. The one in the middle act set in New York City has Cipher's minions commandeering an army of hacked auto-driving 'zombie' cars to stop the Russian defense minister's security convoy, before finally pinning down the target among a jumble of vehicles that have rained down from a multistory parking garage. And the piece de resistance is set in the Arctic's Barents Sea, where after failing to stop Cipher from gaining control of a Russian submarine, Dom and his crew have to outrun it before it reaches open waters. It gets as absolutely nonsensical as Luke stepping out of his vehicle to gently nudge the course of a speeding torpedo with just his bare hands, but boy oh boy if it isn't gorgeously choreographed from start to finish. Certainly, the later 'Fast and Furious' movies would not be what they are without the crackling chemistry between its leads. Gibson's banter with Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges' Tej Parker is still entertaining as ever, especially as each tries to undermine the other in order to win the affection of whip-smart computer whiz Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel). Kurt Russell's enigmatic special agent Mr Nobody shows up from time to time to join the fun, together with his new sidekick/ underling played by Scott Eastwood. But the most laughs belong to Johnson and Statham, whose incessant macho bickering is among the film's main pleasures – the latter in particular steals the show by parkour-ing out of a maximum-security prison and in a cheeky sequence atop an airplane taking out a whole handful of baddies while juggling a baby bassinet. Between them, Diesel's brooding, tortured act here is somewhat overshadowed, lacking Walker's Brian as his perfectly matched rational complement. Like we said at the start, 'Fast 7' was always going to be a tough act to follow, but this follow-up ratchets up the action in wholly insane but unexpectedly delightful ways. As a popcorn movie built and fueled by sheer adrenaline, it is not in the least disappointing and at times in fact immensely satisfying. As an ensemble piece, it boasts great chemistry and plenty of wisecracks. As the latest addition into the 'Fast and Furious' canon, it is not just fast and furious despite its two-hour plus runtime but also an absolutely worthy entry that gives fans exactly what they want. And as to the proverbial question whether this franchise has run out of gas or running on fumes, let's just say that there is plenty left in the tank for two more rounds, and it's safe to say that where this fast-car enterprise goes next is no longer bound by the laws of gravity.",The Fate of the Furious

It may feel zealously exaggerated, and with high level of adrenaline and testosterone, it is indeed excessive. However, fueled by staggering amount of star power and crowd pleasing scenes, it's undoubtedly s fantastic spectacle.Story doesn't veer much from the already established formula, another new threat that tries to divide and conquer, giving ample opportunities for the myriad of action heroes to fight, as well as collaborate, with each other. For the better parts, this works in creating a minimal drama even though there's bound to be slight disbelief concerning the plot, or just disregard of simple physic in general.The script consists of war cries from video games and old school banters from decades ago. It's not without the humor and charm, it might even be distracting if they sound too flamboyant seeing the action is downright the stuff of superhero movie. There's the same amount of fists thrown and flying cars, and any other unbelievable shenanigans in between, in glorious slow motion and less glorious CGI.It's nearly infectious in the delivery, almost looking like collection of scenes deemed to be too absurd and until now was buried in action movie vault yet they are so gleefully pompous, one can't help being dragged around by its pace. The action stars collide in battle royale style, even if one scraps all the other parts of the movie, there's an inevitable hook in the concept of The Rock, Vin Diesel and Jason Statham trading actual and verbal jabs.It also helps that choreography for fights look convincingly fast and brutal enough to suit each character. The transition between grand locations, or towards another scuffle, is accompanied by good cinematography and equally vibrating soundtracks. While it may screech towards certain parts, the actors contribute in their own way, either it through surprisingly good acting or fitting humor.There's enough in the production tank to keep the excitement rolling.

80,arungeorge13,Review – The Fate of the Furious (2017) .. redeems itself with an absolutely bonkers climax set-piece! (3/5),6,5 June 2017,"The eighth instalment in the 'Fast & Furious' series helmed by F. Gary Gray ('Straight Outta Compton', 'The Italian Job') has the most ridiculous excuse of a screenplay (by Chris Morgan) that designates our family of protagonists as sheer invincible. The villains don't really stand a chance (so much so that some of them even decide to turn over new leaves!) and the set-pieces are as cartoonish as they can get.The storyline is something that befits a Marvel movie..a psychotic villain (played by Charlize Theron) who wishes to get her hands on nuclear weapons and a team of 'superheroes' (like literally) out to stop her. After an opening that goes onto reinstate that the franchise hasn't totally given up on street racing, the scene soon shifts back to the U.S of A. But the film's first golden moment arrives not when Toretto (Diesel) gifts his muscle car to the owner of the 51′ Chevy in Havana or when Hobbs (Johnson) imparts cheeky cheer-leading skills to his daughter. It's when Deckard Shaw (Statham) seizes an opportunity to break out of high security prison; he and Hobbs go all fist and forearm on the inmates and security personnel all the while when Bassnectar's 'Speakerbox' blasts in the background.The dialogues are atrocious to the point of being unintentionally humorous. When it becomes apparent that Dom has 'gone rogue' and betrayed his family, the rest of 'em (in the next scene) sit around a table cracking awkward one-liners as if the whole 'family' concept is just a convenient sham. Morgan's screenplay impresses only late in the second half when some interesting twists are revealed and a few (old) faces show up in the form of cameos (not gonna spoil them for you, teehee!).Roman's (Tyrese) expressive nature, at times, comes across as both comic relief and annoying. Tej (Luda) is relatively more tolerable while Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) adds to the oomph factor. Letty (Rodriguez) gets to show off her skills a bit towards the end and she makes the most of it. The big WHY for Dom's betrayal sortof works its way into the film as a mawkish aspect at first, but goes on to instil great excitement towards the climax, again thanks to Statham's timely intervention.The set-piece in NYC shows clear signs of a 'big dumb action movie' where hacked cars just start falling off buildings and one can't help but let out a big sigh. Is it fun to look at? Yes! But it's also making the audience feel less connected with the characters and their actions. The franchise has reached a point wherein each geographically- varying set-piece is supposed to look more absurd than the previous ones.Gary Gray and team go absolutely bonkers during the climax set-piece in Russia where plenty of military vehicles are blown up, a preposterous stretch involving Roman and the door of a Lamborghini, Letty jumping an iceberg on her Corvette Stingray, Hobbs nudging a few snow mobiles, and Dom dodging a missile. While all this happens on the ground (on thin ice actually!), things get increasingly interesting in the air too (which needs to be relished seeing on the big screen). Slo-mo is added only at the right junctures and that helps!Charlize Theron does not have much to do other than give orders from behind a screen and hence, feels a little underused. Helen Mirren, in a cameo, makes us smile. Scott Eastwood (Walker's white-American replacement) barely adds meat to the proceedings. Kurt Russell is invariably fun. It is indeed refreshing to see Statham melding well into the franchise and becoming a significant part of it (for future sequels). He also gets some of the best scenes in the entire flick. Overall, I'd recommend giving 'The Fate of the Furious' a shot at the cinema hall for the steady dose of adrenaline-filled excitement along with that insane climax set-piece (serving oodles of incendiary gratification!).",The Fate of the Furious
81,Abdulxoxo,I got what I came looking - entertainment,7,11 February 2021,"Everyone knows what they're getting with these movies; a bunch of expensive action sequences, held together by a thin plot. Fast & Furious 8 is no different. From the outset we get a street race, taking us back to the early days of the franchise. This film gives us cars, tanks, planes, submarines and more. The gang travel all over the globe trying to stop Cipher. Some of the action is fantastic and looks really cool. You can't help but smile. Most of those moments came during fight scenes or dialogue involving Hobbs and/or Deckard. Johnson and Statham probably gave the two strongest performances in my opinion. There are also plenty of comedic moments, particularly from Roman. Just as often as it was impressive however, I was left thinking ""that's just doesn't make sense"". There were so many sequences where people should have died, but somehow they walk away without a scratch. There's a scene involving remote control cars and also a scene involving Dom getting on a plane that are cool, but are also so ridiculous.
All in all it was an enjoyable, albeit underwhelming experience. It was nowhere as good as the previous instalments but as far as over the top Vin Diesel action flicks go it was pretty good. Nothing earth shattering but is suitably entertaining.",The Fate of the Furious

83,Screen_Blitz,"More of the same over-the-top action galore you come to expect, but it's still quite a bit of fun",8,15 April 2017,"Vin Diesel and the rest of the street-racing crew (with the exception of the late Paul Walker for obvious reasons) return for an eighth installment of two hours of car crashes, explosions, and over-the- top action set pieces. Like the previous entries of the popular franchise, this brisk action thriller is more about action and explosive special effects than character and plot development. As you expect from a movie dealing with non-stop car chases, this movie delivers just that. For those hoping for an action flick with a thoughtful story and firmly constructed character, this film will more than likely to be a diminishing disappointment. But for those who could care less about both aspects, this one is a whole lot of fun, if not without a few blemishes. And the new director behind this entry is F. Gary Gray who last spawned the biopic 'Straight Outta Compton'. This film follows Dominic Torretto (played by Vin Diesel) and Letty (played by Michelle Rodriguez) on their honey moon in Cuba. During their vacation, Dom is coaxed by a mysterious hot computer hacker Cipher (played by Charlize Theron) into joining her on a diabolical operation to steal an EMP weapon supplemented nuclear launch codes. With their once-loyal friend turning against them, Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) must reunite with the crew along with their former enemy Deckard Shaw (played by Jason Statham) to stop Cipher's heinous plan and solve the mystery behind Dom's betrayal.This movie deliver just about everything fans would come to expect from a 'Fast and Furious' outing, from the bombastic car crashes, to the explosive street racing, to the close-up shots of scantily clad women (although the last one is a bit toned down). While the globe- trotting adventure shows little interest is constructing a powerful story or inspiring characters to feed off of, most of the cheers go to the street- racing scenes which exhibit our favorite characters engaging in frenetic, adrenaline-fueled car crashes that more often than not result in an excessive amount of property damage with cars blowing up and building torn with smithereens. Like the previous entries, this film shows no interest in obeying the laws of physics, or even engaging in authenticity. There's a brutal brawl in a prison, there are hundreds of cars dropped from buildings, there's a prolonged chase sequence on an icy field with Ryrese Gibson cruising across the ice on a car door, nearly every absurd stunt you can think makes it way on screen. As for the story, there is nothing special here aside from a few dark twists and surprises sprinkled along the way. Most of all characters we've come to know and love make their way back, and are charismatic as ever. Each of the cast take their stab at some humorous one-liners, particularly Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Jason Statham when are two are bantering at each other. The performances are fine, but nothing that stands out especially if you have a hard time buying Charlize Theron as a computer hacking maniac with a sinister demeanor. At the end, the characters offer a predictable message about never turning your back on family, which has become a staple in the franchise after the countless times Vin Diesel's character preaches about family. The Fate of The Furious is a loud, over-the-top action festival that is solidly entertaining for those willing to turn their brain off and enjoy the extravagant action material. While this installment doesn't quite add anything new to the franchise, it serves as a firm memo that the series still has energy in it's fuel tank.",The Fate of the Furious
84,Troy_Campbell,A massive let down,4,17 April 2017,"There are only two elements on which all Fast and Furious movies should be judged on: the crazy car-centric set pieces and the interplay between characters who, despite being stereotypes, are familiar and fun. Using that yardstick, this previously indefatigable franchise appears to have hit a wall with an almighty crash; the eighth instalment stalls its way through a relatively dull and repetitive two-plus hours that places it in the bottom half of Fast flicks. There is a plethora of car carnage as expected, but director F. Gary Gray can't muster a sequence that's as inventive or as memorable as any number of scenes from the last three films, and the finale is the most rote climax since the fourth entry. Gray seems to be devoid of the edge that James Wan (Ep 7) and Justin Lin (Ep 3-6) so gleefully brought to their vehicular mayhem and bruising fisticuffs, however he does deliver an extremely entertaining hand-to-hand combat sequence with the Stath kicking arse aboard a plane. The untimely death of Paul Walker also leaves a massive gap in the cast. His cockiness and charm as ex-Fed Brian O'Conner was the perfect antidote to Vin Diesel's muscle-head grunting and is sorely missed in this episode. His absence is only made worse by newcomer Scott Eastwood's utterly bland performance; the sooner they realise a Walker replacement is impossible at this point in the series the better. Yet Eastwood isn't the only concern, many of the established cast are clearly on autopilot. Tyrese Gibson is all shout and no laughs, Ludicrous looks tired and uninterested, and Michelle Rodriguez has the same old star-crossed lovers crap to plough through. Perhaps most disappointing is Charlize Theron's underwhelming cyber-villain, who partakes in exactly zero action and is reduced to sprouting cut-away lines like ""you're smart, but not smart enough."" The Fate of the Furious is a frustratingly tedious and unimaginative effort that, especially for a fan of the franchise like myself, is ultimately a huge let down.",The Fate of the Furious

87,educallejero,Closer to the best this franchise can give us,5,29 November 2019,"I'm in the fence with this one. I won't lie. I enjoyed the movie quite a bit when the team was together taking jabs at each other. Including the awful Ludacris, everybody was funny/fun. All of them elevated by the trio of Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Kurt Russell. Also, the overall story of agents and espionage was fine and, I think, well done. All good enough. The movie and action is crazy, but it really doesn't take itself seriously at all, at least in one half of the story, the one I enjoyed it.But. Then we had all the Vin Diesel part of the plot. He is the ""heart of the movie"" and I can't for the love of Christ stand him anymore. He actually tries to act in this one, and Jesus, he's the worst. He just can't do anything other than mumble macho posturing crap. He should get parts that only require a handful of lines in the whole movie (or Groot).So, a movie divided in half. A good one (for what it is) and a disaster.A superhero movie in disguise. But not a particularly great one, and lead by the worst. Almost as good as the best of the franchise (Fast Five).",The Fate of the Furious
88,rockman182,The Fate of the Furious (2017),7,8 June 2017,"The franchise that just keeps going. It feels like a long time ago where the film series basic premise was about two guys drag racing each other. Now, we have international plots with grand scale car chases and destruction. While I prefer small scale narratives, I'm fine with global plot expansion especially since the film has a pretty decent cast to boot. This is the first film without the inclusion of Paul Walker (not counting Tokyo Drift). I initially thought they should have ended the films with his death but this film shows that there is still life in this franchise yet.All seems to be going swell with the crew until Dominic Toretto is one day approached by a cyber-terrorist known for her criminal prowess (played by Charlize Theron). He is blackmailed to align himself with her while at the same time betraying the team he has worked with for so long. Its formulaic and somewhat predictable but I think the film still offers some fun moments with a cast that can play off each other well. With the addition of The Rock and Jason Statham into the mix its mildly entertaining to see the two bicker back and forth but have an unspoken respect for each other. The action is large scale yet again. There are crazy action scenes taking place in New York and Russia. If you are a fan of a lot of car chasing, things going BOOM action, then this film is what you want to see. And that's fine. None of these films are critically praised because they are incredibly dumb and solely exist for entertainment purposes. I do see though that the film has life to it and still has some gas (hehehe) to move forward. Its rare to see a franchise still be able to remain engaging despite being active for so long. There is definitely an endgame in sight and I can see a gigantic coming together of everyone and everything in the tenth film (which is probably the last one). For now just sit back and enjoy the ride (another one!). Its mindless fun that offers decent action sequences and witty character interactions. No harm, no foul. I would like for the titles to not be so incredibly cringe-worthy, this one was awful.7/10",The Fate of the Furious
89,phanthinga,You never EVER turn your back on family,10,15 April 2017,"Back in 2001 if someone said the movie about street racing staring Vin Diesel and Paul Walker gonna be one of the best movie franchise in the future you will think that person is crazy or smoke too much weed but now in the years 2017 the eighth installment of the series just came out and it still head strong in the heart of action lovers all over the world.This movie maybe the best of the series in my mind so far not only we have the whole team back but this time we also welcome more people to join in The Furious family.This time Dom went rouge and crazy things started to happen all around the world so one again the team being assemble by Mr.Nobody(A.K.A Kurt Russell) to not only figure out why Dom betray his family but also to stop a group of high-tech terrorist lead by the beautiful Charlize Theron.You will see Dom talking about some cheesy family speech,Roman and Tej poking each others,Hobbs and Deckard friendly rivalry as usual but went the action kick in it you know it will be all-out insane and more over the top than ever.It have everything a 9 years old kid think is awesome from beautiful girls,fast car racing,prison fight to the max with two of my favorite action sequences of the movie:Zombies car chase and Submarine chase.The chemistry between characters is top-notch and i especially like what they did with Deckart characters he now taking off the serious face he always wear and start deliver many fun comedic moment that i believe is straight out of Rick Ford in Spy.Some emotion moment is very well handle that make me almost cry out loud so when i look back it quite crazy for this kind of movie.The movie is make for everyone not only F&F fan so better buy your ticket and enjoy the first summer blockbuster of this years",The Fate of the Furious
90,jon.h.ochiai,"Big, loud, stupid fun, and worthwhile...",9,17 April 2017,"""The Fate of the Furious"" is big, loud, stupid fun, and thrilling. Yeah, the movie is the glossy dinosaur. Yet ""The Fate of the Furious"" is sublimely about family. Charlize Theron is awesome. She plays the beautiful blonde dread locked Cipher, the most compelling and charismatic villain of this franchise. Unexpectedly in ""Furious 8"" Dom played by Vin Diesel apparently turns rogue on his team, on his family. Theron's Cipher holds the dramatic source of his betrayal. In the telling scene Cipher and Dom explosively attack the base of the secret Federal Agency and his friends to obtain the omniscient surveillance program ""God's Eye"" as part of Cipher's grand scheme. Shockingly, Cipher kisses Dom and turns with a knowing glance. Dom's wife Letty, played by Michelle Rodriguez, says ""Dom, are you going to turn your back on family?"" Cipher leverages a secret over Dom. He tells her that he did what was necessary. She tells him, ""Nothing is necessary. Everything is choice...""In stark contrast with this tragic exchange, ""Furious 8"" climaxes in the Siberian tundra where Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson, diverts a speeding submarine missile over the ice with his sinuous arm. This is just stupid fun-- in a good way. The distinct charm of ""The Fate of the Furious"" is that it is big and loud, yet its heart is about family. This is the corny dichotomy that works. Theron's legendary villainous cyber hacker Cipher is much like her Evil Queen from ""Snow White and the Huntsman""—powerful and soulless. Here she is threatening without raising her voice. ""Furious 8"" has its gratifying heroes in Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, and Jason Statham, who is now the good guy. Ultimately, Chris Morgan's story works as Director F. Gary Gray expertly balances the silly, along with the stunning action, and plot twists. As the movie opens Dom and Letty are on their honeymoon in Havana, Cuba. Dom defends his cousin's honor in an insane car race, racing a car he literally supped up in minutes. Of course, Dom wins the race before the car explodes over the ocean. Cipher dismantles Dom's bliss. She exploits Dom's secret coercing him to go rogue. They are now dueling partners. Cipher is the genius nuclear weapons nihilist with global destruction on her mind. Meanwhile back in D.C., Hobbs coaches his daughter's soccer team. If they lose the consequences could be dire—TayTay concerts will be in Hobbs's future. A secret operative gives Hobbs the mission to retrieve an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) device which renders all electronics inactive. Hobbs calls on a favor with Dom, and assembles his team for the mission. Tragically, Dom betrays his ""family"" nearly killing Hobbs, and steals the EMP for Cipher. The hero now becomes the villain? Consequently, Hobbs goes to prison, because of his mission failure. He finds his arch nemesis Deckard Shaw, played by smart and bad ass Jason Statham, in the same prison. In one of the amazing narrative curves, Shaw becomes the good guy. This sets the stage for Director Gray's physics defying action, and astounding visuals. More entertaining are the relationship of Dom and Cipher, and the colorful bromance of Hobbs and Shaw. The story gets wacky at times, and there are distractions from minor screen characters. Diesel, Theron, Johnson, and Statham bring their A- games. So even amidst mounting movie disbelief, they make it worth watching. Their polarizing personas resonate with the theme of family. Director Gray provides wildly entertaining action sequences. Through bizarre Internet access Cipher commands cars crashing and plummeting out of parking structures in New York City. Statham as Shaw executes martial arts grace and power as he kills assassins on board Cipher's stealth jet. At the highlight: Cipher says, ""You're out of bullets."" Shaw says ""I don't need them for you"" ""The Fate of the Furious"" is non-stop action, humor, and never takes itself seriously. With all the mind-blowing action, I really appreciated the conflict of Cipher and Dom. Theron's Cipher is quiet ruthlessness. In one scene Cipher does the unspeakable act to remind Dom of his promise to her. Dom points his gun at her, and says ""I got no choice!"" Diesel satisfyingly displays more of his vulnerability and humanity in ""The Fate of the Furious"" than in the other movies. He and Theron have amazing chemistry throughout. This is the movie's strength. The inconsequential characters often detract the movie; mostly they are there for continuity. Tyrese Gibson and Ludadris suffer in their roles. Too bad the movie wastes the talents of Michelle Rodriguez. Her Letty could have been a more compelling presence. Even Helen Mirren has a decent cameo. Family is the powerful narrative that binds ""The Fate of the Furious"". The story concludes with the touching homage to the late Paul Walker. The movie reminds that family and love are what really count in life. ""The Fate of the Furious"" is entertaining fun, and gets it right.",The Fate of the Furious
91,Holt344,"The Fate of the Furious has plenty of great action and banter, should have been more practical and not overrelying on CGI",7,2 July 2021,"The Fate of the Furious or Fast & Furious 8 as it's titled as on screen is directed by F. Gary Gray and written by Chris Morgan. This was the forth Fast film I saw at the cinema and the only one I have only seen once, to be honest I found it to be huge step down from the previous films. With that said, it does a lot of good things right, there's some writing that is average and the editing is also just okay. Paul Walker and his character's absence probably were a part of that. Chris Morgan, the producers and the director goes deeper than ever in the spy genre and the villain who is a cyberterrorist called Cipher who gets Dominic Toretto to work for her and turns him against his team, forcing them to find Dom and take down Cipher. On second viewing I actually find the story with Dom going rogue as quite interesting, he's the one who we have followed and have always been about family, it's interesting that they went this way. Different but nice. The witty banter is back and still isn't old, Chris Morgan knows the characters so well which I find is perfect. It can be cheesy, yes. But it's what we all like about the films. I'll have to say that the tradition of filming in exotic locations is nice and one that should never be broken, they mix the story and action so nicely with the locations. There's also some really great action set pieces, but be warned, if you want logic then there won't be much of it. It's super entertaining though.The ensemble cast returns, every single actor except for Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster. Even Tego Calderón and Don Omar reprises their roles as Tego Leo and Rico Santos. Charlize Theron, Scott Eastwood and Kristofer Hivju is the new to the franchise and are some great additions. I enjoy their characters and I think Charlize does a great job at portraying the villain.Brian Tyler, who scored the third, fourth, fifth, and seventh installments, is back for Furious 8. The musical score is amazing and fitting to the tone and atmosphere, Brian continues to do impressive scores.The Fast Saga works so well because of every movie matter, as there's a red thread through all of them. You can still jump into this movie and be entertained but the film is a direct continuation from the others, specifically Fast 6 and 7. The Fate and the Furious is a good Fast movie but overall an average one. Fans of the Fast Saga will love what the producers, director and writer have in store for us. But I won't lie, it would have been better with Justin Lin returning. F. Gary Gray is a great director but not really the best director for this franchise. Justin Lin wanted to make a lot as practical as possible and I didn't get that from this director, the CGI and visual effects doesn't really look that great. The Fate of the Furious have the Furious part nailed down but isn't really Fast enough, Justin Lin or James Wan would have fixed the mistakes.",The Fate of the Furious
92,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Flashy and ridiculous action written by a 12-year-old.,5,14 March 2019,"I'll be honest and admit that this is the first movie in the Fast and the Furious franchise that I've ever seen. Sure, I've been aware of the franchise for years, but it never really appealed to me (I'm not much of a car guy after all). I got a free digital copy of this movie somewhere along the line and decided I might as well watch it since I own it. I had plenty of preconceived notions about this series based on little tidbits I'd picked up over the years, and pretty much every one of them was confirmed with this movie.I think this movie might be best summed up by one of the lines of dialogue. ""What are you, 12?"" A lot of the characters' interactions and dialogue seemed like how a 12-year-old boy who was really into cars would write them. This was especially apparent during Tyrese Gibson's dialogue, which I assumed was supposed to be funny. The plot itself was so thin that I could practically see the seams that stitched together the big action set pieces. I almost half-expected the camera to pull back and show a 12-year-old playing with toy cars at one point (a la The Lego Movie (2014)).If this movie has any redeeming qualities, it is in the ridiculous nature of these action set pieces. I'll admit that they were fun to watch, even if the premise for most of them seemed so out there that they'd never be possible. Most of the characters seemed to work pretty well together, too. Even though I did not know their background or previous adventures, I could pick up on the hints, cues, and references they dropped throughout. I might watch this movie again if there's nothing else to watch, but that's probably not likely.Flashy and ridiculous action written by a 12-year-old, I give The Fate of the Furious 2.5 stars out of 5.",The Fate of the Furious
93,RforFilm,"By stepping up the car stunts and over-the-top story lines, The Fate of the Furious proves it's still a fun road trip with a high octane engine",7,17 April 2017,"Fast cars, some races, a goofy Tyrese Gibson, a hot Michelle Rodriguez, and add the final touch of coolness that is Vin Diesel, and you've got The Fast and the Furious series. I'm still surprised by how big the turnaround for this franchise was. The original three movies were entertaining, but there were not the blockbusters that the most recent additions to the franchise were. It goes back to Fast Five, when they added Dwayne Johnson. That was also the moment when the racing themes were replaced with something of an ""outlaw renegades"" meets fancy cars. The formula made into what is still is the best of the Furious franchise. Like with any movie, a sequel needs bring the stakes and action to something bigger. Ironically with the Furious series, with a set theme of ""thieves with cars"", I'm never sure what to expect. I really enjoyed Furious 7, but the newest film has the great challenge of moving forward without Paul Walker, who seemed to carry half of the charisma. So does the focus expand to the rest of the group, keep it all on Vin Diesel, or bring in new characters? Well, The Fate of the Furious brings a little of all of the above. While in Havana, Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) helps his cousin by wining a street race while celebrating his honeymoon with his wife Letty (played by Michelle Rodriguez). Dom is found by a powerful cyberterrorist Cipher (played by Charlize Theron) who talks him in working with her. Dom and Letty join with their regular crew Roman (played by Tyrese Gibson), Tej (played by Ludicrous Bridges) to work with DSS agent Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne Johnson) into retrieving an EMP device somewhere in Berlin. While the mission goes well, Dom goes rouge, knocking out Hobbs and taking the EMP to Cipher.At first, Hobbs is arrested and placed in the prison where Deckard Shaw (played by Jason Statham), the villain from the last movie, happens to be. During a prison riot, both Hobbs and Shaw are taken out by intelligence operative Frank Petty (played by Kurt Russell)and his protégé Agent Reisner (played by Scott Eastwood) into joining a covert ops teams that will find Dom along with Cypher. The crew manages to track them using the God's Eye software only for it to be stolen soon after by Cipher. The rest of the movie is a journey from New York to the Siberian country that includes the car chases you'd expect, along with nuclear missiles and hijacked submarines. A lot of what I said towards the end may sound ridiculous, but if you've seen the previous movies, then that's what you come to expect out of The Fate of the Furious. I had fun with this movie. I definitely feel like that director F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job, Straight out of Compton) understands the entertainment value enough that despite having to bring in submarines and zombie cars (yeah, those are in here), the franchise has to continue to go in these crazy directions. Does it outdo Fast Five? That still remains the best along with Furious 7, as this unfortunately stumbles within the second half. Not only does the long running time show when many of the dialogue scenes go on too long, but some of the effects suffer. All of the action scenes look good, but there were a few moments of obvious green screen and some stunts where even my suspension of disbelief if pushed a little far. To it's credit, the story does tries to push Dominic's journey into new areas, even if it's limited by his personality. I won't reveal how, but I'd say it's a good step for what I hope is a plan for some sort of endgame. I'll give this seven Cuban classic cars out of ten. It's not the best of the series, but I'm glad their trying to make the action bigger while staying within it's over-the-top territory that we expect out of it. If your looking for something groundbreaking or something equivalent to cinematic Shakespeare, then this is the wrong series for that. This road trip is a fun ride, and I'm gonna enjoy it while it lasts.",The Fate of the Furious

I just got this film on Blu-ray and I just finished watching it what can I say? I enjoy watching this film I had a fun a lot, I love this film to death and I like it a lot. I think is my number one favorite in the series Fast Five (2011) is still my number two favorite film in the series but this one just become my favorite number 1 film. Since Paul Walker died in November 30, 2013 both of the characters Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto retired and the seventh installment completed the story arcs for both of their characters.I think Vin Diesel who took over the movie without Paul walker did a great job I also finished him watching in his early action movie xXx (2002) pretty good movie. Dwayne Johnson was far way better than he was in Furious Seven. He had much more to do than in here than he did in the previous film that was my biggest problem in the previous installment. He was only in the beginning of the film and on the end of the film in the final showdown the rest of that film he was absent but in this film he had much more to do. Jason Statham is back as Deckard Shaw and he had much more things to do then he did in the previous film. Charlize Theron as Cipher was outstanding as the bad guy I liked her performance. Michelle Rodriguez as hot chick mom was really great I love her performance in this movie. Nathalie Emmanuel as Ramsey from the previous film is also in here. I love performances from Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges and Tyrese Gibson they were great.F. Gary Gray did not do a bad job directing this film I thought he was good. I think this movie is a good action movie and way better than the new Transformers films and Terminator films. I rather watch The Fast and the Furious films then those I mentioned. Chris Morgan was excellent writer in this movie.In this movie Dom and Letty are on their honeymoon and Brian and Mia have retired from the game-and the rest of the crew has been exonerated-the globetrotting team has found a semblance of a normal life. But when a mysterious woman seduces Dom into the world of crime he can't seem to escape and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before. From the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, the elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the world's stage... and to bring home the man who made them a family.Also the movie takes on icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea which are cars on the ice, that idea was from James Bond 007 Die Another Day but still the movie borrowed I have enjoyed this movie. Everyone in this movie did great I am so happy I have this film on Blu-ray.I am not sure if hackers can hack into new cars and drive them during on the road with the computer I don't think that is impossible not with the technology was created in the decades, that's my opinion.I wasn't happy that Charlize Theron's character escaped but I hope we will see her in the next installments. I hear there are 2 installments planed and the 10th will be last one in the series.I don't think this movie is great or the best or better than Furious Seven I just think it is a good film.I love that Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham put their sides behind and start working together. I love the prison escape and love that Jason Statham saved Dominic's son on the plain. Deckard kill Han but he pay for it when he rescue Dom's son. I love the chemistry between Dom and Letty they are still married and together that's awesome.Scott Eastwood is also in this and even tough he isn't that great he is enjoyable in this flick.

Gary Gray (STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, THE Italian JOB), clearly knows the franchise he was handed.  He uses the familiar elements - and characters - wisely, tweaking that we know while adding a fresh spin on them all the while winking at the camera as if to say ""I know, I can't believe this either"".  The action is well staged and eschews the use of the shaky-cam so the audience can see what is going on, interspersing these scenes with bits of humanity.  It is at these slow ""human"" moments that this film is in danger of collapsing on itself, but Gray moves on quickly, before it doesThat is because the acting is what you would expect from this type of film.  Vin  Diesel will never win an Academy Award, but his Dom is the heart and soul of this franchise and he is front and center here as the *gasp* bad guy!  Chasing him is his ""team"" - Dwayne Johnson - looking all muscley, Michelle Rodriguez - pouting as she tries to figure out why Dom ""turned, Nathalie Emmanuel as the smart/pretty computer hacker and Ludicrous and Tyrese as the constantly bickering comic-relief sidekicks.  Add to this good ol' Kurt Russell as Mr. Nobody - the man that puts them on their mission, Scott Eastwood as a ""green horn"" charged with keeping an eye on things and Fast7 villain, Jason Statham who is charged with joining the team to bring down Dom and you have a fun and strong ensemble that is worth watching.Joining in on the fun is Charlize Theron as the mega-villain CYPHER who puts the action in motion.  She is certainly enjoying her action- film period of her career and she looks like she is having as much fun as anyone.  On top of this are cameos galore from characters new to this series and some beloved folks from the past - I won't reveal who these cameos are, that would spoil the fun - but I whooped with happiness at each one.I cannot leave this review without mentioning Statham's work in the funniest scene in the film.  This action/comedy escape scene was a stroke of brilliant fun and Statham's comedic timing was impeccable.  Add this scene to the work Statham did in the Melissa McCarthy comedy SPY a few years back and we have the making of a surprise comedy star.As I said at the beginning of this review, I'd be interested in hearing from someone who has seen none of the previous films to see how much of my reaction to this film was based on existing good will and how much was on the merits of this film alone.At the end, it doesn't really matter to me, I had a heckuva time at this film - and I think you will too - if you just roll with the flow and let this film be what this film is - a live action Bugs Bunny cartoon.Letter Grade:  A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the BankofMarquis",The Fate of the Furious
97,Anurag-Shetty,"Manages to remain a strong franchise, despite the absence of Paul Walker's character.",9,21 April 2017,"The Fate of the Furious continues with the story of Dom(Vin Diesel) & his crew including Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson), his wife Letty(Michelle Rodriguez), Roman(Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker(Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) & Ramsey(Nathalie Emmanuel). Dom is coerced to work with Cipher(Charlize Theron), who brings him into the world of global terrorism. Now, it is up to the rest of Dom's crew, to stop Cipher & Dom, before it's too late. The Fate of the Furious is a highly entertaining movie. All the action set pieces in the film are mind blowing, especially the New York set piece & the climactic set piece. The 3D definitely enhances the action on screen. Director F. Gary Gray has successfully taken the reins from Furious 7(2015) director, James Wan. However, I liked Furious 7(2015) better, because it had more of an emotional impact, due to that fantastic tribute to Paul Walker at the end of the movie. The plot of the film is obviously nothing to write home about but, that is what is expected from the Fast & Furious franchise which is known for its insanely ridiculous yet epic, action set pieces. A note on the performances. Vin Diesel is effective as Dom. Jason Statham is awesome as Deckard. Dwayne Johnson is superb as Hobbs. Michelle Rodriguez is amazing as Letty. Tyrese Gibson is hilarious as Roman. Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges is impressive as Tej Parker. Charlize Theron is spectacular as Cipher. Theron steals the show in every scene she's in & is the best villain so far, in the Fast & Furious series. Kurt Russell is good as Mr. Nobody. Nathalie Emmanuel is great as Ramsey. Luke Evans & Elsa Pataky are outstanding as Owen & Elena, respectively. Kristofer Hivju is perfect as Rhodes. Scott Eastwood is brilliant as Little Nobody.

101,dave-mcclain,"As improbable as it may sound, this is the biggest, best and most entertaining ""Fast and Furious"" film yet!",9,14 April 2017,"Amping up the action ante. (Of course that's a real phrase! I just made it up!) Movies have been doing it with vehicles since 1968's ""Bullitt"", 1980's ""The Blues Brothers"" and 1982's ""The Junkman"" (which destroyed more than 80 cars, 103 cars, and more than 150 vehicles, respectively, according to carthrottle.com). Then came the ""Fast and Furious"" movies. ""Fast Five"" is currently third on that cinematic auto casualty list, with 260 cars destroyed, while the films have claimed well over 1,000 vehicles, as a franchise. (2003's ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is number two, at 300 vehicles, and 2011's ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" currently holds the record, having sent a whopping 532 cars to the scrap heap. ""The Blues Brothers"" now stands at #8.) Of course, with the F&F movies, it's not just about the numbers; it's about the creativity. ""Fast & Furious 6"" showed us the destructive power of a large safe being dragged up city streets at high speeds and ""Furious 7"" included a car driving straight from the upper floors of one skyscraper to another – and a bunch of cars ""jumping"" out of an airplane! Is it even possible for ""The Fate of the Furious"" (aka ""F8"", PG-13, 2:16) to top those scenes? Apparently it is! As the movie opens, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) are enjoying a quiet honeymoon in Havana, Cuba, and talking about possibly starting a family, when Dom gets involved in a street race on behalf of a relative. The thrilling race sequence concludes before the movie's opening credits, giving the impression that we have just seen a mini movie – and one that was almost worth the ticket price all by itself. But this is the eighth ""Fast and Furious"" movie, so we're just getting warmed up. Movie Fans get a hint of the chaos to come during an encounter between Dom and a woman called Cipher (Charlize Theron), who insists Dom come work for her and seems to have some leverage on him.Former DSS agent and current Toretto ""family"" member Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is busy enthusiastically coaching his daughter's soccer team when he's approached by a government agent who tells him about an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) generator that has been stolen in Europe. Hobbs calls Dom, who assembles his other team/family members (played by returning cast members Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Nathalie Emmanuel as the brilliant computer hacktivist, Ramsey) and they're off to Berlin. After the team recovers the EMP, Dom shocks everyone by suddenly running Hobbs off the road, taking the EMP, putting it into his vehicle and then leaving Hobbs behind to get arrested.No one knows why Dom has turned on his family and is working with a psychotic cyber terrorist like Cipher, but they're all anxious to find out. That includes mysterious government agent Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), who arranges for Hobbs to bust out of prison – and forces him to work with old enemy Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) to help the team (now joined by a very green agent played by Scott Eastwood) to stop Dom. Meanwhile, he's working on his next task for Cipher, trying to steal a ""nuclear football"" from a Russian government official in New York, with the help of Cipher and her team hacking into dozens of smart cars which they crash all around the Russian's limo, in order to help Dom complete his mission.""The Fate of the Furious"" is everything that fans of the franchise (or any fans of action movies) have come to expect – and more. For starters, the series again draws strength from the diversity of its cast, brings back recent additions and introduces new cast members. (Hello, Helen Mirren!) And, sticking with that ultra-successful F&F template, the script by Chris Morgan (writer of the previous two) focuses on the characters and their relationships, but gives us the usual globe-trotting and plot twists, a little humor and plenty of action. Director F. Gary Gray (""Straight Outta Compton"", ""The Italian Job"") plays up those relationships (including referencing original cast member, Brian O'Conner, played by the late Paul Walker), while the action sequences are, believe it or not, even more creative, daring and fun than ever.As far as how high this movie ranks on the list of films which have destroyed the most cars that information isn't yet available. (They're probably still counting.) With as much vehicle action and destruction (involving a growing variety of conveyances), gun play, physical fights, surprises and good, old-fashioned human drama packed into ""The Fate of the Furious"", it's hard to imagine the producers topping themselves with the inevitable next installment, but you can bet an orange Lamborghini that they'll try. Heck, it was hard to imagine them topping themselves with this one, but they sure did! ""A""",The Fate of the Furious
102,swilliky,A new twist but somewhat formulaic,6,17 April 2017,"The new twist on the extended series of the Fast and the Furious is to put their leader into the role of a villain. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is on his honeymoon with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) when he meets Cipher (Charlize Theron) who provides a video that makes Dom work for her. Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is invested in his young daughter's soccer team when the agency requests he takes on a difficult mission of stealing an EMP in Berlin. Hobbs calls up Dom who agrees and the team assembles to pull off the mission but when Dom betrays them, Hobbs end up in a prison cell right next to Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). The rest of the team, Tej (Ludacris), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Letty, and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) are confused as to why Dom betrayed them. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) recruits them to hunt down Dom and Cipher with his trainee Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood). Hobbs and Deckard break out of prison with the help of Mr. Nobody and they all work to hunt down Dom but he shows up at their undisclosed location to steal the God's Eye from the previous film. Cipher operates in a plane that flies through radar systems undetected and hopes to steal nuclear launch codes for power.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Fate of the Furious
103,bob-the-movie-man,Blood is thicker than Diesel,4,29 April 2017,"I have a confession to make (and I know for some this will be the equivalent of an appalling statement like ""I've never seen Star Wars""). I have actually never ever seen Fast and Furious 1 through 7!(If it's any mitigation to this cinematic crime, I did see the F- and-F wannabe ""Need for Speed""). So I was going to be completely lost with the ""plot"" right?  Well actually, no. It was pretty easy to jump in and follow as a piece of popcorn nonsense.For nonsense it is (hence the ""rabbit ears"" round the word ""plot"" above). The story isn't just a bit far-fetched. It's bat-sh*t crazy where the bat in question has downed a questionable vindaloo two hours earlier! Dom (Vin Diesel) has turned on his ""family"", including his squeeze, the lovely Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, ""San Andreas""), to team with the above-the-law (and above the clouds) cyber-super-terrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron, ""Mad Max: Fury Road""). They have teamed up, apparently, for no other reason than to allow Cipher to 'kick some global ass' with a nuclear threat. But given his caring and sharing side, why the sudden betrayal of his nearest and dearest by Dom?Where do you begin with the nonsensical story? Jumping from Cuba (with some admittedly fun scenes, but shamelessly objectifying scantily- clad women) via Berlin and New York to the icy wastes of Siberia, it's just an excuse to show fast cars doing ludicrously unlikely things. There is zero logic within any of the script. Here are just a handful of examples:  - the team know (through enormous jumps of speculation) to be present at a particular location in the world and at exactly the time that Dom is there (arrive, look through binoculars, ""Oh, there he is""!);all cars can be automatically hijacked and remotely driven (who knew), but NOT those of the team (obviously);fast cars/tanks/etc can be magicked from New York to Siberia (wot, no Hertz Siberia available?);Russian nuclear codes are stolen, so obviously they can't be changed?a nuclear submarine is out of the water on wooden blocks, but spin the propeller really REALLY fast and it can suddenly be sailing away.    I appreciate I am being enormously po-faced about this, and this is designed as pure escapism. But is there REALLY any need for this to be such mindless escapism?  The director (Gary Gray, ""The Italian Job"") and writer (Chris Morgan, responsible for parts 6 and 7) should credit their audience with rather more in the way of intelligence.Diesel and Johnson are never going to set the acting ablaze, but Rodriquez (""Lost"") is as watchable as ever. Theron has fun with her villainy and the supporting turns by Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous are enjoyable. Nathalie Emmanuel though as Ramsey seems as uncomfortable with her ""sexy English"" stereotype as she should be. Luke Evans (""The Hobbit""), Kurt Russell (""Deepwater Horizon"") and Helen Mirren (""Eye in the Sky"") turn up in entertaining but underused cameos, but it is Jason Statham as Deckard that has the most fun in the whole film, and his scenes – done largely for comic effect – are the best part of the movie.   (But ""math"" Jason?  ""MATH""??  I hope your old maths teacher back in London doesn't get to see this film).If you're willing to park your brain at the door for two hours then it has some fun moments.  But I felt the damage to my IQ might not have been worth the risk, and this really didn't fill my cinematic tank.(For the graphical review of this movie, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com Thanks!).",The Fate of the Furious

Jason Stratham and Dwayne Johnson poking fun at their action man status live it up with their charismatic styles and Jason Stratham being on nanny duties while killing baddies is a massive But in fact, I do not really understand how to evaluate this movie.Theron is very good as Cipher, though I'm loved how much I like the hacking/terrorist side of the villain. The ""God's Eye"" was very interesting part of the movie and that's easily the case with Cipher. I'll buy into Dom's crew taking down anybody with the rules (or lack thereof) that the franchise has set, but I'm sure that everyone loves street racers but they get boring so taking on techies. I'd rather have a villain that our heroes can punch, which is why the last few films have been ecciting The film is even capable of surprising. began to play, Statham is a cute nanny.heer is treat Charlize Theron does a fine baddie kick ass from the control room likes to have the world at her feet corrupt people and get under peoples skin and targets dom to help kick off her plan she has something on him and she brings hostages with her and a baby to boot she wants her new lap dog to rob and steal an emp and nuclear codes along with nuclear codes so with dom leaving his co stars lap up the one liners the action is amazing in Cuba with a bang up car in a street race going 200mph and the whole group taking an emp and then taking out bad guys with a wrecking ball wow and the highlight nearly is zombie cars in new York as dom gone rogue as his family wonders what the hell is going on so as they chase dom you probably saw the cars holding his Chrysler and then the arctic chase what an end to the film with tanks flash cars submarine chase and missile explosions and car jumps is wild imaginative ottt its well worth the watch just leave your brain at the door and just enjoy the with banter and Kurt Russell has a new sidekick Clint Eastwood son Scott Eastwood little nobody pretty good action with him taking control as Mr nobody's sidekick",The Fate of the Furious

108,msbreviews,Rating: C+,5,6 August 2017,"I'm not the biggest fan of this saga, but I have to admit that since Fast Five (aka Fast and Furious 5) I've been more than entertained and even felt emotional with the last one (Fast and Furious 7). Every movie since the fifth one has their limits of reality and ridiculousness well defined so that when the action goes down, it doesn't feel that ... stupid.The Fate of the Furious might be the silliest chapter of the whole thing. Even if the entertainment levels are high, the action is just absurdly unrealistic. I know, I know, all of the Fast and Furious movies have that ""special feature"", but like I said above, they put limits to the stupidity. This one doesn't. It's amazingly directed, it looks awesome, but it's just too fake and ridiculous. I mean, a missile could directly hit someone in the head and the film would find a way for the character to survive. BOUNDARIES HAVE TO EXIST!Everything from the predictability and lack of realism of the plot to the cheesy dialogue feels just ... stupid. I'm sorry, I can't find another word to describe this: it's just stupid. Absolute nonsense. With this in mind, I actually (partially) liked this film ... Wait, what?!Yes, the movie is ridiculous in every way, there's no need to keep knocking on that door. What makes the movie entertaining is the fact that it knows it is stupid. F. Gary Gray uses the silliness of the plot and the over-the-top action sequences, mixes them with the incredibly natural chemistry of the whole cast and well-directed fight scenes (real one-on-one fights, not car chases, which are also well realized), and he's able to create a great entertainment.The cast is brilliant, it's obvious that most of them have been working together for a bunch of years. Vin Diesel is Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) keeps surprising me, Charlize Theron and Kurt Russell (Mr. Nobody) are definitely an upgrade, but the real stars here are Dwayne Johnson (Luke Hobbs) and Jason Statham (Deckard Shaw). Their comic chemistry and cheesy one-liners, plus their hard-hitting fist-fights, elevate the movie in a way that makes the first half of it bearable. It's not until the middle of the second act that the film starts to pick up and the only reason I didn't fall asleep until then was because of this duo. Ludicrous (Tej Parker) and Tyrese (Roman Pearce) also have a couple of good scenes, but their writing is just too absurd.As for the villain, I think Cipher should have been better explored. Her motivations are clear, but feel short for the huge plan that she has in mind. Besides, it's goddamn Charlize Theron playing that character, it's not anybody! Her full potential has to be used instead of literally only showing her in one place (it's like she spent ONE DAY in the studio).The story is super predictable and it drags for too long. This definitely feels longer than what it was planned to be, probably because the studios wanted the 2h30 epic runtime. 136min are just too much for what the film needs and the script isn't able to fill the holes with clever character development or some good dialogue ... Instead, it's full of lame, bland, nonsense and even unfunny jokes.In short, The Fate of the Furious is able to mix its limitless absurdity and ridiculousness with the amazing chemistry of the cast, even if it has to be Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham to save the whole thing. The action scenes are too stupid and unrealistic, but well-directed enough for one to be entertained. The first half of the film feels slow (runtime too long) and the villain should have been way better explored (it's Charlize Theron ... I mean, come on!). The plot is too predictable, lacks substance and it's full of nonsense, cheesy dialogues and unfunny one-liners. Still, it's a film that acknowledges its stupidity and tries to make the best entertainment possible off of it ... And it does. Just not enough for a positive review.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",The Fate of the Furious

110,Alexander_Blanchett,The never ending story of the Furious,6,21 April 2017,"I liked it. After the very emotional part seven this one went back to over the top action with a nice mix of wit. Its a typical formula that works for all the parts of the franchise but it pays off because they keep doing interesting little twists (even if some of them might not be very realistic) and keep up with amazing action sequences that are better and better with every sequel (and those are definitely not realistic but hey who cares its fun). The screenplay was corny as hell, as were the one-liners but that is also part of the charm the franchise created within all those years. Acting is also cheesy. Vin Diesel tries to add more and more to his character but it is still a caricature. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham definitely had fun doing this movie or maybe they got motivated by the great paycheck. Charlize Theron as the villain was a bit one-note but I loved Helen Mirren and would have loved to see more of her. Besides those mentioned the only memorable part was Michelle Rodriguez who was most of the time really good. The soundtrack worked and the diction by F Gary Gray as well.

We get a nice montage of Cuban locales and we join the couple checking out some race cars (one that's weirdly equipped with a boat motor). Dom gets some news that his cousin is in trouble. A loan shark is towing away the car that his cousin used to borrow money as collateral. Instead of fighting, they decide to race a ""Cuban mile."" The only issue is that Dom's vehicle looks non-functional. Dom makes some quick modifications and the race begins. They go neck and neck for most of it (the other guy has a far superior car) until the other guy tries to rig it. With some fancy driving and pushing his car to the absolute limit, Dom pulls out a surprise victory. When the shark tries to honour the deal, Dom tells him to keep his car, the fact that he's earned his respect is enough.After they get back to the hotel, Dom and Letty are cuddling in bed. Letty brings up the possibility of bringing a new member to their family. Dom goes out the next day and runs into someone having vehicle issues. This isn't a chance encounter however, Cipher (Charlize Theron) has tracked Dom down to work for her on a job. Dom tries to walk away but she has leverage on Dom, using it to blackmail Dom into betraying his family and working against the team in a cyber-terrorism plot.The message of the Fast and Furious franchise has always been ""family."" Since the re-invention in Fast Five, despite a couple of additions and subtractions (the most noticeable unfortunately being Paul Walker after his fatal accident) we've gotten to know these characters better. Yet character development has always been a weakness. The Fate of the Furious has similar issues but I was pleasantly surprised at how some of the plot twists we're done. We get some tossed in subplots that barely hold any weight: e.g. the Roman/Tej/Ramsey love triangle or Little Nobody trying to fit in with this gang of outlaws. But Dom's betrayal of the team was handled decently, it was typical but far less cheesy than I expected. Some of the characters also got more of a chance to play off each other; Deckard and Hobbs probably had the best and funniest dynamic of any other pair and they also had the most gritty action scene in the *spoiler* prison breakout.The cast of The Fate of the Furious is huge but I'll do my best to break down the individual performances. Vin is the main character again, he could probably do Dom in his sleep but he's on point. As is Michelle Rodriguez, they've had a lot of time to work together and the dynamic between the two of them works. Jason Statham stole the show as he returns as Deckard. Similar to when they brought Dwayne Johnson in, he's a perfect fit for this franchise. His fight scenes are solid (his action scene with the baby brought a lot of laughs) and I enjoyed his parts the best. Dwayne is chewing the scenery but he's such a natural for this kind of work that he overcomes a lot of crappy dialogue. I used to like Tyrese Gibson and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges a lot but this was kind of the movie where they lost me. Tyrese was especially grating, he was hamming it up way too hard. I liked Kurt Russell but Scott Eastwood wasn't very good as his student. I kept wishing he would go away. I thought Charlize was a solid villain in a franchise that normally lacks good adversaries for the team. She's a pro and she walked a nice line between overacting and not committing enough.The thing that keeps audiences coming back to see the new entries in this franchise are the action scenes. I liked some of them but others are just so unbelievable that it was hard not to roll my eyes. Hobbs is essentially a super hero now and Dom is now flame retardant. The message shouldn't be about family, it should be real life physics may or may not matter depending on the scene. I don't expect perfect realism but I tend to appreciate plausible deniability and this movie couldn't even come close. The other movies have always had some well placed humour even if the dialogue has lacked subtlety. This movie had a couple of moments but there were a lot of extremely cheesy moments when the plot turned dramatic. I mentioned above that there have been times where Tyrese or Chris have carried the movies through slower bits but they couldn't accomplish that either. This isn't absolutely essential to making a decent movie but some witty dialogue or some less contrived bits could have helped gloss over some of the movie's other flaws.If you were to sit down and watch the entire set of The Fast & The Furious movies, the difference between the start and the finish would be staggering. This is okay, if anything it shows how these characters and the writers' style has changed with the paradigm to keep this franchise relevant. Bigger action scenes, quip heavy dialogue and reminders of family are the new norm and I was good with that. Now that I can look back, it's not that this franchise has lost all measure of quality. It has plateaued and each entry since 6 has had diminishing returns for me. There were plenty of bright spots from some newer members of the cast and some of the action scenes are more believable than others. But the movie starts to stall in parts with the terrible dialogue, useless characters and goofy over-the-top action. I think we're getting closer and closer to seeing our Fast and Furious team puttering out and ending up in the scrapyard.",The Fate of the Furious

115,Rickting,The third best of the series,7,14 May 2017,"The Fate and the Furious sees Dom Toretto going rogue and inexplicably working with Charlize Theron's cyber terrorist, while his increasingly small team try to stop her and get him back. This 8th installment of the franchise, which has become so ridiculous don't be surprised if they go into space in later films, may not be the best Fast and Furious film but it has quite a bit of punch. Everyone is as charismatic as ever, Dwayne Johnson and Tyrese Gibson are great as is Jason Statham (Although the way they forget he killed Han is odd) and F Gary Gray does a good job with the film. As many have pointed out, while the motive for Dom switching sides is a lot better than expected, there are flaws with the story here and there for sure. In all honesty, with so many characters out of the story-line the franchise is increasingly lacking reasons to keep going. It is weird having a Fast and Furious movie without Paul Walker to be honest, although there is a very touching nod to him towards the end. The main problem is a big sag in the middle of the film and the New York sequence is disappointing. However, the first third of the film is pretty good and the last 40 minutes are pure, genuine and utter gold. On the whole, this is a thrilling, explosive and exuberant installment which overcomes its phoned-in storyline by providing a huge amount of fun and, as always, adding in many touching family moments. 8 films in, the world's fastest and most furious family isn't out of steam yet and this was a great time at the movies. 7/10",The Fate of the Furious
116,dilipbts,The fate of the furious,9,10 June 2020,"The Fate of the Furious (2017) in my opinion is a well fast paced a well done sequel. I just got this film on Blu-ray and I just finished watching it what can I say? I enjoy watching this film I had a fun a lot, I love this film to death and I like it a lot. I think is my number one favorite in the series Fast Five (2011) is still my number two favorite film in the series but this one just become my favorite number 1 film. Since Paul Walker died in November 30, 2013 both of the characters Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto retired and the seventh installment completed the story arcs for both of their characters.I think Vin Diesel who took over the movie without Paul walker did a great job I also finished him watching in his early action movie xXx (2002) pretty good movie. Dwayne Johnson was far way better than he was in Furious Seven. He had much more to do than in here than he did in the previous film that was my biggest problem in the previous installment. He was only in the beginning of the film and on the end of the film in the final showdown the rest of that film he was absent but in this film he had much more to do. Jason Statham is back as Deckard Shaw and he had much more things to do then he did in the previous film. Charlize Theron as Cipher was outstanding as the bad guy I liked her performance. Michelle Rodriguez as hot chick mom was really great I love her performance in this movie. Nathalie Emmanuel as Ramsey from the previous film is also in here. I love performances from Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges and Tyrese Gibson they were great.F. Gary Gray did not do a bad job directing this film I thought he was good. I think this movie is a good action movie and way better than the new Transformers films and Terminator films. I rather watch The Fast and the Furious films then those I mentioned. Chris Morgan was excellent writer in this movie.In this movie Dom and Letty are on their honeymoon and Brian and Mia have retired from the game-and the rest of the crew has been exonerated-the globetrotting team has found a semblance of a normal life. But when a mysterious woman seduces Dom into the world of crime he can't seem to escape and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before. From the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, the elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the world's stage... and to bring home the man who made them a family.Also the movie takes on icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea which are cars on the ice, that idea was from James Bond 007 Die Another Day but still the movie borrowed I have enjoyed this movie. Everyone in this movie did great I am so happy I have this film on Blu-ray.I am not sure if hackers can hack into new cars and drive them during on the road with the computer I don't think that is impossible not with the technology was created in the decades, that's my opinion.I wasn't happy that Charlize Theron's character escaped but I hope we will see her in the next installments. I hear there are 2 installments planed and the 10th will be last one in the series.I don't think this movie is great or the best or better than Furious Seven I just think it is a good film.I love that Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham put their sides behind and start working together. I love the prison escape and love that Jason Statham saved Dominic's son on the plain. Deckard kill Han but he pay for it when he rescue Dom's son. I love the chemistry between Dom and Letty they are still married and together that's awesome.Scott Eastwood is also in this and even tough he isn't that great he is enjoyable in this flick. I also love the poster and the cover on Blu-ray about this film it think it is excellent.",The Fate of the Furious

122,PyroSikTh,Explosions? Check. Car chases? Check. Good fun? Check.,6,19 April 2017,"Fast and Furious 8, completely unsurprisingly, has a story that makes little sense, although it does try, bless it. Dom and Letty are on their honeymoon when a mysterious woman recruits and blackmails Dom into working for her, against his ""family"". His family, headed by Mr. Nobody and his new, young sidekick, spend most the movie attempting to track him down. This is where the nonsense comes in. Without Brian, and now without Dom, who's going to hold the masculinity of the group (it's obviously not going to be Roman of Tej, let's be honest)? Hobbs enjoys a nice promotion, but for the last hole they bring back Statham's Deckard Shaw, you know, the bad guy from the last movie, who killed a member of their ""family"" and tried to kill more of them, who they locked away in an inescapable cell several miles underground. Uh, good choice? I guess?The reason for Dom's betrayal, I have to admit, is actually a pretty good one, although it opens up it's own kinds of problems pertaining to timelines. And despite suggestions from the trailers, Dom is absolutely a reluctant and conflicted accomplice. I feared a complete and utter character assassination, but they actually how manage to drag this premise out of their arse and make it believable. Talking of characters, barring Hobbs' and Deckard's eventually flourishing friendship, integrity's are largely kept intact. Roman and Tej are still the source of the most comic relief in one form or another, although I admit I'm starting to grow tired of Roman.There's also a number of surprising little cameos from characters both old and new as well, and Cipher's whole plot extends back into a number of previous movies. They seem to put more thought into connectivity and continuity than they do the actual story, but as I really dig these kinds of displays of forward (or backward) thinking, I'm all for it. I got a massive kick out of those cameos and it absolutely enhanced my enjoyment, which was something I never expected to get out of this movie at all.As is the trend of the franchise now, action sequences are more important than car chases. There's still a prominence of cars here, but they arguably take even more of a backseat than more recent entries. The days of street racing and car worship are long gone. Much of the technobabble doesn't even make sense for petrolheads; ""His car must have over two thousand horsepower!"" Really guys? There's is an impressive sequence about midway, in the middle of New York, but it's punctuated by a series of carjacks that don't make logical sense. I get Cipher is a good hacker, but how can her and her team of a few hack thousands of cars (that are turned off), and remotely drive them around the city?That said, oh my god that scene was fun to watch. I don't think I've seen so much mangled metal in a movie before. It's just a sea of wreckage that turns downtown New York City into a junkyard. And this is the Fast and Furious franchise's secret; it takes things that make no logical or realistic sense, sticks a middle finger up, and just creates the most fun-to-watch sequences. Another particular highlight is watching Jason Statham take out an endless wave of bad guys while carrying a baby seat. The choreography is stylish and flashy, with spinning, twisting, flicking and throwing used to such flawless effect that the viewing experience is just, for lack of a better word, fun. Fast and Furious is pure entertainment.Talking of Jason Statham, he's just hands down the most entertaining character in the whole movie, and Statham's performance is pure action movie gold. Vin Diesel ups his game a little, which is unsurprising considering the amount of screen time he shares with Charlize Theron, who seems to be having the time of her life. She really sticks her teeth into the role, creates one of the most compelling villains of the franchise, and appears to just have a lot of fun with it. Dwayne Johnson enjoys his promotion to second billing and makes sure to make the most of it, while seeing Helen Mirren in anything, no matter how brief, always makes for great viewing. Yeah, this movie doesn't even deserve awards nominations for it's acting, but everyone's on the same page in creating characters that are interesting and entertaining to watch, and no-one offers a performance so bad it becomes unwatchable.I had no interest in Fast and Furious when it was announced, when the trailer debuted, or even when I got in the car to go and see it. I was bracing myself for just terrible leaps of logic after terrible leaps of logic. While I can't say the film didn't deliver on that, it also delivered pure, adrenaline-pumping entertainment. To some degree I hate saying this, but I also like to judge every movie on their own merits, so my word of advice is to check your brain in at the door. If you think about it too much, you'll just hate everything about this movie, but if you just sit back and enjoy the ride, it's got one hell of a ride to take you on, especially if you're already a fan of the franchise. I give Fast and Furious 8 an entertaining 7/10.",The Fate of the Furious

It has all the trademarks of a Fast movie, and in many instances turns these up to 11 for this entry in the franchise. It's bigger, bolder, more outrageous, with plenty of action and some fantastic sequences involving the cars.Charlize Theron was a nice addition to the cast, with probably the best performance in the film. The plot was very fun, following the theme of the last few instalments, which feel more like Bond/Mission Impossible style sprawling action blockbusters than mere drag racing flicks. I think this maybe had a better plot than some of the previous ones, with some good surprises and a semblance of character development thrown in there.If you're a Fast & Furious fan or general action movie buff, grab the popcorn and stick on Fast 8 for a fun time.",The Fate of the Furious
124,nikola17,"It's still Badass Fast and furious film in franchise big surprises, a lot crazy Stunts, A lot non-stop action",10,16 April 2017,"this franchise is never going to run out of ideas or out of fuel or stop at pit stop never they always come up with a lot cool extreme crazy stunts and a lot of crazy action scenes you will be having fun with believe me it's still great film in franchise but without Paul Walker it's still good film I mean it worked quite well without him he planned something for Fast 8 before he died so this is planned, this has mention about his character and Mia and their son. But the film still mentioned all another things from previous fast and furiousplot: (Vin Diesel) Dominic Toretto and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez)are enjoying their honeymoon in Havana and you met this new character family member that we don't even know is his cousin Fernando (Janmarco Santiago)was asking dom for race against the guy who has a better car then Fernando, you have racing scene at start of movie they start racing with low riders cars, there is a lot impossible unrealistic scenes like any another Fast and Furious films, after race he met Cipher (Charlize Theron) elusive cyberterrorist Cipher, who coerces him into working for her. Shortly after the encounter, Dom and his crew, comprising Letty,(Tyrese Gibson) Roman Pearce, (Ludacris) Tej Parker, and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel)and Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) were in mission in Berlin to steal, EMP device. But after Dom went Rogue Luke Hobbs got in prison (Kurt Russell) Mr Nobody is always there and their he's character is like Bruce Willis character from Expendables church and Scott Eastwood Eric Reisner / Little Nobody, a law enforcement agent working under Petty. Clint Eastwood son is not that bad actor actually he is good. Luke Hobbs gets locked up same prison guess who he's worst enemy Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) in jail cell cross each another, I love Jason character lines in film when he tease's Dwayne character, makes you laugh you have prison fight scene one does. But the only problem in my opinion is when Jason Statham is fighting in prison scenes there is shake camera that's something I didn't like I hated shake camera's in action films it doesn't show a clearly scene for action film but there is little things you going to notice there is shake cameras witch I hate. Mr Nobody add Deckard to be in Dom team I am like? What is this Expendables? Like an Ensemble Action film Of Expendables style with fast cars. There is this has mentions they have talked about Brain O Connor they kept his character alive because he is now with Mia and his 2 kids that works and thatmakes sense for film to keep his character alive. The team mission is to get Dom back the all team is going to get him back but he is forced buy Cipher witch I am NOT going to ruin the film or explain it at all its huge spoiler if I write why is Dom is forced, you have a lot crazy action scenes like there was scene when Cipher hacks all cars with systems, hacking into all of the autonomous cars in the city andreprogramming them to auto-drive, wreaking havoc throughout the city. The cars they all drive buy it self because she hacks it, I know their similar ideas what its coming Terminator 3: Rise of Machines, T‑X hacks the system of cars similar scene of that but expect it's army of cars being hacked crashing each another is cool scene, there is moments a lot impossible staff in film. Some another cameo cast like Luke Evans from villain in Fast 6 doesn't do much but he did he survive? I thought he died that's why Statham character comes for revenge but now he's still alive I was like how? But he doesn't do much. great location in Russia with there is scene Michelle Rodriguez character push's the guy off screen fell in submarine motorwhile it was running you see blood spatter everywhere I am like this is my first time I have seen a gore off screen bloody I am like dam why could they make fast and furious chapter with R RATED that would be sick. Dom is then sent to Russia to use the EMP device to disable a nuclear submarine, the another team is there to stop Dom and Submarine, there is a lot cool action scenes shootout, cool cars I like idea of rather than being car for Tej it's a Ripshaw like what Dwayne Johnson character Roadblock, uses from GI Joe Retaliation but anyway it would be cool if Dwayne character drive that again in this film, part when Luke you have Jason Statham scenes his own fight scenes he doesn't go with team you have scene where he sneaks in plane fight scenes. Jason character kicked a lot of asses in film. director is same director F Gary Gray who worked with Vin Diesel a Man Apart (2003) and Jason Statham and Charlize Theron the Italian Job different believe me the film is still great 10.10 I love it still I thought it's still worth watching very watchable film don't worry about what another people say go and see it film did success in box office in universal Fate of the Furious' Blasting to $534 Million in Worldwide.",The Fate of the Furious

126,EthanBJones_03,'You don't turn your back on family....'; Would Recommend,7,24 May 2017,"*This review will be PRIMARILY spoiler free and I will warn you before a possible spoiler. Don't get mad at me. I will warn you!*'The Fate of the Furious' was directed by F Gary Gray and stars Vin 'The Family Man' Disel, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. It's the classical story of 'turning your back on family'(if you don't read that in Vin Disel's voice; you aren't a fan of this franchise). That's it. Nothing more to it than that other than the Rock is in this movie so you should see it.I'll get this out of the way. This franchise should I have died on that day in 2013. As enjoyable as this movie was, it doesn't need to exist and if they continue to beat this franchise off long into its teens, we're gonna have an issue. Now that is out of the way, the movie is enjoyable. If you want a long, compelling story; go back to the hole you just crawled from under because if that's what you expect at this point in time you clearly have't seen daylight for long. While there are a few creative changes I would make, Gray did a good job taking over the franchise from Lin and Wan. The action is fun and the classic cast returns for another paych-, for their 'last ride' and before they're done milking The Rock(take that as you will). But as soon as he's exhausted all his juices, this franchise is done and I can't say I fear that day. The story exists and I don't fault them for trying but it sucks. I appreciate trying to connect all the movies into one neatly knitted franchise but they're seriously going overboard at this point. The ending was nice but I would make one slight change and that is(SPOILER ALERT FOR THE REST OF THIS PARAGRAPH!!!!!!!!!!!!) I would name Vin Disel's son Paul. They do name him Brian which was nice but I think it would have been a better nod if they named him Paul. While not a necessity, it would have been a very nice tribute to Paul. Vin Disel CANNOT act. He could retire to his tree house in Valencia, California for the rest of his life and continue to stroke his solid gold statue of the rock and he would make this world a better place. Do us all a favour and retire! You had enough money to buy that tree(one less share), you have enough money to live the rest of your life in total comfort, milking The Rock until he bursts. Dwayne Johnson is charisma incarnate and is just awesome as Luke Hobbs. He's smart, he's funny, he's likable and he is the source of the udders that spew the money to keep this franchise floating, on a milky sea. Jason Statham was badass as Deckard Shaw and his 'chemistry' with The Rock was the best part of the movie. They were both complete opposite personalities and this clash of them made the movie work as well as it did. Michelle Rodriguez was pretty good as Letty and remains a key component of this franchise. Tyrese Gibson, on the other hand, was Tyrese Gibson. Earn that paycheck Tyrese, earn it! Ludicrous was fine as Tej but posed no real significance. Scott Walker was fine as Little Nobody but his purpose was to replace the late Paul Walker(may he genuinely rest in peace, all jokes aside) and this just felt wrong. Adding Statham was a fair move because he had been setup in the previous movies. Adding Eastwood, however, was a wrong call as far as I'm concerned and didn't need to be in the movie. We have enough pointless characters as it is(earn that paycheck Tyrese). Kurt Rusell was good as Mr Nobody. I feel like Charlize Theron played her part way too seriously as Cipher. I'm not saying she had to be a WILD AND CRAAAAAZY cartoon but she could have added a little more fun to the role.From a technical standpoint, this movie was fine. It was competently shot and the effects were fine but aside from that it didn't do much to impress. It wasn't a technical marvel but the camera was steady so it's automatically above 'Fast and Furious'. The action was awesome and was really fun. The now famous Jason Statham sequence on a plane is one of my favourite sequences in the franchise and possibly my favourite Statham sequence ever. That said, I think that the set pieces were pretty lacking in this movie and they could have abused the hacking gimmick. Sure there's a cool scene involving remote controlled cars but aside from that they do little with it and could have made the set pieces much more epic because of that. Honestly, this movie is mindless nonsense and contains no rhyme or reason. That said, that is the reason this franchise had become so popular and is the reason it will not end until The Rock stops spewing(just to let that image sink in). If you enjoyed the previous movies(from 5 onward) you'll probably enjoy this movie. If you have a problem with the realism and lack of proper narrative and so forth, you'll have a problem with this movie. All in all, I will say I recommend this movie and I'll say its the second best in the franchise, maybe joint second with 'Furious 7'.7/10",The Fate of the Furious
127,coreyjdenford,Just about keeps the speed.,6,12 April 2017,"This review of Fast and Furious 8 (The Fate of the Furious) is spoiler free*** (3/5)IF THE LAST 16 years have taught us anything with the Fast and Furious series it's that there are always rules - though notorious they are there. However with the last few installments the series has set its own rules. With the eighth movie and a new director F. Gary Gray who also made Straight Outta Compton and the surprisingly decent Italian Job remake, the Furious series has stepped away from pure insanity and gained respect into the spectacular. The series has gone from a small-budget street-racing film all the way to a big-budgeted, globetrotting, scene-smashing, logic-trashing, car-trickery. And for a while it would go more or less with it's effects, with this the emphasis is heavier on more.Fast and Furious 8 starts steadily with Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) enjoying their long-awaited honeymoon, Brian and Mia are out of the picture and the rest of the team are enjoying life. Until Dom is seduced by a dark figure, in the form of the villainous super-hacker Cipher (Charlize Theron), he's forced back into the life of crime and betrays his team. It's unlike when Letty had amnesia for a few films, it takes this into a whole new level which lowers the insanity and makes it saner, well as sane as it can get for a Furious movie. The team have to track down Dom and end his reign of destruction across the globe. This is of course when the new and the old players have to track him by any means necessary. Unfortunately it's here when we find a bump in the road, and the film hits a flat tire. Blankly taking turns for a while, in fact for most of the film's length it stays here, the simple plot wobbly intertwines through congested traffic, and for a while it's as if the film is harshly stopped. The spectacular - if little insane car-tricks make a moderate impact but the film still hits a wall. Happily when this happens there are a few things that make the ride travel smoothly, there's a hilarious tongue-and-cheek battle. Also there are a few stand-out performances too.Firstly, Dwayne Johnson, when he arrived as bulked up super-cop Luke Hobbs in Fast Five, he made an immediate shine with the series, he showed strength and with his appearance in the next three films he carries the series on his shoulders. Here he makes a larger appearance - shadowing his larky cameo from the previous film, he's the leader of the team this time, and surprisingly (no pun intended) he's the rock that holds them together. He still holds a grudge against Shaw and tries his best to take him down in scene-stealingly hilarious prison battle.Secondly there's Jason Statham, when he first appeared only in the last film, he made a stunning hit, and here he does the same whether he's shooting a gun or indeed punching Hobbs he makes everything count, from the first to the last minute. One stand-out scene in particular Shaw goes to kill Cipher with a baby this keeps the film's strength solidly but also makes it funnier when he's chatting while shooting. Finally Kurt Russell makes a solid second appearance as Mr. Nobody, he also took a shine to the series supplying the team with money, a lot of cars and insane tricks one in particular which stood out in the last film. Also every time he's on screen his eyes twinkle as if to say here is a man enjoying his career. These actors literally maintain the nitro-fuelled fun, the enjoyable dialogue, and they keep the speed. Despite Fast and Furious 8 falling behind the previous instalment, it's still spectacular and a lot of fun. VERDICT: The eighth instalment takes a turn into the silly, the nonsensical and the pointless, but this spectacular series is still fun, and marginally maintains its speed.",The Fate of the Furious
128,kgprophet,Movie Series continues to Collapse into Cliche,4,16 January 2018,"In the opening of the movie Tropical Thunder, there is a fake trailer showing Ben Stiller as a tough action hero defending himself against the end of the world. By the 6th sequel he's defending his baby against the end of the world. Meanwhile we are at the 8th installment of the F&F series with no end in sight. So, yes we are left with Vin Diesel, tough action hero, defending his baby against the evil villain. We can list all of the tropes required now. Many shots of female backsides. Wildly over-the-top unrealistic caper that takes place with cars. Tough guy one upmanship. More car stunts that resemble toys flying around with no sense of danger. The barbecue party at the end. This franchise thought to ""up the ante"" by hiring more action film stars, The Rock and Jason Stathom. And then added to it's cool factor by hiring Kurt Russell. The film requires more punches than words of dialogue. Frankly, these movie stars need to little more than pose in front of the camera for a day's work. As much as Vin Diesel talks about family and what's right blah blah blah, it really restricts his two dimensional character, because he isn't allowed to be or do anything that isn't 100% cool. Same with Rock and Stathom, they really are cartoon characters that exist only to fight and chase things. This movie fails because the villain is pretty boring. It matters little what the mcguffin is. A good number of the action scenes want to seem 'legit', using real cars and real stunts. But then they all transition to CGI as the action scene becomes goofy. In this case, there is the idea of hacking into cars that have the latest ""autodrive"" feature. Of course in 2017 there are only 2 or 3 models out there that have this feature, but in this movie they can hack any model and remotely drive them. It makes for some ok CGI candy seeing an army of robot cars but is totally bereft of reality. Charlize Theron has established herself as an action oriented actress, but still is only as good as the material and the director. She is dangerous in Mad Max 4, but here she almost seems like she's going through the motions, despite the 'heavy' scenes she plays. As for the rest of the gang, they have always been there for the humour, but I doubt the screenwriter is known for his brilliant jokes. I wonder how much audiences will continue to support this franchise as it becomes more comic book in tone and look. I suppose if the franchise continues to find new types of action scenes that involve cool cars. But looking at the diminishing numbers for the Transformers series, you would think a niche series like this would find it's limits. I can't recommend this film, and still think Fast Five has the best elements of the series before going too over-the-top. Although the action scenes can be watchable, you know you're really looking at models and CGI (why after a couple decades of CGI can they still not create realistic looking flames?).",The Fate of the Furious
129,asb_deutsch,Better than F&F-7,7,19 April 2017,"First of all, trailers are suppose to give you a teaser of the film, not tell you the plot, so I am not going to reveal much. The movie has strong performances, particularly from Vin Diesel.I liked the integration of multiple elements of the past, especially the God's Eye. Director Gary Gray executed the movie very well though some scenes were exaggerated which maybe have been panned by the critics, but not by the audience. The NYC Manhattan madness will please the fanbase.Overall, it's a good one-time watch. Not to the grand level of Fast Five or Fast & Furious 6 but good enough for watching it in 4DX.My digital score: 6.8/10",The Fate of the Furious
130,DeBBss,"Not bad, but not great...",7,3 June 2017,"As a die hard Fast And The Furious fan and watched all the movies, The Fate Of The Furious isn't the worst of the franchise. When I saw the trailer I was disappointed, but when I saw the movie I understood why Dom went rogue and It wasn't a bad movie.Story: 7/10Dom was on his honeymoon with Letty but he gets interrupted by Cipher because Cipher wants to use Dom for her ultimate evil scheme, but if Dom doesn't help her, his child and ex-girlfriend (you have to watch F5 and F6 to understand why) will die so Dom has no choice but to go rogue, but Dom also has a scheme of his own to to get his baby back and stop cipher.Characters: 8/10Dom: Is a simple character and to be honest he's kind of a cliché character.Deckard: Deckard is a cool character and interesting I'd say Deckard is the coolest character in the movieHobbs: I really like Hobbs mostly the way he fights, he just uses his brute force and just throws people 10 feet across the room.Letty: Letty is just as cliché as Dom but a little less paper thin.Tej: Tej Is Roman's best friend and he's super chill and laid back I only wish he had more screen timeCipher: Oh cipher how can be so generic and the part where she escapes just proves she's going to be in F9.Roman: Roman is the comic of the movie, he always ends up getting screwed first, all I want is Roman to not be screwed first all the time.Action: 10/10The action is great with chase scenes and the fight scenes it's a very entertaining movie and you'll have a blast watching it with your friends, but now F&F is more of a action franchise then a car franchise, before all this it was about street racers and criminals but its all about catching the bad guys, and as a die hard F&F fan seeing The Fast And The Furious and this movie, it's definitely an action franchise now.The Fate Of The Furious isn't a bad movie but all I hope for F&F is to go back to the beginning with street racers and cars.",The Fate of the Furious

132,ginocox-206-336968,"Too much schmaltz, too little plot",6,11 June 2017,"""The Fate of the Furious"" poses a profound philosophical question in multiple-choice format: What is the meaning of life? (a) family; or (b) the brief interval between the starting signal and the checkered flag? The answer seems to be (c) neither of the above. Family is less important than an ethnically diverse cast, and the larger and more diverse the better. One of the better gags in the film is that the team has grown so large that there is not room on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List for everybody, relegating one unfortunate member to #11. But the actual team includes a few more individuals, such as Hobbs, Mr Nobody, Mr Nobody's protégé Little Nobody and a few others. But it's not important that they actually be ethnic, in the senses of having unique cultures, and certainly not in the sense of enduring any economic hardship or discrimination. These are all young, upwardly mobile, highly educated, financially independent, physically fit, extremely capable, globe-trotting overachievers. The period between starting signal and checkered flag isn't important, because they can simply drive expensive exotic cars whenever and wherever they want, even if they are the least suited vehicle imaginable for the mission or the terrain, because, as Dom says, what's under the hood is less important than who's behind the wheel. But what's much more important than (a) or (b) is pure, unadulterated Hollywood schmaltz, and F8 lays it on thick. Some authors write the theme of their stories on a Post-It note displayed near their monitor so they always keep it in mind. One imagines these screenwriters working at computers blanketed with Post-It notes emblazoned with variations of ""More Schmaltz!""Unfortunately, a moral dilemma is glossed over in this pursuit of schmaltz. Is it worth endangering the entire planet to save one life? The unexplored dilemma is reminiscent of ""Johnny English,"" in which the villain compels the Queen of England to abdicate by threatening her pet dog. The McGuffin is a portable Electro-Magnetic Pulse weapon that looks as if it were inspired by the shrink ray in ""Despicable Me"" and momentarily interrupts all electronic devices except those in exotic automobiles. This device is stolen through a brilliantly conceived and executed plan that occurs entirely off-screen, then stolen again when a rather small vehicle drives a much larger vehicle off the road – imagine a Mini Cooper forcing a HMMWV off the road, then take it down half a notch. And this was one of the more realistic automobile stunts. The chase scenes are about as realistic as one of the Pixar ""Cars"" cartoons, without the continuity, but with more CGI, if that's possible. In any event, the F8 CGI seems more obvious. However, a large-scale martial arts and parkour scene involving Stratham and Johnson is masterfully choreographed and executed, on par with ""John Wick."" Without Paul Walker, the blond-haired California surfer looking dude, there is no anchor to counterpoise the celebrated ethnically diverse cast. Scott Eastwood hovers around the periphery as a sort of personification of the superego, but isn't given much to do and doesn't seem quite part of the team. But it's basically Diesel, Johnson, Stratham and Theron who carry the plot. The others have relatively little to do or say. If one were to assign the characters to the eight archetypical roles in Dramatica theory (protagonist, antagonist, guardian, contagonist, sidekick, skeptic, emotion and reason), one would run out of archetypes long before one ran out of characters, much like with the ten most wanted list. The cars are much less important to the plot than in earlier films in the franchise. The car that gets the most attention and has the most ""personality"" is an ancient car with a boat engine used in the opening scenes. What seems most impressive about these cars is the way they seem to teleport themselves around the globe instantaneously, but then a couple of characters seem to do that as well. The film suffices as mindless entertainment, but would be more enjoyable with more plot and less schmaltz; with more physical stunts and less CGI.",The Fate of the Furious
133,monstermayhem32,The 8th chapter of dom and crew,8,17 April 2017,I know many fans were wondering what direction the series would take next considering how furious 7 felt like a swan song to the franchise considering that Paul Walker passed away when that that movie was filming and his character was retired. However things have changed when Dom meets a woman named cipher played wonderfully by Charlize Theron who happens to be the first major female villain in the series to betray his crew when he discovers a son he didn't know about. I will say one of the best parts of the film is the car chase sequence in New York. Helen mirren has a cameo appearance as the mother of deckard and Owen Shaw which was nice to see.,The Fate of the Furious
134,projectsgamer,8/10,8,22 March 2021,The Fate of the Furious is the eighth installment in the franchise and I just love how fun this franchise is like I said from before I did not like the first three movies after that I love these movies are so fun and entertaining all the character are great and different character from Dom's character which is interesting what he did but it made sense why what he did this movie is very wild Jason Statham and the Dwayne Johnson them together is just amazing they make the movie funny and entertaining Little Nobody is introduced is an good character is makes decisions what are funny like in the beginning entertaining from that the only thing this movie feels like an movie because they did not what to do and for the fans which I don't mind but it feel like that all round this movie is entertaining like the others so I give The Fate of the Furious an B-,The Fate of the Furious

Its gotten so ott but its big and dumb entertainment with heart and I love it.,The Fate of the Furious
136,kaptenvideo-89875,The action can't get much more over-the-top – without doing Bollywood,6,16 April 2017,"Aaaand we're back in the magical land of Vin Diesel, where the family always come first, the cup is always full, the national sport is grabbing life by the balls, and everybody and everything is at the very height of its powers, or ready to get annihilated. Thus far promoted mostly as The Fate of the Furious"", there's actually nothing ultimate or definitive about this eighth installment of loved larger-than- life action series. Just business as usual although there's nothing wrong with having some of the ""good old"" if it comes in such a spectacular package. Part 8 doesn't disappoint here. There's a lot of beauty on show – may it come in the form of people, cars, locales or physical laws defying action. Most of the setpieces are so cool that you just have to wonder at the amount of work all this must have required, done digitally or in real life – from the starting race in Cuba to the prison riot to the zombie car army to attacking the Arctic military base, or pretty much everything in-between. The Arctic part itself is so huge that it should have been saved for another movie, perhaps FF9"". In current form it's like a last dish in the end of the big feast: one could enjoy it more if the belly was not so full already. Also, it could benefit from having more breathing room. The events are so cramped together and the heroes get already comically lucky here, that it loses some of desired impact. In the competence porn subgenre, ""FF"" is still one of the big ones, alongside ""Mission: Impossible"" and James Bond. I wouldn't call the new one also the new king but it's good enough to satisfy the hunger for another slice of truly over the top action that Vin Diesel seems to have dedicated his career to. Not to forget, he appeared in another episode of xXx"" earlier this year also. The cast is cool as always. We have: * most of the main crew (Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Dwayne Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous), * expected side crew (Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, Luke Evans, Nathalie Emmanuel) * and some promising fresh faces (Charlize Theron as the main baddie, Helen Mirren, also Celestino Cornielle and Kristofer Hivju in small but very intriguing parts). I hope some of the new ones figure heavily in future sequel(s) because they have not enough room to shine here. We have also Scott son of Clint"" Eastwood who's bit of surprising addition, lacking the screen charm or physicality of every other star here. I hope they are not considering making him a regular. Speaking of the future, I would be excited to see the ""FF"" series seriously considering the hard mission that it has usually avoided so far, part 7 maybe excluded. Namely, the original movie is not just about grabbing life by the balls, or beautiful girls and cars. It's about staying true to family and building better life for them. It exhibits a strong sense of place and community; a world which is attractive already by itself, where the audience would like to stay in – not that often seen in movies, action or otherwise. I secretly believe that this hidden depth is a part of the reason the first FF"" was able to birth this mega franchise we still get to enjoy all these years later. And this is where the series should head back to. Because let's be honest, the action can't get much more spectacular and over-the-top than we've seen so far – without doing Bollywood, at least. And the movies about having heart could actually do with having a bit more depth and heart. Two sequels have already been promised, in April 2019 and April 2021 respectively, and I am sure they will find ways to outshine (at least some of the) massive action setpieces seen so far. They always do, although it always seems kind of impossible having just finished watching the latest. But seriously, how about going back to the roots? The title abbreviation FF8"" reminds me of the function key F8, commonly used in desktop computers to access Windows Safe Mode. Playing it safe is exactly the movie's only downfall. The real drama is promised but ultimately missing, although the promise is great, with the central hero getting caught up with some demons and Diesel proving he has enough acting chops to play it out convincingly.",The Fate of the Furious
137,ritera1,"Fun, big and very silly",8,24 May 2017,"Very big and a lot of money up on the screen. A lot of very large and ambitious set pieces that were generally successful. Some very good moments, camera-wise, in New York but found that fell flat, too. But there was so much that might have slowed it down. The hand-to-hand stuff became a bit jumbled, too, but not as bad as I've seen it in the past. (Hollywood really has to take a lesson from Chinese action cinema in staging fight and action scenes. They do it far better.)The direction was a step up from the previous films with much of the lively elements of the other movies intact.A big handicap these movies have is Diesel. Really is not a good actor, even for this stuff, and they suffer because of him. Time for him to go. His insecurities and ego evident, especially if he's so much in control that he can dictate what goes into the film when it comes to Johnson. He doesn't seem to understand that Johnson can and does easily eclipse him. Even from a business perspective, it's clear the movies don't need Diesel due to his consistently poor showing in other films. He just loads them up with almost super-human qualities.But at the same time I can't really argue with the bank-ability of the franchise, even though I found it way too cartoonish to take seriously. Reminded me of an implausible Roger Moore James Bond. And the hip-hop aspect grated on my nerves, although I am not the demo they are shooting for.I was very vague on Theoron's grand plan. Diesel meeting with Mirren was much longer than ""five minutes."" They can steal Russian nuclear codes that would almost instantly be changed if they are stolen (and why does anybody but their president have those?). They wouldn't have a back-up of the God's Eye device? Statham is suddenly a good guy, forgetting all the murders he previously committed, including of their close friend?And I'm always annoyed by the reckless nature of many action movies. Sure, all that looks great on camera, but we still have ""heroes"" that do things that endanger innocent bystanders by any other measure.And the big problem I had was when Diesel didn't shoot Theoron's character when he had the chance. Yes, I know that his son's life hung in the balance, but so did millions of lives. Even hundreds due to the rampage of out-of-control cars on the street and dropping from the sky that almost certainly killed countless people.But they aren't listening to me. They're listening to the billion dollars that they made.",The Fate of the Furious

139,shobanchittuprolu,The Fate of the Furious is one of the most dumbest entry in the series which works more as a comedy than action.,6,21 November 2017,"The Fate of the Furious (2017): To be frank,I've lost track of how many Fast and Furious have been made and it hardly matters.I never liked this series until Fast Five came which still remains the best one in the series.Later Furious 7 is the one which impressed me.But when I watched the trailer of F8,I got a feeling that this one is going to be just trash.Plot: Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) has mysteriously gone rogue on his Fast And Furious family, and is now working in cahoots with Cipher (Charlize Theron), a criminal mastermind and cyber-terrorist who has orchestrated a meticulous plan that she wants Dom to carry out for her.The only people that can stop Cipher and Dom are his old cohorts, which remarkably sees Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) teaming up with his old adversary Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), while of course Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Chris Bridges), Ramsay (Nathalie Emmanuel) are along for the ride, as well as the covert operations pair of Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and Eric Reisner (Scott Eastwood).My Review: It's kind of crazy, however, that a film series which began as a small story about street racing andstolen DVD players in 2001 is now an Avengers style superhero movie which includes a fight with a submarine.There's a reason this franchise exists and has eight installments, and why lot of Indian filmmakers too believes that car-wrecking sells tickets.F8 has one amazing action scene of zombie-car sequence which may sound ridiculous but provide great fun.That scene is racy and thrilling and raised the hopes on rest of the movie.But I was disappointed that it is the only action scene which is bit believable as in the climax part,Cipher even hijacks a nuclear submarine and chases our gang.The attempts to make the stunts as insane as possible become more and more predictably idiotic — the biggest casualty of these is a race between a submarine, its torpedoes and cars. Of course Vin Diesel destroys the submarine in a cartoonish way.The only good part of the film is the funny rivalry between Hobbs and Deckars.Both Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham did wonderful job in providing great relief in this mess of a film.Others are so clichéd and Tyrese Gibson is irritating.We definitely miss Paul Walker in this series as he could have been amazingly furious when Dom went rogue.So,The Fate of the Furious is one of the most dumbest entry in the series which works more as a comedy than action.Just if they add Kevin Hart into the cast,this would definitely looks wonderful.My Rating 5.75/10",The Fate of the Furious
140,srdjan_veljkovic,"It's not a movie, but a mediocre video game",4,14 April 2017,"There's not much that makes sense here. That's the problem of the whole series/franchise, but here it's pretty bad. Not just elementary physics, but technology, sociology, psychology... In a video game, that's OK, but, this is not a video game... or at least it's not supposed to be.In general, it's not very fun, funny or really interesting. Not to mention that years and modern medicine haven't been kind on Charlize Theron and Michele Rodriguez. Kurt Russell is also not interesting (that's not easy to achieve) and Scott Eastwood doesn't manage to take his mantle. Basically, the whole thing just doesn't work.There are a few good pieces, though. Some jokes/moments, like when Jason Statham talks with his mother, some references to one of the crew not making top 10 most wanted on the Interpol list, etc. One gimmick about Charlize Theron using hacked cars in a multi-story garage actually makes sense. With all the silly nonsense, the end does pick up on the fun and jokes and the movie finishes without breaking apart, which is better than most modern movies. So, it's not the worst movie to see.But, one does get the feeling that the franchise has overstayed its welcome and in trying to expand to territories that don't have much to do with cars and racing, has gone off the grid into no-man's-land.",The Fate of the Furious
141,trublu215,"Loud, Dumb and Absolutely Ridiculous",6,12 April 2017,"The Fate of the Furious marks the 8th film in one of Hollywood's very few non-superhero franchises and just as the number suggests, it is very close to wearing out its welcome. With new full time additions to the cast (presumably to fill the void left by the late Paul Walker) Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, the film feels overstuffed with the type of cheese one would expect from an Expendables movie. This kind of drags on the film especially because the stunts just keep getting crazier and crazier. At one point there is only so many angles you can get of a car exploding in however many dozens of ways you make it explode. It becomes redundant after the hour mark. If you thought the action sequences were relentless, queue the ridiculousness of this film's cast.The Fast and Furious franchise has been built on bad acting, great stunts and an overall guilty pleasure of seeing these characters kick ass. This film was the first film in the franchise where I didn't really feel the connection between these characters. It felt like it was very hard to watch these characters interact. Between Vin Diesel's growl and stare or Dwayne Johnson's need to threaten people in the most creative ways possible or Charlize Theron delivering cringe-worthy one liners, there is nothing but wooden acting between them. While none of these actor are anything special (outside of Theron), one could still come to expect some intelligence to come through the dialog instead of differently scripted lines pertaining to family and how important it is.The story itself is probably the worst part of the film. It is written with the sense of a 11 year old child. Filled with ridiculous twists that reach a level of plausibility only existing in daytime soap operas, the film is hard to take seriously even by the standards this series has set for itself. Where Furious 7 tugged at your heart strings, this one makes you scratch your head and before you can even begin to fathom how any of it makes sense, you're thrusted into the next action sequence. While it does work for a bit, it wears out its welcome long before its third (and stupidest) act. Director F. Gary Gray does do a good job at directing the vehicular warfare we've come to love but leaves much to be desired when communicating the script to screen.Overall, The Fate of the Furious is probably one of the worst of the series. It is written with very little sense and feels very rushed along with being crippled by wooden performances. This is not the series we've all come to love. This feels like a hollow representation of what could have been. Despite the ridiculous action sequences that are perfectly executed, the film leaves you feeling empty even by action movie standards. Fans of the franchise will definitely feel something different with this one and I definitely think it is an enjoyable action film, I just wish it was written with a little more finesse and acted with a little more heart.",The Fate of the Furious

143,rehmankhilji,Super Cars to James Bond to Mission Impossible,5,30 June 2017,"If Superman is playing in some romantic role without flying and Wolverine is dancing in La La Land, how would you feel about the movie? Bad right? Well this edition of the Fast and Furious Franchise is on the same lines. First of all, this movie and its series is on cars, super cars and races. In this part the cars are literally enforced on the movie. If there was no super car involved in the movie, believe me the movie plot would be undisturbed. So note for the makers, ITS A CAR MOVIE not a James bond mission impossible thing. Save the world is a good motto but not in every damn addition. Secondly, the tag line of Dominic Toretto AKA DOM is FAMILY COMES FIRST. Yeah he speak about it in the movie, the makers have made out of no where again a family issue, but what on earth, all the past villains have now became best buds. Dwayne Johnson role as usual, Muscle Man, one punch all good bye, G.I. Joe type and nothing special. He was ultimate in the first but afterwards hardly needed. Tyrese Gibson, continues well, with his comic. Ludicrous, from car expert to everything genius. I think he should have been cast for The Martian, he would have found a better a quicker way. You would be surprised but in this addition he is NUKE Expert and of submarines. Triple Degree in MIT and stuff, simply ridiculous. Charlize Theron, never age and in the end she just magically disappeared and hopefully she will be back in next or perhaps in part 11. She is playing a big cyber criminal who stays in Air all the time without being detected. A little too much to digest. Kurt Russell, why are you being in this movie? like why? Nathalie Emmanuel, continues from part 7 with no major input. Will be seeing her in coming season of GOT, which will be far more better. Luke Evans, he is the good guy now, cause he has a mom too and he mom told her to be good. How pathetic is this. Family Comes first and in order to save his son DOM decide to take help from the person who killed Wonder Women sorry Gisele Yashar / Gal Gadot from Fast 5 and 6 and in the end is the girlfriend of Han. Elsa Pataky, yes they brought her back and with DOM Son.... by the way in which part this happen, when Dom and Elena had something? Or Dom during some time secretly went to Elena, made her pregnant and came back. Anyways, she only has two scenes and in the second she dies. Good thing cause if Dom g/f Eleni found her to be pregnant with a child, things would have been uglier. Jason Statham, yup he is there again and a good guy too. Helping out Dom to save his son. By the way DOM he killed Han. Nevertheless if you are a car fan don't watch, if you just want to see for not breaking the chain of this movie series, then go for it but do not expect a lot. There is lot less of cars and loads of Mission Impossible and James Bond stuff.",The Fate of the Furious
144,FallenEye,Gr8est of the 8.,8,14 April 2017,"OK... We all know that, if you're going to have a franchise, especially one that so far spans, a full 8 installments, progression is incredibly necessary to either stop, rejuvenate or mask possible and perhaps inevitable repetition.With that said, Fate 8 has moved from a bunch of outlaws stealing Panasonic electronics in the streets of Los Angeles, to stopping World War III, yes, World War III, in Russia. In isolation, true, that sounds very outlandish and ridiculous, but if keeping in mind that, when you're doing something you're so much of an expert in, over a period of 16 years - possibly even longer (this being Dom and Team), perhaps one can imagine the possibility of such exponential growth.While watching this film, my ratings kept vacillating quite a bit. When God's Eye was exposed as being ""moot"", that irritated me very much, because it revealed to us the potential uselessness of Furious 7, which would be a major spit in the face, and an insult to its loyal fans. But then, it turned out that Cipher was rendering it moot for them, because she wanted it for herself, because of how capable of a device it is, and by doing so, brought back Furious 7's leverage by making God's Eye a prominent element in the story.That magnificent New York vehicular extravaganza was amazing to watch, but, was it necessary? Why not just control, the Russian vehicles? Perhaps maybe, the ""magnificent, extravaganza and amazing to watch"" would fade away. So, that scene may have not been necessary, but, it was too spectacular.The prison break? I'm not at all too sure about that one. It didn't quite make sense. And Hobbs being turned into a real live Hulk, using walls as punching bags, tearing down a prison and using it as a barbell and, bullets literally bouncing off of him... I don't know. Also, he growled like Hulk??!Ultimately however, even though this film had perhaps, too many twists and sharp turns, it did its level best to avoid being bloated, it moved from one material scene to the next - though arguably, some scenes needed a more sensible motive, while others were a bit too convenient - and, it did a very good job at demonstrating relevance throughout. We know why Cipher did what she did. We know why Dom did what he did, and we know why the team did what they did.So, with a story that wasn't wasted, a cast that was truly strengthened by the amazing Charlize Theron, a consistent F. Gary Gray, Tyler's nostalgic key components, breathtaking set pieces, touching moments like the return of Dom to his family, baby Brian, and the vehicle barricade around the alpha, The Fate of the Furious was bigger, better, more entertaining and amongst the most moving in the series. Is it really an 8/10? As long as Elena isn't resurrected (not because she's an awful character or anything, but because in my day, dead meant, dead), then, yes.",The Fate of the Furious
145,austin0731,"Dumb, Big and Loud.",5,16 April 2017,"Fate of the Furious included over the top, high flying action and was a relatively good new addition to the franchise that started relatively small. The Furious line has grown into a beast over the past years and is never better in terms of pulling its shares at the box office. Its fast paced action is enough to let us dismiss the lack in narrative and structural content that more sophisticated viewers may be looking for. However this is what is it and no one does it better, a fun, dumb explosion of a franchise that audiences have grown to love.Although its 8th installment definitely ups the ante from Furious 7 in terms of action the emotional story that the 7th managed to tell in a beautiful send off to the late Paul Walker is sadly not found in this new film. Paul Walker's absence has really left a void in the franchise that they tried so hard to fill with new comer Scott Eastwood, personally I don't think he can replace Walker's role at all, another thing that puts 7 a leg up.One addition in this film did add a lot to the family dynamic though, The relationship between Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson and their chemistry was brilliant. Their to and fro bickering and love/hate relationship was just so good. Rather, the original furious gang really slacked off; Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous' characters were both not as fleshed out and seeing as Vin Diesel's Dom has gone rogue and out of the team the original gang really members really aren't so colourful and interesting.Overall I would say that even though the action and car chase definitely tops its predecessors. This film was rather not as good as the franchise's more notable entries such as its 5th and 7th installments.",The Fate of the Furious
146,asifahsankhan,"This one might not be the greatest in the franchise, but it's still great at what it is.",7,1 May 2017,"""That's a lot of ice cream and Tay Tay concerts"" - A new era in The Fast and the Furious lore has begun almost four years after original co-star Paul Walker passed away doing exactly what his character Brian O'Conner did in the films: drive fast. With his role shelved by retirement rather than death, the goodness Brian provided Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his band of miscreants remains in the background as an unseen sense of morality and justice. It lingers to bolster the group's sense of ""family"" and togetherness that moves beyond blood into respect, loyalty, and kinship. It's therefore only fitting this newest chapter would double-down on that concept to parallel love and betrayal as yet another puppet master higher than everyone else in this mythology's gallery of villains arrives to tear Dom's world apart.The title is The Fate of the Furious and it's an apt if not wholly on-the-nose moniker for what Chris Morgan has written. Let's just say that everyone who isn't dead in real life or canon makes an appearance to either crack jokes, satiate audience expectations, or provide yet another casualty to serve as the latest trope-based motivation to get angry, lose control, and wreak havoc. Fate has therefore brought them to this place, one where Dom is forced into servitude under the most dangerous hacker the planet has ever not seen. Cipher (Charlize Theron) has the ability to operate in shadows darker than even the US government's Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and she wields Dom as a weapon to accomplish what her other accomplices by coercion couldn't.Cipher has set the ball rolling—or continued a ball she set a few films back without our knowledge in the most convoluted bit of retrofitting this side of Jason Statham's Deckard inexplicably being brother to Luke Evans' Owen Shaw from Part 6, Sung Kang's Han's killer in Part 3, and Part 7's main villain. She seeks a nuclear weapon to ""watch the watchmen"" so to speak and probably has the means to do so without Dom. The reason he's been ""recruited"" is mainly to take him off the board as an unwitting adversary. Her belief is that his betrayal will keep his crew devoid of leadership and too emotionally compromised to stop her. So she kidnaps Dom's ex (Elsa Pataky's Elena) and tests his devotion to ""family.""The inherent comedy in Roman choosing a neon orange Lamborghini to drive on literal ice or making Johnson his daughter's soccer coach complete with Samoan war dance to intimidate twelve year old opponents is all-time. The filmmakers are embracing the natural charisma of their characters and building a story with edge around them without losing it. They aren't completely excising the car chase aspect (the film opens with an impossibly cartoon-like drag race between Diesel and Celestino Cornielle's Cuban Mafioso Raldo), but it's definitely taken a back seat to the physicality Johnson and Statham provide. Just like their fight in the former's office building was a highlight in Part 7, their jailbreak here shines brightest. Between Johnson's embellished strength and Statham's embellished speed, its park-our chaos on steroids.And those action scenes are also very funny once you numb yourself to the fact that everyone has become a full-fledged killer. These aren't mechanics thrust into crazy situations anymore. They now come wielding automatic rifles and a complete lack of remorse as stooges are mowed down individually rather than as mere collateral damage from explosions. But if you buy that these men and women from the street can equal Hobbs' Special Forces training, you can sit back and enjoy the ride. Revel in Dom doing his best Deathstroke to make a Russian diplomat pee his pants. Bask in the glory of Statham single- highhandedly destroying an army while holding a baby's car seat. It's so over-the-top that you cannot help but escape into its nonsense with open arms.The villain is still one-note (Theron has fun with dead-eye malice, but her Cipher is written so exacting in action that she must be made stupid in order to lose), the technology still borders on science fiction, and the body count almost approaches the number of vehicles destroyed. We get sports cars, tanks, and subs as well as fisticuffs, bullets, and missiles. Dom does nothing to earn the freedom he receives and therefore the time to manoeuvre himself into a position to beat Cipher, but she supplies it anyway because the plot needs it. Convenience becomes the spine on which The Fate of the Furious adheres, its inevitable contrivances countered by our enjoyment in their spoils. It might not be great, but it's great at what it is.",The Fate of the Furious
147,FelipeCarrillo,This Machine Still Must Not Go To The Garage,7,20 July 2017,"Mr. James Wan left dumbfounded the entire planet with which is considered as the most memorable of the franchise: ""Furious 7"", beloved at the expense of the illustrious decisions of the filmmaker, incardinating what went us crazy about the previous movies along with his blinding own method to create action films. An attractive mix constituted by the usual threat of the saga: Love towards the family, self-improvement, the likelihood of the scenes, the natural nitrous oxide from clandestine races, the charm between the characters, hilarious push lines, unstoppable pace, greedy ambitions, hand-to- hand confrontations and an unexpected but smashing deep touch of nostalgia because of the tragic passing of one of the leading roles: Paul Walker. Nobody knew what would be the next step by Universal Pictures after the breakout ending of the seventh installment, however, the studio wouldn't let one of the most profitable cinematographic jewels of all time go easily. Who would have ever foretold that a movie on illegal races with a police dab made by $25 million limited budget, would change into an octology with a uniform improvement both its efforts and production estimates, imposing the most expensive movie record in the fast cars and badass guys universe ($ 250 million)? Such mark concerns the latest installment titled ""The Fate of the Furious"", directed by F. Gary Gray.Dominic and Letty enjoy a magnificent honeymoon in Cuba, a paradise of colorfully corroded houses and streets that opens its doors after a 5-year abstinence about allowing for making American cinematographic productions. Their agreeable stay will be truncated by an Apollonian blonde woman named Cipher (Charlize Theron), who manages to extort Dom for personal benefit, exhibiting, at convenience, the treachery towards his beloved family. The skilled hacker used the street hero as the wild card to launch a deadly bomb which would wreck the whole world in a twinkling of the eyes, however, his friends will not rest until bringing back their guru, their high priest, their father.The screenwriters continue misplacing Lilliputians verisimilitude and coherence screws, they had, dissipating them in spectacularly fanciful story lines, and not exactly we refer to impracticable sequences intersected by flames, projectiles and good-looking women; we talk about narrative arcs, twists and tricks. The feature film presents some of the most insane occurrences in its visuals, which will make you buckle up and press the symbolic accelerator under your feet while simulating the dynamic chord from your imaginary auto. We are facing the era where nothing is fully unrealizable, at least for the eye, which is deceived by special effects with high detailedness levels, many of these so common and numerous in the postmodern blockbusters, indeed, it has become a factual necessity to draw the attention of the public, if they see something that doesn't look brand-new, goodbye and good luck. Recovering the above-mentioned idea, these crazy men have conceived certainly awe-inspiring sequences, ranked by the nature of their impact thus: 1. The post initial race, subsequent the robbery of the explosive, where all the drivers appear, and by ""race"" we allude to the wrecking ball. 2. The terminal act in the icy plains of Antarctica, this means, the attack of the Soviet submarine. 3. Jason Statham is officially the new favorite obsession/character for the audience, his combat in the airplane is exceptionally masterful. 4. And finally and the most superb, the car avalanche in Manhattan, New York. I never expected that F. Gray and his team would create one of the best action scenes so far this year, literally, everyone in the theater was absorbed in amazement.In the kinetic world of engines and speed, what makes fast and furious to ""Fast & Furious series"" is the magnetism between the characters, from the most renowned and well-liked to the newest and which, paradoxically, steal the show with vainglory. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham belong this level, brawny Titans who deliver as complicity as style to each frame in which they appear, it's even frustrating the little time and, to some extent, protagonism and treatment that are given to them on the screen. Except for the previous newcomers, computation adept Ramsey (Nathaniel Emmanuel) and Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood) don't work altogether, the first one still hasn't found her place in the group and the second one runs the role of the attractive white man who should not brag about his stereotyped character. As for the old runners, Roman (Tyrese Gibson), the comic relief hands his title over, it seems he has lost his touch, his antics have no longer the same impact. Michelle Rodriguez barely achieves the purpose of her character, while Vin Diesel, performing temporarily the villain of the show doesn't manage that we think he's a vile boy who defected from his group, partly because of his interpretation and partly because of the weak work in the editing of his dramatic scenes.It's ineluctable not to be curious about a new chapter in the saga that has hooked its tires to the entire planet, the unfortunate thing is that, metaphorically, we are tied with a rough cable (marketing) to the back bumper of a car which is sped up in every new installment, but deep down, knows that its most precious fuel is depleted. ""The Fate of the Furious"" doesn't add something relevant or vital for the progress of the auto universe, it provides what today presents most demand: effective, dynamic and insubstantial entertainment. It'd be powerful to apply all that energy to a narrative mold much more humane and coherent like in the first ones, even so, Universal's feature film is quite enjoyable, leaving aside narrative prejudices. It's unstable on pace issues and Paul Walker absence is noticeable, however, the first installment of the final trilogy will provide the stipulated speeds for the condescending fan legion.",The Fate of the Furious
148,virindra,Awesome action movie.,8,17 April 2017,"For me the Fast and Furious movies began with installment six. I like the over the top action. This movie is not different. The beginning of this one is a bit confusing, seeing Tortellini in an old car competing with a much newer car, but starting like the cars are equal. But the race is making the start up very well.I liked seeing Eastwood's boy making miles in acting. Handsome guy, a good replacement for Walker. I don't like Charlize Theron as an actress. Beautiful woman, but does not know how to act. She proved that in Prometheus as well. Fast and the furious shows that old bad guys can team up with the F&F family. Maybe Charlize will become Tortellini's girlfriend some day.Jason Statham was awesome. I liked Helen Mirren as well in her ""small part"". During the break people were wondering who that old woman was.I give this installment an eight, like the number of itself. I hope the next one will be better, so I can proceed this new habit.And for last my call for the big dude: If Disney is going to make a movie of Vaiana, please grow some hair and do the audition for Maui.

If you are interested, this movie is not only entertaining but asserts itself as a contender for the best in the series. Let's be honest no one watches a Fast and Furious film for its script but for its full of adrenaline scenes. Faster and furiouser than ever this film it's worth taking a spin.",The Fate of the Furious
155,Semisonic,Epically shameless nonsense Vol. 2,2,4 July 2017,"According to the famous marxist saying, there's no such crime capital wouldn't commit for a 300% profit. The Fate of the Furious might not aim to triple its budget in earnings, but the crime of the paycheck receivers is still there: to take us to the movie theaters yet again, this film resorts to being so ridiculously over the top that you'll be recalling Fast Five and its multi-ton safe ""drag race"" (pun intended) as the good ol' days of sheer realism. Even ""jumping the shark"" isn't strong enough for this franchise anymore, we should say ""jumping the nuclear submarine"" from now on. Alas, that's not even a metaphor.There's no point describing the ins and outs of the film, even for the sake of sarcasm, because towards the 8th step of this path there's nothing new left to surprise, disgruntle or even enrage you anymore. I will say, however, that despite the departure of several prominent franchise heroes in the latest episodes, the new characters keep proliferating at an alarming pace, making you genuinely wonder whether it's hype or paycheck that draws people into this monstrosity, and how soon it will be renamed to something more fitting, like ""Toretto's Eleven"".There are two unlinked things left to say, one good and one bad. The good one is that now there's not one Game of Thrones person in the film but two. Kristofer Hivju and his fiery beard definitely added some color to the film, although his character is made more of wood than of fire in here. The bad one is that, even though the film tries once again to pay tribute to Paul Walker by making a pretty sentimental reference to his character towards the end of the film, I simply couldn't recall the name of Paul Walker himself until later when I looked it up here on IMDb. Maybe that's just me being amnesiac, but in this rush to be larger than life every single second, the franchise loses the last remnants of true emotions and sincerity it once had, becoming instead a big hard-stomping caricature of itself. So maybe it's for the best that you have a hard time linking Paul Walker to this film in your mind: he was way too nimble and vivid for it, while Vin Diesel fits this image perfectly.",The Fate of the Furious

Yet, shelling out money at the cineplex to support the 8th film in a globally dominant franchise sends the wrong message to Hollywood (or at least, not the message I'd like to send regarding these bloated moneybombs).Because while I did get the maximum enjoyment you can get at a movie like this, it was also, ultimately, a waste. That's not to say they all are, or even that this movie is all that bad (it's fine) it's just that maybe it didn't matter that much in the first place. A Big Mac tastes best fresh out of the fryer, but should I even be eating one in the first place? On occasion sure its fine to dive, but not just because someone is telling me now is the only time I can -- not anymore.Also, this is the first one that has really started to show its age.

157,rutzelb,"CGI and stunts gone wild for this ""spy"" story",9,21 July 2017,"Cipher (Charlize Theron) convinces Dom (Vin Diesel) to go over to the Dark Side and betray his friends so he can work for her. Okay, so she must have something on him for him to do that. What could it be? Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) steals a EMP unit for Cipher, but Dom takes it away from him for Cipher. Cipher wants nuke codes to have the world powers do what she wants. Dom steals the nuke codes for Cipher. Cipher knows where a Russian sub is that no one bothers about anymore, but it has nukes on board. Oh, oh!What happened to racing? We do see it in the beginning for a while; then everything turns into a spy movie. The Feds get involved with Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) as the boss and his right hand man Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood) and they want to take down Cipher and now Dom too. If you like seeing cars crash for hours on end and even fall from skyscrapers when Cipher says, ""Make it rain"" and hand to hand fights with guns shooting everywhere, then this is for you. As for me I will admit the car crashes choreography are simply outstanding, but when they go for too long a time - and they do - I fall into la la land. More exciting scenes have a submarine coming up thru the ice upsetting vehicles racing to close the locks so the sub cannot get into open waters. These scenes along with missiles coming from Russian troops are truly frightening, but well done nevertheless. How they did all this is a mystery to me. Looked very real. The camera work and overall photography, pacing and editing are awesome. Kudos. So this is just a spy story with CGI and actual stunts gone wild. And wild is a tame word to describe what you will see in here. I did say this had turned into a spy movie, but on the extreme one might say this has really turned into an Extreme Demolition Derby without starting times. This is basically the whole movie.Notables: Michelle Rodriguez as Letty, Dom's girlfriend; Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs as mentioned becomes a part of Dom's team (but without him as he has gone Rogue, remember?); Tyrese Gibson as Roman, a part of Dom's team; Ludicrous as TJ also a part of Dom's team; and Jason Statham as Deckard who joins Hobbs and the rest of Dom's team. And Kristofer Hivju as Rhodes, Cipher's right hand man.Overall this is a good action movie that got away from racing for a purpose and instead became more of a spy story. Is this what we will expect to see in future shows? Huh? Well, okay then. Bring it on. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Brief soft stuff",The Fate of the Furious
158,AnishMisra,FF8 Review,8,19 April 2017,"The Fate of the Furious is a film directed by F. Gary Gray. This film series is one of the most anticipated every time it comes out. And yes, I too have expectations from this franchise. And yes, it delivered. Plot: Dom gets sucked into the world of cyber-terrorism after Cipher threatens him.Story and direction: If you decide to watch this series actually with some story in it, please don't go to the halls. It is basically for hardcore FF fans. I myself was a fan of the series only after the fourth part (since most of the racing is finished after the third part). This part of the franchise links both the 6th and 7th parts of the film, which I quite liked. The twist which is revealed quite early in the film was not actually something that was satisfying. Cipher's character is one hell of a bad-ass character written. I thought nobody would beat Jason Statham character in FF7. But hell yeah Cipher is the best villain in the entire franchise till now. I hope they bring her in future installments (Yes, 2 more parts are still there).Acting: Vin Diesel was good in this part too. We see the old Dom Toretto . The Rock who people quite missed in the seventh part (I also) was back with some Major chunk of role in the film. Jason Statham was also good. Tyrese, used as comic relief in the film gives many laughs. Also providing laughs is Scott Eastwood, playing Nobody's assistant. We also see him driving some cars and getting to action (which I didn't expect). But yes, a special mention to Charlize Theron. Although she didn't have action scenes to support her role, the role was well written and executed with perfection by her. Kurt Russell too was good.Other departments: Music used by Brian Tyler was good. The VFX was also great. And yes, the stunts.. With each of the franchises we see a great number of action sequences (that is what basically this film is made for). And hell yeah, I was impressed with each of the action and stunt sequences. I watched it in 3D. Which made the fun even 3 times better.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be the scene where Rock cheers the girl's to victory and has some sort of victory dance in the beginning of the match. That was quite funny to watch. He even forces an official to cheer for the girl's victory.Verdict: On that note, I would like to say that FF8 delivers. Although it has some minor mistakes, I came out of the hall satisfied. There is even another tribute to the character Brian on the film (hell I miss you Paul Walker). It is less entertaining that the seventh part, but satisfying.I will give this an 8/10.",The Fate of the Furious
159,Nightmarelogic,I am not sure if the bad reviews are by people who have actually watched the series,7,14 January 2018,Its interesting to read some of the bad reviews because they complain about the lack of realism. That is just funny to be cause it makes it look like they haven't been paying attention to the series at all. If realism is what you are looking for in a series then this is definitely not your series because it boasts flying cars on a fairly regular basis. However it has done that pretty much from around movie five and we are on movie eight now. Then again action movies have never been very heavy on realism so if you like a good action movie you should really expect men flying through the air in fast cars and not getting shot by bullets heading straight for them.Now on to the plot. This one adds a bit of thriller and drama to the plot when the defacto leader of a band of misfit heros betrays them on an operation. They spend the movie chasing him while he tries to get out from under the thumb of a woman who is blackmailing him with the only thing that can be used to blackmail a man like him....his ex girlfriend and his son. The movie itself doesn't really have anything new except for some new characters but that is a good thing. This isn't really a series that needs to be changed. When you get down to its bare bones it is a series about family and what makes one.,The Fate of the Furious
160,destinylives52,More Craziness And More Fun,7,15 May 2017,"The eighth movie of ""The Fast And The Furious"" line, ""The Fate Of The Furious"" is just as outrageous, ridiculous, unbelievable, funny, and entertaining as the preceding seven movies. Part 8 has Charlize Theron playing the villain. Her problem? She wants to have the means to threaten and carry out punishments to various governments when they dowhatever it is they do that upset her — the movie wasn't really clear on that. She blackmails Vin Diesel's character to steal what she needs. No, she doesn't need ex-Navy SEALs; she doesn't need ex-Special Forces; she doesn't need ex-SAS or even ex-Delta Force soldiers — she needs Vin Diesel! So what has Theron have on Diesel that makes him turn on his fellow fast and furious crew? That is a secret I won't reveal. But Diesel is now on the most wanted list, and not only is his former crew after him, U.S. secret agents are also coming for him. In fact, so many people are angry at Diesel turning rogue that his old crew are working with former enemies. We are treated to ludicrous chase scenes and giant, action set pieces in Cuba, Berlin, NYC, Europe, and the unfriendly skies as Diesel's motivations and actions unfold.My most memorable, movie moment is the sequence of the bad guys hacking the computers of dozens of vehicles in NYC and driving them all remotely with a decent amount of precisionall done by one or two people. Adding to the craziness of this sequence is seeing what is supposedly Manhattan's streets fairly open to fast moving traffic during the day time. People familiar with this island are probably laughing after reading that last sentence.Hey, ""The Fast And The Furious"" movies will never be Oscar contenders for Best Screenplay, we know this. These movies are for a specific audience of hundreds of millions of people all over the world — myself included — and they never fail to entertain us.

162,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,8,16 April 2017,"he Fast and Furious series continues with it's 8th installment, despite the loss of Paul Walker the series still manages to be as fun and entertaining, only this installment has a bit of extra effort into story, character while not sacrificing the crazed action it is known for, and as well hope to prove the franchise can be strong as ever though it has lost one of its main stars.Originally, I had low expectations and thoughts of this being not as good as the last one but this manages to be good and fun as the series is known for. Without Walker, the film's remaining stars Diesel, Johnson, Rodriguez, Gibson, Ludicrous and a few more old faces along with a few new faces to the franchise manage to keep us committed to the franchise, they all give solid performances that make their characters still likable and believable. Charlize Theron's role in the film was indeed one of the major highlights, playing as a smart, capable and believable threat to our heroes, indeed this is one of the best villains to have appeared in the series to date.The action set sequences are basically following the style and scale to the previous films (in this case, 6 and 7), with practical stunt work, CGI touches for the impossible and a big budget to work off the film pulls this off with great fun and yet silly results that reminds us that it's not going to take itself too serious. The climax was pretty much like F&F6, an endless runway but made more sense of realism without losing the no brainer tone. There's fist fights, cars blown away, destruction, an epic prison escape and endless 'no way in hell that could happen' moments that will indeed keep the current fans of the franchise interested throughout.Overall, The Fate of the Furious is a fun film of pure escapism, action packed sequences and a great story to boot. This I can recommend to fans, but let's hope there's only two more then they can wrap it up, securing a great end to the franchise.Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers",The Fate of the Furious
163,danielharden,H8er's gunna H8!,6,22 April 2017,"Fast and Furious 8 is directed by F. Gary Gray and stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Charlize Theron. The Fast and the Furious franchise is well known for its fast cars and logic defying narrative and action/chase scenes. Now in its eighth instalment, without it's initial protagonist (RIP Paul Walker) but yet still making lots of money, Fast of the Furious 8 is the same mindless fun everyone expects without offering much more than those idiotic conventions. Simply put it's a fun, dumb, escapist, action movie. If you are looking for a plausible, Oscar worthy script this far into the franchise, then you deserve to be disappointed.... Sorry to be harsh but it's true.By far the best part of this film is the relationship between Jason Statham and The Rock. I completely understand why there is going to be a spin off with these two and to be honest, I'm looking forward to it more than I am the final 2 Fast and Furious films (9 and 10). Their love hate relationship provided just the right amount of conflict and humour and the chemistry between them worked wonderfully. It was a shame that after a certain amount of time in the film they stop having their one on one stand offs all together. The film in effect robbed me of something I didn't know I wanted to see so badly. It's a shame the film forgot about their relationship midway through this film.As I said this film is what it is. It's a dumb, fun, summer blockbuster with the same sweaty bald men driving fast cars for the 8th time. All expectations of this franchise's genre is met such as; Vin Diesel's grumble monologues about family, girls dressed like strippers, fast cars defying every law known to man and Tyrese Gibson forcing comedy unsuccessfully and just coming across as a dick. This being said I couldn't help but find myself bored watching this film. All expectations were met but nothing new was done effectively. Fast Five had the Rock's introduction and the heist genre, Fast 6 had character deaths and the plane sequence, Furious 7 had the beautiful send off for Paul Walker, but this film fails to raise the bar for the franchise as a whole.This films cinematography and editing were terrible at times, being very jumpy and hard to focus at certain points in the action, but this is still as expected of the franchise. Same goes for the script but as I have already said, don't expect anything of great value, but I still can't excuse the film for consisting of large amounts of state-the-obvious dialogue. I find this type of dialogue excruciating to hear and screenwriter Chris Morgan seems to love it. Charlize Theron was the main offender of using this dialogue and I feel sorry that she didn't have a better character to play (a fast and Furiosa if you will). She pretty much looks blankly and whispers ""Get out of there."" to Dom for the films runtime. One for the bank account I see Charlize.If you are like me and thought that Furious 7 was the perfect ending the Fast and Furious franchise could wish to have, and really should have been the end of the franchise, then the Fate and the Furious will prove you were right. It is a dumb fun action film that I can see a lot of people enjoying, but for me this film was a boring repetition of events that doesn't elevate the franchise or effectively utilise its Rock and Statham bromance. There is fun to be had with this film and so I wouldn't deter people from it, I just wanted something bigger and better than the last film and I wasn't given that. I look forward to the spin off but Fast and Furious 9 and 10 not so much.",The Fate of the Furious

165,tinovalkki,Shameless entertainment,8,12 April 2017,"Fast & Furios movies belong to a genre of a bad movies which are so bad that they are enjoyable. Whole series of movies are shameless entertainment from beginning to the end and there is nothing bad with it. Movie offers you everything you ever waited, reckless driving, pretentious stunts, stupid jokes, machoism and (beautiful women). Every time they try to make everything bigger, than previous. This time they bring nuclear submarine to end scene. There will be two movies at least to come to this series. Remain to be seen what they bring next time to make it even bigger than this. Story is quite gauzy, but hardly any one expect anything else. As an entertainment movie wont betray you, but with it's script is little weaker than previous movie. Jokes are quite lame, but some of them manage to make you laugh. Froth entertainment and nothing else. Light story is quite amusing, but some scenes makes story a little lame. For that we can blame movie director F. Gary Gray. Previous movie director James Wan kept story tight and solid. Let's hope they will bring him back in upcoming movies. Movie holds every aspects you ever waited. Senseless reckless driving and great action. Even this movie aren't so good than previous it still is shameless entertaining. Bringing Kurt Russel to movie is great honor to 1980's action movies. These movies are so bad that they are so great and dulcet to watch. It gives you what ever you were expecting for these movies, speed, action, orgulous stunts to satisfy you to pay a movie ticket price.",The Fate of the Furious

The best thing about this movie IMHO is not all the bang and boom, but the strange friendship between Rock and Statham. Now that's some funny stuff to watch, listen to actually. The way they exchange their respect, and one particular moment, priceless.Do not look for logic, common sense and anything intellectually valuable in this movie, just enjoy all the Hollywood crap it offers.P.s. It is science fiction movie, and I don't like Americans showing Russians as incompetent soldiers because God knows it is quite opposite.",The Fate of the Furious
167,joshbarton15,Nothing but entertaining vehicular chaos,7,12 April 2017,"What started as a simple Point Break with cars idea, centred around illegal street racing, has evolved over the past sixteen years to become a box-office behemoth, totally disregarding its roots, instead opting to become a ludicrous action franchise that now has its eight film entering cinemas.If I'm honest, even though they are utterly ridiculous, I have become more of a fan of the Fast and the Furious franchise ever since they changed things up massively with Fast Five back in 2011. With each film since, they've really gone overboard to try and outdo themselves and The Fate of the Furious might just be their craziest outing yet.When the mysterious cyber-terrorist known as Cipher (Charlize Theron) seduces Dom (Vin Diesel) into working for her, it's up to those he once saw as family to stop him, leading to a lot of vehicular chaos.I mentioned earlier that the franchise has totally disregarded its roots, which isn't entirely true, seeing as the first ten minutes includes a number of gratuitous ass shots and some actual street racing, but that's about it. From then on in, The Fate of the Furious is an adrenalin fuelled action movie that definitely rocks out with its cock out, delivering plenty of blistering action that will keep you entertained right through to next week.Seriously, some of the action sequences in Fate of the Furious will yet again be headache inducing for physicists however, you simply have to buy into them and just enjoy the ride if you want to have any chance of enjoying this film. A scene involving cars being hacked and swarming around New York sure does look bonkers but it suits the franchise as it is now, plus it was funny as hell.The fatal flaw once again in one of these films is the script and just how awful some of it sounds when these characters say it out loud. I mean, I'm not expecting Shakespeare in any shape or form, but some of the lines of dialogue in The Fate of the Furious is some of the worst you'll hear all year.Coming to the performances, The Fate of the Furious features an ensemble cast, many seen before in the franchise, who clearly share great chemistry together, leading to a more enjoyable viewing experience. Tyrese Gibson once again comes off a little like the kid in class trying too hard to be funny, before being totally upstaged by the duo of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, who genuinely share some funny moments together. Oh yeah, Johnson and Statham get dealt some awful dialogue but the two of them really do make it work, and Statham gets the best moment of the film. Seriously, it's hilariously brilliant and I hope Statham remains a franchise regular from here on in. Charlize Theron joins the party as the villain of the piece but she doesn't really get much to do apart from sit behind a computer so she does feel a little wasted, particularly as we know she can handle an action sequence after her performance in Mad Max: Fury Road.There's talk of taking the franchise to space in the next instalment which would take the franchise to even more ludicrous heights. As far as I'm concerned now though, The Fate of the Furious is an entertaining entrant into one of the better blockbuster franchises around. There's a nice little tribute to Paul Walker's contribution to the franchise in there for good measure too.",The Fate of the Furious
168,barbagvido,This nonsense should have stopped at Furious 7.,2,28 April 2017,"The Fate of the Furious is the 8th movie in the Fast and Furious franchise. It somehow made it that far. But at least it's fun. It's really stupid and cringy at times, but it's not to be taken seriously. Still, I think everyone is way too gentle on these movies.So, once again, it's basically a B-movie script with a big budget. And the previous movie was surprisingly touching with its tear-jerking tribute to Paul Walker and I think it should have stopped there. This isn't even funny anymore, it's just a pointless cash-grab now. When it shouldn't be funny, it is. And when it should, the jokes fall flat. And you end up cringing through the movie. It was fun, yes. But it never should have made it this far! This is way too much for such a stupid franchise and everyone is more gentle then they should be. There are lots of better movies that are taken too seriously and get mixed or negative reviews. And this rubbish gets praised. Maybe I'm overreacting, but I think it's really the time that it stops. It's not awesome anymore in any way, it's just really, really dumb at this point.I don't recommend this. Don't go see it.

169,anthonyf94,Family values (?),6,6 September 2019,"One of the most interesting things of the entire saga, is the conflict between different law models, the institutional one against the law of friendship. In all the movies this makes the characters often ambiguous, from the double game of Brian to the alliance between Hobbs (policeman) with the Toretto gang.Here this moral fluidity teacher is apical point, and falls down in a series of inopportune changes of position. The ""betrayal"" of Toretto happens too easily and without a clear narrative construction, so we can't understand well if he is good or bad, and not for a thin psychology but only for an inadequate management of the characters. Equally, Shaw starts to work with Hobbs and the others even if they fought each other until the previous movie. So, in general, the moral positions are bad defined and this reduce the efficiency of the ""family message"" (already paternalistic and annoying per sé) also weaker.In conclusion, this movie repeats all the problems of the previous chapter (and also the fact that there's no more fast, practically, and supercars are only a spectacular extra)0 as pathetic dialogues, exaggerated explosions and fights, and less than the other movies manages worse the moral ambiguity that reveals just its low quality.",The Fate of the Furious

I said this on Twitter and I stand by it: I don't go into these movies expecting Oscar worthy screenplays. I'm just looking for dumb fun, and that's what all the Fast and Furious movies have delivered perfectly on. And you certainly get your fill of dumb fun here with The Fate of the Furious. If you stop and think too much about what's actually going on, you're going to ruin it for yourself. You're not supposed to think about it. A lot of stupid, crazy sh*t happens on screen... but it's so much damn fun to watch! Just take these scenes for what they are and move on. The usual crew is back for this. Vin Diesel is as good as ever as Dom. The only unfortunate thing is that he's separated from the rest of the crew for the majority of the movie, so we don't get the usual comradery and chemistry he has with everyone. Even if it is minus Vin Diesel, we still get that chemistry from everyone else that makes these characters and their interactions so much fun. Dwayne Johnson is once again the shining star of the film. He has the best action scenes and the best one- liners, and is just a complete badass through and through. Tyrese Gibson is also once again the shining comedic star of the film. He has always been the comedic relief, and excels at it. He's always fantastic in these movies...",The Fate of the Furious

Recipy: take hot action stars, pour some sexy chicks for background, add unreal action scenes, and above all put 50 gallons of diesel. There you are. Guaranteed shallow fun. You might be offended by the constant absence of physical laws reaching levels of Matrix's Neo, and the glorified Toreto. The baddies of the movie is just a couple of persons and some bodyguards- plants, while the gratuitous violence towards the Russians without reason, left me very annoyed. Statham's and Dwayne's characters are the most interesting. When Statham was killed off with none giving his respects I was very annoyed and lost interest in the movie. Luckily his fighting skills returned and the movie ended on a pleasant note. Eastwood is a handsome addition in the team, but still needs a lot of work to reach his father's kickass style that would suit the franchise.The thing to retain for sure is the zombie car chase, which was something never seen before.

173,kaden_lewis,The Fate of the Furious,10,7 July 2021,"Just to be clear, I am rating this movie 9.5/10, I just needed to round to 10 because they don't allow decimals. I don't get why people are giving this movie 1's and 2's out of 10, this was a fun movie to watch. This movie had some of the best action in the series. The New York scene was amazing. When Cipher and her crew hijacked nearly every car in a certain area using God's Eye, I was so entertained, especially when she made it rain with Cars in a parking garage. Also, the final scene in northern Russia when the crew was driving away from a submarine, and Russian military Separatists on ice was amazing. We were also given some great laughs as usual from Roman. He is definitely one of my favorite characters, he is so funny. Another funny scene we had was the scene where Shaw fought off Ciphers entire crew all while holding a baby, the baby's expressions were perfect and hilarious. Even though this movie had some great action, it also had some flaws. This movie felt sort of empty with characters. Out of the original crew we only had Dom and Letty, then out of the others from Fast Five, we only had Roman, Tej, and Hobbs. It sucks they had to kill off or write out nearly everyone from that stretch of movies. That is one of the reasons why Fast 5, and 6 are my favorites, they both had the entire crew. I did like ""Evil Dom,"" but I didn't like how dark the reason was for him doing that was. This movie was unnecessarily dark and somewhat disturbing with Cipher at some times and I just didn't like it in a Fast and Furious movie.Besides all that, this movie had some good action, and some good laughs, don't listen to what most people are saying, this was a good movie and I definitely recommend it to everyone.",The Fate of the Furious
174,anupapu8,Well It got big surprises.,8,14 April 2017,"THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS(released in India as FAST AND FURIOUS 8) - Well they say two more installments are coming , one in 2019 and one in 2021. I say , bring it on. I m totally on board.Surprise Surprise Surprise , the movie is full of them , which unfortunately i cant discuss . But you will enjoy them, definitely.Its hard to discuss about every character in the movie , so i will limit myself to only two. First and foremost Jason Statham , my favorite from the series and i think he is the best addition to the series (The Rock comes second) . Statham has a very special role in the movie , which again i cant discuss , lets just say he gets most of the one on one fights in the movie also some best one liners including the cutest action sequence in the movie. And his new Bromance with ROCK'S character is turning out to be awesome.Then comes Charliz Theron. My god i loved her hairstyle. I wish she use the same look in some other movie with her being the main lead. That being said , she was totally a furious villains. Not pulling any punches , she took hard hitting decisions which broke Dominique's character to tears. F Gray Gray is a very good director. he had the experience of both Action and Drama before this. Back in 2003 he directed The Italian Job, which was one of the best HEIST movies of all time . Its shocking that he didn't get any chance after that for making any action film. In 2015 he directed Straight Outta Compton , a biographical drama of a RAP group which get Oscar nominated for best best screenplay. Here he controlled both action and drama (including the comic scenes ) very nicely. Yes there were some dull moments in the film(mostly when the character of Chepir gives Domnique life lessons) , but that's because of average writing , nothing wrong with the direction. And as always , Fast and Furious series were not about good writing ever , but in last four movies they have injected just enough writing to make these more then just B GRADE action movies (a label with which the series has been started).The action ? Yes its great. Kicking the S**t out of every law in physics. These heroes can do anything. The character of ROCK literally changed the direction of a missile with his hand. ROCK is like a human form of HULK in the movie. My favorite sequence in the movie was THE JAIL BREAK , with ROCK and STATHAM fighting with inmates and officers. Thats because i like Hand to Hand combats more then vehicle stunts. My least favorite was New York chase sequence , and that's because it uses too much of CGI which was some how easily detectable to me(even after 250m$ budget). But each and every sequences are well done. Nobody will get disappointed with the action scenes , i guess that's what counts in FAST AND FURIOUS movies.About bad writing , there was a time in the movie when a tragedy happened , and after two scenes the group seems to cracking jokes , like they do feel any sorrow. That was pretty bad for me. Lastly i am putting this 8TH installment on the 2nd position after the 5TH installment which is my favorite in the series because of its writing.And yes , they are somehow still keeping the soul of LATE PAUL WALKER alive in this series. 7.8/10By ANuP APu KuMaR",The Fate of the Furious
175,mitchell5954,It's A Fast and Furious Movie!,7,17 August 2019,"The Fate of the Furious is the eighth movie in the Fast and Furious franchise. At this point in the series you pretty much know what to expect from these movies; races, crazy car action, fist fights, explosions, insane plots, one-liners galore, and a ton of fun. Essentially your basic Michael Bay movie, though these films are much more entertaining than most of his films, especially as of late. If you're a fan of the previous films, especially five through seven, you'll enjoy this. If not, this is not the move for you. I for one enjoy most of the films in this franchise, including this one. There'll all stupid movies, but in an entertaining way.Most of the cast and characters, who weren't killed off, return here, except for Paul Walker (RIP), with a couple new additions, including Charlize Theron as the villain. Charlize's character blackmail's Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) to betray his team and pull-off various heists for her in order to achieve her ultimate goal. The rest of the Dom's team must stop them and rescue Dom.Like I said, this film continues the trend Fast Five through Seven have set, especially part seven. Unbelievable as it sounds, this film manages to be even more over-the-top than Furious 7. However, this film is better than Furious 7. The plot feels more coherent, the action is better, the climax is better, and The Rock and Jason Statham have much more to do. Fate of the furious is probably my third favorite Fast and Furious film. I like it more than Furious 7, and certainly more than the first four. But, I still like Fast Five and Six a tad more.As always with these films, Fate of the Furious is technically well-made. The action is all well-done, and much of it practical. What CG is there is integrated well. The music is also good, both the score and songs. The dialog and acting is corny, but that's to be expected. Plus, it's delivered in a fun way.Overall, Fate of the Furious is another Fast and furious film. Not much more to say. If you're already a fan of this series you should like this one. If you hate this series, this movie will not win you over.",The Fate of the Furious
176,Dannyboi94,"Entertaining, but leave logic at the door",6,17 April 2017,"I think it is a surprise to anyone how they managed to make eight of these movies. While changing the street-racing routes definitely saved this franchise, the Fast and Furious 8 is a slight step back, even though it was a fun ride.First of all, the good aspects of this movie are its action scenes. They are shot very well, and every single scene with visual effects, is absolutely flawless. I don't know if they used practice effects or CGI, but I really couldn't tell the difference. Of course, like all Fast and Furious movies, this suffers from, unrealism. Seriously some of the things that happen in this movie are beyond far-fetched, but that doesn't make it any less exciting, even if you just scoff and say. ""Yeah right, like that would happen.""The acting in this movie is also very well done, with Charlize Theron outshining everyone in the movie, which is no surprise. And she is also a very interesting villain, even though we no nothing about her at all. Every character in the movie has their time to shine, and Dwayne Johnson is just brilliant, you could watch him throw fully grown men across the room all day and not get bored.The story of the movie is a bit ... meh. Forgettable. While the plot of the movie is compelling, and they give a very good reason behind Dom's betrayal, the movie jumps around a lot, and is very sloppy. I found myself confused a few times, trying to understand what the hell was going on.While this movie is not bad, it has a lot of flaws, with the major one being the god-awful editing. Seriously, this film is a bloody mess. The editing is real bad, with scenes that don't make sense or abolish the rules of continuity, take up most of the movie, even more so towards the end of the movie - which was also very rushed. Some of the characters, old and new don't have much to say this time around, with them just popping in and out of screen. I think one of the biggest problems people will have with this movie, is that they barely reference Paul Walker, or Brian in the movie. They mention him like once, and that's it. Nothing. I can understand that they want to respect Paul's memory, but his character is still alive, they could have showed Mia face-timing Dom, with Brian and his son in the distance. Just seeing them would have been perfect.Fast and Furious 8 is a good movie, but not a great one. It is better than most in the franchise, but not better than Fast Five, 6 or 7. If you do go and watch this movie, don't expect a realistic movie, because you will find more realism in a Narnia movie.6.4/10",The Fate of the Furious

179,margulanabutrlov,The Fate of the Furious 8 Review,7,23 March 2019,"When a dark figure blackmails Dom Toretto (Diesel) into turning against his crew, it's up to Luke Hobbs (Johnson) to stop his old friend, and perhaps save the world into the bargain, with the help of a deadly foe (Statham).
The number 8 sat well on Steven Gerrard, but not necessarily on movies. Fast & Furious 8 - a more mundane moniker over here, changed from the appropriately overblown The Fate Of The Furious across the Pond - sets out to break a curse that took down the likes of Friday The 13th and The Pink Panther. And it does so in much the same manner that transformed the franchise from an also-ran into one of the world's biggest box office behemoths: by doubling down on daft. This is no longer a down-and-dirty series about loveable carjacking criminals; it's a globetrotting, scenery-smashing, logic-jacking extravaganza. Fast 8 is more of the same, more or less, with the emphasis heavily on more.
It starts sedately enough, with an almost entirely extraneous sequence in which Vin Diesel's carjacker-turned-Dom Toretto and his wife Letty (Rodriguez) are on holiday in Cuba, getting caught up in one of the franchise's seemingly contractually obliged street races. By the end, though, that pesky escalation has delivered a true first for movies - a submarine-car chase. In-between, enough vehicles are totalled to make the end of The Blues Brothers look like the start of The Blues Brothers. These action sequences are handled comfortably by new director Gray, even if there's nothing here to rival the sustained insanity of the bus chase in Fast 7. Instead, it's during the film's frequent bursts of exposition that Gray struggles, with the scenes in which the crew members each explain something while looking at monitors heavily redolent of TV shows such as NCIS. They further reinforce the long-held feeling that some of the supporting characters aren't really that compelling. Thank the Lord, then, for three actors who are having the time of their lives.
First, there's Kurt Russell, whose Mr Nobody rocks up from time to time to helpfully explain what the hell's going on. The action stuff he leaves to newcomer Scott Eastwood (just when you thought there was no more vroom at the inn, this movie has more characters than TwitLonger) as his deputy, Little Nobody. But whenever Russell's on screen, his eyes twinkle like a man enjoying one hell of a career resurgence.
The second is Dwayne Johnson, which should come as no surprise. The introduction of his super-cop Luke Hobbs to Fast Five was integral to the franchise's evolution from callow contender to self-aware, sweat-drenched, gloriously silly blockbuster champ. And here, with Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner absent for obvious, tragic reasons, the bulk - literally and figuratively - of the movie's action falls to him. And he steps up to the preposterous plate, whether it's tackling a torpedo with his bare hands, or exchanging choice insults with Jason Statham.
The Stath's Deckard Shaw was the bad guy last time around, hunting down The Car-azy Gang one by one and giving good enough glower for them to keep him alive. This time around, thanks to reliably ridiculous retconning, he's on the side of the angels, and actually emerges as the film's MVP. There's no glowering here - this version of Deckard Shaw is a quip-happy one-man-army that utilises Statham's natural charisma in a way Hollywood has mostly missed until now. His standout sequence, though it borrows liberally from John Woo's Hard Boiled, is huge heaps of fun. Give this man his own spin-off.
Russell, Johnson and Statham, of course, are in on the joke. Something that doesn't seem to be the case with Vin Diesel. And to reflect that, while Dom's crew are off taking care of the Fast, Diesel is stuck with the Furious in his own little rather dour, melodramatic movie with Charlize Theron's villain Cipher, who doesn't get to do much except stare at computer screens and bark standard-issue threats. Mind you, even here escalation is inevitable: just when you think this storyline will be a fun-free zone, Diesel finally gets a couple of scenes with Dame Helen Mirren (complete with slightly dubious Cockernee accent).
Oh, and there's further good news: if you're playing the Fast & Furious drinking game, where you take a shot every time Vin says ""family"", you'll be pished as a newt about an hour in. Now that's a win-Vin situation.",The Fate of the Furious

It is not that I did not enjoy the first two, I just never got around to watching the others. I kept up to date with them and the behind the scenes stories but just missed out on the films. However, I recently saw an advert for Hobbs and Shaw and me and Shell fancy seeing that, so thought I better play a bit of catch up.
The problem is I now have to go back and watch all of the rest of the films as I bliming well-loved this one. It is the perfect blend of action and humour with quality actors springing up everywhere and a fantastic script.
Vin Diesel is too cool for school, Dwayne Johnson is incredibly funny and charismatic, Jason Statham is wickedly crazy eyed and casually psychotic, Michelle Rodriguez is amazingly stylish and hard as nails, Charlize Theron is an awesome villain, really freaking menacing and evil. Tyrese Gibson is hysterical and delivers his one-liners with expert comedy timing. And that's before we have Ludicris, Nathalie Emmanuel, Scott Eastwood, Kristofer Hivju (my favourite Game of Thrones Actor) and the legendary Kurt Russell.
Also, the nod and honour to Paul Walker's character Brian is nicely done. You can see from all that they do and say, the FF is family and it makes you want to be a part of it as well.
I am not going to go on too much about this film as I simply loved it but I will say that the fight scene with Jason Statham holding the baby is probably one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen, and definitely the funniest fight scenes.

When acting royalty, in the shape of Dame Helen Mirren are uncredited, you have to question why. Given the script, it was never going to win her another Oscar . The car stunts try to out do the previous seven films, with big explosions and a seemingly unlimited number of crashing cars. Yet compared to the previous films, the street racing and precision driving that made the previous films so enjoyable has been replaced with Dwayne Johnson coaching little league soccer and my favourite character: baby Toretto (James Ayoub/Carlos De La Hoz), who totally upstages Jason Statham - who is in competition with Tyrese Gibson for the most amusing scene - without speaking a single word.
The film is a bunch of set pieces, with a bit of story to tie them together; cliches of being able to avoid any injuries while facing an army of heavy fire or wrecking a city with technology that would make Elon Musk jealous and just walking away.Charlize Theron makes for a decent foe, though for all her apparent power and infamy, her execution leaves a lot to be desired, as well as enough room for the usual array of supped up muscle cars to drive all over and through it.
While Kurt Russell reprises his role as Mr Nobody, basically taking the role of trying to direct the super egos by being secretive/mysterious and cool at the same time.Whether the next film in the series has Dom's nitrous boosted stallion sporting ISO fix seats, I don't know.

186,bellab1972,Simply aimed at 'idiots'!,1,17 April 2017,"I was a huge fan of The Fast and the Furious as I love cars and don't mind stupid story lines. The essence of the original movie was lost long ago. I won't bother going into details about the actual story because by now most people know what it's about and to be honest, doesn't really matter. It bothers me when so many stupid movies are being made and are actually making money because people's expectations are so low! Like other sequels, the producers can release really stupid movies and make absolutely no effort to improve on the original and ruin the franchise. Transformers is a prime example! It's not that hard to make a great 'car movie' but when they don't even bother following the laws of physics and have cars flying and doing the impossible, this insults the viewer! People excuse the ridiculous stunts saying it's not suppose to be real life but it is suppose to be semi realistic and on earth where gravity exists! I shake my head in derision at such insulting stunts. But, with these movies making money, viewers standards are non existent as long as there is are tough guys and fast beautiful cars. Producers will continue to make terrible movies when the publics standards are so low. We could send a message to the movie industry that we do have brains and to not insult us with such impossible stunts, but maybe people are that stupid! I know it's just my opinion but wouldn't stunts that are possible be more exciting and more enjoyable to watch! I really don't understand the appeal of fantasy stunts as opposed to highly skilled realistic stunts.",The Fate of the Furious
187,Oberrated,Another outrageous outing by the Fast crew,6,15 April 2017,"I've over being excited for these films and expecting to be blown away or at least thoroughly enjoying the film in its entirety. It has gone to a point where its juvenile antics and over-the-top story lines are for pure entertainment and nothing else.With that being said, as expected, ""The Fate of the Furious"" delivers more outrageous story lines, mega unrealistic sequences like old school taxis and soccer mom vans being hijacked through hacked computer systems, and a street racing team that somehow has the skills and capabilities to combat government trained personnel and international crime syndicates.Granted, the film does what it intends to do and I can't deny it wasn't entertaining. I caught myself laughing at multiple points of the film. Especially with the likes of The Rock, Ludicrous, and Tyrese Gibson.With outrageous action scenes, the standard crazy car stunts, and personalities most people love; ""The Fate of the Furious"" is sure to do well in the box office regardless of how extreme this series has gotten from the early days.-- Oberrated.com --",The Fate of the Furious
188,eparazak,The F&F Crew is back!,8,29 April 2017,"The Fate of the Furious is the latest installment to the Fast and Furious Franchise and it takes place during the honeymoon of Letty and Dominic played by Vin Diesel. Dominic is encouraged to join the opposing side by a woman named Cipher and it is up to the Fast and Furious crew to put an end to their work with him on board.I'm not going to lie, I found it hard to keep up with the plot of the previous Fast and Furious installment because I wasn't necessarily familiar with the first 5 installments. This is a series which you need to watch the movies in order in order to understand what is going on.For the most part with this movie, keeping up with it wasn't that difficult. The movie mostly doesn't seem to alienate itself with casual viewers. Sure there were some story elements from older films that did return, but I didn't find them to be too distracting. Dom's motivations for joining the opposing side feel believable as the movie continues, even if they are a bit generic. If I did have to find some flaws with the story, it's that I thought a few parts weren't explained very well and brought some confusion. Either way, I found the story oddly engaging.The movie was a lot more action packed, as there was a lot more to work with compared to the previous. Furious 7's action took place in cities and the mountains. This movie's action on the other hand, was done so much better. Not only do the locations work to their advantage, but the execution was done in an oddly creative way. For example, one of the action scenes involves the use of automated cars and the way they use them makes that scene highly engaging.Overall, I really enjoyed Fate of thee Furious. I found the story pretty good and the action to be highly engaging. Even if the movie does get a bit cliché at some points, it's still a very good installment to the franchise; I recommend checking it out if you can!",The Fate of the Furious

191,jay-techie2007,Third best of the franchise - goes overboard with the action but great entertainment,8,19 April 2017,"This is probably the third best movie of the franchise, behind Fast & Furious 6 and Fast Five. It is a half suspense half thriller with some new stuff in terms of action sequences which were conceptualized very well - right from the initial race in Cuba till the climax in Russia. While the story isn't so powerful or innovative, the amazing direction was able to juice out all the entertainment value. Story (7/10): The trailer itself revealed that the story is about Dom turning rogue and until about half the story, it remains a mystery. The team, who had been dealing with drug dealers, international criminals, tanks, and missiles - have a larger nemesis now - nuclear weapons and terrorists. And not just they have to stop them without Dominic Toretto, they have to stop Dominic Toretto as well along with those terrorists. While the suspense was revealed half way down the movie, the story didn't lose the steam and unpredictability. The intricacies of the story were very well written and the edge of the seat action scenes keeps you glued. The positive shade given to Jason Statham's character was good to see - he isn't so good playing negative roles. There were few unnecessary stuff that, if avoided, could have made the movie much better - like the cat fight between Hobbs and Deckard Shaw. The animosity between Hobbs and Shaw just wasn't convincing enough and the kind of street fight, the trailer promised, didn't come up at all. Acting (8/10): The movie has strong performances, particularly from Vin Diesel and Charlize Theron. The rest of the crew did pretty much the same level of performance as earlier. I would have loved to see more of Michelle Rodriguez though. The comic content, except for Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham scenes, is well executed and fun to watch. Direction (9/10): For someone who has worked with Vin Diesel, Charlize Theron and Jason Statham, it wasn't a wonder to see him getting the most out of the cast. Gary Gray executed the movie very well, especially with the car sequences which were very well conceptualized - the Cuba race, the NYC madness or the submarine climax. Although he did go a little overboard with beyond belief scenes which didn't make sense but then it's FF, so it may be excused. Overall, the direction was good and had the entertainment value it should have. Adding the element of Shaw's mother was cool!! Overall (8/10): Overall, it's a good watch. Not as perfect as Fast Five or Fast & Furious 6 but good enough.",The Fate of the Furious

There is only one race scene in the entire movie. There are no other racing scenes. Now our guys quit the race and started chasing bad guys in secret missions like government agents. It doesn't seem like the old air. Already in this movie, Brian's absence is immediately felt. When it comes to Fast and Furious, the first crazy blonde boy comes to mind is Brian. I wish they had brought back Brian's character with the technology they used in the seventh movie. I think the audience accepts this.If we talk about action, there was no action missing in any Fast and Furious movies, and there was more action in this movie. Adrenaline hardly ever came down from its climax. The movie is very fluent in every aspect, you can watch it on the screen without even taking a minute. The fiction and effects are amazing. The effects are so good that they are very realistic.That speech that Hopps made on the scene where he first appeared really causes the audience to laugh.

195,dineshaishu,The fate of the furious,10,29 July 2019,"Now, ""Fast and Furious"" is more like a Brazilian soap opera, where everyone knows each other and addresses names. After the death of Paul Walker, many, and I among them, thought that the film would be the last, but not the same. Producers and creators do not want to kill a chicken carrying golden eggs. Each film of the franchise brought a good cash and there was no rating below the seven. I watched this movie and I'm ready to share my impressions of the view and thoughts on this matter.The plot of this film will lead our heroes to the most ill-fated places in the world: from Havana to New York and this time it is necessary to prevent the capture of the world from the charming and pretty hackershee with the pretentiousness and intelligence of the Joker, who talks about world domination and total control with philosophy on the verge of insanity. The action goes on increasing and reaches the boiling point at the time of betrayal, the team faced the most dangerous enemy, with its ideological leader. Not everyone can immediately understand what Dominic saw in that smartphone that immediately stepped on the dark side of the force. The main tie for the drama of the film is family values, which I welcome in any form and let the plot be compared with a soap opera, this is a new generation opera with steep wheelbarrows, well-chased pursuits with dashing tricks, bright and colorful explosions.A separate article should mention the humor of the picture, built on the recklessness and absurdity of some decisions like rain in fifty cars from the window of a shopping center or ""Niva"" in the Atlantic Ocean with a submarine. While you are in the cinema your mind does not want to think about the logic and unreality of some tricks and phenomena, perceiving everything as a popcorn blockbuster with an element of situational humor and absurdity, especially well in the verbal skirmishes of Dékard Shaw and Luke Hobbs, in prison they are each other simply they continue to complain and they are no better, but it's so ridiculous! The main humorist was Roman Pierce. As before, he always sticks in curious situations, not without a caustic commentary and in itself he is a good comedian. It seems to me in my new capacity as the franchise organically exists and is fully capable to please the eye, if it does not think about the story logic and violations of the laws of physics, the eyes and the brain in such films have a rest, but here it seems to me the strongest concentration of the humor in the whole franchise and this share of self-irony and banter smoothes not all but many roughness, which for me personally is a good plus. The picture does not stint on the visual beauty and assembly, especially would like to mention that our localizers even translated the names of cities visited by the characters, and that's the solution when mounting the sea white reads ""Havana. Cuba ""seems to me a good decision, plus I will note the camera and composer work. Why do I evaluate them in a single segment, because often when we see a beautiful landscape picture, or just kinds of beautiful female beauty always comes music and some tunes well as memorable, and the camera in the moment of the explosion, chases and fights pulls out a general plan good angles , helping us to see in detail the environment or just enjoy the action.Actor's work is not bad. Vin Diesel throughout his career earned three images with which he is associated: Dominique Toretto, Xander Cage and Riddick. Recently released a third film about the agent ""Three X"" and something he did not particularly like, the top five. Here he plays as if this is what he is, at the same time is the producer of the franchise from the fourth film. In our dubbing he speaks with the voice of Sergei Chonishvili, a strong dubbing actor with many roles in our cinema. Dwayne Johnson, once known as ""Rock"", wins Hobbs well.

196,OlieRendch,A satisfactory entry into the franchise with great one-liners and OTT stunts.,7,21 April 2017,"I do not enjoy films where over-the-top characters spout out cheesy lines after committing some physics-defying act for a generic plot. So why is it then, that every time I sit and watch a Fast & Furious movie, I come out with a great smile on my face from an utterly enjoyable time? The Fate of the Furious is no different and I never expected anything less. Vin Diesel returns as Dominic Toretto leading his team of multi-cultural criminals along with government guy Dwayne Johnson but this time Toretto has seemingly turned on his friends and is now working with a mysterious baddie.The cast, of course, is great. Diesel is on top form in his role as he has been for over a decade. Some of his other films don't do as well but this franchise makes up for it and it's a joy to revisit his unique delivery of lines. Johnson, again, is always a pleasure; he seems like a real nice guy in real life and his characters are always a bonus to a film, and in this case, Luke Hobbs, has some great one-liners which no doubt were the cause of some outtakes due to others cracking up. His verbal sparring partner here is Jason Statham returning from the previous film and he is the epitome of an over-the-top action star so putting him in this franchise was a genius move. The rest of the team were absolutely fine as well; Michelle Rodrigues and Ludicrous are as good as they ever are; Tyrese Gibson is the same too, I don't particular find his humor funny but he is a staple of the franchise and so I'm glad he's in it despite his cringy jokes. Kurt Russell returns from Furious 7 and once again plays the shady government agent Mr. Nobody, and he does it pretty well. Nathalie Emmanuel also comes back but I really didn't see a need for her character; she seemed very pointless. The actress does great in the role but there isn't really a role other than someone the Tej character can relate to and then sit in the passenger seat during car chases.As far as cars go, The Fate of the Furious gives us some great car action, from the very first one in Cuba to the ludicrously horrifying chase in New York. I don't think the stunts were as impressive as the previous ones, such as jumping through buildings or dragging a safe through Brazil, but it has satisfactory action pieces, especially towards the end. As far as plot goes, it's fine for this sort of film; there was a twist of sorts which took me while to get used to and will have to see where it goes but ultimately the Charlize Theron story was engaging enough but not wildly original.The Fate of the Furious was another satisfactory entry into the Fast & Furious series and even though it had the absence of Paul Walker, due to terrible circumstances, I didn't feel the film suffered from it. I think I prefer Fast Five and Furious 7 over this, making it as good as Fast & Furious 6, in my opinion, but in the end, I'm always going to enjoy Vin Diesel using some special nitro to win a race to the soundtrack of the current popular electronic music.",The Fate of the Furious

198,ryanskywalker-87402,The fate of the furiosa,7,22 April 2017,"With eight movies, two short films, theme park attractions, video games and 16 years of history, The Fast and The Furious is undeniably one of the most important action franchises of all time, together with James Bond and Mission Impossible.The story of this franchise has become very similar to that of a soap opera, with characters dying and coming back, allegiances broken and rivalries settled. As you might imagine, it is very dumb, with dramatic moments that sound silly due to an overly serious script filled with pathos, and intentionally and unintentionally hilarious lines and moments that made the entire audience laugh (courtesy of Tyrese Gibson, the unofficial comic relief).The returning cast fits well into their shoes and their chemistry is as explosive as always. The (alleged) feud between Dwayne and Vin can be felt on screen, especially in the lack of screen time that the two share. Thankfully, the duo Johnson-Statham was great to watch, and the latter is easily the MVP in the cast: not only does he have the most memorable scenes (a prison riot near the beginning, and a humorous fight scene on an airplane), but he also carries the most charisma. Who was really disappointing here (due more to the script than her) is Charlize Theron: a badass as Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road, here she has jack to do, playing a villain part Boris Grishenko from Goldeneye and part Blofeld that is very underwhelming.Let's stop talking about the story and acting, something that no one cares about when watching one of these movies. All you care about is the action, and I am very happy to say that it was great here. Even though I am not the biggest fan of the franchise and I would not know how to rank them, this is easily among my favorites for one simple reason: the pacing. All of the other movies have some tediously boring scenes of dialogue that do not move the story forward, making you feel the weight of the long runtime. This time around, there is plenty of action, the dialogues are light, and the tight editing makes the 136 minutes runtime feel much shorter.Overall, The Fate of the Furious is a solid entry in an action franchise that keeps getting bigger and more fun. While the story is not as smart as it thinks it is, the overall product is so enjoyable and fun to watch that I have to recommend it to fans of the genre and franchise. Judging by its record-breaking opening weekend, you have probably already seen it.",The Fate of the Furious

204,Eric266,Losing Touch with Reality,5,26 February 2018,"First off, let me say, I like these movies. The action and stunts are great (albeit a bit too CGI for my tastes) and the characters are likeable. But lets face it, these movies went off the rail of reality about two movies ago. It started with the Road Runner-like CGI stunts of Fast Six. The tank chase scene and Dom flying through the air to catch Letty in midair and crash into an oncoming windshield just defied logic. In the theater, my stepson, who adores these movies, said out loud, ""Did that really just happen?"" Fast 8 is another revenge plot where the always lovely Charlize Theron plays a villain who is the mastermind behind the villain from the 6th movie (played by Luke Wilson). She blackmails Dom into helping her capture a nuke so she can...well, I'm not really sure what she was planning to do with the nuke. I was too busy laughing at the insane stunts. Joining Dom's old crew is Jason Statham, who you remember was the villain in Fast 7 where he was seeking revenge for the way Dom and his mates treated his younger brother, the aforementioned Luke Evans. Statham's Deckerd Shaw is welcomed aboard the team despite the fact he killed Han at the end of Fast 6...or was it Fast 3...actually its both now that I think about it.The movie moves at a very crisp pace and you can't spend a lot of time thinking about the plot holes and the insanity or the lack of realism. The Rock's byplay with Statham is funny and I could really see them doing a spinoff together. Again, Shaw killed Dom's friend, so it would make more sense for him to work with Hobbs than with Dom and his crew.The absense of Paul Walker is not as big of a detriment as I expected. His character is mentioned a couple of times, which was a nice touch. However, the addition of Clint Eastwood's son, Scott, is a nice surprise. Scott and Paul Walker were good friends and shared a love of cars, so it kind of makes sense that an actor so close to Walker should step into the ""whitebread"" role. Eastwood's character even starts out as a law enforcement rube, just like Walker's character, Brian. Eastwood did a nice job in the role and I hope he continues in the next couple entries.Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson have pretty much played out their characters two movies ago. Gibson especially is annoying as all he does is complain and scream during the action sequences. Nathalie Emmanuel, while lovely to look at, has almost no reason to be in the movie. All her character's actions and dialogue could have been given to Ludacris. She was utterly wasted and that is a shame as she is so good on Game of Thrones. Speaking of GoT, Kristofer Hivfu, better known as Tormund to GoT fans, shows up as little more than someone for Dom to fight. The final insult was the poor use of Elsa Pataky's character, Elena. She is one of my favorite characters in the series (I wish Dom had picked her and dumped Michelle Rodriguez's Letty) and her role in this movie did such injustice to her as an actress and a character. That is the biggest sin of this movie, in my opinion.While I felt this movie missed the mark and the series has completely jettisoned the good will built up by the first 4 entries, it was still fun. Sometimes, mindless action movies are just what you need.As a side note, if you want to see a funny spoof of this series, look for ""Superfast"" on Netflix. Its funny when you compare it to the actual series.",The Fate of the Furious
205,FabledGentleman,Alpha male vs Alpha male,6,11 April 2017,"Never betray your family, or there will be hell to pay. Vin Diesel, how could you? How could you turn on your own family? How could you be so mean and thoughtless? Was all we ever did in the first seven movies for nothing? How could you Vin? How could you....This is about as intelligent as story goes in this movie, but i guess most people these days don't go to see a furious movie, to then walk out a much smarter person. We kinda know what we are getting into, this is going to be all about speed, guns and explosions.So, how did this movie do in those regards? First off, let me just get this off my chest; I guess that furious films once upon a time was about cars, now they aren't really that much about cars anymore, the story in the next film will probably be in planetary orbit. The cars in this film, as in the previous film, is mostly there to create momentum; This is a film that wants to cruise in top speed to the finish line, and never look back, so we better buckle up for a 2 hour high octane action ride.When a movie doesn't have much acting and story to lean on, what can a film contain to become great? It is possible to make quite good films by utilizing the rest of what you got in a proper way. In this case the action scenes, the CGI, the music score, the directing, cinematography etc.So how did it do?Well. To begin with this movie is packed with ridiculous scenes just like you would expect, and if you can accept flying cars in the previous film you can also accept most the stuff that happens in this film, it's not about realism, to say gently. As a comparison it's not much realism in the superhero films these days either, we can accept some over the top films, for pure entertainment.But as entertaining as this film is at times, it has it's flaws. First off it actually feels smaller in scale than the previous film. F. Gary Gray seem to want to tell a deeper story in the midst of all this, rather than just push the envelope further than before. It might be that Gray simply do not posses the same skills filming action scenes as James Wan and Justin Lin; But Gray enhances other aspects of the film instead.The CGI is not award winning material, but it holds up for most of the movie, but it's also weak at times, especially in a scene where Charlize Theron controls hundreds of cars and steer them like a herd of raging bulls down narrow pathways.Speaking of Charlize, she is probably the best performer in this film, she underplays her role to an extent she becomes really scary, and i loved that, there is just no telling what she is up to next. The other actors pretty much delivers the exact same performances you have already seen so many times before, once again. but a minor plus to Dwayne, he can be so awesome if he really wants to.The best parts of this film are really good actually, but the worst parts are pretty bad and drags down the feel of the entire film, i did expect a little bit more to be honest, maybe just a little more work on the CGI, maybe just a tiny bit better acting, just some small tweaks to the story to make it flow better. The entire experience you get from watching a film often comes down to the small details. In the end this movie is about an Alpha male that fights another Alpha male.As a conclusion, it's at times a damn fun way to spend a couple of hours, that's for sure, but it's not better than the previous film, and it's not revolutionary in any way, it's basically the same recipe cooked at lower temperatures. None the less, a spectacular display.6/10 - Fair",The Fate of the Furious
206,oazam,Only for entertainment purposes.,6,15 April 2017,"I have been a fan of FF trilogy including Tokyo Drift which was a spin off. The trailer of this movie was a bit mediocre making me think that the plot would just be too predictable and honestly after watching this movie, the story couldn't do any justice to the film.So basically Dom and Letty are honeymooning in Cuba and having a time of their life. After a street race, he approaches a woman who needs help with her car and reveals the realness in her as a cyberterrorist that goes by the name of Cipher who blackmails Dom into working against his allies known as his ""family"". During an infiltration in Germany to steal an EMP device lead by his team, he crashes Hobbs' vehicle into the military compound and steals the device and flees by entering Cipher's plane. Dom's actions gets Hobbs' arrested and sent to prison where he encounters Deckard. Now that is where Mr. Nobody comes to the rescue by hacking into the prison server and create a riot to get Hobbs' and Shaw out. What the team does by involving Shaw to capture Dom and the reason behind Toretto's betrayal is basically what this film is all about.Compared to other movies in the trilogy, this one is very average at best. But there are positives that makes it a worthy weekend watch.The writing in this movie was bleak as if Michael Bay was directing this. Action films follow a very unique pattern. When action sequences come in the way, there is basically no space for a proper story and dialogues executed by actors and actresses. This film managed to accomplish that by putting more action than an actual story that was written by Chris Morgan who basically wrote majority of the films in the trilogy. F Gary Grey's direction was horrible. He was good in directing Straight Outta Compton but this time his angles were very sloppy and whoever did the editing of this movie, please find another hobby because the way the VFX and CGI effects were executed kinda felt like watching a Bollywood movie.The acting was average. Vin Diesel basically acts like how he really does because the punching factors shown in him are a bit cold and not too warm but did keep me engaged during some parts of the film. Michelle Rodriguez was just there and she really couldn't do a lot of justice to the film that I was frankly expecting. Charlize Theron was decent and I did like her energetic performance but she was like a mannequin with her dialogues in the film and the cringe-worthy climax came from her. Rock and Shaw had the same acting chops and both of them kept me satisfied with their rough punches. SpEmmanuel, Ludicrous, and Gibson were also pretty good as usual and funny and techie a the same time.The highlights in the movie were the budgetary and action factors of this film. The action sequences were executed beautifully like the smart car hack, the plane fight, and the ironic prison fight but like I said, it wasn't shot nicely but these sequences will keep your to the edge of your seat and your popcorn too. The budget will face its overpower from the Box Office but I really feel it won't reach the Billion Dollar Mark due to its less hype around for the film.Overall, this movie is just an average movie with mediocre direction and writing especially performances. But based on the action sequences, I would definitely recommend Fate of the Furious on a one- time watch quotient.2.5/5- Less action more story please.",The Fate of the Furious
207,jasonmichaeldickinson,Family No More,2,25 June 2021,The Fate Of The Furious let's get in how bad this movie was the story and plot was awful again the acting in this one was bad this is the worst entry in The Fast & Furious Series.,The Fate of the Furious
208,bodhi-13262,My FATE is my own.,6,12 May 2017,"'The Fate of the Furious' is the exhausting 8th entry of the prolonged series of criminal street racers turned super spies. Undeniably, this series has an enormous following since 2001, but after sixteen years on the streets, are these films finally running on empty?1. The plot really isn't anything special to say the least. The film starts off with Dominic (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) enjoying their honeymoon in Cuba. However, nothing good lasts forever - enter Charlize Theron, who plays the mysterious 'Cipher' who almost immediately blackmails Dom with a serious yet unknown leverage that is revealed later in the film. No time is wasted as we are thrust into the fast-paced action. From the trailers it's clear that Dom betrays his team due to his reluctant affiliation with Cipher, but anyone with a brain-stem knows that that's something which hits a dead end lol.2. F. Gary Gray has done some very entertaining and captivating films in the past, but it seems no matter the director, this series seems to follow a specific pattern at this point. Not that it's a huge complaint, but since the 4th film, the style of action seems to repeat itself even into this one. I give credit for how inventive the action and set-pieces are, but yet again, the film-makers can't help themselves but push things way over the top. The last action sequence in particular where the team travels to icy Russia to face Cipher and Dom in the final showdown, is where I drew the line of sheer belief. Words can't even begin to describe the pain.3. If there was to be a comparison between this and the 'Mission:Impossible' films, I'd follow Tom Cruise any day. I can't believe I'd see the day when Tom Cruise's death-defying stunts would be more plausible that Vin Diesel and The Rock's. The underlying story of 'Family' is still beating like a heart without a body. For someone who was with this theme since it's inception, I'm utterly tired of these film constantly cramming down my throat the importance of family. Even though he wasn't the greatest of actors, Paul Walker really did bring some kind of balance especially with his story and background.4. I gave 'Furious 7' a pass because it was in essence a farewell to Walker, although I enjoyed this one just an inch more. There should have been a new running theme in this film and left the family matters in the previous since it ended on such a perfect and emotional note. I know it's been said before, but Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson are more of the outstanding characters as far as performances go. Charlize Theron does bring a fresh take for a female villain, but her role isn't as large as one might think. Vin Diesel and the rest of the cast don't really bring anything new as they play their respective roles as one-note as possible.If you're an action and car junkie, then this is the movie for you. It's fast, it's loud and with as many close-up shots of women's butts as possible. Have at it.",The Fate of the Furious
209,scottingram,Fast & Furious 8 Film Review,9,16 April 2017,"The new action film Fast & Furious 8 in the 8th film in The Fast & The Furious franchise starring Vin Diesel, The Rock Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Scott Eastwood, Michelle Rodriguez, Charlize Theron, Kurt Russell, Helen Mirren, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous.In Fast & Furious 8 now that Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (American actor Vin Diesel - Pitch Black, XXX films) and Letty (American actress Michelle Rodriguez - Machete films, S.W.A.T.) are on their honeymoon and Brian and Mia have retired from the game—and the rest of the crew has been exonerated—the globetrotting team has found a semblance of a normal life.

210,Students_SimoneVeil,The best movie of the saga Fast & Furious!,10,10 January 2019,"The story talks about Dominic Toretto (a illegal racer car)and his family. He must quit his family and work for a cyber terrorist for save his son. Now his family is his enemy. In my opinion, Fast & Furious 8 is the best film of the saga Fast & Furious. Even if there is less racing car the movie is great. From the beginning we are immersed in the atmosphere. This movie is action-packed and the action scenes are spectacular. Even if the story original, I love this movie. This movie is just excellent.
If you like action movies and cars, you must watch this movie.",The Fate of the Furious

Unnecessary but fun movie.",The Fate of the Furious
212,ellimic,not a bad film but I don't think it was worthy of the previous 6,7,17 December 2017,"I enjoyed the film and thought it was a good storyline - how they linked it to the past two films when Dom and his team had unknowingly disrupted Ciphers plans.
It was however against everything Vin Diesel had shown Dom to be when he just cold-heartedly turn on his team, and his wife. I could see his reasoning, it has been made clear that the family thing is important to Dom, but how he cold turn like that seemed unlikely. And how the team rallied to his side at the end seemed suspect, like they suddenly forgot he had been a dick?I thought how Dom named the child Brian was nice tribute to Paul Walker.",The Fate of the Furious

It is mind-blowing!Edit: I rated each one of them the way I feel deserved it. That is how entertaining it was. They were all great. Some might not like it because the stunts are ridiculous or not possible, or because the story line was not great.The review for this, Fast and Furious 8, would be that it was great and entertaining. The story line was great. You get to see so many action scenes and stunts from so many of these actors.",The Fate of the Furious
215,ahmetkozan,"Fast, Furious and Emotional...",7,21 April 2017,"The Fast and the Furious series began as a simple street adventure. He also loved this movie, which loves Need for Speed. The film has turned into one of the longest running series of movie theaters. It is necessary to make another addition to the new Fast and Furious films with the loss of an unfortunate traffic accident during the filming of former actor Paul Walker; Fast, Furious and Emotional...Here's our thing; We have a very nice and poisonous cyber agent, played by Charlize Theron, aiming at launching a 3rd World War who is abducted by the Russian nuclear submarine and who does not know what to do and creating an environment of chaos. Dominic Toretto joins her own army because she knows who will come out. The rest of the team are confused but recover quickly and make Deckard, the bad head of the previous film, a forced partner. The rest is a big fuss and a big car pursuit sequence at the finals.This time, F. Gary Gray... Before the film, it was a question mark for such a big budget, but the business that it reveals deserves applause. He has pulled the fastest and furious part that was drawn up until now. He is also successful in managing the player. He makes Charlize Theron both in love and hate, and Jason Statham is able to combine his ability to create disruptive humor with his fists. Speaking of punches, the film has close combat sequences that require as much choreography as we will see in a Jet Li movie, and these moments are more enthusiastically viewed than the car scenes.Long story short; Fast and Furious 8, a Bond adventure for children of all ages. In warm Cuba it starts among the girls with mini skirts and ends in ice-cold arctic seas. Great budget, great adventure. If you look at the flowing text when the movie is over, you will see that the real heroes are the stunt team. Hollywood owes a lot to these crazy people. Watch the day and then download the soundtrack from Spotify because it is very successful and wait for the 9th movie. 8/10",The Fate of the Furious
216,mts-78680,One of the best ones yet,8,9 May 2017,Definitely action packed and full of speed and hot cars! I really enjoyed this one for all the stunts and even the script was above expected. Must share that most of the scenes don't make much sense but just go with the flow and enjoy it for the entertainment it provides. The chemistry of all the returning characters are an extreme plus! Thought I would miss the characters gone and thought they might have some flashbacks but that would keeps fans in the glory days.

220,jaapeelman,Unbelievable nonsense,5,21 May 2017,"I really do not understand the high score of this movie on IMDb. It is very unrealistic with a very stupid story-line and follows the popular idea in Hollywood that the whole world can be hacked and manipulated by whiz-kids using a computer and doing it all in split seconds. The car-chase in the beginning is nice to watch but off course also very unrealistic and ever seen a car drive even fast in reverse as in forward gear? Yeah, I know one car and that was the dutch DAF who had a special gearbox.... The action in this movie is on the one hand nice to watch but on the other hand impossible. And the movie-makers probably never heard of the fact that a big passenger-aircraft has to fuel now and then and therefore can not be untraceable. But the most stupid thing was with the nuclear sub sitting on steel bars and by just rotating its propeller somehow got in the water.... This movie is only nice for people who believe everything Hollywood is presenting them. If you are not like this: do not watch the whole movie but just the scenes at the end when Jason Statham is in the aircraft with the baby because these are the scenes that are the nicest due to the interaction between Jason and the baby.",The Fate of the Furious
221,MichaelNontonMulu,thrilling action sequence with some funny moments,9,12 April 2017,"Well, as usual after watching a Fast and Furious movie, I was always amazed by how crazy the action stunts in every installment. It was like they tried to make it bigger, better and crazier in each movie. This one is no exception. The action sequences were all there, from the street car racing (which is the movie's unique specialty), the fighting scenes (made even more special with the addition of Jason Statham), and of course the car chase involving sooo many vehicles.In term of story, I think the writers were quite smart to make the story intriguing with the betrayal of Dom to his family. They even made some surprising twists (though they were quite easily guessed by us audiences), nevertheless, kudos for their effort. The most surprising thing about the movie was the amount of funny scenes which I think were quite significant. The moments involving Tyrese Gibson were hilarious and even Jason Statham also had some moments as well. The movie also had some brief appearances and cameos by few characters from previous movies and a new interesting character played by Helen Mirren. I think she would appear in the future installments as well. One thing that I am quite amazed was how smart the people behind the franchise were. They have made the movie evolved again from originally a street car movies, to heist and now more like spy thing. But of course all the ingredients of Fast and Furious were still kept in tact. The special effects of the movie were good, the sound effects should be good (though I did not experience it as I watched it in the studio with normal sound system). I am seriously tempted to watch it again in a cinema with the cool sound system just to re-live the scenes with better sound.My wife and I certainly were entertained by this movie. We had tons of enjoyment from the cool action sequence, the amount of funny moments, and even few of dramatic moments. So if you are looking for another outstanding action movie with all those qualities in this kind of movie, then this one certainly would not disappoint you. But if you are looking for deep conversation type of movie with heavy story line for an action movie with logic, then it may not suit you. Just a reminder that this is a pop corn action movie suitable for thrill action movie seekers like most of us.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",The Fate of the Furious

224,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,Great time at the Cinema!,7,16 April 2017,"The F&F franchise has turned into The Expendables with cars, and like the last film, it gladly embraces its absurd plot and over-the-top action set pieces. It starts off with Dom on his honeymoon in Cuba where he is interrupted by a mysterious woman called 'Cipher' played by Charlize Theron. She forces him to turn against his team in order to do a series of jobs for her taking him from New York to Russia. Theron fits the role perfectly, she is menacing, seductive and manipulative and could play a perfect Bond villain.Just as it threatens to be gloomy, there is some laughs to be had. Dwayne Johnson and the Stath have a good taunting scene where they shout puns at each from their prison cells. But yet again Tyrese Gibson gives us his best improv yet as he constantly pokes fun at everyone including new comer Scott Eastwood. Director F Gray (new comer to the series) has to deal with a lot of characters here. But he still manages to give them some sort of story arc and does a good job at keeping them interesting. Hobbs coaches his daughters football team in his spare time, there's a love triangle going on between Tejj, Roman and Ramsey. Then there's Letty who is trying to figure out why Dom has betrayed them and Jason Stathams villain from the last film is on a path of redemption. Another thing that the franchise does so well is give us some breathtaking stunts with minimal CGI (only when needed). The film doesn't disappoint, some of the standout moments include vehicles being flipped left right and centre, cars being driven out of a buildings, an opening race sequence and wrecking ball scene to name a few. However its not perfect, there is a lot of pointless exposition dialogue to keep us up to date with what is going on. Plot device 'Gods Eye' from Furious 7 comes back which is used against the team. One scene involving Dom hiding from 'Gods Eye' so he can have a cuppa with Helen Mirren is laughable. The laws of physics are non existent of course (but its not a documentary) and it is the most implausible entry of the series yet.Nitpicking aside, don't go into F8 expecting any realism or logic because there is none of it here. Just turn your brain off because its more brawn than brain. Like its predecessors, its filled with exciting, over the top, adrenaline fuelled action thrills; and there's enough harpoon guns to give Batman a run for his money.

Where We're Going We Don't Need Science...,7,14 April 2017,"Fast cars, exotic locales, things go boom, Tyrese Gibson spouts one- liners, family.That's this whole movie in a nutshell. Sound familiar? Well, if you saw Fast 5, Furious 6, and Furious 7, then you've essentially seen Fate of the Furious.But this should come as no surprise to anyone.Universal has hit upon the magic formula for this franchise, and as the last three installments have raked in mounds of cash, they figure if it ain't broke, don't change it.This film is the first film since The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift to be completely devoid of the late Paul Walker. Now, Tokyo Drift is often considered to be the low point in the franchise. Is Fate of the Furious another Tokyo Drift?No, but Paul Walker's absence is sorely missed.This film sees Vin Diesel reprise his role as Dominic Toretto, and as the previews have shown, he has betrayed his family and thrown in his lot with Cipher, the super hacker menacingly portrayed by Charlize Theron.Now, Luke Hobbs must bring the team back together as well as recruit some unlikely allies in order to bring Dom down.Fate of the Furious definitely delivers all of the same thrills that the last three films did: fast cars, beautiful women, and wanton destruction.However, there is no way of getting around the fact that this is the eighth film in the franchise, and the third after the franchise refresh of Fast 5. It can't hide the fact that there is hardly anything new about this film (despite one of the studios behind it being called Original Film).Nevertheless, if all you want is to turn your brain off and enjoy fast cars and things going boom for two hours, this film will deliver.

Gary Gray and in ""Fate of the Furious,"" Toretto turns on his team and goes rogue because he is approached by a woman named Cipher to help her achieve her goal while the rest of Dom's crew seeks out to find out why he went rogue.I'm a fan of the series, not a huge fan though. In fact, I stayed away from these movies for long during my middle school and high school years because these movies were all anyone ever talked about and everyone treated them like they were the greatest things ever made, and in my opinion they're not. I have always thought the first four installments of the series are the weakest, and though I acknowledge that these ARE NOT good movies, they know what they are and really admire ""Fast Five"" for pushing the franchise in another direction. ""Fast Five"" still remains my favorite Fast and Furious film to date. The fifth through eighth films are definitely the four best installments in the series. However I liked ""Fate"" the least out of these four. Does that mean that I didn't think ""Fate"" was entertaining? No, it was. Here are my problems with this film.""Fate"" tries to outdo everything the previous three installments did, and it never reaches that height. It aspires to be something more than what it really is: it tries to be good and clever in too many parts. The wheels this series is built on aren't supposed to be taken seriously. But there were many instances in this film where I felt it was taking itself a lot more seriously than it should, like it was afraid to try and actually be a good movie. I didn't have this problem with the previous three installments. Those movies proved that these movies aren't supposed to be good. They're good ""bad"" movies but they know that. The ""touchy-feely"" scenes in this one one really took away some sense of fun that the last three had. Also, can we just accept the fact that Paul Walker is dead now and that the character of Brian O'Connor has been retired for the rest of the series? There is a scene at the very end of the movie where I was like ""they are still harping on the fact that Paul Walker is dead. That was almost four years ago. Get over it now."" I'm not saying that Paul Walker deserved to die. Yes, it was an unfortunate situation and for the most part I thought ""Furious 7,"" handled that very well. But why do we have to keep bringing up the character's name, and continue to harp on the fact Paul Walker is dead? Can't we just let that go?This film also somewhat disappointed me from a ""ridiculousness"" perspective. Every action scene tries to be clever and inventive, but the only one I thought was really over the top was the one that takes up the entire last third of the movie. That's really it in terms of ridiculousness. I'm not expecting realism from this series. It's a series that definitely defies physics, but compared to ""Furious 7,"" and even the sixth one, i found the action scenes to be a bit of a letdown. The best part of the movie by far, and I Never thought I'd ever say this, is Jason Statham. He wasn't given anything to do in the seventh one, and that was my problem with that. Luckily, they use him to his potential in this installment and his chemistry with The Rock is hilarious. He's definitely the bad guy that you wanna root for even though you don't like him. There's really not much else to say about this film. It's the same thing the past three have been, just not as ridiculous. The fun factor is still there, and I had a good time watching this film, though it may seem my problems I have with the film outweigh the good based on this review. I am going to give ""The Fate Of The Furious"" a 6.9/10",The Fate of the Furious

237,tyingling7766,The Fate of the Furious Review,8,21 April 2017,"So, all the promotional material that anyone has seen for this movie has stated the movies is called The Fate of the Furious. Although, the title card for the movie simply says Fast and Furious 8. I don't know what the actual title is, but it doesn't change the movie. Here's what I thought.Synopsis: Now that Dom and Letty are on their honeymoon and Brian and Mia have retired from the game-and the rest of the crew has been exonerated-the globetrotting team has found a semblance of a normal life. But when a mysterious woman seduces Dom into the world of crime he can't seem to escape and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before. From the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, the elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the world's stage... and to bring home the man who made them a family. Starring: Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Charlize Theron, Kurt Russell, Scott Eastwood Director: F. Gary GreyThe movies have steadily been getting better since the fiasco of Tokyo Drift. I do have to say, this one took a small step back. It is still an exceptional movie, but it wasn't as good as seven with the sentimental value or five with the all-around great movie.And by the way, the mention I just used is all you're going to get about the Paul Walker situation. They did a good job of keeping the characters involved with him out of the movie.I do have say, the only thing I didn't like about the movie was the lack of story here. You didn't find out what Cipher was doing until the movie was almost over. And, if you remember the end of six where there were two major action scenes within twenty minutes of each other, it happened here as well. Maybe if they had about another twenty to thirty minutes of movie they could have added more.As far as the story of the family goes here, it was okay. Sure, you had a few more people added to the movie, but that's okay. Kind of had to happen, although I don't think two of them are going to be part of the family come FF10. All the actors did step up their game a bit for this movie. They showed why they want to keep the franchise going. Scott Eastwood coming in was okay. He didn't really show anything different, but apparently he is supposed to become more centralized in the next movie.Bringing in a new director did give the movie a since of something different. We pretty much had the same director for the last four movies. Grey offered a different point of view on the action here. Did I like it? It was okay. He used a lot of jump cuts and close- combat camera methods. I'm not a fan of those, but I'll still watch the movie.The main selling point of the movie was the cars and the action. Neither one disappointed in the end. There were several parts in the movie where the action was some of the best in the series (see the plane scene at the end), and some of the best cars in the movie, well at least one. And that one didn't even race. You saw it drive at the beginning of the movie. The '63 Impala was just gorgeous.Final Thoughts: Definitely in the top three of the series so far. Go watch the movie. I think watching it on IMAX did give more of an advantage. Again, watch it.Rating: 8 out of 10That's it for me folks. If you would like to continue to follow my post, go ahead and like this page.

239,nandidot,Absurd and Outrageous Fun,8,15 April 2017,"Do you remember eating Pop Rocks as a kid? The popping candy that created a fizzy sensation in your mouth as it dissolved was more about fun than taste. 'The Fate of the Furious' reminded me of that long forgotten candy. The 8th film in the Fast & Furious series arrives in theatres this weekend with much hype and a billion dollar movie behind it. Many, myself included, thought the series should have ended with number 7. The death of a beloved star, the emotional quotient, and an adrenaline filled plot took the story to new heights and it looked like the series would end on a high. But, of course not. You don't walk away from a money making machine. You milk it for all its worth. And as it turns out, there's some juice left in the franchise still.Dominic Toretto, lead star Vin Diesel, betrays his family and everything he stands for when he walks away from his life to work for the evil genius, Cipher (ingeniously portrayed by Charlize Theron). Together they steal nuclear codes and destroy cities while Dom's team, which now includes a previous villain- Deckard Shaw, hunts him down across the globe. Why has Dom gone rogue? Well, you'll see the answer coming from a mile away but watch the movie anyway.The plot isn't innovative, in fact it's the weakest one from the last 3 films, but fans won't care too much. The cars are faster, the stunts more unbelievable, world domination seems to be a finger click away, and stars still display their muscles more than their acting chops. The reason this series works is because it embraces the over the top, outrageous fun. It doesn't shy away from doing the impossible (read: unbelievable). Take the sequence in New York, for example, which is absurd but wildly imaginative. Keep the crazy alive, team.The cast is an ensemble of stars led by Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, and Jason Statham. Not one can suggest acting skills as their claim to fame. The franchise needs stars, though, the more you can overstuff the better. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the ample screen time given to Charlize Theron's Cipher. I enjoyed watching her cause chaos without doing much actual heavy lifting. Most villains bash their way through the narrative; she smiles and presses a key. Refreshing!The Fate of the Furious is not nearly as good at Fast Five or Furious Seven. 5 reinvented the franchise and 7 was an emotional roller-coaster yet F8 still provides decent fuel to an already raging series. There is a distinct lack of emotional connect and a Paul Walker sized hole in the plot but if fun is what you're looking to have at the movies, you won't be disappointed. I was entertained. Bring on 9 and 10, let's see how far this can go.https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com",The Fate of the Furious
240,spewy29167,Popcorn munching brainwash for intellectual Pygmies,1,15 April 2017,"Lets make a movie, we'll have cars and babes. Wooden acting and stunts completely impossible, without even a shred of plausibility. Most of the males are super alpha and have comic book hero strength. Any excuse for a car chase is ham-fistedly woven into the already weak story for any opportunity. The acting is cringe-inducingly cheesy.Cars are a polluting waste of space and resources that kill every day that should be used sparingly and not celebrated. This film is everything that is wrong with modern culture.",The Fate of the Furious
241,makka-00955,Suspend your disbelief and it's enjoyable,6,29 June 2017,"Believe it or not, I've never seen any of the other movies in the franchise. The concept and always struck me as being a lot of car-chases and cars crashing and it never appealed to me. Having seen this latest installment, my suspicions were entirely correct. It's action-packed, stunt ridden and fast-paced, but the script is limited. Nothing wrong with the acting, save Helen Mirren's appalling Cockney accent, but it was littered with cheesy moments. What I found odd was Jason Statham occasionally forgetting which accent he was doing; he's a one-trick pony and limited in acting range, to Cockney and American Cockney. I'd wager that his voice would never get above a whisper if you were to set him on fire. I realise this is a movie not to take too seriously, but some of the stunts and action sequences were about as far-fetched as it gets. Strip the movie of the stunts and you don't have a lot of substance. Here's an abridged version of events: Vin Deisel is forced to go rogue after a hacker holds his baby and it's mother hostage, said team-mates try to stop them before they create World War three. Along the way, two suits provide them with a neverending supply of high-end cars - because that's what the feds do (apparently). The Rock and his friends try to smash them to pieces. What's crazy about that concept? There are two computer systems, which enable both sides to break into and control everything on the planet, with little more than two seconds of tapping on the keyboard. Kurt Russell plays the fed in charge, he must be scraping the barrel these days, as must Charlize Theron, playing the hacker, Cipher. A watchable romp if you can switch off your disbelief for two hours. The Rock and Vin Deisel spend the whole movie trying to be more manly than the other, but the Rock has now more credibility and some range, whereas Vin Deisel makes Matt Damon look animated. A bowl of soup could out-act Vin Deisel. I don't have to give away the ending because it's ever so slightly obvious.",The Fate of the Furious

Everything is just terrible, I honestly don't know why I had the endurance to watch this to end. I literally had to stop thinking for more than two hours to endure this train wreck of a movie. Everything is just terrible, the dialogue, the acting, the story, plot holes so big you could drive a truck, no, a convoy of trucks through. I can't believe people are paying to watch this and even like it. The day they stop making movies for this franchise will be a very happy day for me. 1/10",The Fate of the Furious
243,infoalwaysacritic,8 Times the Charm... With half the one-liners,8,3 May 2017,"The 7th instalment of the fast and the furious was a mangasmic fantasy film with so many one-liners that the writers wore out the period button on their keyboards. Some lessons appear to have been learned along the way and while the plot line of the 8th film resembles something concocted by a pair of schoolboys playing with their dinky cars in the playground, it succeeds at many things that the previous films lacked.Anyone who has followed the films knows that Dom is all about family - or his open definition of the word, and so this film plays off of the shocking behaviour of a man turning his back on family. Unlike previous films that clumsily toyed with the concept, Fate of the Furious manages to deliver an emotionally charged story with a better- than-class script and action that doesn't take itself too seriously. You'll still scratch your head at the preposterous nature of some of the circumstances the characters find themselves in, but this is part of the charm for someone who likes these movies.If you follow the F&F movies for action, you'll find just as much here as in the past movies. You'll be treated to explosions, car crashes, missiles, gun fights and a lot of choreographed fist fights. Shaw (Jason Statham) returns to virtually steal the show with his blend of humour and capable physicality. Famous for not one, but two epic introductions in the series, Shaw's character participates in most of the memorable scenes mixing humour and his awesome badassery.A little light on the street races this time around, the film has no shortage of cars destroyed in creative ways, including the compulsory destruction of a very expensive orange sports car. If this hasn't occurred to you before, check back through the F&F films and you will find that someone has a serious hate on for orange cars.Charlene Theron is a welcome injection of new blood and Vin Diesel delivers his best when interacting with her. More characters make return appearances, some with some comedy and others to remind you that they exist.Mix explosions, nice looking cars, ladies at street racing events and an emotionally charged main character in crisis with a seasoned cast and you'll find that the latest Fast and the Furious film delivers above par for the series in some departments, most of all in humour.",The Fate of the Furious
244,SamwiseG,"Completely brainless, very patchy storyline, but action packed and watchable",5,21 April 2017,"When you go to see any movie in this franchise you know exactly what you are going to get.....Vin Diesel trying to play a super smooth hard man, The Rock trying and Ludicrous trying to inject some banal humour, and Michelle Rodriguez adding some love interest and denim jeans glamour. You don't expect an exacting storyline, nor do you expect a cerebral script.............and that's exactly what you get this time too.My main points of concern outside of the above area) Charlize Theron playing a devious bad guy, which doesn't work too well. b) The ridiculous accents put on by Jason Statham and his mum, Helen Mirren. Statham seems to try and make himself into some shoulder rocking cockney hard man, and his accent gets more extravagant in every F&F film he appears ..... the man is from Derbyshire, and hasn't a cockney bone in his body, and anyway cockneys really are not the hard men of the UK although do like to project themselves as such. Mirren is a classic British actor, and to hear her put on her absurd version of the same accent does her no favours whatsoever. I burst into laughter when she kept saying words ending in 'thing' ... she would dumb down the 'th' into the required 'ff' but still pronounced the 'ing' in precise Oxford English.... awful but hilarious.All in all you leave your cranial matter at the box office, and just enjoy the car races and spectacular crashes for what they are.",The Fate of the Furious
245,joelmulder96,The Fast and Furious and Fully Self-Aware,7,22 April 2021,"The Fast and Furious franchise consistently encompasses a very specific aesthetic and vibe, which results in the films mainly targeting and entertaining the viewers who grew fond of the series (even if it was only for ""the family"", the cars, and the action) and decided to stick around.The Fast and Furious is a surprisingly intriguing franchise. When asked what the best film of the series is, I believe the majority would vouch for Furious 7 or Fast 5. How is that possible? Is it because the series started out as ""just okay"" and by the time Fast 5 came out, it had finetuned everything into a solid action movie?The answer is no. The first three entries in this series are mostly character-driven (yes, pun intended) expositions. It's not about the racing per se (except for Tokyo Drift, perhaps), it's about the characters. In other reviews, the comparison with a soap opera emerges, which is actually quite an apt description of the series allure. The characters have entertaining, albeit cheesy, chemistry, and it is even more satisfying to see this in the context of the many adventures that they have, alone or together. That is why 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift are still fun to watch, even though not all the characters are there.The first film introduces the characters and not much more. It's Brian's -and the viewers'-welcome into the family. 2 Fast 2 Furious has Roman and Brian teaming up, which is just fun and entertaining. Tokyo Drift thrives solely on the humour and drifting, and adds a dash of mystery by not being the chronological third part of the franchise. In Fast & Furious 4, the viewers receive what they asked for, which is just more of the first film's family back together again. It does a fun job at that, but this film is mainly preparing the audience for Fast 5, which is known as the heist film. More over-the-top action, even more emphasis on family, more cars, and more cheesy humour. More of what we've already seen, but this time the story is quite solid, as well. Plus, you know, it has Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Fast & Furious 6 and Furious 7 continue this successful formula and prove that the heist or a solid story are not obligatory for this blockbuster series to work. Just add more laws-of-nature-defying stunts, more cars, more awesomely stupid action sequences, more one-liners, and more family. That is all it takes to satisfy the fans at this point. And here's the beauty: the film makers behind this franchise know exactly what their audience has come to expect and gives them precisely what they love. That self-awareness is what eliminates the bad from the cringey.The Fate of the Furious is yet another pile of Fast and Furious' beautifully self-aware, action-packed nonsense. And for me, that is what makes it so enjoyable. I can just grab a beer, grab some friends, sit back, pay very little attention to the dialogue, get a refill in between action sequences, and enjoy this film. I hope you can, too, but I can most definitely understand if you don't buy into the hype, as well.",The Fate of the Furious
246,lev-nemkin,Did not disappoint...,9,16 April 2017,This was my most anticipated movie of 2017 then I got even more pumped for it after seeing the trailer and I'm glad I was because this definitely did not disappoint it was awesome I loved it this is now my 2nd favorite in the Fast and Furious franchise at first I predicted that Dom would just turn his back on his family for his own reasons that it was his choice but turned out to be much bigger than that Cipher who's played by Charlize Theron in this basically blackmailed him to do it told him that he would kill Elena and the child he never knew he had if he didn't co-operate with her so he ended up working with her to a certain point but he was also figuring out how to get himself out of it without Elena and his child being harmed although she did end up being killed anyway which was sad because she was a huge part of his team and his family to me. There was something else that puzzled me that I was kind of disappointed about and that was the fact that Deckard Shaw who had killed Han then came Dom and his team for his comatose brother is all of a sudden working with them all of a sudden they're friendly but as the movie progressed it made more sense to me that he was after that I warmed up to that idea I was glad that he was part of their team now because he really ended up bonding with them especially after he saved Dom's son from Cipher they connected after that which I was glad to see plus the fact they mentioned Brian and Mia was nice they gave Brian a proper goodbye in Fast and Furious 7 then an honorable mention in this one which was great I cried closer to the end I won't reveal that because I don't want to spoil why to me this was just as great without Paul Walker they still managed to make it bigger and better now don't get me wrong I'm still sad that he's gone still sad that he will never appear in a Fast and Furious movie again but there's still story there still things they can do with this franchise I hope they end it well because they have 2 more movies to go I actually predict and hope that in Fast and Furious 9 Sean will become a part of Dom's team I reckon that will be awesome because I like that character plus I also can't wait to see how things progress now that Deckard is a part of the team and before I forget Ramsay is another character that I feel is now a part of the team even though she only became a part of it in Fast and Furious 7 when Dom and the team saved her life seems like she's settled in well that she's not just a part of the team but the family as well. I give The Fate of The Furious a 9/10 it really was almost perfect to me.,The Fate of the Furious
247,jpc-34200,The best one yet,10,27 April 2017,Fate of the furious is action set piece after action set piece. Vin diesel goes rogue in this one up against a bondish type villain Cipher played by Charlize theron. I love the ice car chase sequence at the very end of the movie. It takes place in Russia. I would give this entry a high five. Fast and the furious is a brave franchise. One of the best of the millennium action movies of all time. Who doesn't like fast cars zooming or jumping off a cliff or crashing into a submarine. This is so much popcorn fun. I give it 4 stars,The Fate of the Furious
248,TheJohnnyPHreak,Fun Sequel For The 8th Film In The Franchise,7,6 March 2019,"I wasn't sure what to think after Furious 7. I thought that would be the last of these films. It was a nice send-off for Paul Walker, who was a mainstay in the series. It also concluded much of the storylines that had been going on the in the last four films. (Also it's probably my favorite in the series) But why would Universal Pictures want to stop diving into their cash cow? The film keeps getting bigger, wilder and making more money with each entry. I have never seen a film franchise in it's 6th or 7th film be as good and as profitable as this franchise. So, how dod they follow such a success entry as Furious 7? Oh, I don't know, let's make the mainstay hero Dom (Vin Diesel) the villain and have him team up with a beautiful expert hacker and terrorist named Cypher (Charlize Theron).That's basically the plot of this film. Dom is forced to turn on his family because of reason unknown for about 45 minutes of the runtime until we find out why he would turn on his family. It's a genuine twist that I didn't really see coming but I could have put two and two together. There's not much about the plot that I really need to dive into. If you've been following this series, you know what is going on. The film is really all about the chemistry of the actors, the action set pieces and the performances? Yes the performances, I said it. I think some of the actors on screen here are having the time of their lives. It's just fun to be in a crazy action film series like this one.I am an unabashed fan of this series (even though I really don't like the original, which is a story for another day). But the films just keep getting wilder and wilder. Also, they always seem to be fun and engaging. This 8th film is no different. Directed by F. Gary Gray, he definitely has honed some of his action film skills. Most of the action set pieces are loud, crazy and easy to watch. I don't feel like all the time I'm gonna have a seizure. There are two standout sequences that propel the film.One featuring a jailbreak with Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. The other is a sequence on a plane with Jason Statham. If you haven't seen it, it's one of the most fun, funny and entertaining action moments in the entire series. There is a reason why these two actors are getting their own spinoff, they have a ying/yang quality that oozes on screen. They make for an opposite but fun duo.Theron seems to be having a great time as the villain as well. She chews scenery with the best of them. But also she has more hidden away than the normal villain in this series. There are ties to the last three films with her character. All are revealed through the course of the film. I think she's one of the best villains in the series and a good one in general for big-budget action films of late. As I mentioned before Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are a breath of fresh air for this series.They both are just all in on their character. The chemistry between them comes in spades. When they are on screen the film pops and even if they aren't on screen together, the film seems to be alive. I'm not coming down on the rest of the cast. They are all okay, Russell and Rodriguez fairing the best out of all of them. It must have been tough for the filmmakers with such a diverse cast to get everyone a moment. And they do, but some are far better than others. Watching you can even tell who the director may have learned in to in order to keep the film going.I'm not the one to say if you have seen one Fast & Furious movie you've seen them all. That's not the case. I think each film have good qualities for everyone to see each of the films. The Fate of the Furious is a fun entry to the series. I do think it's in the middle if I would rate it against other films. There are some fun action set pieces, a great duo turn for Johnson and Statham and a good villain. I'm hoping with the wildness of this film, the future films will get a bit crazier and give us good villains to challenge this family. I'm not sure how they could up the stakes but there may be something out there that gets the family back in the field. See this if you are a fan of action films, see this if love the series and see this if you just have two hours to kill.",The Fate of the Furious

250,m-maru,Excellent movie,10,25 April 2017,"Excellent movie. Personally, it is the best of the saga. It caught me from the beginning; The action scenes surpassed all that they have done previously (the final scene, incredible and the best I saw) The performances of all the cast very good and Charlize as incredible villain, all cast excellent. I really liked the surprises, which for fans and fans will know who they are and they will love it. The film made me laugh a lot, thrill and enjoy. The 3D is very good, and I emphasize the reason of the betrayal of Dominic since I did not imagine that reason. It is an entertaining film, epic and that will enjoy it very much. Excellent and the best of the saga.",The Fate of the Furious
251,kane_1371-117-231060,The dumbest of dumb movies,5,9 June 2017,"Oh how low has this franchise fallen. Fast and Furious is a franchise that had a great start and then just went down hill. While even the first one wouldn't get an award for being a deep and meaningful movie it still had a character, charm, good story, well established motivations and characters. Even Tokyo Drift with its horrible lead actor had more charm to it. After a few films the movie started to lose any actual purpose because there are not many ways in which you can tell a story about street racers so instead of ending the franchise like sensible people they went on to focus on the least interesting part of the original story the criminal raid activities of the group. These movies kept on coming and got worse and more nonsensical with each iteration. Adrenaline shots in the form of big action names like The Rock and Statham each helped to make the otherwise nonsensical movies gather viewers and then tragedy struck and Paul Walker passed away and that naturally got more people to watch FnF 7. FnF 8 however falls to the lowest point of the franchise. This movie is filled with nonsense hacking, stupid action scenes, horrible characters both new and returning and just not funny jokes. (except one where The Rock cuts a massive promo on Statham) The story is so predictable that you can just leave the theater after the first 10 minutes and know the rest of the story. In an age where action movies are great and each unique FnF seems not to fit well neither among the awesome dumb films or the better and deeper action films. The saddest part is that this movie is merely 0.5 behind a masterpiece like Collateral.",The Fate of the Furious

The movie is loud, over-the-top, outrageous, beyond unbelievable in a few scenes, but I sit and watched it with my boys and we had a great time watching a cool movie and guess what?...we turned our brains off for a while and enjoyed the movie for what it was. But isn't that what you need to do sometimes for movies? Is that what folks do when they watch the insane Sharknado movies? The acting is great, fight scenes are awesome, special effects are beyond incredible, even if totally unbelievable most of the time. Theron, Statham, Diesel and the Rock are fantastic in their roles.

Producer Vin Diesel & the team of filmmakers - in particular the second unit - were indeed able to up the ante for the action sequences as mentioned starting from the 5th installment, giving viewers some of the most daring stunt work put to film in recent times.For deep, intriguing plots you're at the wrong address as well, the story is so absurd. But it works for this franchise as the cast is clearly all in to have a blast, especially Charlize Theron who stands out as the psychotic villain, & they even carry the emotional scenes quite well.Keep the momentum going & they are sure to have mega fire hits with installments 9 & 10!

Well, they've spent a lot of cash here, nowadays it's hard to drag people in theatre, but for some parts in the movie, it was well done.Forget about any logic or physics here, it's entertainment right? even sometimes it goes really too far, i can believe (mostly), that a Sub will chase fast cars on ice, or any cars stunts really (who cares? they can't die on screen^^), but the chase in NYC with autopilot cars is dumb to say the least and so on.Then there are families, Torreto and his own band of brothers, Paul Walker's soul is there too, you'll see it , Hobbs and his daughter, even the Shaws are a family remember, F7?.Deckard (J. Statham) is back with.. Owen (L. Evans) and of course they have a mother M.Shaw(Dame H. Mirren) Because of family, Dom will betray everybody and everything he believes in before, the scenario isn't that bad but a it's bit chaotic.C.Theron is really brilliant as the Armaggedon for this opus, Scott Eastwood is a new comer in the F&F and a good one, K.Russel is perfect as Mr Nobody, T.Gibson is always the funniest guy in the band, M.Rodriguez loves V.Diesel more than ever, well, all good,BUT, they've made a mistake once, they've cast D,Johnson who is still great don't worry, but the man is huge.., i mean, he is a star on his own, and almost steal the show.It was good to watch, i've loved it because of the family plot but most of it because of J.Statham and D.Johnson chemistry, it's obvious they must (need to) do something together.Well, as you probably know, Universal is thinking of a spin off with Deckard Shaw, Hobbs and Mr Nobody as their mentor, Chris Morgan would be the writer so i just say don't think, DO IT!, i can't wait to see the two in a full action movie on their own.",The Fate of the Furious

This time we see Dominic Toretto betraying the people he is close to and working for the villain Cipher played by Charlize Theron.As with the more recent movies in the franchise, the action was top- notch. There was plenty of comic relief from Tyrese Gibson making this movie more funny than the majority of comedy movies (which I personally don't find funny). Cipher made a good villain and was played well by Charlize Theron. It is also interesting, without giving anything away, to see much of the family dynamic in this movie.It is safe to say that this movie delivered just as much as the more recent entries in this franchise and it paves the way for more movies to come.

That is not a criticism. people know what to expect with F&F and as The Rock said in an interview about the movie. ""in movies you have to suspend disbelief"". in this movie you need to take your disbelief and lock it away somewhere deep and dark, but once you have done that then you will have fun. There is no attempt to provide any character insight, rather the cast do what they are supposed to do, which is comforting. the Jason Statham character, his lost cause brother and his darling mother provided a nice comic element in the later part of the movie when i was starting to unsuspend my disbelief. Returning to the James Bond reference i made at the start of my review, the franchise may have peaked with this episode. After fighting the threat of nuclear war and saving the world i can only see two viable ways forward for the team. First, doing a Doctor Who and defeat an alien invasion. Second, quit at the top and close the franchise. i quite like the idea of an SF version with Dom joining forces with Riddik, thereby getting two pay packets.",The Fate of the Furious

Some Cringey Dialogue And Acting Aswel!,6,8 May 2017,"Decent film but this one wasn't up there with the best of them. Out of the new school Fast And Furious films for me it goes, from best to worst... 6, 5, 7, 8, 4.The 3 or 4 main action sequences were exciting, as always, but between those parts there were flawing issues so it made the film feel too long. Ideas were shoe horned in without any finesse like the way it was done in the previous few episodes.Besides the as-usual great action scenes the flaws with the rest of the film were...*The story didn't feel as well told as the previous 3.*Charlize Theron's character didn't come off as menacing enough.*Maybe it was how the film was made but it felt like it was missing Paul Walker's character, he was the glue that helped with the previous ones, the emotional centre, which the characters left couldn't fix in this one.*They gave Tej(Ludicrous) more screen time which would have worked if he was a better actor and character.*Ramsey, The British computer girl that joined the team from the last film, her performance is amateurish and cringeworthy and really stands out from the rest of the cast and Yes even compared to rapper Ludicrous' Tej. You can't help notice as she gets fairly decent screen time in this one.*The Rock's superhuman strength stands out as a little ridiculous in this one. No other member of the cast comes close now, we'r talking DC/Marvel strength! Its too out of place compared to everyone else. They'll have to get Doomsday in the next one just to make it a fair fight!*It's too long.*Yes Jason Statham is the stand out character but is underused!The last 3 Fast And Furious films i gave an 8 and two 10's but this one i'd give a 6, just above average thanks to the action sequences.",The Fate of the Furious

This will not disappoint the franchise fan, that is for sure.Okay this is a Vin Diesel movie, so the Rock and Statham takes a back seat but all is well, Theron plays a mean baddie, could have been a little more defined, nice cameo by Kurt Rusell, all in all bottom line is, you will like the movie if you know what to expect.",The Fate of the Furious
266,rs403404,This movie is really stupid. Gratuitously stupid. Gloriously near perfectly stupid.,8,18 April 2017,"This is a stupid movie. A movie where if a nuclear football is stolen, the government goes all out sending a group of car enthusiasts/adrenaline junkies to retrieve it rather than just changing the codes. A movie where the villain goes out of her way to make sure one certain person is forced to work for her and largely uses that person not for any particular skills he has but for grunt work. A movie where The Rock throws a torpedo at a car. This movie is really stupid. Gratuitously stupid. Gloriously near perfectly stupid. But that's this whole franchise in a nutshell. If you go into a Fast and Furious movie expecting a bold piece with deep themes and thoughtful introspection, then you clearly haven't seen any of these movies. Any theme deeper than ""family is good"" is way over the head of this franchise. For all intents and purposes the origin of this series was nothing more than a cheesy ""Point Break"" remake. And if you're asking yourself ""wasn't 'Point Break' already cheesy?"" The answer is yes. Yet somehow from that beginning we now have one of the biggest franchises in the world with seven sequels. Granted, it didn't fully find its footing until ""Fast Five"", but since then it's been consistent.Directors like Justin Lin and James Wan handled this franchise knowing full well that these movies are dumb. But being dumb doesn't mean it can't also be fun. Well now we can add F. Gray Grey to that list of directors that understands that to make a movie work in this series, you must not just shoot stupid stuff, but fully embrace the stupidity with no reservations.And while Fate may be the least fun the franchise has been since 2009 with an overlong runtime and plenty of pacing issues, there's still plenty of smiles to be had here. I also appreciate that rather than replace the late Paul Walker's Brian with a clone character, they chose to upgrade Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw from evil villain to uneasy ally. Adding a completely new dynamic to the cast. Probably the best relationship in the movie is between Shaw and The Rock's Luke Hobbs. The two clearly hate each other with a burning passion, yet know that their best chance of succeeding lies with working together.The Fate of the Furious is not a great accomplishment in filmmaking. It has no aspirations other than to tell a dumb story in a fun way that relishes it's stupidity. From that perspective, it's a pretty big success.",The Fate of the Furious
267,darryl-42069,It ain't ran out of gas!,8,16 April 2017,"Fate of the Furious, the eight installment of the mindless, crazed up action flick has proved itself that the franchise never ran out of gas. There's over the top action scene, there's some mindless story, and there's Vin Diesel talking about family over and over again. Those things are what makes us coming back for more, and this is no exception.The story follows Dom Toretto who betrays his family to work for Cipher, and his team's attempt to stop him. Vin Diesel has firmly stated that this movie ""may earn a Oscar for it's acting"", Maybe he's right because the acting is probably the best in the franchise. There were times where I'm surprised by Vin Diesel's acting. I also had a tear in my eye for no reason (damn those ninja cutting onions...) Charlize Theron is amazing as someone who's a menacing foe that you love to hate. The Rock, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Ludicrous, Tyrese, Kurt Russell, and Nathalie Emmanuel reprises their roles and they did a good job as well, especially The Rock, Statham and Michelle Rodriguez. Scott Eastwood and Helen Mirren are great and a welcome addition to the franchise. There's also some surprise appearances and they are great as well.The story... you definitely need no explanation for this. As always: it's stupid, in a good way of course. The story ties into Fast & Furious 6, and Furious 7, so for newcomers to the franchise, you may get confused a bit. The film also uses plot twists, which were greatly executed. There were some well placed funny moments and there's also some depressing moments as well. The movie also serves as the first in the final trilogy of the franchise. How the story goes later, we'll just wait for the ninth installment, which definitely will arrive soon enough.The action, needless to say, is as crazy as in Furious 7, or maybe more. Taking insanity to the next level, these action scenes is either get you pumped out for what happens next, or making you shake your head for it's absurdity. Just don't relate to science or the law of physics, because those things don't apply to this movie.However, the movie somehow felt hollow. There's something that's missing from the movie that prevents me from fully enjoying the movie. The lack of Paul Walker in the movie probably causes this. Referencing Brian and Mia in the movie ain't help either. Plot holes were present in the movie as well. Someone dies in the movie, but their deaths don't do justice (he/she died, he/she avenge his/her death, and that's it). And there's some CGI noticeable throughout the movie (which is a shame).Regardless, Fate of the Furious is a movie with a stupid story, ridiculous action sequences, and Vin Diesel talking about family, which were bad, in a good way. Don't expect a really good story, or some logical action scene, because you'll ended up disappointed by the end of this movie. And for those ""fans"" who said: ""Remember when it's all about racing"", face it, Fast & Furious ain't returning fully to it's roots. If you don't like the change then you'll definitely don't like this movie. For anyone else who like fast cars, mindless action fun, get a ticket, have a seat and enjoy the ride.",The Fate of the Furious

But i am glad to say that this movie is good . Kurt Russel was amazing in is role as Nobody . The rock was as usual awesome so was Jason statham . The rest gave a good performance . I didn't like the 3D very much though . They have paid a gd tribute to Paul Walker . But it was not as good as the previous movie for me. This is probably one of the funniest Fast movies . I loved the chemistry between most of the cast members. I think this is a good way to end the series . If you have liked and enjoyed previous fast movies then i am pretty sure you will like and enjoy this one .,The Fate of the Furious
274,Songwriter_90210,Ridiculous! Exactly As It Should Be!,8,28 May 2017,"Anyone who's watched the Fast franchise knows that their starting point is ""over the top"". So it should come as no surprise that this one would be any different. Is it fun? Absolutely. Is it exciting? Yep! Is it believable? Are you kidding? Of course not! It's not supposed to be.The addition of Jason Statham and Charlize Theron bring much more legitimacy to this action flick. Charlize can act, and well, Jason? Jason can kick ass. I would have gotten pretty tired of the dual gun shows doing the heavy lifting once again, but Diesel and the Rock get a bit watered down, thankfully. You can only have so much muscle head antics until it gets old. I can always use much less Tyrese Gibson, and there is less, but he's also been given a little bit better dialogue than in previous F&F movies. The rest of the cast is watchable and don't distract from the story.It's really easy to give away spoilers for this movie, so instead I'll just say this: if you liked F&F #1, #3, and #5 (five being clearly the best), then you'll like #8. The seventh installment was an homage and a farewell, and I don't judge it harshly because of that, but this one is far and away better than 7. This is not a film for the serious film buff. This is a thrill ride in an amusement park, and you have to really allow yourself to be OK with absolutely unbelievable plot twists and totally impossible stunts in order to enjoy it. It's even quite funny in some spots. Intentionally funny, not ""oh my god that's stupid"" funny. Well, there is a little bit of that too. Bottom line, I liked it.

But in the morning, I was happy to go to school because on the afternoon I would see Fast and Furious 8. After this movie, I wasn't disappointed because this film is an action film and I love action movies. The movie was released in 2017. The producer is Felix Gary Grey. The main actors are Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron. The plot takes place at first in Cuba, then in New York and then Russia. Vin Diesel (Dominic Toretto), the nice man works with Cipher (Charlize Theron), the mean woman because she has the son of Toretto. How could someone imagine such a plot? Finally he arrives to save his son and his team! It's a very good plot.It why this movie is amazing. The visuals effects are amazing too. For example when a million cars drive with no driver. Or when the actors fight, we have the impression they are in a real fight. The sound effects are wonderful because when there are fights we listen to fights with real punching noises. Fast and Furious 8 is not just an action film because sometimes the movie was comical. I think the actors play very well because it's not easy to play in this movie because they are watched by so many people. This movie is extremely amazing, I want to see this film another time. The movie lasts 136 minutes. In 18 days Fast and Furious 8 won 1,036 billion dollars.It's a wonderful movie!RM",The Fate of the Furious

In the opening scene, Dom jumps out of a car that is probably going over 100 mph, onto pavement, and doesn't even get any scratches. Another thing that is ridiculous is that the ""bad guys"", meaning Dom and Cipher, knock out all of the ""good"" guys, leave them, and leave them alive. So the good people can just come after them later I guess? Cipher gives Dom the choice between killing her which will result in his son's death, or letting her live. He chooses to let her live, this psychopath that is stealing nuclear codes. What hero does that? I would shoot her, and then shoot all the other bad guys I could before me and my family got shot. At least I would die with respect and having killed the evil character. And then Dom kills one of the good guys. Lastly, Cipher ends up shooting his son's mother anyway. What an idiot. He had a chance to kill Cipher, but he blew it and she killed his son's mom anyway. I left at this point. I have better things to do than watch this kind of dribble.

I watched the 1st F&F when I was 13 in a drive-thru cinema. I remember at the end of the film, people revving their engines and peeling out of there like they were suddenly drag racers. That's the entire essence of this franchise. It's not good screenplay, or brilliant acting, or massively original plots. It's turn-your-brain-off, a flurry of furious action and fast cars. Hence the name THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS. Even the title tells you exactly what you're in store for. This addition is similar to the rest of the movies. Get the impossible to get bad guy by driving cars (in this franchise, any problem can be solved with a fast car). Dwayne Johnson really stands out as an absolute beast in this movie and appears larger and more invincible than ever.

279,kastenmeier-andreas,As Dumb and Entertaining as it gets!,6,18 April 2017,"My biggest hope with the ""Fast and Furious""-Franchise is, that everybody else is watching it with the same attitude as i do. I watch it as a entertaining guilty pleasure comedy with the knowledge of watching the most stupid things on screen. And I mean most stupid things. There are moments especially in this film, where i couldn't stop laughing. For example, the hackers or computer experts in this movie need less than 10 seconds to write the most complex codes by shortly hitting the types.Now you may say that this is nitpicking, but that's just a small detail. The plot, dialogue and action scenes follow the same insanity. You get ""The Rock"" surfing on a torpedo, People suddenly trusting their former enemies within seconds and silly car chases that define the law of physics. And god damn please never ask yourself, why the hell the main villain especially needs Dominic Toretto for her plans.Why do I still give this movie a 6 out of 10. Because the makers of this movie know exactly of this stupidity and the fun of it. This is a hell of entertaining movie to watch and shut your brains down. Especially the newer cast members seem to like every scene their in. I loved the action scenes of Jason Statham, they are among the funniest moments of the movie. On the Contrary, I didn't like the dark main plot and characters as much in this entry to the Franchise.""Fast Five"" is still the most entertaining one of those movies, but you'll have a good time with this, too. But keep remembering yourself to stop thinking.",The Fate of the Furious
280,rachaelblakeegypt,The Fast and the Furious franchise has always made its way with being fun entertaining films.,8,15 April 2017,"The Fast and the Furious franchise has always made its way with being fun entertaining films. Cool cars, crazy insane action sequences that usually breaks the laws of physics, and lastly, the story always focuses on the theme of family. That is usually the case with the most of these movies, and the code that Dominic Toretto lives by. Old enemies become good and good go bad, so it seems when Dominic (Vin Diesel) betrays his team and family during an extract mission in Berlin. Stealing an important device, and reporting to Cyber terrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron). Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and the rest of the team that we all know from the previous films have to track down Ciphers next move and stop Dom. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and the new addition (Scott Eastwood) will need Hobb and his team and the help from their former enemy Deckard (Jason Statham).I feel like the fast movies are getting better as it goes on from every movie and amazing to see how it went from a street racing movie to a heist film to a spy action. Also one that should not be taken seriously. It's a blockbuster action movie that you should leave brains and logic out before seeing the movie. Seeing these characters as a team go on glide trotting missions to stop Cyberterrorism using sporty cars and tactical fast tanks. Does these missions even require them to use cars? Probably not, sure there is other ways they could have handled it. But than it wouldn't be a fast movie, would it.The action sequences are big, loud, and insane. From the opening sequence, in Cuba, seeing Dom race with a burning car was fun. Until he meets Cipher that persuaded him to betray his team. Without giving away details, on Doms motivation to do such a thing against his family, it's best to see for yourself. The film also takes place in New York and has one insane scene when Cipher hacks into computerized cars for her own control and leading a wave of cars to invade a convoy. Last, the chase sequence with the cars being chased by a submarine was fun in a overlong battle that takes place in Russia.The cast was still great and it was fun to see Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham taunt each other when working on a team. Helen Mirren has a brief appearance and is well worth it. Scott Eastwood was also a fun addition as a rookie to Mr. Nobody. Charlize Theron as the villain was a perfect choice. But sadly, she does not have much to do besides her menacing threats and being in a command room throughout the whole movie. The film does have its twist and turns in the direction, when characters family limit is tested. But in the end, the central theme will always be about family coming together.The Fate of the Furious is awesome and does best for what it is trying to do which is entertain with crazy action sequences. Great cast. Fun to see these characters work together. Has its cheesy dialogue humor. And I hope to Watch more.",The Fate of the Furious
281,mukherjeediptendu,One of the best entertaining action franchise delivers again........,8,14 April 2017,This movie franchise is the dumbest but coolest action packed drama franchise out there and it delivers perfectly.This movie brings you back to the old fast and furious feelings from the beginning with the Cuba racing sequence. It is one of the most well directed sequence i have seen. From the start you got to know that Dom is going rouge and when you know why you feel it too. The action sequences are most entertaining sequence just like other fast and furious movies and it is ridiculously awesome. The dialogues and interactions between Rock and Jason Statham i enjoyed the most. The relationship between Dom and Letty is also well done. This movie has some lairs that you cannot get from the trailers. Story is way better than the trailer looks.Some of the humors doesn't land very well. In the second act of the movie it gets a bit slow for a few minute when they try to figure out everything.If you went to see this movie thinking about logic in every scene then this movie is not for you. If you want pure entertainment then this movie is definitely for you. My opinion it is not as good as Fast Five but definitely better than Furious 7 .......7.8/10.....,The Fate of the Furious

My God!!!Okay, I have always had a love/hate relationship with this franchise. I find them likable and enjoyable on some level, but they represent everything I have come to hate in Hollywood action films in the last 15 years! Each film gets more preposterous than the last and now they are just over budgeted Wile E. Coyote - Road Runner cartoons, with more and more CGI heavy stunts. I hate the way the action in these films is shot and edited. Shaky cam, hyper moving cam, weasel on speed editing...specially during the fights, where the cameramen must have Parkinson's and the editors are paid by the cut! F*cking inexcusable! Any director who does an action film should be required to watch movies like ""Ben Hur"", ""Bullit"", ""Enter The Dragon"", ""The Road Warrior"" and ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" to see how action is shot and edited properly! It makes no Gad damned sense to take the time, effort and money to stage big action and then shoot and edited it like an amateur filmmaker! The gang is back and in fine form, but I just never got the Michelle Rodriguez thing! I think she is a terrible actress and action star(?)...Who has only one facial expression, that ""Who farted?"" look. What do I know, it will probably make a quadrillion dollars!

Now as a rule I don't normally review movies that are not my typical genre because I'd obviously have a bias point of view but for this load of unimaginative garbage I'll make an exception. The script must have been sometime like ""Do stuff with cars"" because that's all the movie was, no story, no dialogue, just doing stuff with cars that didn't need to be done with cars.

288,davidarcher,Very good - if you don't stop and think about it,6,14 May 2017,"Some movies are like richly-detailed novels, complete with complex characters and plotting. Other movies are like Disneyland attractions. While riding Thunder Mountain, for example, it's pointless to ponder the singing animals who appear on the deck of an underground riverboat.Fate of the Furious falls into the latter category. It's best not to ask if a Russian submarine can out-run a souped-up high-performance car (it can't), or if one person can remotely operate said Russian submarine (probably not) or if the effects of an EMP device are temporary (they're not.)Still, no one does car chases as well as the Fast and Furious franchise. And, unlike Guardians of the Galaxy 2, the witty banter usually is.The usual cast of characters is back for #8 and Charlize Theron is the new villainess. (Can't wait to see her in Atomic Blonde.)See it now if you liked 1 – 7. Otherwise, skip it.",The Fate of the Furious
289,Tkbn3812,"Won't fail to entertain, even with some flaws it's still packed with all the typical action of a FAF film",7,18 April 2017,"The Fate of the Furious continues the highly-profitable Fast and Furious franchise. The film certainly lives up to the expectations of previous films, with all the action and adventure one has come to expect from the franchise, along with one of their most sinister villains yet. And yet the film takes a darker turn towards its storytelling, with important characters pushed out of the limelight and new characters not developed enough. Regardless, the film is certainly an entertaining watch, balancing out the characters and action to deliver a satisfying new installment in the ever-expanding FAF franchise.The film tells the story of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), who teams up with master-hacker Cipher (Charlize Theron) while in Cuba, and turns his back on his old team. This old team consists of Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) and, for some reason, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel). The team is recruited by Mr Nobody (Kurt Russell), to stop Cipher from her plans. Mr Nobody has also recruited Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the villain from Furious 7, which naturally angers the team, most especially Hobbs. Alongside Mr Nobody is his new assistant, Little Nobody (Scott Eastwood). Little Nobody is a decent character, however he is not quite perfect, for example he is inexplicably a driver almost as adept as members of the old team. More importantly, the writers have attempted to give him quite a bit of character development in his transition just before the final act from stringent-rule-follower who comes across as an idiot at times, to a rule-breaker. However with limited screen time this is done too suddenly, and not actually dealt with for the remainder of the film; this makes it somewhat unbelievable. Still, the character is a fair addition to the old team, which has morphed significantly into having only four of the eight original members from Fast Five; he will definitely need more characterisation in future films, though.The film can be applauded for its very powerful villain. Charlize Theron does a stunning job playing the cold hearted villain of Cipher, without a doubt the most sinister villain the franchise has ever seen. Her character is always in control, right until the end, and her characterisation is done very well throughout the movie. Her escape at the end is certainly a disappointment, however this without a doubt is merely setting the film up for sequels.The film also has action sequences which live up (mostly) to the reputation of the franchise. The past two films have had three main sequences, however this film instead opts for two main sequences; New York and the submarine in Russia (the Cuban race doesn't exactly count). The submarine sequence is very well done, primarily because Dominic is back on his team's side and the scene features all the action and death-defying stunts the franchise generally features. However, while the New York sequence is mostly impressive (especially in all the cars being controlled), it's also conflicting; Dominic's team show up only towards the end to try apprehend him, and are foiled by Dom fairly quickly. The reason the sequence is conflicting is because of the rather small amount of time spent on focusing on the 'good' side, instead focusing on Cipher's team hacking into all cars around New York, and Dominic stealing the nuclear football. Usually FAF action sequences feature the bad being chased by the good, but here the bad is actually Dominic, the good are his team, and the chase is merely him being cornered by them and managing to escape fairly quickly. However Deckard and Letty do manage give chase. Dom 'kills' Deckard, but nearly manages to let Letty escape with the nuclear football; it's Cipher's other henchman, Connor Rhodes, who gets it off her. Dom turning against his team, or as he sees them, his family, was the centre of every trailer released. The reason that he did so was never revealed, but just before the New York sequence this is done; Dom's former girlfriend, Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) has been kidnapped, and it is further revealed that Elena had an accidental pregnancy with Dom, presumably between the events of Fast Five and Fast and Furious 6, and thus their son (still a baby) has also been kidnapped. This reveal is shocking, and serves as a powerful motive for Dom to work for Cipher; if he goes against her, both Elena and their son will die.Thus, as a result of nearly letting Letty escape, Cipher kills Elena. It's here where the film takes quite a dark turn, cementing Cipher as a powerful villain. Elena's death is quite horrible, and the way they kill her feels somewhat ill-suited for an action series, belonging more in a horror film.The film makes quite the number of callbacks to previous films. There are many throwaway lines to previous films, especially Furious 7, with the return of Deckard's brother and villain of film 6, Owen Shaw, in the last act (although he only gets a line or two). Although perhaps confusing viewers who aren't as familiar with the franchise, the callbacks help establish the franchise, with two more sequels already lined up, as a series.The film does, however, push the old team out of the limelight. Every line Roman delivers is comic relief, with him as a character progressing nowhere in the film. Tej and Ramsey are also pushed away, although they seem to be flirting throughout the film, an alright addition to their otherwise non-existent characterisation. Perhaps the primary problem with the team is that it's missing Dom; let's hope the 9th brings back the team as strong as ever.Overall, The Fate of the Furious is an entertaining action flick which will no doubt entertain. It may not quite meet your expectations based off the last three immensely popular installments, but it won't fail to satisfy.",The Fate of the Furious
290,guycorhuo,These kind of movies is like falling in love...,6,13 April 2017,"....you have to accept 'em despite its failures or better move on.Spoilers!!!!The best you can do is to take a seat and have fun and not try to find answers to the long list of questions that this movie will cause to you.Also whether you look for good and high level screen writing you are in the wrong place. This is just a long ride in one of the most hyperbolic rollercoasters ever (if you've seen the poster you've noticed that there are some cars being pursued on ice by a submarine. Nuff said!) You don't go to see fireworks to hear Debussy or to an amusement park to hear someone recite Walt Whitman in the jump & smile ride. This is not Moonlight, or Manchester by the sea nor even La la land. This is an spectacle, an action movie franchise and you get what something like this is worth.This is an universe where physics follow different rules to ours. I don't understand why they aren't considered sci-fi movies because there're at least four or five scientific-technological creations that can't exist in our reality. Yes. It has two Academy Awards winners. But remember that Charlize has done Monster but Mad Max too. And Helen Mirren can play the Queen but also Red 1 and 2. By the way, both are quite good in this one. Helen Mirren just appears twice but great both times.Major spoilers!!!The prologue is a perfect clue of what expect in terms of hyperbolic screen writing. A long scene with a lot of classic F&F action that barely contributes to rest of the story. Just to remind us how much charismatic Dom is, to introduce us to a character that is going to appear later to do something that any Helen Mirren's thug could have done, and to relate Dom with kids when he is cheered as a hero by a bunch of brats just because there's something related with parenthood along the movie. But finally is just a scene to start the engines on. Maybe at the end you'll wonder what has happened with Owen Shaw. There's no answer. Or how has Dekard released his brother. There's no answer. Or.... better I stop here. Don't blame Universal, F Gary Gray or Vin Diesel after watching the movie. Blame yourself if you go to watch it not knowing what a F&F movie is after 7 previous releases. This is what it is, and you have to know exactly what is. Take the ticket to your ride, void your mind and enjoy. Paul Walker in our hearts.",The Fate of the Furious

The movies aren't about the racing or the cars anymore its all about the crime and bad guys vs. the team\family. I really missed Mia\Jordana and Brian\Paul in this one. It wasn't the same without them. So, I guess the story was Dom turned to the dark side in order to save Elena and his son that he had no idea existed? Charlize character ""Cipher"" showed him something on a phone, but what was it? What made Dom switch and turn against his team\family\Letty? They didn't show.

294,afatedcircle,Just end the franchise already.,5,13 April 2017,"You know, I used to really love these movies. In fact, you could say like many others I've grown up on these movies, but at this point I think it's just time to wrap them up.First off,you saw much of the movie from the multitude of trailers we've seen. In fact, other than one surprise there is nothing in this entire movie that warrants facing the theater crowd and paying the money to see. If you do want to see it in theaters I suggest waiting a few weeks until the crowds have died down. That being said, the 7pm showing on Thursday(opening night) only was half occupancy.The first thing I noticed was the characters didn't seem to mesh as well together or have the charisma they used to. Tyrese brings some of the comical elements to the movie as we've come to expect, but you can still sense a sort of awkwardness with all of them. In fact the most entertaining and comedic aspects of the entire first half of the movie were brought to you by Statham and Dwayne Johnson. I could enjoy a movie based entirely on Hobbs and Shaw.Speaking of Shaw, he's ""killed"" early on in the movie and doesn't reappear until later but completely steals the show when he does reappear along with a short cameo of his younger brother. Until this happens though the action is honestly quite bland.Kurt Russell is always a charm for the few times he's shown but his new underling played by Scott Eastwood who becomes a member of the team is well...hard to watch. I get it, the studio needed a replacement for Paul Walker but this definitely wasn't the right choice. Here you have another ""FBI"" character who chooses JDM tuner cars to drive around but doesn't add anything to the team at all. I would have much rather seen them use Lucas Black, who some websites listed in the cast but was never seen.Your two big baddies are Charlize Theron and Krsitofer Hijvu(of Game of Thrones fame). Charlize is fairly decent in her villain roles and is eye candy as always but I'm not sure how well she came off as an expert hacker and cyber terrorist. Hijvu was the muscle of the group but was killed by the ""superman"" known as Dom in a 20 second(if that) fight scene. We know however that Charlize will be the main antagonist in the next movie as well so if you liked her in this one you'll probably like her in it.Now to the action scenes. The whole ""hacking"" vehicles to send through the streets of New York came off as stupid as it sounded. For me it was mainly because you had cars that have no ""autodrive"" capabilities flashing it on LCD screens and driving themselves around Terminator 3 style. Throw in Dom running around in some tactical suit and mask straight out of the Crysis video games and it seemed like I was watching xXx. It doesn't get any better for gearheads when they try to say a car has 5000hp or the submarine chase scene. The only race scene in the movie is another unbelievable one in the first 5 minutes of the movie. So overall the gearheads that love these movies might have a hard time watching. You'll love the Dodge Demon we get to see for a minute or so though.I guess I recommend the movie if you're looking for nonstop, unbelievable action but I can't bring myself to give it more than a 6/10.",The Fate of the Furious

While I have no interest in the character relationships in this series anymore,the whole Dom thing did surprise me. Charlize Theron was quite good,but didn't really add anything interesting for the franchise. The main cast,particularly Dom & Team,put minimal effort. The stunts were a bit laughable but technically sound. The story,quite formulaic,other than the final act. Scot Eastwood was quite nice as Little Nobody.As for the flaws,the humour was really bad,particularly during the airplane scene and the final act in the snow.

It has enough of a story line to hold it all together but this movie is all about action and fast cars. It has car chases, car crashes and even cars falling out of the sky. Director F. Gary Gray, who also directed Straight Outta Compton, has put together a high octane adventure that is a real crowd pleaser. In Fate of the Furious the team has gone back to their normal lives, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is coaching his little girls soccer team and Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) are in Havana on their honeymoon. However one day Dom is approached by the cyber- terrorist known only as Cipher (Charlize Theron) and she shows him something on her cell phone which makes him turn his back on his team and join her in her evil international terrorist plot. So the whole team is forced to go after Dom and the family, which is a prevailing theme in the movie, is a family no more.The supporting cast, including Tyrese, Ludicrous and Jason Stratham, add the comic relief to the movie and there's even a small cameo appearance in the movie from Oscar winner Helen Miren as an international crime boss. Obviously I don't want to give away the ending but the movie is set up for another Fast and Furious movie in the future, and since the previous F&F 7 made over one billion dollars worldwide, you should get ready for a Fast and Furious 9!

I watched the first 10 minutes and couldn't bear to see the rest. I was cringing so hard at how this completely obscene junk can be written and accepted. What a joke. The slowest car in the entire island beats the fastest car just by taking off some bodywork and adding some nitrous. I'm sorry, that's not how cars work. You don't become faster than the other car because you go in reverse and your engine is on fire. This is the stupidest thing I've seen in movies. It's like their holy heroes cannot lose in any circumstance whatsoever and they'll even have a race between a Bugatti veyron and Dom on a bike and he'll cycle faster with the bike being on fire, him doing stunts midair, landing in his neck for bonus points, only to emerge stronger. This is what this movie is. Someone above the age of 12 with half a brain notices how dumb this is and this scene in itself made the other fast and furious movies seem like a documentary. And I disliked the other fast and furious movies because I knew exactly how the movie will end when it started, so predictable. No tension, no suspense, just a terrible cliché plot that can be written by a 6 year old kid. I'm almost certain that most of the good reviews are fake. I have never stopped watching s movie within 10 mins, and guessing by that, it's probably the worst movie I've ever come across. Don't waste your money, if you can think logically and intelligently in any way, this will be too cringy for you to handle.",The Fate of the Furious
305,christonr-64261,F8-est Hits,7,1 May 2017,"The eighth instalment of Vin Diesel's star-making vehicle, comes nearly two decades after the original F&F; a poor man's Point Break with street racing instead of surfing. But the franchise has grown, evolved and hulked-up pretty immensely - particularly in the latter four movies - to create what can only be described as mind-blowing, film-going experiences.'Fate' is no different; heightening and enhancing the craziness to ridiculous levels whilst hitting the consistent beats this franchise is now so renowned for (crashes, drag racing, posturing and FAMILY!!!) It would be easy to level at this film the criticism of jumping the shark - as with 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 before it - but when you actually sit down to consider the self-awareness on display, it is hard not to applaud such a meta approach which ultimately knows it's audience and is very much giving it what it wants.F. Gary Gray's latest offering pays homage to all of the previous instalments and then some: Remember dragging the safe around Rio? We have a stunt sequence kind of like that. Remember that/those dude(s)? He's/she's/they're back! Remember that weirdly-named maguffin the team were chasing but then forgot about? Now it's a major part of the plot. There are literally too many to name in this review, but to me, this film felt like a real celebration  of all things Fast/Furious  (much like 'Skyfall' did for Bond) So where does Fate of the Furious rank among its contemporaries? Despite the brilliance of The Stath and Tyrese in particular, there are things which admittedly don't work, so it's probably in the 4th-6th range. But don't let that deter you; F&F8 is a fun, often-surprising and charming novelty of a sequel.",The Fate of the Furious
306,annonymouscritic,Insanely entertaining!,7,4 June 2017,"I'm a huge fan of the series, so I may sound a little biased here:This is my third movie in the Fast And Furious franchise. Fast And Furious 7 is still the best one, but damn this one comes close. I don't think it deserves the 5/10 Metacritic gave it. It's not a bad movie. Just like all the FAF movies, this movie is insane, funny, and sometimes just so friggin' dumb that it turns into one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever watched. It has everything you love about the series; explosions, high speed chases, good plot, decent acting, and really good action scenes. The drama was there too and even though I was wrapped up in it the drama sometimes came off as a little ridiculous, and that comes from someone who watches Rick and Morty every Friday. And the return of Deckard Shaw is great. I really like Jason Statham and him being the main villain in FAF 7 was great. Now Deckard is back in this movie and kicks even more ass than he did last time. So overall, definitely would recommend to fans of the series. If you haven't watched a single one of the movies before then you won't find much here. This is a film which, I believe, can only be enjoyed by fans of the series. Great film though, but that's just my opinion.",The Fate of the Furious

Like the previous films in the series this film is purely tongue in cheek. The action for the most part is well directed and often spectacular. Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson add great presence to the film and really elevate the scenes they are in. The scene with Jason Statham and a baby probably being the stand out scene in the film. For fans of the series this is another entertaining entry, the question is like last time, where will the next ride take us?

309,adamcarlton,"if you're a fan, you know what to expect",6,13 April 2017,"this review may contain spoilers.going into this as a fan of the series since the beginning i knew what was in store and thats the bottom line here. if you're a fan of the series or you just enjoy a crazy action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously you will have fun here. my only gripes with this movie, and this as i said is coming from a long-time fan, are that you can only suspend your disbelief so much before it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. and that is what many of the action scenes in f8 do. i found myself on more than one occasion with the words ""oh come on"" on the tip of my tongue while i sat in the theater. such as the scene where cypher remotely drives a thousand cars almost perfectly in sync toward a vip motorcade or the penultimate scene where one character is rescued from their drowning lambo by way of holding on to a doorpanel that was hit by a harpoon wire (yet he still managed to communicate via radio that it was cold while several metres underwater).but on the positive side, fast8 is for the most part very entertaining. it almost never lets up, slowing down for a few brief scenes here and there to let the audience catch their breath. besides the welcome return of statham who i love (and his banter scenes with dwayne johnson are hilarious) charleze theron is probably the best antagonist the series has had so far and in my opinion she gives the best performance here. i just wish we had a little more background on her character and got to see her in a vehicle instead of just watching her plodding around her plane barking orders at her minions with her little headset. but hey fast9 is already in production right so maybe we'l see more of her?i give fast8 a 7/10. it isn't the best entry in the series but it certainly isn't the worst. it's just slightly let down by a sub par story, far too ridiculous stunts that border on laughable and some weak effects here and there. but if you love f&f you'l have a good time with this.",The Fate of the Furious

Aside from driving a car that's on fire, Dom and the others also have to defeat a tank being controlled by our antagonist Cipher. I liked that this one had more comedic scenes in it and the reason Dom goes rogue makes so much sense. It had been something I was wondering about since I first saw the trailers. Still, there was something about the focus being on Dom and how much of an unstoppable badass he is that really made it different from the others. My favorite scenes were with Jason StathamAs to why it fell through for me, Dom getting center stage instead of the whole family aspect (even though it had a glaringly obvious family aspect thrown in) and it trying to fit into a genre it isn't. This is a car racing and action movie and there weren't many cars or racing like some of its predecessors By the end of it I couldn't help wondering what could happen next.

Without giving too much away, a hated villain who had taken innocent lives - and threatened many others - returns as a good guy. It's beyond inane. The franchise had always been more about testosterone than plot, but this twist is beyond stupid.Adding insult to injury is the back-and-forth ""banter"" between the two main characters. Hobbs (The Rock) apparently has multiple personality disorder, because we see him go from a capable, disciplined military leader to a petty, insecure ""bro"" to a quirky, lovable father figure. It's like they cast 3 different people for one role.Oh, and lastly - a pair of gratuitous cameos that felt like very small bit parts. Kevin James and Deadpool - errrr, Ryan Reynolds - both show up long enough to bring some humor into the movie, but quickly wear out their welcome.This movie should be titled: ""F8 - The Bro Dudes"". It's very apparent that this franchise has devolved into millionaire actors with too much testosterone playing with their toys.",The Fate of the Furious

316,timothyalanwilliams,"""Fate"" Is More Ridiculous Than Furious",6,7 June 2017,"I remember seeing the preview for ""The Fast and The Furious"" back in 2001 and thinking ""That movie is gonna bomb! Who wants to watch a movie about street car racing?"" Little did I know that a movie studio's idea of re-imaging the cult classic, ""Point Break"", with street cars instead of surf boards would turn into a box office hit and make Paul Walker and Vin Diesel household names. Diesel and director Rob Cohen abandoned the sequel, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" with Walker starring and John Singleton directing. It couldn't match the success of the original and most thought the franchise was over. Then up-and-coming director, Justin Lin, attempted to breathe life back into franchise with a whole new cast on a new continent with ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". Although the film bombed at the box office, Vin Diesel saw potential and inked a deal with Paramount to get the original cast back together with Lin directing and shifted from just a street racing movie to more of a straight-up action flick. 2009's ""Fast & Furious"" was the revival no one saw coming and jump started the franchise...uh, so to speak. Each sequel after (""Fast Five"", ""Fast & Furious 6"", and ""Furious 7"") got bigger, bolder, and, at times, to more ridiculous than furious. But each one dominated the box office and turned out to be quite entertaining popcorn flicks. After the tearful farewell to Paul Walker (who died tragically during a break in filming) at the end of 7, I wasn't quite sure how the franchise would move on. The bond and chemistry of Walker and Diesel were the key components of the previous movies' success. And I have to say, ""The Fate of the Furious"" suffers from Paul's absence. The movie is still full of action, and even more street racing and car chases than the last few movies. But that's no surprise with new-to-the-franchise director F. Gary Gray who took movie car chases to a new level in ""The Italian Job"". But even with those cool car chases, The Rock going toe-to-toe (again) with Jason Statham, and new villain Charlize Theron, ""The Fate of the Furious"" feels like it's running out of gas. If you are looking for a solid story line, this isn't for you. But if you just want some ludicrous action (pardon my pun), some amusing wise-cracks from Tyrese Gibson, and a hint of high-tech hi-jinks to save the world from a ruthless hacker then 8 just might be in your fate, Side Note: I am hoping that The Rock gets his own spin-off movie based his ""Luke Hobbs"" character, because he is becoming bigger than this franchise can handle.",The Fate of the Furious
317,BklynBryanCM,Soap Opera that needs to go Back to Racing Cars!!!,6,14 April 2017,"Fate was a step back from Furious 7. Honestly the series should have ended after F7. Only 1,3,5, & 7 were good films. Fast 8 attempted to one up F7 with bigger stunts, explosions, & action. But F8 lacked heart. Too much Soap Opera style drama/ forced drama. YES we go to these movies to see Action, but some plots like ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is cliché. Deckhard Shaw killed Han!! Now they are going to Team Up?? Bring Han back from the dead just like Letty then F8 will make sense. Cipher is not an established or strong villain at all. They gave no back story about her. The Fast/ Furious series is Not the same without Paul Walker. They should bring back Agent Fuentes and Sean Boswell for #F9. I doubt Dwayne Johnson will return for F9 or F10 (he will just do the Hobbs spin off). F&F needs to stop All the Globe Trotting and go back to its single location/ setting roots (1-3). F8 was OK, but could have been much much better!! The Fast 8 crew somehow morphed into The Avengers as they seem to be superhuman and invincible.

319,Kubricksboy,The First Good Popcorn Film of the Year,7,13 April 2017,"Actions speak louder than words. In the case of this film, you wouldn't want the words to speak at all because everything that's said in the film is either super-mundane or outright gibberish. (Except the English stuff, of course.) But that doesn't derail film at all. It's almost as if the film's saying, ""If you want word play, go watch a Sorkin film. We provide over the top action, which goes well with the popcorn."" And they keep their promises. What we get is over the top (or under the bottom) action in its most glorious attire. It doesn't always make sense, but one doesn't really care as long as colorful cars are flying against the orange filled backdrop of the screen.There are more cars in this one than there were in the last (If we are really counting there are more cars in this than there were in all of the preceding Fast and Furious films.) There's more action, more actors, more villains turning into good guys, and one plot point that we didn't give a rat's ass about from one of the previous films. They ended up making an entire film which will probably end up making a billion dollars on that one plot point. But the film still holds up, remember there's a submarine chasing ridiculously expensive and fast cars on a frozen lake in this film.'We are Action films and we only want one thing: Nuclear codes.' That's not really true. What you want is to fool the film-goers and make money out of it. We are okay with paying money for that, but can you change the lie from time to time. You have submarine chases and rogue demolition balls. Why stop there, you are already over the top. Tear Antarctica in half or something, but stop with the quest for Nuclear codes. The film is still good, though, because Dwayne Johnson says ""I'll punch your teeth so deep inside you that you can brush them from your ass.""Now, let's get to the good stuff: Jason Statham talking to a baby in an English accent. Jason Statham jumping up and down and breaking prisoners like they are matchsticks. Jason Statham talking to The Rock or his Mum. Jason Statham simply talking. I never thought I would say all these thing about Jason Statham, but he was good and I'm just telling it as it is.To round up, this is a better film than its predecessor, but not a good film all around. This a popcorn film in full throttle, and if your argument for it being bad is 'bad color palette' or 'inconsistent story structure' or 'it lacks heart' or any of those artistic aspects with which you generally judge a film by, I got one thing to say to you: You're watching it wrong.

322,ryanmkincaid,A problematic re-introduction to the franchise,6,21 May 2017,"The issues in this re-entry into the Walker-less franchise are too many to count. So I'll point out the problems in hopes that the next installment correct these gaping plot problems:1. Deckard Shaw killed Han so now Dom forgives him for that? Hard to shallow.2. The NYC sequence was horrible. First of all NYC traffic is absolutely horrible from sun up to sun down. Those birds eye views of semi empty streets is pure fantasy. The draw of shooting in NYC is what imaginary way will the director/writer/crew choreograph chase sequences in a metropolis where it's bumper to bumper car and foot traffic all the time. The production saying that they are filming in NYC proved that they really didn't need to film here at all because the sequence was unimaginative.3. Following up the NYC sequence is the absolute absurdity that a hacker can remotely control hundreds of cars simultaneously. There are just not that many cars that are hack-able on the road. That sequence is at least 50 years off. 4. Dom naming his son Brian? Would have been better fitting to name him Paul. Brain is still alive in this universe. The characters even mention contacting Brian and Mia in the beginning of the film. It's understandable that the franchise would want to honor Paul Walker and his character but to name your kid after your ""STILL- ALIVE"" brother-in-law is forced. Had the character been killed off in the previous film then naming him so would be fine. Here it's reaching, and in the most imaginative way. Naming the son Paul, however, accomplishes EXACTLY what the franchise wants. Plus the audience is smart enough to get it.5. Figure out how to reintroduce Lucas Black/Tokyo Drift cast back into the franchise.",The Fate of the Furious

I mean come on it's F&F, if you're going to sit there and think about plot holes and some stunts then you're going to miss the fun.I have read some of the reviews here, and I am wondering why people can't take the movie for what it is? It's not supposed to be accurate, and realistic, and believable. Do you really think the Potter universe exists when you see the movies? The last dialog of the movie sums up everything, trust me it does. It had an uncanny resemblance to Vin Deisel's real life. ""That was the greatest tribute I could give to the man off-screen.

324,pniemeyer-47222,I am a convert,7,8 May 2017,"I used to scoff, but now I am grinning. For a while, I purposely ignored this series. Then I learned that Kurt Russell would be in the seventh one, and decided to check that out. (I'm, um, a rather big fan of his.) That film was dumb, cartoony, and still a solid action outing. This film doesn't take itself quite as seriously, and like the series itself, is essentially the movie equivalent of In-N-Out Burger. It's not brain food, but for what it is, it's pretty damn good.Most action franchises tend to rise and fall based on the strength of their villains. Well, they've got a good one here. Charlize Theron is having the time of her life here. I wasn't quite clear on her motives (something about stealing nuclear launch codes to start World War III because...reasons), yet that hardly seemed to matter. She's got something on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), and that's enough to get him to do things that seem completely out of character. I won't spoil anything, except to say that the film nonetheless reaffirms the series' dedication to found family and the importance of having your friends' backs.The Rock is a very likable actor, so it's a shame that he doesn't appear in good films more often. This film brings back Jason Statham's cockney villain from the previous installment, then lets him and Dwayne Johnson have a sort of rivalry-turned-begrudging-respect- turned-bromance relationship that is impossible to watch without smiling. (Also, have you ever wanted to watch The Rock coach a girls' soccer team? Don't give me that; of course you have.) I'm starting to wonder if this series is starting to wind down, as more of its characters seem to be starting biological families in addition to the metaphorical ones that they drive fast cars and save the world with.The climax of this movie features a submarine, missiles, a car with 5,000 horsepower, and a lot of green screen effects. The only weak point of the movie is a chase scene in New York, which just feels a bit rote compared to some of the other set pieces. (Maybe I'm just getting tired of watching so many cars crash.) And I haven't even mentioned Helen Mirren's brief appearance, which you should not take seriously, not even for a minute. If this film doesn't sound like your thing, it's not.

327,Shred_Master,They are showing signs of franchise fatigue once more,6,16 April 2017,"I remember the original movie. It was innovative, fresh and a very decent action flick. I was not too impressed with the sequel, or the 2 that followed. They re-ignited the spark with Fast Five and stayed solid for another 2 subsequent movies. This time around, I'm feeling that familiar ""meh"" once again.The first problem is, you already know the entire plot and every action scene before the movie starts. This is due to the relentless marketing in the form of the trailers. It's not like you could have escaped it either. If you've been to the movies at all or have watched TV n the past 6 months, you have seen the trailers multiple times. There were no real surprises. The only thing that the trailers didn't tell you is the reason why Dom is now working for the enemy, Cypher (Theron). The reason why I marked this one with spoilers - turns out, his girlfriend from when Letty was presumed dead and then she was alive but without her memory (can't remember her name ATM) was pregnant with Dom's child. Cypher was holding her and his son captive.As far as the action scenes themselves, it's more of the same. Ridiculous, over the top and pushing the boundaries of believability, even more so this time around than before and predictable. Even if much of the plot hadn't been given away from the trailers, the parts that fill in the blanks were predictable as well. There was a part in the finale as well that I saw coming from miles away. Another spoiler - Dom's son is rescued from Cypher. His ex told him that she wanted the father to name him. As soon as she said that, I said let me guess, Brian. Sure enough, just before the credits roll, he said ""Everyone, let me introduce you to...Brian. It was an obvious Easter egg tribute to the late Paul Walker but instead of making it a subtle nod, it was a cheesy, eye rolling moment, due to it being so cheesy, on the nose and predictable.I know that this movie is supposed to be all action and lacking much in the way of sense but they seem to have pushed the envelope too far this time around. In the last 3 movies, they manage to find a good balance of car chases, fight scenes and maybe the plot was over the top but not to the point where it exists in an alternate dimension. Not the case this time around. The movie is already doing really well and that's no surprise. The truth is though, the filmmakers have this notion that the franchise is bulletproof and no matter what they churn out, it will be a success. That is probably true but the realist in me is saying that they should revisit the formula again, because there's only so much turning off of the brain that the audience can take.",The Fate of the Furious

330,honestly22,"Put the sick dog down, please.",5,30 April 2017,"Yeah, no. I went in with low expectations, and I still came out disappointed. Why are we here? What is the appeal? The story was trash, the effects were rubbish and the repetitive slow motion was enough to make me puke.Why are we here? The only true enjoyable facets of this ""movie"" were the locations. Seeing Cuba was refreshing; as it's not really a common location for films, but this isn't enough to sustain a franchise. It seems at this point all the writers are doing is putting dumb plot points into a hat and pulling them out to create a story, then chucking in location names and writing a script based on this. This franchise is dead, put it down and move on. Make a spin off franchise. Stop making Fast and Fates Of The Furious 5's because this is boring. So boring. Dumb!",The Fate of the Furious
331,talizen,Very good and entertaining,7,30 April 2017,"Fast & Furious 8 was very good but I wouldn't say it was the best or the greatest but it was very good and entertaining. The storyline was pretty good, linking the previous Fast & Furious films from 4 to 8 (minus 5). Charlize Theron's did an outstanding job as villain, very pure evil her character. It's quite cliché for villains to use extreme weapons like nukes to rule world to show what they're capable of. Its Charlize Theron's second villain role since 2012's Snow White and the 2016 spin-off, the Huntsman movie as the evil Queen. One of the reason's I watched Fast 8 is mostly because of my three favourite actors; Kurt Russell, Dwayne Johnson and my favourite ever, Jason Statham. The movie felt different without Paul Walker but it had a good tribute at the end when Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) named his baby son, Brian. Other than that, the movie was very good.",The Fate of the Furious
332,indieke,The future not looks very bright,3,12 June 2017,"OMG. What kind of mess is this? If you see today the first F&F, was about friendship, family and racing. A lot in common with ""point break"", and it all made some sense with great cars, women and fun. Diesel not seemed so much interested in follow up until the nr 4 came along, and got the original cast together, with some new faces.When the plot became less realistic, there was still a ""fun"" factor in it and the chemistry of Paul Walker, against the coolness of Vin. But every movie charm became less,action more important, even if the action would make no sense. Nothing wrong with action, but nothing was credible any more, and from the 6 it really became really brainless.Of course I miss Walker in this. But even his presence would not have changed the fact the story made no sense at all. Ennemies from yesterday, who killed team mates, blow up a hospital, killed innocent people, become the savior of your child and your best buddy. Nuclear codes are given away, cars start to drive by themselves, and all is so unbelievable, that it takes away all your interest. What do you care what is happening when everything that is happening seems impossible? Why not add living dead or something more spectacular, all for the glory of unrealistic action. Wait, I can like that, in a Van Damme movie, but this was originally a movie about roque street-racers.When you make a story, when nothing is believable, even kids will turn away. A hero is NOT in danger, if he survives the most unbelievable situations and so take away the suspense. You can make action and fun that is a bit more believable. That made the originally Bourne movies stand out.Replacing Paul Walker, by Eastwood's boy, could have been a good idea, if even this poor guy could act. Gone Walker's smile and humor, but instead a tense actor, who seems to have a carrot in his ass. His nice blue eyes not save his performance.Nothing against action, some exaggeration, but some logical, where you can care for the heroes. No, it is more a ""soap opera"", then a thrilling movie. The future not looks very bright.",The Fate of the Furious
333,Gloobey,So now we know...,5,4 May 2017,"For the record, not being a gear head, I had little to no interest at all in the first four or so Fast & Furious movies. No, I came to them around movie five and up until now the seventh instalment had been easily the best. Very, very dumb but oh so very enjoyable. I had wondered, though, how they could possibly outdo the over-the-top nonsense we were fed in part seven. How could they possibly walk the line between dumb and just plain stupid? Could they go even more bonkers and still just about - but only just about! - have us willingly suspend our disbelief long enough to be able to enjoy the damn thing? Was that even possible...? Well, now we know. The answer is sadly no.I really did want to engage with this movie in a meaningful way, IMAX 3D and all. But it was just too dumb. From a shower of driver-less cars to pushing torpedoes away with your bare hands to...oh, I don't know what else. No matter how dumb a movie is, there has to be something we can believe in, right? Well, not this time out. No spoilers here, see it for yourself - yes, really - but don't say you weren't warned...",The Fate of the Furious
334,rohan-mahey,This is my personal opinion on this film.,6,1 May 2017,"So this film has changed my views on the fast and furious franchise. This film has done an alright job on to why Vin Diesels character (even though his character is originally a villain (see the first fast and furious film) but does that count). Now the action,the action was brilliant especially the hand to hand choreography. But there was on flaw and stupid moment to me. That one flaw was the New York zombie car scene it just didn't appeal to me that much and i thought it was stupid. The best action scene was the jail scene cause you just see Jason Statham character beating the prison guards as he is running away from Dwayne Johnson's character who is chasing him. Now the best thing in the film were the insults their characters made they were pretty funny one of them were something like and i quote "" I will kick your teeth so far down your body you will need stick your toothbrush up your ass hole to brush them"" that was funny right? That insult came from Dwayne Johnson's character. Overall i gave it a 9 out of 10 as i just needed a little bit more convincing that Vin Diesel's character was a bad guy. But now something comes to mind at the end of the film when they are at their new apartment everyone just forgave his character even the rocks and the nobody team. With the rock his character nearly killed him and with the nobody squad he blew up their base of operations. So yeah that's why i gave it an 9 out of 10.",The Fate of the Furious

336,Eshan_2110,A surprisingly decent entry,8,13 April 2017,"After the beautiful yet tragic ending of Fast 7, I didn't think this franchise should be touched again. Yet it made over a billion dollars at the worldwide box office and became the 5th highest grossing film of 2015. This made it somewhat inevitable that another film would be released, and this news did initially disappoint me. However, I can safely say I enjoyed The Fate of the Furious way more than I thought I would. In fact, it's probably the most enjoyable entry into the franchise, even despite how different it feels. The 8th instalment is directed by F. Gary Gary, an experienced director who has directed The Italian Job (2003) and the more recently, Straight Outta Compton (2015). F8 represents a far different film, in the sense of the sheer scale and budget. It is without a doubt the biggest and craziest film in the franchise. He handles the directorial duties very well, blending the action and heart into its 2-hour runtime. I thought the pacing of the film was decent, however after the first act, the film sort of just doesn't stop. This is arguably a good thing, as we don't watch these films for intricate narratives, but rather the spectacle. However, I sometimes felt confused on why things were happening or characters choices as the film progresses quite quickly. The editing of the film helped give a clear perspective even despite all the high-octane action. I also enjoyed how the text was overlaid onto the film to help the establish the locations. The narrative itself is full of some interesting plot points as we learn why Dom has turned dark. I think the important thing is that the revelation is very much in line with the character's behaviour and moral code. In this regard, the whole scenario of Dom becoming the antagonist feels less surreal. It also created an interesting dynamic as to how each member of the team handles his betrayal. It is the characters of this franchise that make it special to me. It goes without saying that Paul Walker's absence is felt. But it makes sense in terms of character development that Brian isn't featured. It is most certainly addressed in the film too. Brian's absence allows for the rest of the cast to shine, particularly Tyreese Gibson, Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson. I felt the three of these characters and the way they interact with one another made the film. The new additions of Charlize Theron as Cipher, Scott Eastwood as Little Nobody and Hellen Mirren as Magdalene Shaw worked and help to expand this world. Cipher's goals are slightly one dimensional but Theron's performance is decent and she manages to become quite fearsome. The action sequences featuring vehicles were not as enjoyable in this film for myself, apart from the scene in Cuba. The hand-to-hand scenes although were fantastic. The prison sequence in particular was sublime and really allowed Jason Statham to show his action prowess and why he is so suited to this ever-changing series. As well as characters, it is the locales and music featured in the franchise that also make it so animated and vibrant. In this series, Cuba is the standout and it is beautifully captured. The New York sequence is probably the weakest part of the movie, because it just felt a tad silly, even despite a submarine appearing in the last act. The soundtrack by Brian Tyler was as energetic as you'd expect and really did compliment the action. Now this is a strange statement, but the film didn't always feel like a Fast and Furious film but I don't think it was a bad thing whatsoever. Since Fast 5, the films have been broadening their roots, from heists to spy films and this one most certainly felt like a pure action film. With that said, it brought the right amount of humour, heart, and action that I needed. Don't get me wrong this film is absurdly cheesy and over the top, but that's why I enjoyed it so much.",The Fate of the Furious
337,fmh_markbuys,Fast & waste of money,1,12 August 2017,"Unfortunately Fast & Furious 8 is by far the worst movie I have seen this year. I have a great fantasy, however the creator of this movie is gifted a wider fantasy. The movie starts in Cuba with a bad car race en ends up at the table together with the family. Self driving cars, self flying cars, people flying like superman, a Russian Submarine which all in a sudden can reach a speed + 100 Mph and so on. Vin Diesel who runs over to the bad guys, Jason Statham who is now the good guy and so on. The only funny character in this movie was actually Jason Statham.The first teasers of this movie indicated it was not worth going for to the cinema. Viewing this movie at home and wasted almost 14 euros, I am glad I did not wasted my money in cinema.Fast & Furious 7 was a good movie to close the Fast & Furious editions, number 8 is a complete disaster. Please do not embarasse yourself by producing number 9......",The Fate of the Furious
338,theresamansweto,"Another fast and furious movie, did it work ?",7,13 April 2017,"The Fate Of The Furious Movie Review!Movie: Now this movie has been really hyped up lately, well the whole franchise is usually really hyped up anyway but that is really critical for the movie because sometimes they are not as great as the hype that is produced. Now in my honest opinion, the fast and furious franchise should of stopped at fast 7, mainly because the way they ended it was just right, but I guess they just had to make another one because people go crazy over Fast and Furious movies no matter what the plot is, really in my opinion I do not have a clue on how Fast and furious went from racing to racing away on ice in Lamborghini's and race cars and getting shot my the Russian military in the Russian military base and going top speed driving away from a submarine under the ice which is sub zero temperatures while missiles are also getting aimed at them and saving the world from a girl who is going to nuke the world or something? The movies are gradually getting more and more intense in each movie. I can say the movie was entertaining but also there were parts to the movie that weren't great.Actors & Directors : One thing about Fast & Furious is the main cast and actors in the movie, which in my opinion are all magnificent. Lets talk about Tyrese first. Tyrese is usually the humorous character in the team, sometimes he can be cheesy but in Fast and furious 8 I think he was pretty funny, it wasn't very forced jokes, it was just funny, I liked him a lot. Next we have Vin Diesel, now Vin is a very confusing character throughout the movie, as people who have seen the trailer, he turns his back on his "" family "", but ill explain that later, overall he was good, I guess just like how he was for the whole franchise. "" Luke Hobbs "" aka Dwayne "" the rock "" Johnson which is one of my favorites was just his usual self, his character wasn't really that involved within the plot really, but I really like his character. Next Jason Stratham, another one of my personal favorite actors, really he is the highlight of this movie, it wouldn't have been as great without him in it, he was my favorite character. Like as soon as you see Jason Stratham in a movie you already know bodies are going to drop left, right and center, he is just magnificent, his character was something the movie really needed. Ludicrous is the well known hacker in the movie, really his just the same within all of the franchise has the hacker personality, drives fancy cars, and is always messing around with Tyrese. Scott Eastwood in the movie?  I think he can borrow a bit of talent from his father.F. F. Gary one of my favorite directors showed good skills in this movie but needed some work.Plot: Now, plot was a big thing for this movie. What the movie is about is Vin Diesel's character "" Dom"" turns his back on his crew, and becomes bad, and ow the Fast and furious crew have to stop him blah, blah, blah. Now we know that but we have no complication whatsoever, it kind of ruins the film, it's kind of the case of what happened with Batman v Superman Dawn of justice ( not a spoiler ). There is no reason why he turned on his "" family "" which gave a downfall to the movie. The enemy within the film ( Charlize Theron ) was just the typical I'm going to do this, I got this, I'm evil and whatsoever but the way she was "" defeated "" wasn't good. This is all usually distracted by all the bad ass events that happens follows within the film.Editing: Editing is something crucial for the fast and furious series, and for this movie they nailed it. Surprisingly they didn't have that much music to go with the fight scenes and editing, which is something Fast and furious is known to do but there is nothing to complain about editing wise.Feedback: Overall; if you are the type of person that doesn't want to spend their money in the cinemas to watch another fast and furious, you don't need to rush to cinemas to watch it, although you can wait to the DVD release and watch because This movie was quite entertaining, it was quite a entertaining 2 hours for me. If you are a fast and furious fan go see the movie it is not bad in my opinion, really its just another fast and furious movie but it always has something in there to make it different. People might wonder: Is Fate of the furious the best in the fast and furious franchise? Ow even through I have only watched fast 6, 7, and 8 in my opinion 7 was better for several reasons. My questions about the film: How come no matter what situation the crew is in, there is always a button in their cars to get them out of it? question 2 : How do they always have something in their car to make them go faster? Question 3: How do the people in the film think so damn fast ? I rate the fate of the furious a 7/10.

339,gorillaz-96353,Steve's Film Page on Facebook,7,31 May 2017,"My hopes were less than fully realized, but my concerns were more than quelled. The Fate of the Furious did not quite measure up to the most recent installments, but it proved that this franchise can survive adversity. Strained relationships amongst several actors and the absence of a key character did little to hurt the quality of this film. The character development I longed for was lacking, but the thrills were not. I will place blame partially with the director, F. Gary Gray. Certainly a competent director, but an ill fit for this series. I much preferred James Wan and the less contrived Furious 7. Did I want a little more? Sure. But was I satisfied, nonetheless? Absolutely. Verdict: RENT IT. Expect more of the same. That is to say, exciting action sequences and a pleasantly comfortable return to Toretto's family values. By the way, did anyone believe that was Manhattan? 7/10 — ￼ watching Fast and Furious 8: The Fate of the Furious.",The Fate of the Furious
340,bratxja,Fast and boring,4,23 August 2017,"The Fate of the Furious is the eighth movie in franchise. And I expected more. More I don't know. For me Fast and Furious ""in one harness"" with Pirates of the Caribbean. Yes, I understand, that they very different, but both have such atmosphere of adventure and action So, I like them all. When many observers said that Pirates are the bottom of the franchise, but new Fast is superb, I was delighted. I liked the last Pirates, so Fast should be excellent! But you read the heading and must understand – that's not true.(this review contains spoilers!!!)Citius, Altius, Fortius! (Olympic motto)Main problem pf the movie – it is boring. Really, don't understand. In the movie from which you expect action, action and only action this action is not interesting. Paradoxically. There are several interesting moments, for example race in the beginning, some moments on the Russian military base. But all this flow of action flashes before eyes. And you are getting bored. Creators tried to put in movie more and more action, that it became a problem. Old, old Diesel and his frenemyFor me Diesel is an actor of one role. He played himself. Man of the rock. But deep inside, he is very empathic. This is problem for many actors, that ""find"" their best roles and then play only them. But in Fast 8 you understand, how did Diesel got older. How old is he? Okay, wiki 50! Sometimes camera was shooting him from different angles and you see this. Fast 8 shows, that a few more films and Diesel must change his ""emploi"" on scene. But he is good now. And he is first of the two reasons to watch movie. Second reason is Jason Statham. He is a bright spot on this film.Other comrades of Diesel can be characterized as The ROCK! I'm sorry, Dwayne Johnson, two Afro-Americans, smart girl, always dissatisfied Michelle Rodriguez and Kurt Russel's guy. That's all, what's left after ""10 friends of Diesel"" from previous parts. Character of Dwayne Johnson turned out to be uninteresting in this part. Agree, if the dancing of Maori's haka with thirteen-year girls was only interesting moment for Hobbs, that means something.Main villain (or Charlize Theron) was interesting character, but only on the beginning. Charming and incomprehensible she ceased to be after several scenes with her. This is problem of the script, not Charlize. When villain only sitting indoors with computers and saying strange things - it is bad. Bad for image of villain. And her assistant - Kristofer Hivju (that red-beard guy from Game of the thrones). I understand that you can make terrible face. For a script you are nothing. Script, script, scriptThis time writers decided to be original. Trailer told us, that Diesel is turning to evil. But in fact, all this is more prosaic. Yes, Diesel is forced to be evil. But because his son and some woman were captured by Charlize Theron. I didn't re-watch all 7 films, so really, who is this woman? And why nobody didn't know about his son? It's like ""Dom, where are you going?"" ""I'm going for carrot. Will be late!"" Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) – his beloved – didn't know anything? But main villain knew!And main question – why does she need Diesel? Does she have no money to pay for good specialists? But she have own plane with group of special forces. So, she have money. She sent Diesel himself on different tasks (important tasks). If he fails, the operation failed. What motivated the villain to such behavior? Because we need a conflict. And we need Diesel. So, script is simple with some rudiments of intrigue. What are good in movie – that are shooting and cars. Scene on the Russian military base in the winter – beautiful.But as a result, the whole movie is boring. 4/10",The Fate of the Furious

I felt other movies in the series allowed everyone in the cast their moment to shine, but the ensemble here is now far too big with too many super stars like Vin, and the Rock and Jason Statham and brand new Charlize Theron as an incredible villain. This leaves most of the other cast under used, like Tyrese Gibson who was funny, but it was all one liner after one liner without Roman Pearce doing anything.Still, it's one of the best blockbusters of the year.

344,Ricky112101,Solid action movie with a few flaws,7,18 December 2017,"This movie is pure action movie. It features car chases, explosions, gun fights, and even submarine warfare. This series sure has come a long way since the first film came out in 2001. ""The Fate of the Furious"" pits stars Vin Diesel against his crew (Dwayne Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, etc.) due to a mysterious woman (Charlize Theron) holding something against him.We aren't told immediately why Dom (Diesel) is doing this, but we get a plot twist later on in the film that was interesting, but disappointing at the same time. But without this plot twist, we have a completely different movie, so it is essential to the plot and story I guess.Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham were awesome in this movie. The scenes between these specific two were some of my favorite. The exceptionally cheesy but awesome prison fight was among my favorite scenes in the movie. However, we have some really ridiculous scenes involving Dwayne Johnson picking up a torpedo with his bare hands while inside a movie vehicle on ice and flinging that torpedo at enemies is over the top (but awesome too) and a scene where sports cars outrun a giant military submarine. Some of the acting was sub par for the series, but it wasn't bad necessarily. Overall, this is a solid action movie, and if you are a fan of the others in the series, you will like this one.",The Fate of the Furious
345,daddyxj-1,Still Got Plenty of Fuel But Fuel Needle is Starting to Lower,8,22 April 2017,"Furious 7 had one the best conclusions for a film series ever. I and was perfectly happy if the series ended there and continued with spin-offs or hell even a Netflix TV show. But the almighty dollar wants these films to continue. I really had my doubts going into this film. I didn't think the series had any fuel left. The story arch in the last 3 films was complete. What else can we tell now that the main antagonist was no longer in the series? Well, I was wrong, really wrong, I was very surprised by this movie, surprised to the fact that I was very entertained and had as much fun as I had with this series since Tokyo Drift (yes I liked Tokyo Drift). The main driving point of the story (which the trailers express) of Dom going rouge was a valid plot point and with a twist to the series that worked. What I liked about the film was the main plot device and of course the action. All the action scenes were all fun to watch (personally, I like the opening sequence best) But this movie delivered on what it promises and that's over the top action. At one point our anti- heroes seemed like superheroes who drive in their own ""Batmobiles"" and ride to the rescue.What I didn't like was fact that a couple of action scenes were fun but very ridiculous and somewhat didn't work for me. And one of the characters in the film has an arch that just betrays the last two films and makes you question the motive of others. But on the downside, the franchise will run out of fuel soon and start to get that ""been there, done that"" feel to it that will make the next films seem boring. You somewhat feel that in the climax of this film but it's the main plot point that keeps the action scene lifted because you know it's coming just when and how keeps you invested.All in all the movie was really good and you will be entertained and I would rank it as well as parts 5, 6 and 7 but the finish line is near and I feel the next films (I read 2 more are coming) will not have enough fuel to make to the finish line. Will the next films kick in the NOS and project us to the finish line...I really do hope so.",The Fate of the Furious
346,sohylejain,The legacy continues...,9,14 April 2017,"After seeing all the Fast and Furious movies I can proudly say that ""The Fate of the Furious"" has rightfully lived up to that mark. After 'Furious 7' they came back with this one and for true fans, it is completely fulfilling and buck worthy. If someone is not a regular follower of 'The Fast and Furious' movies, then this movie isn't for you. And that is when one can expect negative reviews. This movie has everything you want to see in a 'Fast and Furious' movie. This eight installment has the Latino songs, sexy cars, breathtaking action, top-notch humor and some 'wow' moments indeed. The movie starts with Vin Diesel(Dom) and Michelle Rodriguez(Letty) who are having their honeymoon when a mysterious woman Cipher(Charlize Theron) appears from nowhere and convinces Dom to work against his team. That is how the story rolls. Dwayne Walker(Luke Hobbs), Michelle Rodriguez(Letty), Christopher Bridges(Tej), Tyrese Gibson(Roman), Nathalie Emmanuel(Ramsey) and Jason Statham(Deckard Shaw) all go against Dom and Cipher. Now, are they able to bring back the person who brought them together in the first place or not is the question? The comic element offered by Tyrese made the viewers burst into laughter every now and then. Although he was laughed at all the time but in the later half of the movie he too showed some zeal along with his friends which you cannot miss. The fans might also think that Dom portraying as a villain is a setback but his negative change has a very strong reason which I won't give out easily. If you don't miss Paul Walker(Brian) in this movie you ain't a real fan. It has been difficult for the director F. Gary Gray and writer Chris Morgan to come up with a different story line and it is visible at times, but they have done a wonderful job indeed. Not giving out spoilers is quite though for this movie but one thing I would like to state that this is a must watch not only for the fans of this franchise but who are also a fan of Paul. If you are not looking forward to this because Paul ain't there then it is a blunder. The movie is just like another Fast and Furious movie raining down cars, sweet music, and high-flying action. Not an upset in any way. One of the best moments of the movie is the climax. Don't watch it if you expect something much more than which one should expect from this franchise. Don't miss it if you are a 'real' fan and not a 'fake' one. You will love it. A strong 9 stars out of 10 from my side. It did make my day.

There are a lot of surprises and twists that add more elements of enjoyment to the movie The reason behind the fact that Dom has turned his back on his family really a very powerful strong reason and this is one point that I was so worried about and I was really waiting to know the reason and I was afraid it won't be a good reason . The reason was very strong that even if any of us was in his place he would have done exactly like him and this one of the enjoyable element in the movie . The Action I can't say no more , there is nothing like Fast and Furious in the action scenes , the ideas they create in each new chapter always make you looking forward to know what they can do more , what are the new thrilling ideas they will add in each chapter . Last point is the last scene of the movie that I don't want to talk about here so I won't uncover all the surprises in the movie however whoever will see the last will understand the beauty of it , specially those who are fan of Paul Walker like me, may his soul rest in eternal peace .In the end great thanks to all who had participated in this chapter specially the writers who wrote something solid , connected and strong .

353,cmtrisket,"The Fate of the Furious, Honest Review",8,7 June 2017,"Where to start, where to start! The quick, dirty, and simple review is if you liked the OTHER 7 MOVIES you will love this one. I feel like if I left it at that this would be a bad post, but you would have all of the information you need haha.We can start this one with some logistics. The movie itself is listed a 136 minutes (2h 16min) and like the other movies it doesn't seem long at all. It is again in that sweet spot , time wise. On top of the main actors from the main set of movies they have since added Dwayne Johnson, and Jason Statham. I was skeptical when they introduced both of them. Jason Statham is one of my all time favorite actors, and I was wondering how they would incorporate him, since in his movies he always wins. He has that persona about him, so seeing him in other movies where he isn't the main lead is interesting. ""The Rock"" has burst into acting and has done a few movies, but nothing great. Although I think they made him perfectly as a character in these movies. As of this movie They added another big name actor, picking up Charlize Theron as the main protagonist. Lastly as far as actors go I was very surprised and had weird feelings about Kristofer Hivju being in the film as a bad guy. This might only be me but he will always be the Wyndham Rewards Wizard from the TV commercials haha.This movie starts in Cuba where Dom (Vin Diesel) is coerced to work with the mysterious Cipher (Charlize Theron). She has him working with her on what would be a terrorist type of attack. In the process of doing so he has to turn his back on his family and friends. If you follow the series you know already that that is a huge deal. Dom's crew is left confused and concerned for him. They don't know why he would do something like he did, but they are determined to find out. Like most of the movies they strive the whole time to stay true to themselves and deal with problems as they come. This movie is highly packed with cinematic action like you would expect and has you on the edge of your seat most of the time. I'll leave it at that, because if I say anything else I'd be saying too much. 😀 The movies have evolved since the first one. They started out being just about street racing, petty crime, and strong family bonds. They now have more developed plots, that take them around the world fighting crime. It sounds weird saying that since they originally weren't considered the greatest people. They were poor city residents doing what they could to survive and breaking every law along the way. They have done a great job keeping the crew, separate but equal to the law enforcing side of Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). They always keep their street edge, and their no regard for the rules attitude. I think behind the scenes it has been a big help that this franchise has a huge cult like following. They have been able to pull in big money. That has in turn enabled them to make bigger and better movies and keep the same cast while adding great supporting roles.The franchise did take a huge hit with the death of Paul Walker during the filming of the 7th movie. That is obvious, and I wasn't really sure how they were going to handle it. I mean think about it, they had, then, seven successful movies. They could have ended it right there, but they chose not to, and I for one am OK with that. They never killed Brian's (Paul Walker) character off, they just sent him away with his family. That being said he is referenced a few times in touching ways throughout this 8th movie.To sum this up, there are people who have hated on this franchise from day one and that's OK. Those people would not enjoy this movie. There are people who haven't seen any of the other movies, I would urge them not to watch this one first. 😉 Then there are people who have at some point or another seen all of the other movies. To those people I would say it is a must watch. Once you find yourself immersed in this franchise you don't want it to end. Sure at times it is cheesy, but that's what makes it a bit fun. These movies, while kicking up some emotion, don't really leave you thinking about the real world. You can watch these movies and just have a good relaxing time.Regarding the time line of the movies, I'll refer you to this link. Warning that link contains spoilers. It is older but still stands mostly true. The franchise is messed up worse than ""Star Wars"" when it comes to the order of the movies. I saw one guy splicing 3 movies at one time making it all make sense that way haha.Anyway, since I am a fanboy of the franchise, and have a place for it in my heart, I have rated it a bit higher than most.I personally give this movie a 8/10.",The Fate of the Furious

I can't describe how poorly wriiten this is without getting into endless spoilers, which would require me to relive this pice of crapola. 
On a philosophical note, this is a movie that makes murdering look morally right. The good guys are bad guys, and in a different time I could go along with it for fun, but 1.) this movie is too dumb to be fun and 2.) our current political times of equating might with right, ruins that equation.",The Fate of the Furious

Failure to understand or accept how reality works, even at a basic level. If you know the basics of cars, computers or physics, this will inflict pain to your brain.No part of this movie made sense, it makes all 7 prequels seem like a real life documentary about cars.

357,dingding-90547,It is an amazing movie and really touched me.,8,17 April 2017,"There is no Paul in this movie, but too many big names, such Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, Elsa Pataky and so on. The absurd plot of ""The Fate of the Furious"" builds steadily toward climaxes again and again accompanied by racing cars, limousines, the beauty and the music. The movie began in Cuba where Dom is cut in by a female stranger named 'Cipher'. Cipher compels Dom to oppose antagonize his team to do a series of jobs for her and take him from New York to Russia. The Spanish actor Charlize Theron who plays Cipher fits the role perfectly. In the movie, she is vicious, sexy and manipulative woman who is the team deal with and stop from causing a potential World War III.One of the reasons which strengthens your laugh lines is that Dwayne Johnson and the Stath have a few of good taunting scenes. Moreover, Tyrese Gibson gives audience his best impression because he constantly makes fun at everyone including new comer Scott Eastwood. Then Letty who is trying to figure out why Dom has betrayed them, and Jason Statham who was a villain from the last film is on a path of redemption. Another thing is to bring audiences some amazing stunts only when needed. The film is not disappointing. Some of the highlights include left turn and right turn vehicles, cars running out of the building, opening games in Cuba, shooting, guns, bombs, cars, army tanks and the wreckage of the stadium, and so on.Just as the serials before, this movie is full of exciting moment which is over the top of the epinephrine action thriller. As long as carrying the open mind to enter, you will love the serials more. You can take this movie as a spring dream only, which can be woken up to go to run. The popcorn calories consumed, and then look forward to the dream of the next day.",The Fate of the Furious

They tried to CG a location only for it to turn out really bad. The Action was good, but most of it was highly unrealistic.

Disappointment is not a word i like to use for a film but oh dear mother of Mary was this film garbage, when fast and furious 9 comes out it will probably be set in space and have floating cars crossing dimensions in space and have little woolly bears like return of the jedi. disgusting franchise that should of been buried long ago. If you have the intellect of a 6 year old then this film will serve its purpose and after watching this trash you can go home and play with your matchbox cars and pretend your Vin Diesel. The storyline is non existent the acting is belligerent everybody thinks there tough and can never die its sad and pathetic, i hope when you stand outside the cinema people throw coins at you thinking you are somewhat retarded.",The Fate of the Furious

I was into this series the very summer the original came out in 2001. 'Fate of the Furious' isn't better than 'Fast Five', 'Fast & Furious 6' or 'Furious 7' and it isn't worse. It's right on par with the greatness and excitement of the second half of releases in the franchise. Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster's absence is felt, but it doesn't hurt the movie as Dwayne Johnson's increased hero role fills the void. Expect all of the twists and turns that the previous movies have thrown our way. The type of twists that make you change how you see the franchise as an entirety. Like when you realized Letty wasn't really dead, when you learned Letty and Dom were married at a previous time or that Han was killed intentionally by Deckard Shaw and it wasn't just a typical car accident.The most intriguing aspect of the film is the role reversal of Vin Diesel and Jason Statham. It's like seeing two all-star players traded for one another and now those two teams are playing. It really mixes up the movie and makes you guess and think. It's also an angle we haven't seen in recent films. Charlize Theron is a dark and vicious villain who constantly keeps increasing the intensity in the film. All of the car scenes are exciting and right on par with the finales seen in recent installments.",The Fate of the Furious

364,bivinph,Same recipe but tastes damn good,7,12 April 2017,"Fast and furious was never about logic or agreeing to the laws of physics, its about crazy car chases, ridiculous survivals and total destruction. This movie is no different. Be it the race in the beginning, jail sequence, hacked cars or the submarine, the movie is full of adrenaline. If you thought the series would die out with brian you are definitely wrong, One thing that came to my notice was that the franchise never seems to have a real villain its like there's always someone bigger and the last bad guy was just a pawn. The rock's hulk action scenes and Statham's baby rescue were real kickass. The movie ends with the classic around the table family meal and a new addition to the family Since The fast and the furious, after watching each sequel you feel this is the best movie of the franchise and thats what i felt after 2hr 16 min. At the end of the movie questions do arise and certain comebacks may feel unnecessary but since this franchise is not going to end any time soon lets just wait.

Some improvements made after the previous films was the dialogue, humor, and the outrageous car stunts. However, I think the downgrade from this movie has got to be the story itself. Dom's temporary betrayal really took the franchise to a darker tone; but at the same time, it's highly similar to the Fast & Furious 6 when Letty was working with the antagonists for part of the movie. Also, the decision to have Deckard Shaw working alongside the crew raises a lot of confusion. To me, I saw it as, ""It's cool to have Shaw on our side, but you still killed Han. So I'm not so sure."" But I still think it's a good movie.",The Fate of the Furious

371,erick-palacios04,Pros and Cons will define The Fate of this Franchise,8,12 May 2017,"Before you go any further please be advice, there are major Spoilers ahead.My IMDb list since the 4th one, Fast & Furious 9/10, Fast 5 10/10, Furious 6 9/10, Furious 7 10/10 and The Fate of the Furious 8/10, you see what i mean?Pros:1: The action is unbelievable 2: The shots are stunning, the movie looks amazing. 3: The hole New York scene it's incredible, Cypher controlling the cars, Toretto going against his own team, shooting Shaw to later find out it was all set up, how Toretto points and the Cypher Henchman when he threats Letty, and come on Toretto taking all of his crew down, even Hobbs. 4: When Roman says ""Brian would know what to do"", that line was incredible, because in the end Brian can do much more than Hobbs when it come to Dom. And finishing with Letty saying ""No, we'll not get Brian and Mian in this, that was the deal"" that was beautiful. And come on, he names his son Brian? Amazing. 5: The Riot prison scene with Hobbs braking every arm and Shaw doing the same escaping from Hobbs and jail, totally Awesome. 6: How amazing is Charlize Theron in it? she looks so dominating, so evil, so bad ass, with that hair style, and doesn't take s**t from Toretto, his first mistake and shot Elena (Yes Elena dies, it broke my heart), and of course doesn't take s**t from anybody. 7: Like the other films, Roman doesn't disappoint, he can still make us laugh out loud, and messing with the new kid Nobody , Jr. (Scott Eastwood), it was a great touch. 8: I love Kurt Russell's power in this films, hi clears the path so Hobbs and Shaw escape from prison and unites them, kind of a ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" and Shaw hates Cypher, she did something terrible to his family. 9: Helen Mirren is in the film, Amazing, and plays the Shaw's brothers mom, and Toretto sets up Deckard's dead with her so he can trace Cypher 's plane and save his child, in return he gives them Cypher, and Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) appears here, Yeah. That plane scene totally kicked ass. 10: And come on, the Antartic scene (that actually is in Russia in the film) with the submarine, the soldiers, Toretto fighting back the Cypher henchmen, and helps his team Finnally.Cons: 1: The absence of Brian O'Conner it's really there, no matter what they do, even when they put Hobbs as the leader, bring Shaw with them and a new kid played by Scott Eastwood to the Team, but still, as i said before, when Roman says ""Brian would know what to do"", that really make us say ""We really miss Brian"". 2: I can see them taking down terrorists and everything, but now it's like they are the ones who can stop a World War 3? really? it's like the producers are doing something over theirs heads but they are still amazingly stop it. 3: Letty it's better than 2 train Russian soldiers bigger than her? Roman with a car door and a pistol took down like 5 soldiers in the ice? when did they receive all their special training? way over their heads. 4: Hobbs and Elena were really good friends, and we don't see closer with them, like Hobbs going to her funeral, or saying a few words about her, but they showed him getting mad about Shaw's ""death"" because they shared a laugh?, i mean really? 5: Dom is Thor or Goku? or maybe God?, because they are now trying to tell us trough out the hole movie that he's kind of a superhero or something, stuffs like ""You don't know Dom"", ""I give Dominic Toretto"" after everything that happened in Russia like he can do that with his eyes close, or when he says to Cypher ""you should kiss my son, because he's the only reason why you, your plain, your security, your men are still on this earth"", I mean come on, Really? so if something happens to his son, him alone it's gonna take down a huge terrorist that with a single bottom can disintegrate him? and she takes those words like ""Omg, i think i'm going to die"", that's completely full of s**t. And his hole team was struggling to terminate a lot of soldiers in the ice and him with a single car takes them all down in a minute? they are showing him like something more than Hobbs, Shaw and Cypher, this are guys with special training, years in the business, huge terrorists, but Dominic Toretto it's much betters than them, of course he is the star and we love Toretto, but guys try to make it much better. 6: The last one and i thing the worst one, this hole franchise keeps telling us something about Dominic Toretto, he is all about family, you mess with his family and your mess with God apparently, so OK all those things i named before that he can do, being Goku and stuff, so when Deckard Shaw killed Han, almost killed Brian, Mian and their son, almost killed Elena and Hobbs, almost kills him for crying out loud, and in the end of the film he salutes him like an old friend? this is the guy that almost kills Hobbs because he was going to arrest Mia, almost killed Brian when he found out he put Letty against Braga, but with Shaw just says ""i made the right choice"", and now Shaw it's part of the team? and that's the other thing they exaggerate, Toretto's charm, now in the 9th or 10th Cypher will be in the team to?.

378,matdemon,Jumped the Shark BIG Time (SPOILERS),1,23 April 2017,"Unlike other negative reviewers, I AM a fan of the franchise. To date, I have seen every F&F movie in the theater. That trend ends now.Fast and the Furious 7 was not a good movie. But this? It is the most asinine movie I've ever seen. It's so ridiculous and full of half-written plots, cheesy one liners (back-to-back-to-back-to- back), soulless, replaceable characters, and the stupidest action sequences you'll ever bare witness to. The plot? Who cares? There's some loose connection with trying to tie together the Shaw Brothers with Cypher (Charlize) ... but its distant and laughable at best. You can obviously tell there was little attempt to ever extend the story of Shaw from FF6, as the results in FF7 were laughable. But this movie just magnifies that 100-fold. I could write a novel on the silly action sequences. There were so many: the wrecking ball; the submarine; the Rock ambushing a torpedo gliding across the icy plain of Russia from the side of his car; Toretto's 2k!, no 3k, no 5k(!!) horsepower car tossing other cars around the streets of New York; the sudden ability for Cypher to hack every car in NYC, regardless of year or make, and somehow control them all like a Transformer-esque army (a literal battalion of cars) and then have them rain from 6 story buildings like cats and dogs... Still not sure how, since cars were just emerging through the sides of buildings that were not even parking garages, and a good many stories up. A 1988 Taurus? Hack it! A DeLorean? Hack it. A 1999 Jeep Cherokee? Hack it. Every car can be hacked, apparently, and then used to drive with pinpoint accuracy in droves, like tidal waves, to crash, counter, and explode upon a victim of your choice. Then, what about the Shaw Brothers in their GI Joe jet packs? Or Roman using his Lambo underwater in the Arctic Tundra of Russia, for a good few hundred yards, yet somehow comes out not wet, nor drowned, nor feeling any level of hypothermia...? Look, every scene in this movie is so silly that it stacks HIGH above the ridiculousness level of what we've come to love about this franchise. It's just tacky now. Soulless, and thoughtless--plain idiotic.The characters have no semblance of their former selves. Remember the emotional bonds forged in #1, 4, 5, and 6? You won't see any of that here. The characters are simply there to spit one-liners at each other, as if they were a bunch of 13 year old boys jockeying over seats at a lunch table. You could take any character (minus Vin) away from this movie and the movie wouldn't be impacted. Kurt Russel and Scott Eastwood (Scott especially) are just cringe-worthy every time they talk. Scott's entire character was unnecessary--I guess he's a poor man's replacement for Paul Walker. He fails miserably on that account. Roman has no point at all in this film and has been converted into just a 100% useless laughing stock. He makes decisions that add no value to the team, but simply get them into situations worse than they are already in. He never does anything positive. Ludicrous and that less-than-one-dimensional hacker-girl are simply there to speak a few random IT terms the writers grabbed from a 5 minute search on the internet. ""Slaving"" a sub-marine? Their characters are as pointless as any others. Letty is just there to make the audience ""believe"" there is some semblance of Vin having resentment for turning his back on his family.Given how powerful and elusive Cypher is, Toretto would never have the jump on her ... ever. The entire angle of him somehow just knowing where Shaw's MOTHER (don't get me started) is absurd. And then they try and explain the entire story of ""How"" in about 1 minute during the middle of the action climax ... and introduce Shaw's Brother, who is NOT DEAD (GASP!) only so he spouts 1-2 lines before moving on with life, as if he were never there. Then, The Rock. Why is he even here? He and Statham hate one another yet they don't. Statham: supposed to hate Team-FF for killing his brother, but doesn't really hate them. Why? Well, because good old brother is still alive, and Statham has known this the entire time. So that makes his revenge on Toretto and his team in FF7 meaningless. Then, the baby thing? What in the hell was that about? Was I watching Baby's Day Out? Dunsten Checks In? Embarrassing, cheap attempts for a laugh.Look. FF5 and FF6 brought some over the top action, but they brought i along with touching, emotional stories tied to deep rooted characters you've grown to love throughout the series. Add: good plots.FF7 was a dud. Outside of Paul Walkers tribute, the movie itself was utterly pointless. But FF8? This movie is plain awful.The people who are saying this movie is GOOD are just saying that because it's piling on the levels of ridiculousness introduced in FF7 (namely). However, its removing all of the deeper meaning and soul that made FF4, FF5, and FF6 work. Hate to say it, but Paul Walker's death is sort of an analogy for this series: he was barely ethereal for #7 and the movie suffered for it ... losing it's way as he floated away. He had no part in FF8, and as such, the movie was without soul. It was a shell of former entries.The Fonz is gliding high on his water skis in this movie; high up in the air, above Cypher's plane, looking down, down, down, far below ice-sharks circling Roman's watery grave, and deep beneath the ice of Russia's Tundra where remnants of a separatists' nuclear submarine lay burning.Also: nice to see guys in 2017 carrying around nuclear launch codes in briefcases attached to their arm by handcuffs.",The Fate of the Furious

380,Manuelgroesch1-1,Trump's win suddenly made total sense to me,1,11 April 2017,"I mean if you watch this movie on repeat all the ridiculous honor talk, the alpha male cult, the explosions, the ruthlessness, I can see how at some point you could come to the conclusion that America just has to ""bomb the piep out of Isis"". If you actually believe the stuff these one- dimensional characters say in this movie, I would not be surprised to hear you think being ""tough"" is what the world needs right now. There is this one scene, where the ""newbie"" suggests a diplomatic solution and is immediately schooled by one of the muscle packs that he has to ""become a man"" and basically start to blow sh .. up. That is at the root of what is wrong with Putin's Russia, Erdogan's Turkey and yes Trump's America. At the end of the movie they actually have the chutzpah to have them sit around a table and pray... cause if Jesus liked anything more than loving your neighbor it was blowing piep up while driving Lamborghinis.You may say: Stop analyzing it and just enjoy it. But even on that level it was all just too convoluted, unbelievable and plain that I could not just sit back and enjoy the ride. I never was at the edge of my seat because I really didn't care much for what was happening to any of these characters. I'm kind of sad great actors like Helen Mirren or Charlize Theron would spend time on something like this. I guess it pays well.",The Fate of the Furious
381,QuintLives,More of the same,2,25 May 2017,"I am continually baffled by the popularity of this series. It's not that I don't like dumb action movies. If you want to run a marathon of c-grade Van Damme and Seagal movies, I'm in. I'll bring the beer and we'll have ourselves a night. The problem here is that the characters in these films are the worst humans on the planet outside of terrorists. These are the people that pull into the bar parking lot doing 80mph in 10-year-old BMWs, order a round of Fireball shots, put $50 of worth of Drake on the jukebox and ask the bartender to crank it while everyone else in there is trying to watch a ballgame. These characters are the dregs of society and I got tired of their nonsense five movies ago. And yet here I am reviewing part 8. Because I'm an idiot. Anyhoo, when we last left the gang they had crashed some cars in an unlikely fashion and Vin Diesel mumbled some hackneyed crap about family. Picking up from that cliffhanger, we find that Dom (Vin Diesel) is now being blackmailed into turning on his friends by a hacker named Cipher. No, really, her freaking name is Cipher. So, Mr. Nobody (tragically played by Kurt Russell, who deserves better) brings together Dom's old team to stop Dom and Cipher before they gain control of a nuke. Did Dom really turn on everyone? Is the old gang really being torn apart? Were you dropped on your head repeatedly as a child? If the answer to the last question was ""no,"" then there is likely little suspense to be gained from the first two questions. These movies don't really lend themselves to coherent analysis, as they are mainly excuses to put good-looking people in stupid action sequences while occasionally yelling something inane for the trailers. As such, I just have a few random thoughts. First, these movies actually became more entertaining when they introduced The Rock and Jason Statham, which is likely because they have more charisma than any of the original cast. Unfortunately, they are sidelined for much of this entry and we are left with the nonexistent suspense of Dom's story for much of the running time. That makes this far less entertaining (and I use that word loosely) than the last couple of movies. Second, the movie doesn't even have as many extravagant action scenes as the last couple of films. As dumb as Furious 7 was, it at least through increasingly preposterous action sequences at you constantly. That distracted the audience from the plot, which was a good idea. With fewer distractions, one has more time to think about things and that is not a luxury with this series. Finally, this movie has an almost adorably quaint concept of hacking. Cipher (seriously, her name is Cipher) can literally hack any machine on the planet with a few keystrokes. I wondered if the producers went back to 1995, grabbed the guy that wrote Hackers and asked him to write this script without any updates about how this stuff actually works. They should have just cast Angelina Jolie and made her the same character from Hackers. I at least would have gotten a laugh out of that. I don't like this series, but this may be the worst one of the bunch. The action scenes are surprisingly dull, the characters are awful and the writers seem to have even stopped trying. I just wanted it to end. Dear god, did I want it to end. But don't you worry, Fast & Furious fans. Parts 9 and 10 already have release dates set. So do some exhaust work to your Jettas, blast some Chance the Rapper tunes and your heroes will be back before you know it. I need a drink.",The Fate of the Furious
382,Dtaylor1970,There is far fetched and then there is Fate and the Furious,4,2 September 2018,"As a fan of the series you know and expect things to be rather over-the-top. But who cares, the series is about turning the brain off and watching the action. But there really is a limit to how obsurd things can get. From undetectable software the sweeps the whole internet every 6 seconds, a person ""off grid"" flying in a massive plane, the fastest car in Cuba out accelerated by the slowest car when the latter is in reverse. However nothing beats a single person controlling 100s of cars independently from a single computer. I really could go on for ages.
This film has a wonderful cast and one can only thing they must have paid very well to over look the plot. Shame they didn't have the money to pay someone with high school science to explain a few of the issues.
Yes the action is great as ever but this really can never be more than background TV because you really do not want to follow the plot.",The Fate of the Furious
383,JohnTequila,"Big, Loud and Fun",9,12 April 2017,"Saw this at a midnight showing last night. Fans of the series will be pleased with the thrills seen on the screen. Each character gets his or her moment throughout and at 2 hours +, the movie had time for everyone involved. Although Helen Mirren was underused, but great in the limited time she had. Paul Walker was sadly missed, but his spirit (not the ghost type) was still there. Without spoilers, there are some plot twists and turns and surprises which were a welcome to the series. As was Scott Eastwood. Possibly a new member of the family in the movies to come next, Maybe. As for Charlize Theron, an actress I greatly admire, was a throw-away villain with very little to do except be moody and cold. She was wasted in this role to be honest. Standout moments this time round come from Jason Statham, the prison fight as seen in the trailers and later action scenes had equal thrills as well as a few laughs. Going into this I expected a loud OTT action film and that's exactly what I got. It's expected now in a series that goes bigger and bigger as they go on. 8.5/10",The Fate of the Furious
384,paulcheus,Vin Diesel please retire!,2,21 April 2017,"The film is full of real life inconsistencies: the speed of a car in reverse, how an EMP really works, the actual size of a submarine torpedo, how an ICBM really works. These flaws make the film more of a parody than an action flick. I am not sure that the producers intended that but, this is the final result. The comic scenes are plenty and resourceful, some of the actors being heavyweights (Statham, The Rock, Theron, Russel, Mirren), but as usual, when Vin Diesel makes his entrance, the movie goes instantaneously to crap. Yes we all understand that he is a founding member of the franchise and all, BUT, will someone please explain to him that he can't act to save his life? My personal advice: Vin Diesel please stop at signing checks and let the acting thing to people with some talent. Or at least do not offer yourself the leading role just because you also produced the flick. The difference in actors value and class it so obvious it is embarrassing!",The Fate of the Furious

386,rsjovertoom,Fast & Furious 8 takes itself more seriously than its contents allow for,6,14 April 2017,"At first glance we get exactly what we expect to get from a Fast & Furious installment: fast cars, hot girls, Dom wins a race and then criminals come in and ruin the day. But that's where the movie steps away from the familiar. Dom turns his back on his family to help out the bad guys (the reason why is the big reveal, so I won't spoil that), which adds a level of darkness and morality to an otherwise fun, over the top, ridiculous action flick. Suddenly the overdone action sequences look stupid and other silly stuff starts to get on your nerves, where in earlier FF's we might have just chuckled.The international terrorist is called Cipher, bluntly stolen from The Matrix. Cipher wants to steal nuclear warheads to be able to hold countries accountable for what they do (not withstanding the fact that setting off a nuclear bomb mostly kills innocent people). Mr. Nobody (borrowed from a movie title) tries to stop her by hiring our usual crew instead of government professionals. They explain why, but conveniently forget about the existence of the CIA, which is there specifically to tackle stuff like this. I won't even list all the impossible stuff they show us during the action scenes. Suffice to say it was off-putting, at the very least.But the movie does try to redeem itself, and in some ways it even succeeds. The characters get some time to have fun together, especially Johnson en Statham have cool moments together, and Statham also gets an awesome fight scene. Theron plays a moderately convincing psychopath, and even dame Helen Mirren shows up for a fun cameo. The ending contains a nice nod to Paul Walker, which makes no sense at all from a narrative point of view, but for the audience it was a very satisfying salute. Big Walker fans might even tear up a little.It's tough to come to a verdict. The stuff I don't like could have worked in the other big Vin Diesel flick, the latest xXx movie, because that movie didn't take itself seriously at all. That's just a fun flick with lots of ridiculous but cool things. But there's good stuff in this one, too, and I'm tempted to give it a pass. By the skin of its teeth, but a pass nonetheless. It's definitely not as bad as some of the earlier installments, and that's surprising.

And whats with all the angry faces whenever someone is behind the wheel of a car. In this movie we see our hero's driving their cars on ice at high speed without the slightest hint of any sliding, not to mention being able to come to a dead stop without so much as a slip of a tire. And we see Vin Diesels car out run a heat seeking missile. But the biggest load of dog do do is when our hero's position their cars around Vin Diesel to protect him from a massive explosion.

Just show some costly cars , sexy girls, rap background music , Vin Diesel's Random mumbling with sudden shouting and Stunts. Stunts which have gone to an extent where now we should stop criticizing south movies stunts. Dwayne Johnson is nowhere now being considered as human in any movie he does and this is too much of it. Just a beast, there's a scene at jail which i found so bad and damn, he was trying to divert a missile from submarine. And the sarcastic comedy, which is stupidity and almost been the routine aspect of every big Hollywood movie. So, whatever i may say, finally people should stop watching so that collections come down and they make some intelligent stuff with that much money spent.

396,Havoc571,What has happened to this series.,6,16 April 2017,"Where do I begin, this one was so far out that it made me wonder if this was a sci-fi movie or a national security type. There was nothing about the love of the drive or cars in this one. The story starts in Cuba where all seems to be going well then out of nowhere BOOM! Charlize Theron's character comes out of nowhere and shows Dom a picture on the phone and the backstabbing begins. He does all of this in a large sequence to get Hobbs locked up only to break out with Jason Statham and they all come together to try and stop him after he stole the item they were all working to ensure security. After your left confused as to why he is doing this, There is the Brazilian from the previous movies and she has his baby. You read that right a baby and he will stop at nothing all of a sudden to make sure nothing happens to them. So after keeping Leti from being killed from one of the other mercenaries, it was at the cost of losing the mother of his child shot in the head at point-blank for his mistake. During the same time, Statham was shot only to come back with his brother Shaw to help him get the child back to him all the while he was out running a missile in a car that hit a snow bank and skips off to turn around and hit the same place it came from. This one was not the same nor did it have anything really in common with the other ones. The only similarity was the team and how they all worked together. Unless your a die hard fan or just need to see it because you have been watching since the first one, then wait for it HBO or Red Box. It was not worth the money at a theater. Last but not least this was one of the most predictable movies that I have ever seen. My apologies for the random sentencing of this but this is how the movie was, went from one part to the next not giving any information on what is actually going on.

The previous installment was somewhat of a disappointment with over the top action and forgettable story line. I was preying that my favorite franchise wasn't going to be stamped on and also hoping I could prove the haters wrong that it is right for the series to continue.After walking out of viewing this film, my stomach was pumping, my heart was beating fast and I was full of adrenaline. I was very satisfied with this new installment of the Fast franchise and was exactly what you would look for in a movie. The action scenes, despite being quite extreme and dramatic, actually appeared pretty realistic. The chemistry between the actors is still fresh and as a viewer we are still warm to our beloved heroes, however, the credit for the chemistry between the cast is owed to The Rock and Jason Statham, who stole nearly every scene. What is most important about the film is how despite being the eighth one, yes the eighth one, is that it is still fresh, and not a repetition or ""more of-the-same"".In conclusion, Fast and Furious has once again proved that a sequel number does not define the quality of how good or bad a movie can be, and proves that as films go on they can still remain good or even better. I wouldn't say it was my favorite part, (who can ever top Fast Five, right?) but I would place it somewhere between 5 and 6, and label it as one of the better films made to date.P.S. - Don't be an idiot like myself and stay till after the credits thinking there will be a scene that sets up the next sequel, nope, have to wait three more yeyears for that one!",The Fate of the Furious

The previous F&F movies established this realm, but this one seems to think it it exists on some other plane.

Then out of nowhere a drag race happens and a stock car gets thrown in with nos and weight reduction (against the fastest car in all of Cuba) That is really stretching it! Then the car manages to win on fire and backwards!!! thats ridiculousMoving on, we go to a soccer field and high level police officer is now a soccer coach, and he has a daughter(no reference of that before, no storyline of how that happened) and suddenly this banned police officer is asked to do a super high level job. No storyline of other people unavailable or he is the only man for the job.Now suddenly he gets a crew, we don't know anything about this crew, what they have been up to, but they suddenly just pop in.out of the blue, Toretto meets an agent, who forces Toretto to work for her and Toretto can't tell anyone. OK so its a son, (but previously he had no knowledge of a son, he is in love with his main girl(who just shared an intimate moment) Who he fought so hard to get, like for 2 movies. Now he just drops everything and decides to turn his back against his girl, friends, country and everything for his baby. (Highly unrealistic) Especially since he calls his friends family. So rather than let them in, trying to help me, he goes against them. Totally out of character based on movies 1-7...So he then does it and goes against, his supposedly FAMILY and almost kills one of his best friends.Then after an action scene, one of the good guys ends up in jail with one of the bad guys. They are convinced to join forces in a minute. I mean so easily, they decide to work with each other. These are two guys that tried desperately to kill each other. Now they are best buddies at a drop of a hat.another weird scene, his the mother of his child, who he turned against his family for dies and yet Toretto barely shows any emotion. Like it barely happened.It really just gets worse and worse after that, movie keeps jumping with unbelievable scenarios.

The way it was directed, shot and edited made me, for the first time, want to watch the same movie again right after it finished. The fighting, racing, dialogue, jokes and the amazing choice of music was so sophisticating that I can't begin to imagine how one can not like it. I really can't.The second phase was the story. Now I now a lot of people are having problems with the story, because according to them, it didn't make sense. Why? Why doesn't it make sense? What were you expecting to see? Dom and Deck are now friends? Well they bloody are. Dom wasn't there when Deck was introduced to the group. Deck saved Dom's child so why wouldn't Dom like him? Yes, Deck killed Hank, but does it really matter when the whole movie was mostly based around Dom trying to save his child, and earlier in the movie, Elena? Well, he got there in the end, again, with the help of Deck.And now that's sorted, I personally think the story was really good. It wasn't the best story ever made, but for the franchise, the story was better than some of the previous movies. But that's how it goes here, some are good, some are not so good.Overall, I am giving this film 10 / 10 because it truly deserves it.",The Fate of the Furious

408,paul-carlier,Drifting away from it's roots,5,22 October 2017,"I was surprised by how soulless this film was. The previous films revolved around the emotional bond between Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Jordan Brewster and the absence of two of them is evident. The plot doesn't lead on from anything and you can see each twist coming for miles. It is also unnecessary brutal while adding no real value to the story. The franchise has always revolved around the concept of family, and it is rammed home in this film. However, the loss of so many of the original crew, including Han, means that replacements have been introduced and their characters are weaker and seem destined to be used as filler.The great strength of the franchise was that it dealt with a unique urban culture. The first films had an element of reality to them as well as being great fun. However the latest films have the crew saving the world in Bond-like plots and they are becoming increasingly ridiculous. The franchise needs to return to its roots to survive. However, the inclusion of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham makes that unlikely as they are unsuited to that type of plot.",The Fate of the Furious

As a result of becoming downright secret Service films, some logical questions have been exposed, such as performing such tasks why not go to a professional agent? And just going to rely on this kind of street team? Why would Jason Stanson join the lead team? Have they forgotten the companion Jason Stanson killed in the last movie? Although this is a popcorn movie, it makes these problems more dog-blooded because of the overall variation of the theme.3. Chariz Theron plays the villain and the tech resources it owns are completely at odds with her IQ performance in the film. The more bizarre this sense of the film, the stronger it is later. Because according to most movies, the more The villain is, the more powerful it should be when the film is later.4. Counselor, can let me stick to the film at the end of the only Theron.

416,princess_lilmisspiggy,"'The Fate of The Furious,' or Stop Worrying and Love the 'Fast and Furious' Films",10,15 April 2017,"There are a lot of questions posed throughout The Fate of The Furious. Sometimes they are a single word (""Toretto?""), sometimes they are more of an imperative (""What's it gonna be, rook?""), and sometimes they are philosophical (""Why are they shooting at me?"")Then there is the question that ultimately confronts anyone for whom this movie is an introduction to Hollywood's most absurd and unlikely franchise: What the hell is wrong with you, you idiot? For those of us who foolishly slotted the Fast and Furious and its brethren to the NASCAR/ Saw movies file as the rare pop culture phenomenon you allowed yourself to avoid, this movie is the one where you wave the white flag and finally, happily, give in to the turbo-charged ridiculousness spearheaded by that soulful lunk Vin Diesel and his band of super buff gearheads.The narrative thrust of this film—and the movie is pretty much all velocity and thrust—comes from the betrayal by Diesel's Dom Toretto of his beloved crew at the behest of Charlize Theron's Cipher, who seems to possess the ultimate leverage over him on her cell phone. ""You are going to work for me, betray your code, and shatter your family,"" she says to Toretto, which is pretty much the same pitch Travis Kalanick uses to lure talent from Google over to Uber. Theron is terrific in the part, confident enough to let her cheekbones and crazy yarn hair do most of the acting. Of all the unexplainable and logic-defying feats portrayed in the film, Theron's hair—and how she maintains it onboard the satellite and prison equipped airplane in which she spends most of the movie—may take top prize. Indeed, when they flash a dossier for her mysterious character on one of the various informational screens that bleep and bloop throughout the movie, it is revealed that her hair color is, ""Unknown."" Yes, and like her steely intentions, perhaps unknowable.Most of the rest of the assembled are returnees, the glittering jewel of which is Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw, who gets to antagonize Dwayne Johnson while simultaneously saving the Earth as a conscripted member of the crew. The British actor has more charisma than he knows what to do with. His balletic airborne martial arts dance while holding a baby is not only one of cinema's cleverest John Woo tributes, but a joyfully absurd way to kick off the summer movie season. We all are that baby, cooing as we are flung about with seeming abandon but also with the utmost care.",The Fate of the Furious

The actors and actresses all put on outstanding performances; the movie was actually about cars in a sense; the word 'family' wasn't mentioned as often as you would think; you could actually see the motivation behind the actors actions.There were so many scenes that gave me actual chills from the cinematography.

It was missing the furiousness that the family shows when going after a villain but without truly knowing if Dom is someone who they need to be worried about or if something else was going on, they didn't push hard enough, it was more like a wait and see what's going on. I was expecting an all out war but it was very mild without the characters having a clear villain and reason to show that fury that we're used to. Also in the other movies they are trying to make a lot of money by doing jobs and that was also missing in this one. I want to watch it again on DVD to make sure but it could have been so much better. It was just like a regular movie rather than being what I know and love.",The Fate of the Furious
419,daddylovesisaac,Cool film!,8,6 May 2017,"I watched this film in the IMAX around 2 weeks back, and let me say I did like it. I liked the opening sequence,there was this race in Spain somewhere, and Vin Diesel drove furious and exploded his car, which was quite cool. In the middle of the movie there was a lot of driving on ice, which is kind of the setting for this film. I personally remember a part where this guy and this woman had a fight inside a cabin on the ice, and the woman won that fight, she threw him out of the cabin and onto the ice, and for a second you can see a huge patch of blood as the camera zooms in. Despite that being the only bloody part of this movie, the film was cool, violent and had 's***' style cursing. I'm just giving you some age advice for this film. Anyways,it was cool when Dwayne Johnson was in this kind of prison, and he fighted the bad guys with the guns. The closing sequence is where the guys get back to their own family.

Sure, the actor is dead, but they refer to him at the end, naming a baby after him. Why? They were all talking about ""saving the world"" so why would they insist on not bothering Brian in his retirement if the world would end with their failure to stop Charlize Theron anyway? What they should have done was have the Brian character killed off-screen by Charlize Theron's goons as part of the leverage to manipulate Dom. Then naming a baby after him would make sense and they wouldn't have to carry on a lame excuse for Brian never appearing in any future installments of this ridiculous series.",The Fate of the Furious

Apart from that there are no redeeming qualities to this movie. The stunts are awful, the plot is abhorrent, the dialogue is ridiculous, and there's no amount of suspension of disbelief that can make you enjoy any of this. And you can't even say there were plot twists because there wasn't a single thing in this movie that wasn't predictable before the opening credits even started rolling. I can't say I've ever been a real fan of this franchise but chapters 4 to 6 were enjoyable, as action vehicles and as spectacle cinema.

423,nicksfocus08,"Entertaining installment, but.....",6,14 April 2017,"Well, as a fan of this franchise from the beginning, I was excited to say the least about this sequel. The franchise kept improving with each film. The drama, action, and everything else vastly improved each time. Every entry before I gladly award 10 stars. Well, I cant do that with this entry. After watching this one, I was sort of underwhelmed when comparing it with its predecessors. It seems to me the overall quality of the film, up to the CGI, as well as the atmosphere and overall dynamic just feels somehow less than. I would attribute this to several things, one of them being that you feel the absence of Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster. This takes the 'Fast and furious' feel away from the film. I am also not sure that this director was the right pick, as they would have benefited from bringing back Lin or Wan, or someone else. The acting was good, the scenes flowed nicely, and the movie entertaining, but...again. there is a tremendous absence here. Some of the CGI seems less than, and some of the scenes are now TOO out there to believe. While I enjoyed Kurt Russell and charlize Theron and Scott Eastwood, they seemed to just be in the film, but were not very impactful. The film also was missing an appearance from Lucas Black and Eva Mendes, and maybe perhaps Cole Hauser from 2fast 2furious . Not sure why. It just lacked what the others had...Heart. Statham and Johnson, and of course Diesel were amazing here, also Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese/ludicrous. The overall quality and atmosphere and plot just fell short. They must restore the essence that is F&F with a director who can accomplish this task. Hoping for an improvement in the coming sequels, although I am feeling that the 7th one should have ended the series so as to not ruin the legacy. They should make it tighter, more taught, and return to,really, what all the previous installments offered, including Tokyo Drift.

I really liked how the message of ""The Importance of Family"" stayed consistent throughout the film. As Dominic Toretto says ""You never turn your back on family"". I really liked that. I also, enjoyed how all the characters came together during the whole movie. The way they thought, spoke, and how their demeanors changed from beginning to end made sense, and was well thought out.

I was just 11 years old when the first movie came out and now I am 26 when the eighth installment has come out. I have grown up watching these movies and it feels like the movies have grown with me. I like the concept of FAMILY as the root of the movie. No matter how old you are, no matter what you do, family comes first. The conclusion scene makes you smile even though it has been the same in almost all the installments, the entire family sitting together, smiling and enjoying together. The GRACE is always an inherent part of these ending scenes.I would say it's a good action movie with its own moments of thrills, fun and twists. The plot is quite interesting and they have built up the suspense very well through the trailer. I went to the theater just to find out ""Why Dominic Toretto went rogue?"" Charlize Theron plays the villain very well. She drips with cunningness. I was always a fan of her eyes. Vin Diesel is still the heart of the franchise. The witty and foul dialogue exchange between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham is hilarious. Tyrese Gibson continues with the lame comedy which is funny sometimes. Then there are the absolutely beautiful and gorgeous cars to watch. The remaining characters played their part well. However, I feel that the characters have piled up over the previous installments and it has become quite problematic to give each one the appropriate screen time.Therefore, watch it for the beautiful cars. Watch it for the gorgeous girls. Watch it for the action sequences. Watch it for the picture perfect locations. Watch it for the sexiest villain of the franchise. Watch it for some witty stuff. Watch it for some cheesy stuff. Watch it for some funny stuff. Watch it for the baby. Watch it for Vin Diesel. Watch it because it's Fast and Furious.I go to a movie just to sit back, enjoy and get entertained.

However, by now, everyone knows this is no longer just about cars and racing, but that is not the main problem with this movie. It is the fact that compared to the previous ones, this is the most over-exaggerated so far. Although some scenes are ingenious and quite thrilling, there is an equal amount of scenes that are completely unrealistic and more over, ridiculous. The submarine scene is a total mess. When they infiltrate the Russian base, both Dom and his team have absolutely no remorse killing the Russian soldier, who are actually just defending the military base, and doing their jobs. They are not the villain in this movie, but still, they are dehumanised and portrayed as such. Same scene, Dom becomes the good guy again and miraculously manages to blow up the submarine, which holds several nukes on board (not one nuke, multiple), but the explosion, not only does not do justice to what a nuclear explosion would look like, but it does not seem to affect them much. Their explanation is giving by some cheap chip excuse and the fact that the nuclear explosion was underwater. At the end, there is absolutely no consequence for killing the Russian soldiers, no state involvement, and the so called Mr Nobody seems to be totally fine with it, big happy family. As a result, all these flaws combined make the movie quite frustrating to watch, and as I said, I don't think they're making the right choice by radically shifting towards a different direction, and now I do understand where the bad reviews come from.",The Fate of the Furious
446,niranjanthevaliant,Excellent Advertise for Cars. Well a lot more that just that,10,2 July 2017,"I went in with not not too much hope, given IMDb rating was just 7. The movie was far better than I expected. All we seeing trailer is Dom going rogue. Well they had to come up with something to run it to the eight round. Of course, dom could have done it in many ways rather than just going rogue, but well its a movie and you just got to be the audience who's out there to enjoy, not fault it. Its a movie, not a science show or a case in the court. Well, first off, I was so interested because I have been recently playing asphalt 8, so great to see all those cars in action. You have Statham, diesel and rock in the same movie. Its overcrowded. So there are going to be some mistakes. But they can be ignored, because of what you get to see on the screen. Stunning visuals. Not sure how many cars they wrecked to make a movie like this. We are out here, trying so hard and saving up, just to get one of them. Well, it comes down to the idea and how to do something like that and still not be broke by any means. They certainly got that. The little kid string together the emotions of Dom. Statham brought in added surprises. Tyrese Gibson provides humour. Well, when the team get all their cars and set out on their mission for the first time, it gives you the goosebumps, also when Dom turns against Cipher. Its not perfect, but deserves a lot of attention for that they have come up with. The movie doesn't lack soul, like some other high budget movies. Its a right mix of both and comes close to my favorite FATF movie which is Tokyo Drift. Han's role in that movie is still second to none in all FAFT movies.",The Fate of the Furious

Although this movie did have great action scenes, it feels like this franchise has gotten the Joel Schumacher Batman and Robin treatment. Felt like I was watching these characters that are supposed to be human do things that are not humanly possible. The characters felt forced to appeal to kids as if they were The Avengers or other superhero movies. This franchise has to get back to it's roots and I keep hearing over and over again when each movie comes out that it's going back to it's core roots but it's not the case with this movie. In my opinion the last good F&F movie was the 5th and will continue to be as it us with others. This film also suffers from the Child's Play syndrome as the first 3 films in that franchise were dark, gritty, and serious tone.....then after that the franchise nearly died because of the overly done comedy that felt forced and unnatural....good thing the Director of that series seen that the audience wanted it to go back to what it was and listened to the audience. I hope the writers read this and the next few F&F films will be less corny, campy, and more adult oriented and less like Marvel comics movies.",The Fate of the Furious

455,wouterdrummen,A step down from previous deliveries,5,6 May 2017,"I have never been the biggest fan of one of the most successful franchises of all time, ''The Fast and the Furious'', but I do admit that these last couple of years I have become (slightly) more interested in the movies, especially with the arriving of big names like Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham in recent years, and with ''Straight Outta Compton'' director F. Gary Gray on board for the eighth installment, I was hoping that it would become one of the best movies of the franchise. Sadly, that wasn't the case, at least not for me. I was disappointed by the fact that for the first time in recent years the quality had actually gone down.The opening scene says it all; Domenic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Lerry Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) are on their honeymoon in Havana, where Dom is challenged to a street race by Raldo (Celestino Corneille), who is the 'King' of the Cuban capital and owns the fastest car in Havana, while Dom has to race in his cousin's car, the slowest car in the city. However, Dom has several tricks up his sleeve and narrowly wins the race, risking his own life more than once during the race, for the car was about to explode and he almost got killed by Raldo. However, Dom doesn't seem to care that much, because he allows Raldo to keep his car since 'earning one's respect' is the best reward you can get, and he gives his own show car to his cousin Fernando (Janmarco Santiago). From the start on there is more than enough action and car races, but the implausible coincidences just keep piling up to such an extent that even for a ''Fast and Furious'' movie it just becomes too much. Sadly, it doesn't end there The movie itself is quite enjoyable, although it is a bit disappointing when compared to some of the previous installments, especially since F8 has almost no plot. If we compare it to its predecessor, ''Furious 7'' had a more reasonable plot. In that movie, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) swears vengeance against Dom and his crew after they put his brother in hospital. Dom and his team have to defeat Shaw before he takes them out (however, all seems to be forgiven in F8, where they actually team up with Shaw without hesitation, even though he killed Han, blew up Hobb's office, severely injuring him but also exploded Toretto's house, they all become one big happy family). This time, it is Dom who betrays his own team after he is forced to work for 'supervillain' Cipher (Charlize Theron). The team has to stop them and get Dom back, which is about it. Even if the whole situation is dead serious, most of the crew hardly seems to mind, joking around while Dom gets his hands on 'weapons' such as an EMP and a nuclear football rather easily.Some of the characters are quite interesting (especially the rivalry between Statham and Johnson is entertaining) but most of them disappoint; the supporting cast keeps growing but hardly has anything to do. Especially Charlize Theron falls short of my expectations. Just like in most Marvel movies, they get a big name to play the villain but with hardly any impact or real motivation. The actress already showed that she is capable of kicking ass in movies such as ''Mad Max: Fury Road'' and the upcoming ''Atomic Blonde'', but we never get to see her in full action, apart from one scene where she takes out Dom's team. A part from that, her character is shallow and we are not even sure why she is doing all this. It is clear that Gray wants to portray her as an evil but genius mastermind who has thought of everything, but Dom has little trouble disabling her 'masterplan' As in the previous installments, there is always a 'second bad-guy' or some 'evil side-kick', as is the case here with Rhodes (Kristofer Hivju), who is most recognizable as the Wildling leader Tormund of the popular series ''Game of Thrones''. He seems more evil, motivated and brutal than Cipher, even he has less screen-time, he tries to make most of what he is given. It is however a shame that a talent such as Theron is completely wasted.All in all, the movie is entertaining, but due to the lack of any narrative, only a few interesting characters, the poor dialogue and hardly any logic sense, the 2h 16min long movie couldn't keep me interested until the end. And yes, I know, this may sound like a 'poor excuse', since ''The Fast and Furious'' franchise isn't loved and so popular thanks to the credibility of its story or narrative but thanks to its impressive action-scenes, races, fight scenes and explosions. The movie is fun to watch, but the performances and narrative get overshadowed by the special effects, which is my main point; I couldn't enjoy the movie as much as I wanted to because I hardly cared for any of the characters. And the franchise has proved more than once that the main characters cannot die; Dom miraculously survives every accident, as does the rest of the crew, who even after the worst accidents pick themselves up, laugh it off and carry on. Even the whole 'one big family' idea has become pretty useless and a cliché, used to fill some of the plot holes when they couldn't think of anything else. It is so overused that it gets cheesy.I would personally love it if in the upcoming ''Fast and Furious 9'' it would be the other way around; more time invested in making an interesting story with characters who have more depth. Maybe I just expect too much of a F&F movie, but then again, I was positively surprised by the previous ones, but the amount of plot holes, poor narrative and uninteresting characters in the eight installment is just too great to overlook.",The Fate of the Furious

And of course this assessment is subjective (but i'll try to be objective as much as possible)The Fate of the Furious (F8) (Disclaimer: I have followed all of this movie series)Story: 6.5/10 Besides it is an action movie, F8 provides a kind of different but interesting story plot, where Dom betrays his 'family' and the struggle between all of them to finish the mission for their personal interest. I give 6.5 because the story is not deep enough and feels 'anyway there is a story' and then Action almost take every scene of this movie. Moreover, tension interspersed with comedy adds the value of this movie.Graphics: 8/10 Future computer program, city and North Pole backgrounds, intense car chases and of course cool cars are the graphics values that provide since F5, makes this movie has its own characteristics which don't have by other movies, which are continuously developed in every movie-making.Additional Genre: Action: 8/10 Car chases, men fight, gunfire, and other innovative actions in almost every scenes make me give 8.5, actually, but sometimes I found an event that is impossible to happen, so I decrease the score into 8.0 because it is not a Sci-Fi or Fantasy movie (but maybe some of you will have an opinion that this also give an entertainment credits).Overall: 7.5 Yes this in an action movie, what else do you expect beside the action?",The Fate of the Furious

The Helen Mirren and Jason Statham roles, and the interactions they had with other cast members, kept the movie afloat when there weren't car races, chases, and crashes. And there were lots of them. Which, if the car action is the only reason you are watching the series at this point, you will not be disappointed.

Apart from the same super-clichéd parts of this movie, it still is a torture if you leave your brain outside while watching it. Some highlights in the movie:1. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson totally lives up to his name by breaking almost anything he comes across. He practically changes the course of a torpedo just by pushing it with his bare hands.2. Dominic Toretto, the so-called family guy, suddenly turns a traitor because he just came to know all of a sudden he is a dad and the evil woman (we'll come back to her) uses him as a sidekick for her evil deeds using his son as leverage. Not a problem, except Dom never lets his teammates know until the very end. So much for family values. Also he suddenly is accepted back into the team when he jumps off a cliff in a car in some unknown part of Russia. No explanations needed Dom, you're a bro.3. Old villains, re-entry. And now they're goody goody. The nemesis from Fast 6 got like a 2 minute cameo and all he does is hold the gun. Older brother(nemesis from Fast 7, we all know his name) got more action scenes where his remarkable fatherhood skills are shown in a mid-air fight trying to save Dom's son.4. Remote controlled everything. Cars, cameras, computers, submarines, nuclear launch facilities. Everything is hack-able. Wait which movie was I watching again? I thought this was about some fast cars and some drag racing.5. They bring super cars to fight the security of a nuclear facility in frozen Russia. Yes, this guy who talks a lot (as if he's a comedian) brings a Lamborghini because they are about to save the world from nuclear annihilation. No, I am not joking. I repeat. I am not kidding.6. Chicks who don't know a thing about computers have a crazy hacking cat fight over the computers.7. Dom is the guy who you can count on to fight the President of The United States's motorcade and still win single-handed just because he's got the fastest car driving skills. And he also steals the nuclear codes. Also they can drive 60+mph in broad daylight in the middle of NYC. 8. The evil woman just wants to rule the world. But she is so smart to hack almost every device on the planet, even know the secret location of the secret Mr. Nobody and even hacks the nuclear secret submarine, but must still need Dom because you know he's got mad driving skills.9. Racing a submarine. Naa that's just the trailer. Dom outlives a Mach-4 missile and lives. Holy mother of Flash, he's fast.I'm tired of writing more of this. If you have a brain, please avoid this.

The same people complaining about the ""realism"" and ""believability"" in the movie are probably the same people that will go see Transformers, Harry Potter, Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, and say how great those are. #RelaxOK, I don't think this was one of the best in the ""Fast"" series, but it wasn't awful. I will say, I didn't care all that much for the plot. I thought it was out of nowhere, but it is what it is. I will not give details of the movie, so here are just a couple of my thoughts. I thought everyone did a decent job in the movie and the comedic parts were pretty good. Tej & Roman are funny as usual. Hobbs vs Deckard was good too. Dom does what Dom does, but I thought it was weird that there was NOT a lot of on screen interaction between Hobbs & Dom....... is the beef between the actors real? Mr. Nobody & Little Nobody were good in the flick. Charlize Theron played a good villain boss. I still love seeing Letty on screen. Shout out to the movie for finding a way to fit Don Omar & Tego Calderone in for a second.

Secondly, the story was actually not terrible (this is no Tokyo Drift); the reason's for Dom's betrayal (as seen in the trailers) are very human and feel very real and the redemption of some of the characters was earned (on the most part). Thirdly, Charlize Theron was great, as usual, as the villain Cipher.What I didn't like - Firstly, Helen Mirren's accent was terrible although was warranted by her character. Secondly, as mentioned, the laws of physics get broken at times (the wrecking ball (again from the trailer) is a perfect example).Final thoughts - This film is a great addition to the Fast and Furious franchise. It is what we've come to expect from these films over the last almost 20 years and I'm interested to see where the story goes from here as, according to the cast and crew, there are only two of these left.In terms of the score, I couldn't not give this an 8/10.

The plot evolved around Dom and his unofficial affair with another woman that lead to his betrayal of his fam. Not sure if this is really a spoiler but it's in the trailer(he turned on family). Really like their bond between each other and oh god, Roman, he's always the funny guy and the scared- to-die one. I miss Brian, I really do. I reckon, 7 was better. The plot for 8 did not meet my expectations. BUT, I really enjoyed the movie!",The Fate of the Furious
479,vaishnavdhote-58440,A Treat to watch...Binds audiences greatly.,8,12 April 2017,"First of all Fast and Furious 8 is a treat to watch.Action sequences are awesome and binds the audiences.If you are fan of this FnF franchise then you will fall in love with this movie,and even if you are not a big fan then also you will love this movie.All the characters in the movie are shown very well .Plot was also good and was meaningful.Start of the movie is awesome and literally II stranded up from my chair.Attitude of every actor in Dom's team is cool and stylish as we have previously seen in first 7 movies.Movie have some thrilling suspences and you will be amazed to see some known personalities appearances in the middle of the movie.I am giving 8/10 because in the middle after interval movie plot falls little bit , Charlize's talk seems boring and fails to bind interest for some time.But again in next scene movie runs smoothly.In between talk of Tyrese Gibson is very interesting, it gives all the spice in the movie which it needs.I must say that FNF franchise has included glamour and sexy scenes in previous parts but Fate of furious lacks it.Work of Dwayne Johnson is quite notable and he has definitely left his mark like previous parts.Ludicrous and Natlie Emanuele has acted very well and done justice with their role.Finally talking about my favourite actor Jason stathom,loved watching his stunts and talk with dwayne (agent hobbs). Overall after comparing with previous parts it will not let you down.For eg:-you know Thor 1 was quite well plotted vs Thor 2. This has definitely not happened in this movie.You will love this movie very much.Your eyes will not get off the screen for a second because of chase and action sequences.Fate of furious is definitely incomplete without Paul walker(Brian o Conner).Love you Paul ! It feels like this franchise should not end because it's a treat to watch such a beautiful and great cast working together and spilling magic on screen.",The Fate of the Furious

489,BuffyD,This series died with Paul Walker. But...,7,17 April 2017,"The ""Fast & Furious"" series died with Paul Walker, and the exit of director Justin Lin. Walker's character was always the protagonist of the series. It was his character arc fans had been following since the original movie, and thus ""his story"" the audience has had an investment in. All the other characters were secondary players, including Vin Diesel - whether he realizes it or not.This all became painfully obvious in the series' low point, Furious 7, when any scenes involving Walker's originally planned story-line were excised & replaced with new scenes of Jordana Brewster giving tedious exposition. Without the protagonist to care about, that film relied on over-the-top spectacle and Vin Diesel to carry the weight. As Diesel has shown in the xXx & Riddick movies, he isn't particularly compelling or charismatic and can't carry a film. He is only interesting as a foil or companion to Walker. And with Walker virtually absent from Furious 7 - except for the ""send off"" coda at the end - the movie was just a tedious, cluttered, boring mess of a Diesel vanity project.""Fate of the Furious"" learned these lessons and is an improvement from Furious 7. The producers realized the series was dead without Walker and that Diesel couldn't give it any life. So instead of trying to resuscitate the franchise, they smartly figured out a plot device that tricked Diesel into getting out of the way. And while Diesel and the decaying corpse of ""The Fast and the Furious"" do remain on the periphery (Ludacris and the hacker girl look like they'd rather be anywhere else) ""Fate of the Furious"" sees the birth of a new creature taking the center stage: The Rock & Jason Statham show - and it is an absolute, glorious hoot! They breathe life, fun, thrills and laughs onto the screen. If Diesel ever realizes his arc in this movie was only used to push him to the periphery so that The Rock and Statham could be given center stage and demands a reversal to a Diesel-centric Fast 9, the producers would be wise to cut ties, let the franchise die, move on and give Statham and The Rock their own movie that isn't saddled with the baggage of the Walker-less Fast and Furious Universe.",The Fate of the Furious

Charlize Theron has the most pretentious and vague dialog, that is supposed to sound super cool but only succeeds at reminding you of The Matrix sequels. The action scenes, while great conceptually, are missing something in execution that the last few achieved. Also half of the cast feels unnecessarily crammed in for this plot.

496,jonathangoss183,A little unrealistic.... but still a good movie.,6,22 April 2017,"Let me start by saying: I'm a sucker for a good action-packed movie, full of fighting and car chase scenes. Jason Statham is actually one of my favorite actors, just for his fight scenes. But I feel like they stretched this one a little too far. From Luke Hobbs headbutting a guy in a full riot-gear helmet and not cracking his skull(and the guy in armor actually going down) to a couple dudes in Lambo's and Bentley's taking down a whole Russian military base, I'd say it's pretty far- fetched. But, at the same time, this is the only Fast and Furious I've seen in it's entirety. Are these movies known to be outlandish and cliché? The beginning of the movie (When Letty and Toretto were in bed talking about a baby) seemed to be coming out of a 2007 romance film, so bad it made me cringe. But, with all of this being said, I was astounded with how clean the movie was, and I like that. And I still had a helluva time watching this movie, and will probably watch it again when it comes out on TV. After, of course, I watch the Fast and Furious movies 1-7, maybe I'll get it a little more.

499,mr-a-v,Too far-fetched (SPOILERS WARNING),5,15 May 2017,"Let me be clear, I never really minded the implausibility of the other movies, but in F7 the craziness of the cargo plane scene (which has by far enough power to lift the four cars weighing it down btw) was a little annoying to me. That being said, I felt like the whole of F8 was like the plane scene. 1. An unbelievable villain: She wants ""accountability""... could that be more vague?2. The logic: If you believe the movie's logic, anything with a keyboard can be hacked or used for hacking; any car that has an on- board computer can be remotely driven; a COLD WAR ERA NUCLEAR SUBMARINE can be hacked, remote-guided, and submerge-emerge fast enough to jump out of the water, and keep up with all these cars that are speeding on the ice; a light-armor vehicle can withstand anti-tank .50 cal fire, but an armored truck explodes almost instantly; Dom's car having an alleged 5000 hp (when the top modified cars before entry-level DRAGSTERS barely go over 2000); a car can pop a wheelie on ice; and many other way too incredible things.3. What really gets my goat: Han's killer, being accepted as a friend of the family. All the other movies of the franchise has at least a minimum of ""realism"" in the action scenes, like yes it was stretching the term realism to an extreme point but it was still somewhat believable. But now to me it has embodied all the things I used to hate about Pierce Brosnan's James Bond; all fireworks, thin story. I mean seriously.. the only character development in this movie is that Dom learns he's a father and loses Helena and the Shaw brother's story gets about a two minute screen time.

I understand sometimes reality doesn't look so cool, therefore I didn't mention minor unrealities. My review will be mainly about those mistakes. In summary, the story is not bad, it has some things I don't like, but it's personal opinion, not a flaw from the makers, I guess.In the beginning, the old car Dom's racing with ignites itself on fire from overheated motor, but doesn't burn the fuel and blast fuel tank. EMPs have no blast wave and would also be effective on the car itself. Roman's Lamborghini has no snow tires, therefore it's initial instability. But has the scene moves on, the car magically gain super stability, being able to successfully deviate course to dodge missiles. Submarine isn't going to get to destination before the cars, yet it gains some sort of divine speed when it surfaces, being able to get on their tails once again. Submarine explodes with nukes inside, yet none nuclear damage is caused. It's certain submarines can take explosion, external and internal, yet if it takes a missile blast and then the whole submarine goes ""kaboom"".

There are so many holes in the scenario that makes you doubt that even if you are watching a fast&furious movie! It has severed all its bond with the original F&F franchise that has no identity anymore. It is very usual to see something amazing and out of limits of normal to happen in an action movie but throughout the movie, you will see so many cases that the laws of physics are broken and not in order to achieve something amazing but just out of lack of research and attention to how would some events fold out in the movie. From another point of view, there are so many unnecessary and irrational actions taken in a movie that again makes you wonder if you are watching F&F or sesame street! i.e. if you want to steal a submarine while it is on land you definitely do not need to turn on its turbine!

The story, despite their intentions is so predictable that you cannot help but roll your eyes for the entire movie. The acting... ohhhhh... the ""acting""... some of the worst I have ever seen. Can Vin Diesel actually get worse at acting? Yes, he can. Even the performances from seasoned actors like Charlize Theron and Dwayne Johnson felt wooden, no doubt due to the horrid script and direction.Not even the action sequences nor special effects could save this movie, as they were fake enough to repeatedly kill your suspension of disbelief and distract from what little story exists.Dear Hollywood: Enough with the tired sequels.

The use close up when Dom is looking through the window at his son and his baby's mother. There using this to show tension between the guys who he is being forced to do work for and Dom. they use a dark theme when the character know as Mr Knowbody shows up. There also using the same dark light when Dom is getting briefed on the mission that he is given by the bad guys. The use a very bright light in the very beginning to shoe he is worry free or happy.

They set an unrealistic expectations of what cars and/or mechanics are capable of. However...that doesn't mean the film is not worth seeing. It's fun, exciting, visually stunning, and based on family being there for one another. (Which I hope...everyone can get behind). Yes! To answer your question. It's not realistic. But that's what the ""movies"" are all about. Taking yourself out of reality, and enter into fantasy. Plus awesome cars. The film brings almost all the characters back together for the greater good.

528,dejonefc1,Absolutely Laughable,1,21 May 2017,"Honestly, how do people watch these films?! Before you action-heads start shooting me down, do you not even consider realise how stupid this franchise is?I appreciate they are entertainment, but you then elevate these woeful actors and directors to such lofty statuses that they believe their own hype. They live fantastic lifestyles for being average and more than a few who watch these ACTUALLY BELIEVE that the plots, action and the actors who play these - quite frankly preposterous characters - are possibly/probably like that in real life, frightens me. No wonder the Tories run Britain and Donald Trump is the president of the 'free' world. Very aptly, Ludicrous stars. Because that's exactly what these films are - LUDICROUS. Anyway, the film itself is even more far-fetched than any superhero film you could ever imagine. Hanging out of cars flying 150mph across icy plains and pushing a submarine torpedo off it's natural and targeted course straight into a villain's vehicle to blow it up, continuing the horrifying myth that car doors can stop machine gun fire, fire doesn't kill the good guys, rubber bullets don't hurt The Rock, but will instantly kill a minion who is armed to the teeth with protective clothing?!Ha ha ha. It says everything about current society - most people seem to believe that fantasy is real and they then have THE STUPIDEST ideas for current world political policies, allowing the Trumps and North Korea's of this world to carry on regardless, despite their absolutely arrogant and retarded views on humanity. This may just be a film, but the money these companies and actors make justifies (in the eyes of an idiot) the shocking state of the world. The same rocking-horse-brained zombie will be too busy taking selfies and say that I am bitter and jealous of these people. Nope. Absolutely not. They are just taking advantage of you clowns who aspire to be them, but never will AND are making this world worse for those socialists who DO CARE about their fellow humans, regardless of colour, creed, race, gender, sexuality.

530,dissoci8,Terrible Movie - Beyond Fake - Could not finish watching,3,22 April 2017,"Generally I do not review movies, beyond just a star rating. However, this movie has a decent Star Rating. At the time of this review a 7.3. Unfortunately the reviews seem to be of the ""either its a 10 or a 1 variety"". Granted this movie makes me want to select 1 and leave it at that. However, the fake reviews granting this film anything above a 5- 6 pushed me to write it up.The movie begins with over the top humor based on racial stereotyping. Because you know, middle class white kids get scarred when they see Polynesian themed dancing at grade school soccer games. Yet the wives of said kids all want the lead dancer...Please. This is not a serious action movie. By definition it's a Surreal Comedy (""A form of humor based on bizarre juxtapositions, absurd situations, and nonsense logic"")Now ask yourself if this is the type of movie you signed on for. If yes, then have at it. Just remember, when you see a car doing highway speeds in reverse, that's an ""absurd situation""...laugh now. When race is used to shame your kids...laugh now. When every piece of technology used in the movie does not function properly or is used incorrectly during scenes, that's ""nonsense logic""...laugh now.Personally, I expected a serious movie. Over the top car scenes would have been par for the course. But they need a decent story, and some realism to pull together an action movie worth watching. This movie has none of it. Well perhaps the props and special effects, and actors to interact with them.Now while a 1 was what I wanted to give the film. The 3 represents the effort I saw from the actors, along with the special effects. When cars fly through the air...it looks like they are flying through the air, and the actors responds to the ridiculousness appropriately. Hence the 3.Huge disappointment because I did not hate the previous installments, and I could have used a decent action/adventure movie for a distraction. This was so bad, everyone involved should be ashamed. That goes for the bull***t reviews and ratings which artificially elevated this movie's rating above a 5 or 6.",The Fate of the Furious

534,oshevelyov,A horrific thrash,2,20 April 2017,"I remembered that 3rd part of this movie ""Tokyo Drift"", was lots of fun, so I convinced my wife to see the 8th part. What a pile of crap we saw! It started with a traditional racing, which was fun but, after so many movies about the same thing, felt quite trite, to be honest. Even colorful Cuban landscapes and passionate Latin themes didn't help. My wife called that part ""chuleria del barrio"" (a neighborhood childish put on). Producers knew that and, apparently, decided they needed to raise stakes so the movie quickly shifted into the terrorism domain. Taking into account the caricature nature of the franchise which, at the same time, pretended to be a kind of serious, the attempt was moronic from the very beginning but got worse with every turn. Protagonists first invaded Germany (Berlin) and later Russia (some Northern military base). Both times they wrecked havoc having fun killing locals. Both time locals had nothing to do with what was happening. American villains fought with American ""supermen"" on a foreign territory. After each firework and significant body count, either American villains or American ""supermen"" celebrated the victory. Locals just depicted a stupid cannon fodder with zero initiative. Their role was to appear with a gun or a ""chainsaw"" (if they were big enough) and die for American fun. Stunts and fistfights were impressive (Statham is a big talent) but the sheer lunacy of the events didn't let me enjoy the action part much. Racing, the core of the franchise, already too far-fetched to be the central part of a terrorist plot, didn't save the day because the sound in the cinema was deafening. Whenever protagonists cranked up their engines, I would start praying to have it finished before my eardrums explode. I especially remember the last scene of the movie when complacent American warriors gathered on a rooftop of a skyscraper in New York to celebrate their victory and talk about family values. Never mind they have just killed, at least, a hundred innocent Russians, who tried to save their military base from the invasion. Of course, in the mind of movie makers, those poor chaps deserved to die. Why not? After all, they were unable to protect their nuclear submarines from cunning American terrorists. If it wasn't because of the USA, the world would have ended in nuclear convulsions pretty soon. The message is clear: die poor barbarians, that's your Fate of the Furious while we, an uber-nation, continue breed and prosper.",The Fate of the Furious

547,ahmedfiraol2013,the movie was great but the franchise has its flaws,7,21 November 2017,"The franchise known for its fast cars and the ""best crew in the world,"" blessed us with yet another spectacular movie. The eighth installment of the franchise, Fast and Furious, brought both action and somewhat comedy (by Roman Pierce) to the big screen earlier this year. Generating nearly a hundred million dollars in its opening week, the movie was a success. I, for one, enjoyed the movie as much as everyone else in the theater. However, I'm somewhat dissatisfied with the turn the franchise took to some extent. With his son and baby mama being held hostage by cipher for her bidding, the crew leader (Dom) must go rogue and turn on his. In doing so, his crew is forced to hunt him down and stop him with the help of a convict (Deckard), Hobbs and Mr. Nobody. This showed that the crew is ready to stop anyone, even one of their own, at any cost if they have to. Adding nuclear weapons in the mix, nobody can accuse this latest adventure of playing for small stakes. Still, the Fate of the Furious, which eschews designating its sequel status numerically, only sporadically sparks to life, with the best recurring bit involving the macho banter between Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs and Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw, which eventually prompts even these tough guys to burst out laughing. From An orange Lamborghini to a submarine in Russia and hacking cars halfway across the world, the fate of the furious is shied away from its original movie. The opening scene, however, showed promise as it's a classic fast, an exhilarating street race in Havana that Dom wins by stripping down an old Junker to its barest bones and giving it a flaming shot of NOS. It's the one classical old-school race in the entire movie, with Havana making for the most decorous of Old World mazes, and Dom, in the home stretch, driving the car in reverse, its engine engulfed in flame. But when a slow-motion overhead shot shows him inching ahead across the finish line. No one anticipated that a movie that once begun as a bunch of illegal street racers robbing petroleum would later escalate to juggling not only nukes but an EMP device and a Russian submarine. Overall, The Fate of the Furious is a movie where Vin Diesel races a car that's on fire — backward, Jason Statham battles untold minions on a plane, all while holding a baby. During the climax, the crew has to outrace a submarine. And then somewhere in the middle, an innocent supporting character is shot in the head by Charlize Theron's Cipher, execution-style. ""The Fate of the Furious"" isn't the first movie to dramatically shift gears, slipping an unpleasant death into a movie that otherwise didn't give a care about human life. There's one in ""Fast & Furious 6."" As a movie whose climax involved the longest airport runway in history ends, we see Han, a quiet yet very likable member of the franchise, walking around, minding his own business, when all of a sudden there's a big explosion, followed by the first appearance of Statham's Deckard Shaw, who swings by to announce himself the bad guy of the next sequel by shooting Han in the head.",The Fate of the Furious

555,bubbasvn,Interesting but quite too many unbelievable situations,7,28 April 2017,"(Non - Spoiler Section) is it good? Yes, it's interesting and worth watching. Going into the film you will be anxiously waiting to see why Dom betrays his team after watching the the trailers. It is action packed and brings some nice comedic dialogue and some really nice action scenes. Except some parts rely a lot on CGI.(Spoiler Section) Now, whether it is unbelievable that Dom can pick up an EMP bomb with ease, or that the Rock can break handcuffs at an extremely secure prison is beyond me, but it doesn't stop there. So it is OK for Kurt Russel's character to allow prison guards to be injured or killed, to prove a point, and in that kind of prison the guards would ask the Rock to return to his cell without just zapping him first. So Dom can elbow his car door off in the middle of the street, or how the greatest hacker in the world can't notice a tracker on her plane, that later on shows a red blinking light, that can easily be seen flashing towards the end of the movie. Is it believable that an EMP would not destroy the communications in Dom's car, or the CPU in his car. And also the EMP hit the security room, so why was it still running? Also why could the submarine still run after an EMP. Wasn't the submarine on stilts? How did it get off the stilts and into the water? When firing a sniper rifle from that range, how could gravity and wind speed be ignored? Can Dom really jump out of a vehicle and not be hurt at all? Plus fire explosions don't just stop because there is a car in the way, why wasn't anyone angry at Dom on the ice for killing Deckard Shaw? How doesn't Roman have hypothermia? And a Lamborghini door isn't bulletproof oh and if they could use X-ray from a satellite to look through that Russian car, why couldn't they do it to see Dom not at his car? The previous movie was about saving that program that Ramsey made, and Cipher has it, how was this not solved or part of their main concern? How do you go on a plane like that and not at least bring a parachute? WHy wasn't Dom's cousin upset with Dom before he gave him His ride? Especially when he tore it apart? Am I missing any?

Fate of the Furious is moving the franchise in the right direction. This film is by far the best since the reboot in 2009. I enjoyed the great new locations and the variety of cars. The opening scene in Cuba was a good throwback to fans of the original movies, and using Cuba as a backdrop is 10/10. The car culture in Cuba fits this film perfectly. I believe the action scenes were much better choreographed than previous, the Prison scene to be exact is a huge step up from previous films and is a scene i won't soon forget. Charlize Theron was a great addition to the cast she makes a great villain and i hope to see Kurt Russell back again with the rest of this fantastic cast. I give it an 8/10 just because some of the action scenes where too gimmicky even for Fast and Furious, but all in all its a fun experience and good mind numbing action especially in a theater so i encourage everyone see it in theaters.

The good guy turns bad (temporarily) and the bad guy suddenly becomes the new ""brother""...never seen that before.After watching the trailer you can predict the whole story of the film and with a chance of 99% you will get it right. Apart from the normal smaller errors like self-repairing cars, the film suffers from major logical errors that are even visible for our ""smart guy"" Roman. Submarines at the speed of cars, never landing, refilling and invisible planes. Oh, and why should you shoot the bad guys in their cars with a bloody tank if you can also wait for Dom to appear in his tuned car ramming them? Seems legit. I could go on for ages but I'm getting tired.The film might not be too bad for new viewers who just want some senseless action and a bit of fun. I did laugh for example during the Jason Statham ""plane-baby scene"", but that didn't fit to F&F at all. And by the way: Did they just trusted and worked together with a guy who killed Han and nearly the whole ""family"".For any ""true"" Fast & Furious fans the franchise died when Paul did I guess.

Like the muscle car vs tuner kind of vibe that they've had in the old ones. But since the movie has taken a different route a long time ago. then I'm not going to complain. The storyline got more confusing, and complicated, and unbelievable as hell. People who never saw any fast and furious movie will face some issues understanding the storyline. As I've had a hard time explaining the story to my friends during the movie. And lastly, I wish that they could use a little less CGI and that's it.

564,chechevara,Decent Installment In The Franchise,6,3 August 2017,"I remember when Fast 5 breathed new life into the Fast & Furious franchise. The first film was an enjoyable mindless popcorn action flick. For me 2 Fast 2 Furious is a guilty pleasure. I would say that Fast & Furious 4 is the worse film. Tokyo Drift is my favorite out of the 4 films. Fast 5 is my favorite in the series while the 6th & 7th film were my 2nd & 3rd favorite. Then we have Fate of The Furious which in my opinion is the weakest out of 5, 6, & 7. The Action scenes are just as thrilling (albeit way too super long) as ever. The team is still the same we can root for during these situations (Dwayne Johnson & Jason Statham Being My Favorite Characters. & i found the concept of Dom turning evil interesting. If only the execution was better. The villain is not as good as Owen Shaw but she's still an interesting villain nonetheless. A few problems i had with the film was some of the forced humor could've easily been taken out. The reasoning behind Dom betraying his team makes no sense just so they can connect to the other films, & the action scenes could've been more intense and WAY shorter. But it's still an enjoyable film nonetheless & if you want to see a mindless popcorn action flick. I recommend you give it a watch. But it won't be as good as 5 & 6",The Fate of the Furious

568,den_harrow,"The 3rd ""F&F"" extremely stupid & childish movie in a row",1,26 April 2017,"First of all, I have a confession to make. I still have installed, on my personal PC (as in ""I'm its only user PC"") Need for Speed V: Porsche Unleashed (released 2000), which I re-play, again and again and AGAIN, on a weekly basis (yep, that's one of my guilty pleasures, mind you). And NFS Most Wanted, the 2012 version (still unfinished, because some cars are giving me a v. v. v. hard time...). And NFS Hot Pursuit (the 2010 version). And the latest no-internet-connection-required, NFS Rivals. ""Need for Speed"" STILL is a very good and successful franchise and, obviously, is the main inspiration for this ""F&F"" franchise (various cars, from American Muscle to Italian or German exotics, infinite tuning possibilities, pursuits, drifting competitions, racing competitions etc. etc. etc. ...). These NFS releases are games. AMAZING games. Which can't be cloned. In this particularly case, imitating is not a sign of flattery. That's why, IMHO, I think that it's about time for you, you Hollywood $$$ hunters, to stop making movies under this ""F&F"" franchise. Actually, you should have stopped after the fifth movie. The sixth was (and I'm extremely generous here) a very low ""so-so"", the seventh a small disaster and a medium waste of time, and the eight is The Mighty Disaster, The Supreme Failure... This one should be one of the movies to finally convince IMDb that the ""zero"", if not the ""zero"" AND the ""minus"" ratings are a MUST.Without revealing anything from the so-called ""plot"" (LMFAOLOL), if you're anything above 9 y. o., do not -I repeat + I advice + I warn you- DO NOT waste your time and torture your senses, your brain and your cinephile ego with this... this... this... OMFG, this ""F&F VIII""!!! Avoid this one like the plague, because you'll have only to win. You'll save some money (so you can buy beers and re-watch, for example, ""Tokyo Drift"" - my favorite in the series), you'll spare 2+ hours of your life and you'll protect your neurons from being molested & destroyed by one of the most imbecile & ridiculous car movies I've EVER seen.Both the entire ""plot"" (ROFLOL) and the technical possibilities of ""that"" car in New York City are, simply, shameless insults to the viewer, a plain and simple retarded disgusting mockery.The ""F&F"" saga is over. We, the cars and tuning and races and horse-power lovers - we know this. The following movies, the 9th, the 10th etc. etc. (because they will transform this into a cine-series) will be only some ""minus one"", or ""minus two"" or lower. You should have quit while you were ahead. Really.RIP ""Fast&Furious"".",The Fate of the Furious

This movie was very disappointing. All of Dom's character development was destroyed in the first minutes of this movie after he turned evil en betrayed everyone. Charlize Theron was cringe and stupid as Cypher, worst F&F villian. The Rock and Statham chemistry was pretty good and it is nice to see them together, but overall this movie was really bad.

The franchise has become every moviegoer's guilty pleasure — mindless over-the-top action, million dollar sports cars, and the signature close-ups of women's butts. The cheesy dialogue and line delivery is forgivable, the acting is passable, and the cast is likable (the leader of whom being Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel, who is carrying the series on his back at this point). The new villain this time around is Cipher, played by Charlize Theron. Her mysterious monotone character is the most interesting of the Fast & Furious antagonists thus far. Speaking of antagonists, it is very entertaining to see the Shaw brothers (played by Jason Statham and Luke Evans) join the team and fight alongside Agent Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson"") and Company. Jason Statham's performance, particularity his charisma with Dwayne Johnson, really is the highlight of the film. Vin Diesel is great as always, and in Fate of the Furious we see a more emotional side of him as he goes against the family to save his infant son. His betrayal does seems out of character, which is my only complaint about the film. It is very satisfying, though, when he is reunited with the rest of the characters. The nod to Brian at the end is a nice touch (Rest in Peace Paul Walker).Overall, Fate of the Furious is a hell of a good time. It goes where the series hasn't gone before, which I didn't think would be possible. Stunts and fight choreography are top-notch as always. Very entertaining and refreshing, and meant for the big screen. 8/10.",The Fate of the Furious

586,archanasinghmit,Mindless entertainment!,8,13 April 2017,"Still fast and still furious, even after 7 older parts. This movie is the third FAF movie I have ever seen. I spent my weekly quota for entertainment related activities on this movie. I could have bought a book or seen a show on netflix, but I instead spent it on IMAX. And 'experienced' this movie. Hence it deserves, at least my review. Despite my reluctant and unenthusiastic premise before going to watch it, I must say, I was thoroughly entertained.The exemplary performance of miss Charlize Theron is eerily captivating. She's exuberates such intensity with her performance that it would feel like I'd convert into ice the moment she touches me. Vin Diesel on the other hand is as expressionless as he has been in all the other movies. Does excessive exercise make your face incapable of showing emotion ? Maybe. Despite his attempt to look extremely scary, somehow to me he looks like a teddy bear I could totally cuddle with. He's adorable. Watching him being blackmailed by Charlize was like watching Cercei torture Hodor.This movie had such an elaborate story that it could easily have been stretched into a two part movie. Saying that, we were exhausted after watching the drama and action packed in those 2 hours of screenplay. You're not going to feel inspired or fulfilled in any way after watching it. Its not going to be a profound experience of sorts. There will come no time during the movie where you would feel empathy for anyone. This movie is not going to make you a better person in any way. But it'll make you laugh. Groan with disgust at the bloodshed. Strengthen your resolve to not drive again. Make you really worried about the kind of message impressionable young kids might be getting out of racing on streets. And also make you want to travel. Its a mixed bag.

This is an incredible extravaganza of stupidity, but at the same time charismatic and driving. But the most important thing is that the film copes well with its main task - it amuses.But in fact, I do not really understand how to evaluate this movie. Then Dwyane Johnson scattered the special forces in batches, rubber bullets did not take him. And by the way, the fights here look ridiculous, and not because of the fact that the bad, namely because of enchanting illogicality. The film is even capable of surprising. For example, Vin Diesel began to play, squeezes out tears. And to that, Scala shoots a brutal smile. Statham is a cute nanny.In general, everything is clear. The audience will most likely be divided into two camps. One will say that after the first parts Forsage is nothing really impressive. And about how I already said earlier. Namely, that this is only an unbelievable extravaganza of stupidity. And the second easily disconnects the head before viewing and without thinking it will just look at the picture and have fun.And as for me, then at least once to be honest. To look and forget.

592,adamdarby-24524,"Although more of the same, Fast 8 is silly popcorn fun!",7,18 April 2017,"If you are looking for artful cinematic entertainment full of acute intellect and emotional substance, then you may want to stop reading this review. But, chances are you have seen the previous 7 films in the franchise (or a majority of them) and intend to indulge in another 2 hours of Vin Diesel proclaiming his adoration of family and expensive cars doing everything imaginable. And if that is the case, then you'll leave the theater with a smile on your face and money well spent. Part of the beauty behind the recent entries in this series is the awareness of what they have become and why they are so successful. Any attempts at formulating a thought-provoking plot are clearly placed near the bottom half of the priority list. After all, this is a franchise built on a gentle remake of Point Break with street racing at its core. But by this point, street racing is obligated to make a brief appearance and remind the audience of the ""Fast and Furious"" roots. Let's face it, they're over-the-top action-heist extravaganzas now. Cars, chases, gadgets, explosions, and government-endorsed destruction all featuring your favorite set of characters that used to simply race cars when they cops weren't looking. With the latest Fast and Furious film (and first released after the loss of star Paul Walker) coming out this past weekend entitled The Fate of the Furious, the tradition is kept alive while continuing to confuse viewers with their laughably inconsistent movie titles.The film doesn't take many risks in terms of changing up the established formula, but the big change is Dominic Toretto's (Diesel) intent to work against his own team this time around. It opens with a street racing scene reminiscent of the original movie. Once that is out of the way and you're in the mood for more, the plot begins. Dom has finally settled down with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) to live a life of ease. But as per usual, Dom is pulled away into another job against his will by an elusive cyberterrorist who goes by the name of Cipher (played to outrageous perfection by Oscar-winner Charlize Theron). She threatens him with something personal in order to have him betray the ones he calls family. Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Jason Statham and Kurt Russell all reprise their roles from the last few movies. It is now up to the rest of the Furious team to find a way to stop their leader along with Cipher in order to save the world once again.First off, let me preface my opinion by saying that this movie is a lot of fun. The action is ridiculous and defies all laws of physics, but it serves as a great popcorn blockbuster. With The Rock and Statham having to put aside their differences and work together this time around, some wonderful chemistry comes out of these two and their ""macho"" egos. And while Russell returns to play the slick Mr. Nobody, his inexperienced and by-the-book partner (played by Clint Eastwood's son Scott) allows for the addition of a funny new character who ends up as the butt of many jokes courtesy of Tyrese and Ludicrous. The enduring quality of this series has always been these enjoyable characters that accompany the crazy action. Fate keeps this as the driving force behind the somewhat rehashed plot (pun intended).As entertaining as this movie was, it does seem to drag at its lengthy run time of 2 hours and 16 minutes. Since the plot doesn't have much new to bring to the table, it can seem a little repetitive despite the interesting twist revealed in the middle. Cipher is an engaging James Bond-type villain, but Theron's ""calm yet crazy"" bad guy routine grows stale and familiar by the final act. There are also certain instances of comedic relief (one taking place on a plane) that seem a little too far-fetched even by Fast and Furious standards. It took me straight out of the film at times.Although it may not break much new ground or stand out as much as the more memorable first and fifth entries in the franchise, it is a wonderful popcorn flick. If you are a fan of the other recent ones, then you will certainly have a fun time with Fate as well. The chemistry between the team is still intact and the action is bigger and crazier than before. I wish they would have ended it after the tear-jerking conclusion to the last movie with the send-off for Paul Walker. But if they are going to drag this series out to make more money, they might as well go nuts. Check out Fate of the Furious (aka The Fast and the Furious 8) in theaters now.",The Fate of the Furious

From the very first scene there was more action and suspense than you could poke a stick at.I wasn't planning on reviewing The Fate of the Furious when I decided to go see it at the cinemas, but about a quarter of the way in I decided that I simply must, because I want everyone to know what an awesome film it is and that it's worth all the time and money in the world going to see. The characters were consistent, as always. I absolutely loved the banter between Hobbs and Deckard, and think they both bring so much to the series. Deckard is the guy everyone loves to hate and oh, did I hate him in the seventh film. However, I found him much more likable in The Fate of the Furious— probably because he was one of the good guys. Roman and Tej are also two of my favorite characters. They're always witty and humorous, but both bring their own skills to the table.I must say that it absolutely broke my heart to see Dom betray his family and his team. I still have no clue why he did it, and that's one of the main issues I have with the film. The story line was quite complex and I didn't really understand it, but I've never been good at that. I think it's so cool that you can still enjoy the film without knowing all the in's and out's, or every last detail. Dom's always been one of my favorite characters, although I was ready to never forgive him after the stunt he pulled in The Fate of the Furious. I think deep down I always knew he'd go back to his family and do what was right, and needless to say, he's still one of my favorite characters. I think it was very brave of the produces and directors to take a crowd favorite and turn him into a character who most people will probably now hate, but I think it was 100% the right thing to do. Being the eighth film in a series, it would have been all too easy to play it safe and pursue the same old story line. Instead, they changed it up and did something no-one saw coming and which everyone hated by turning the main character against his family. Can you imagine how boring it would have been if none of that had have happened and everything throughout the film had just been smooth sailing, without any drama?Which brings me to the character of Cipher. I absolutely hated her, and not just because she was the villain. I found her to be incredibly weak-willed and boring. She made everyone else do all the hard work for her, and where does she get off telling Dom what he should feel and that what he is feeling is actually false? Blah, blah, blah. I didn't know that she could read minds. Plus, who likes a character who turns a good man against his family and friends, kills an innocent woman in front of her baby, and threatens to (and almost does) kill said baby? There's nothing that satisfied me more than seeing her fall to her demise, and I would have loved to have seen her die a slow and painful death. I give this film 9/10 because it kept me on the edge of my seat and was an absolute joy to watch. It was a bit predictable at times, but name one film that isn't.",The Fate of the Furious
598,arfinabirkhan,Overall One of the best Action Movies.,10,24 April 2017,"Excellent making , good cast & crew selections . Though the escape scene of The Rock and Jason Statham should have been more better but i also liked it But mostly the End scenes were far way better like the previous movies of Fast and Furious Series. Watched each and every movie of Fast And Furious series and hopefully waiting for the 9th one.",The Fate of the Furious
599,dewii,No words for this....,1,25 April 2017,"There have been two movies in my life so far, that really had me on the edge of leaving the cinema before it was all over. Both times i decided to sit it through, making me feel dumber with every minute. Where the first of those was an infamous flick going by the name of ""Transformers 3"" the second was this very.... i don't even know what to call it.For my faith in humanity to be restored, i REALLY have to HOPE and PRAY that all this 10/10 reviews are some part of a marketing campaign. If they aren't, i can not help but feel tremendously sorry. Even stating things like ""FF8 is totally over the top, it just has to be like that, much fun much wow"" does not even come close to the point in any aspect. The whole movie is a gigantic insult to every form of intelligence and makes me wonder, how much they had to pay some of the more renown actors, to filth their names with starring in it. Going into detail in whatsoever way would just totally not be worth it, as is paying 6 bucks for this.I couldn't help but have a special problem with Vin Diesel. His whole appearance, voice, everything, worked absolutely perfect in films like Riddick, to a certain extent also in Tripple X. In this movie yet, his dumb one liners, faked emotions and overall ""pretending"" (whereas there is no better word for what this movie had all of its characters do for over 2 hours) just has you cringe every minute of his screen time.Finally DO NOT be fooled: you WILL NOT enjoy any of this movies (ridiculous) ""action"" scenes, when every other dialogue, story line and every other bit of it leaves you in utter pain.EDIT: one more mention of the word ""family"" and i would have puked all over my popcorn.",The Fate of the Furious
600,fltacious,Better Than I Expected,10,27 April 2017,"First off, this movie was definitely worth going to see!!! My husband is a Fast and the Furious fanatic and he was not disappointed! I was entertained by the plot by the action at the beginning till the very end!! It was very funny and I loved the twist to the movie. It all came together well. This is a must see!!!",The Fate of the Furious
601,lukasstyle,1,10,30 April 2017,"Amazing Movie with many action and awesome moments! You have to watch it!! 10/10 Its still a movie about cars, and the most are insane car scenes which you never watched before. There is much epic, dramatic and amazing fighting scenes which are very good performed. I love that movie and you don't have to watch the other movies of Fast and Furios before. The story background is amazing but I don't want to spoil you guys. Enjoy the movie ;)",The Fate of the Furious
602,coke-18568,Good action movie to numb the brain,4,1 May 2017,"All in all this is a good action movie with plenty of jokes . But is this fast and furious ? Definitely NO . The movie starts from being about street racers with believable crime to a group of past street racers fighting criminal gangs . But fast 8 makes even mutant looks weak . Cars flying around , superhuman powers kinda level which leaves drivers feels nothing from car crashes . The worst part is , the story line is not even believable . Even if they are legendary car racers , how come the gang are more powerful and skilled in weaponry than CIA , FBI , OR Army of any country. Fast 8 makes james bond weak . This is not about car race action anymore . Sad for what it becomes .",The Fate of the Furious
603,infosalimjabali,Overview,8,13 May 2017,"This post may contain a spoiler: Fast and the Furious is an action packed, family fun film that keeps you on the edge of your seat! The controlled traffic scene will forever be an epic moment in film-making history! A personal favorite of mine. RIP Paul Walker, the film had an amazing tribute to keep you forever in the movie and our thoughts.",The Fate of the Furious
604,cmwarbird-63999,Just an awesome movie,10,18 May 2017,"You know, I really loved this Movie. And I am someone, watching all sorts of stuff, just for entertainment. I don't overthink things too much when it comes to movies. I probably love many movies, quite a lot of people think are trash. So what ?The way I judge a movie is about when the movie ends, if I had a good time with it. I don't care how much budget a movie spent, how many stunts, how many explosions and things like that are in it. I don't really care if its over the top, if ""physics"" isn't reality like, if its realistic or not.Why would I care about these things ? Its about entertainment, nothing else.This is actually my first ever review on IMDb, and I sure often thought about doing it before. But, and that's probably the reason of the kinda replies I am getting for this here. There is just too many rude-a** people here, that cant live with the fact that some people like stuff they don't. And the only thing they have to deal with that, is to insult others for doing that. Boohoo, get a life.I watched most of the F&F movies, and you know what, its not just the stunts and the explosions and all that what makes these movies worth it for me, but its the actors. I like all the actors, which is already a win-win for any movie or tvshow, for me. If I like them, they can do pretty much what they want, and I would still love it.So for all you overthinking, realism & detail nerds, this is a great movie. Everyone else will enjoy this. Deal with it.",The Fate of the Furious
605,subedibigyan,Review,6,19 May 2017,"I would say the theme of the movie of fast and furious has drifted from its original course now. The movie's initial theme was mostly about fast cars, underground races, and car modifications. but now the movie is more of an action movie where there is more of an action thrilled and fight.The fate of the Furious does indeed start with a race and eventually leads to the crime theme. Dom Toretto steals weapons for a hacker as his teammates try to stop him with flashy cars which are mostly expensive cars not modified or anything when the movie had initially come up with in the first movie. As the movie continues there is more of a chase and run style and barely any race making it interesting as it following past movies.",The Fate of the Furious
606,reconwitch-27257,2 hours and 16 minutes wasted,1,20 May 2017,"I always watch a movie with no preconceived thoughts on how it is going to be. Some movies will surprise you and be one of the best you've seen in a while. This was not one of those movies. It was a waste of time honestly. It's the same thing regurgitated for the 8th time. I did like all the characters but the only things I can say good about the movie was that I like several of the actors, some pretty scenery, some pretty cars and I've run out of good things that quickly. Now if you are a huge fan of the Furious movies then you'll probably not see anything wrong with it. If you aren't a fan then find something else to watch.",The Fate of the Furious
607,lizwilson-03256,hate it,10,21 May 2017,after what they did with the last ones i found this film disgusting and disappointing. i will never watch it again. i spent since the last one looking forward to this one coming out and was left wishing i had not wasted my time. i would rather have watched paint dry than watch this. i love Vin diesel but even i cant accept that he is OK with this. t take back what i said,The Fate of the Furious
608,damnedwhatuser,Absolutely senseless,1,6 June 2017,"One of the most stupid, senseless and ridiculous movies I have ever watched. I wonder only why would Charlize Theron play in something like that? Money must have been very tempting for an Oscar-winning actress to even think about that this could become a good movie with no story, no developing characters, not even a story but just lots of money thrown on some... well I must admit - good special effects. But not worth even a dime to pay for a ticket to watch it, not talking even about the waste of time.",The Fate of the Furious
609,whaimaru,"Im in, 100%",10,22 December 2017,"This is what you call good bull$#!+. Its not trying to pretend, its not trying to be anything other than what you expect. And you get that in truck loads. And I love it! If you are a dumb@$$ who walks into this expecting shakespeare then thats your fault! Dont blame anyone else, just look in the mirror and say hello to a moron. For everyone else who wants to ride that furious road once again, its all good! Bring on the next one",The Fate of the Furious
610,imtizza,Stop making more movies...,1,9 June 2017,"I don't know why people praise this movie. It's pure and utter nonsense, ever since the first 2 movies the franchise has gone from worse to worst. Clichéy characters, cringe lines, anabolic adrenaline and unrealistic scenarios. Don't forget about the plot... OMG serious its so bad i cried. Hollywood just keeps adding more and more BS into this series. Its a shame since the first 2 movies actually were good. Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez will forever be bad actors.",The Fate of the Furious
611,jedinichelsea,An insult to all those who paid money to see it,1,20 June 2017,"Be aware, plausible spoilers I do not know where to start. I thought that I'm used to the cheesiness of the FF movies, but this is......overwhelming. Its like they are making movies for people under 18 only. Whole movie is a load of random c***. Its so senseless, cheesy, unbelievably unrealistic, cliché- ish.....total disaster. They ruined good characters, like deck shaw. In ff7, he was terrifying hit-man. Here, they turned him into a clown who is afraid of his mother. Its ridiculous. Next, is it a bird, is it a plane? No, its......Luke HOBBS!!! My Lord, he is the perfect example of everything wrong in modern Hollywood. Awful acting, cringe lines, superhuman strength (they literally took it to the superman level in ff8) Cipher- theron is a brilliant actor in normal movies, but here they made her a joke. I would compare it to the thurman's poison ivy from 1997. Tbh, roman is the only lightspot. He really is funny, natural funny, not bad humour like others. He is the reason why I made it to the end.",The Fate of the Furious
612,jmanjarrez-84015,Awesome installment,10,27 June 2017,"Awesome installment in the series. Great action sequences mixed with some good comedy and some good drama. The whole cast did great with their parts, but I think The Rock and Jason Statham stole the show this one, the latter with his fight scene on the plane as he tried to protect Dom's kid.",The Fate of the Furious

But hundreds of cars ( even VW PASSAT from 1998 ) driving themselves ??? Come on, why rape these fine Fast & Furious series, this was so bad, so terrible bad, the writer must be on some XTC or something, such a shame !!! And why all these people rate it high ???? Unbelievable, i really loved these series but this part 8 was very very bad, after 40 minutes i STOPPED WATCHING !!! i waited for 1 year for this movie, so excited, but damn, who did this, please people, don't rate this crap so high, don't see it, waste of your time and money.",The Fate of the Furious

If you are a fast and furious fan then you'll be disappointed at this one. Action scenes was stupid and made no sense. the villain was just terrible. they lost the plot completely. very disappointed!!!,The Fate of the Furious
616,chrisaustin10,Beyond awful,2,19 August 2017,"I like all the previous movies despite the nonsense sometimes. But this one, it was painful to watch. Extremely disappointed of Charlize Theron, her character was very cartoonish, and her criminal organization did not even make sense. She just made this movie for the money and the reputation of the series, I am sure. She may be the lamest bad guy of any movie. Spoilers, Who finances her airplane anyway? And where do they land without police interference? Statman was the only good thing of this movie. And how the heck Vin Diesel changes personalities just like that? What a pu**y! And Theron plastic surgeries were very distracting as well!",The Fate of the Furious

This is without question one of the most moronic films ever made. Despite the stars (who are all capable of much more), despite the massive effects budget, despite fast cars and scantily clad women, this still manages to be two of the most boring hours you'll ever spend watching a film.
