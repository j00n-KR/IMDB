0,SnoopyStyle,real story done well,7,23 October 2020,"PRT Kamdesh was built in a remote Afghan valley surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountains. The American soldiers defend the badly situated camp against constant attacks from positions above. In 2006, 55 allied soldiers are attacked by an estimated 400 enemy force.It's a compelling story and a harrowing fight for survival. The battle is riveting. It's based on the true events. Scott Eastwood is probably the most recognizable face. He also has the John Wayne character. It is a real life story partly turned into a John Wayne movie. That's probably its weakest aspect where the enemy is always standing up right and taking a full load of bullets in the chest. For some reason, they are gathered up in a group always ready to be mowed down. The Rambo sensibility is its Archilles' heel. The battle is still top level action although the soldiers really need to dig underground tunnel access to the ammunition depot instead of playing cards, pumping iron, or jerking off to other people's wives. The other minor issue is the large number of characters. It's to be expected from this real life war story. In some ways, this may be better as a limited series on a streaming service. It deserves a six hour treatment. As it stands at two hours, it's a bit too long for a theatrical movie anyways. All in all, this is a compelling true story done relatively well.",The Outpost
1,nogodnomasters,Thank you for your service,9,18 July 2020,"This is a war film based on a true story. It takes place at an indefensible base in Kamdesh surrounded by mountains, They are targeted on a daily basis. The soldiers are required to be diplomats to the people shooting at them. Of course, being sitting ducks invites a major confrontation. The film was realistic. You didn't know who would live or die from the start other than Scott Eastwood and Orlando Bloom. They get paid too much to die in the first scene. The film does not make any political statements. It does show the horror of war in such a way as to question it.Guide: F-word.

2,zardoz-13,Victory in Afghanistan,10,6 October 2020,"""Last Castle "" director Rod Lurie's harrowing tale of combat in Afghanistan ""The Outpost"" gives us a glimpse of a baptism by fire comparable to Brian Trenchard-Smith's ""The Siege at Firebase Gloria"" (1989) and Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001). Based on a true incident, this heroic epic draws ostensibly on two published sources: CNN reporter Jake Tapper's ""The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor"" (2012) and Sergeant Clinton Romesha's memoir ""Red Platoon: A True Story Of American Valor"" (2016). Hyperbole aside, this adrenalin-laced, testosterone-fueled, high-octane depiction of fewer than 60 gallant American soldiers repulsing an onslaught of 300 Taliban insurgents is genuinely inspiring. Mind you, considering the disadvantages our guys faced, it is all the more gratifying because these fearless Americans triumphed over a relentless enemy that tried to annihilate them! Simultaneously, the sacrifices to life and limb here will evoke patriotic tears.During the slow-burn first hour of this two hour plus account, ""Finest Hours"" scenarists Paul Tamasy & Scott Johnson and Lurie acquaint us with far too many Americans to remember and then plunge us into a helter-skelter reenactment of the Battle of Kamdesh. Historically, this combat occurred in 2009, when Taliban troops launched a devastating attack on Combat Outpost Keating. According to director Rod Lurie, Millennium Media duplicated all of the violence in Bulgaria on a shoe-string budget rather than venture into rugged Afghanistan where all the blood was spilled. Nevertheless, the producers have commemorated the exploits of living and dead alike without resorting to maudlin sentiment. The end credits reveal this battle was singular because it boasted two living Medal of Honor recipients. Miraculously, only eight U.S. Army servicemen died. Sadly, some 22 personnel received wounds during this make-or-break attack.Initially, ""The Outpost"" presents strategy, facts, and opinions to keep in mind. ""In 2006, the U.S. Army established a series of outposts in Northern Afghanistan to promote counterinsurgency. The intent was to connect with the locals and to stop the flow of weapons and Taliban fighters from Pakistan. One of these was PRT Kamdesh. It was built in a remote valley completely surrounded by the Hindu-Kush Mountains. One analyst said it may as well be called 'Camp Custer.' His reasoning was simple and official. Everyone at the Outpost was going to die."" Basically, Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines 'counterinsurgency' as ""organized military activity designed to combat insurgency."" Meanwhile, 'insurgency' means ""a condition of revolt against a government that is less than an organized revolution and that is not recognized as belligerency."" This preface prepares audiences for a largely factual film designed to keep them on the edge of their seat.
""The Outpost"" unfolds in a series of chapters. Each chapter is named after the commander-in-charge at the time. The film opens with an American chopper landing under cover of darkness at Camp Kamdesh with replacements. Grim-faced Staff-Sergeant Clinton Romesha (Scott Eastwood of ""Fury"") rides strapped into the front seat of the whirlybird as it descends. Blessed with his father's chiseled, matinee idol looks, Eastwood portrays one of the two Medal of Honor winners. The younger Eastwood acquits himself competently as one of the few soldiers to survive combat without any serious wounds. After casing the suicidal camp he must defend, Romesha crawls into his bunk for some well-deserved sack time. He frowns at a phrase scrawled on the slants of the bed above him: ""It doesn't get any better."" The prevailing opinion among the occupants of Combat Outpost Keating was they felt like fish in a barrel waiting for the Taliban to shoot them. Without fail every day, these G.I.s are told the Taliban plans to storm their camp. After a while, our guys treat these ominous warnings with the same skepticism until the unbelievable happens and the Taliban attacks.Life for the commanders of Camp Kamdesh is no picnic. The first CO is CPT Ben Keating (Orlando Bloom of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy""), and he maintains friendly relations with the native Afghans, like a calvary commander in the Old West would have with reservation Indians. He dies trying to drive an oversized truck along a narrow switchback road on the side of a steep mountain. CPT Robert Yllescas (Milo Gibson of ""Hacksaw Ridge"") replaces Keating, but he doesn't last long either. Explosive would best describe his demise. Other officers follow, and one is replaced, leaving First Lieutenant Andrew Bundermann (Taylor John Smith of ""Martyrs"") in charge. Ironically, when everything goes sideways, Bundermann finds himself in his skivvies orchestrating resistance against the trigger-happy, towel-headed aggressors. One of the least valiant soldiers, SPC Ty Carter (Caleb Landry Jones of ""American Made""), has trouble differentiating ammo calibers for the camp machine-gunners. Later, Carter redeems himself in more ways than one when the Taliban invade Camp Kamdesh for the grand finale.""Ghosts of War"" lenser Lorenzo Senatore distinguishes himself when he hurls us into the thick of the fracas. Some of the aerial drone photography, especially during a bridge crossing over a serene river in the middle of nowhere, is utterly sensational. At times, you'll feel like you're caught in a hailstorm of lead and explosives that never seem to abate. Veterans as well as first-person, videogame, combat shooters will treat this experience as either exhilarating or petrifying. The sacrifices these Americans made against overwhelming odds is enough to prompt you to cower behind your furniture as you watch what looks like a massacre! Interestingly enough, the cast consists of either the sons of superstar actors/musicians or their grandchildren. Scott Eastwood, Milo Gibson, Mick's son James Jagger as well as Will Attenborough, the grandson of Oscar winning director Richard Attenborough, and Alan Alda's grandson Scott Alda Coffey, make up the tour-de-force cast. Orlando Bloom appears briefly as the first captain, and several veterans of Combat Outpost Keating actually reprised their real-life roles in this unforgettable opus. Anybody who enjoys war movies about charismatic American soldiers kicking ass will want to watch this combat classic more than once.",The Outpost
3,grantss,"Gripping, gritty war drama",7,20 November 2020,"Situated in an isolated area of Afghanistan, Combat Outpost Keating is manned by a small force of US Army soldiers and very vulnerable to attack. After years of sporadic, light attacks, in October 2009 the Taliban attack in force. The odds are massively stacked against the defenders.Based on the true story of the Battle of Kamdesh, The Outpost does a great job of portraying the terror, confusion, camaraderie and bravery of soldiers in battle. Very realistic, giving the viewer the feeling for what an infantry battle must be like.Very emotional too, especially towards the end.Not perfect though. The set-up feels clumsy and long-winded. I get that the director is trying to show the bonds between the men but it seems forced and doesn't actually achieve the engagement level he is aiming for.Overall, worth watching.",The Outpost
4,ferguson-6,puts us in it,7,4 July 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Rod Lurie's latest is not only based on a remarkable true story, it uses the real American soldier's names (and some real soldiers) and depicts the valiant efforts of those who were part of the Battle of Kamdesh in Afghanistan on October 3, 2009. Mr. Lurie (THE CONTENDER, 2000) is a West Point graduate and Army veteran, and the film is based on the book by CNN correspondent Jake Tapper, with a screenplay from Eric Johnson and Paul Tamasy.We first meet the new arrivals on their helicopter transport under the cover of darkness. They have been assigned to this combat outpost known as ""Camp Custer."" The nickname comes from the assumption that everyone there is going to die. Why is that? Well for some reason, this military outpost is positioned so as to be surrounded by the foothills of a mountain range - creating a natural shooting gallery of which the soldiers are sitting ducks. It's one of the most vulnerable military outposts ever created, and with it comes so many Taliban attacks that the soldiers can't even take seriously their local scout's constant warnings, ""The Taliban are coming!""There are 53 soldiers assigned to the camp, and the aura of impending doom hovers non-stop. To compensate, joking around and playing sports are utilized to pass the time between attacks. The men even debate whether calling home is a good thing or not. One of the bunk beds has ""It doesn't get better"" carved into the frame - that's a taste of the kind of inspiration floating around. ""Thank you for your service"" is pure parody amongst these soldiers, and it's easy to understand, given the tension they must feel - we are nervous merely watching from the safety of an armchair.The performances are solid and you'll recognize a few. Orlando Bloom is Lieutenant Keating, Scott Eastwood is Sergeant Cline Romesha, and Caleb Landry Jones is a standout as Carter, the ex-Marine outcast who is more complex than initial impressions lead us to believe. On an unusual note, the list of ""relateds"" is quite impressive: Eastwood is of course the son of Clint, Milo Gibson is the son of Mel, James Jagger is the son of Mick, Will Attenborough is the grandson of Sir Richard Attenborough, and Scott Alda Coffey is the grandson of Alan Alda.Director Lurie divides the film into chapters associated with officers, but the segment that most every viewer will find riveting is the near-40 minute attack on the outpost by hundreds of Taliban gunmen. It's relentless battle action at a level rarely seen in movies, and we feel like we are in the middle of it. This onslaught feels like hopelessness, followed by desperation, followed by survival mode. Never does it feel like an outright victory, but more a relief for those who survive. Cinematographer Lorenzo Senatore makes this a visceral experience - one we won't forget.Very little politics come into play here. Instead this is about the men in the line of fire - their courage - and their desperate attempts to live and hold the outpost. All of which is followed by a haunting breakdown that stuns. This battle resulted in 8 dead and 27 injured American soldiers, followed by many medals, including two Medal of Honors. The closing credits honor those killed in action, and we see photos of the actual soldiers next to the actor who played them.",The Outpost
5,trashgang,not as bad as many people stated,8,12 July 2020,"I waited a while before I watched this due the negative reviews on the internet but after seen it I just don't understand thise people.Okay, maybe it's slow in the beginning and there's a lot of scene's you think well, why and how and please explain but once things go wrong at the outpost this is a hell of a movie.Scott Eastwood. in the dark, his eyes and voice are really lik eclint. Said that, back to this flick based on true events. The cruelty of war is shown, friendship and death are so close.

Directing, acting and cinematography were better then in you average action war movie. And this film which is based on very true events superbly depicted a modern battle i think - the handheld camera was superb and really added to the realism - during battle sequence i literally forgot that i was watching a movie and not a documentary - it was that good.Overall, ""The Outpost"" is a very solid action / war movie.

9,Thanos_Alfie,Very good...,6,1 August 2020,"""The Outpost"" is a Drama - History movie in which we watch a group of U.S. soldiers fighting in a very bad location against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. There were hundreds of Taliban fighters against only a few U.S. soldiers.I liked this movie because it was based on a true event that happened in Afghanistan and it meant a lot the defending of that specific spot because it was representing much more than a simple location. The direction which was made by Rod Lurie it was very good and I believe that he presented very well the whole concept of the movie before the beginning of the battle something that made us understand very well the location and the main characters. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that Caleb Landry Jones' who played as Specialist Ty Carter made one of his best performances so far. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Scott Eastwood's who played as Staff Sergeant Clint Romesha and Orlando Bloom's who played as CPT Benjamin Keating, and they were both simply amazing. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is not just another war movie but much more than this and yo will understand that only if you watch it.",The Outpost
10,cruise01,Decent war film with lacking the emotional depth with characters.,6,22 August 2020,The Outpost (3 out of 5 stars).The Outpost is a fair war drama film that lacks the emotional depth with the characters. Not the best war movie. The plot is about a group of soldiers stationed at an outpost that makes them very vulnerable to the taliban. The films script lacks the emotional connections with the characters making them dull and forgettable. The action battle sequences was pretty intense in the climax.,The Outpost
11,eddie_baggins,A familiar war film with a heart-pounding central set piece,6,13 September 2020,"Directed by journeyman filmmaker Rod Lurie, who has made a career out of delivering solid if unremarkable pictures with big stars attached, The Outpost would've likely came and disappeared rather quickly had it been business as usual for Hollywood in 2020 but due to circumstances the audience for this based on true events war film has opened up substantially.Becoming a massive VOD hit in America over the Memorial Day long weekend, The Outpost, which takes place in the dust-plagued surrounds of Afghanistan during the heat of the Middle Eastern war of the mid 2000's, is the type of American war film we've all seen countless times before, filled with some recognizable faces and characters we won't remember the names of once we hit the stop button, but that doesn't stop this well-made mid-budget effort from being an entertaining watch.Loaded with a whose who of mid-level Hollywood talent, with the likes of Scott Eastwood, Orlando Bloom and character actors such as Caleb Landry Jones all getting time in the spotlight, Laurie spends a significant amount of time investing the audience into the everyday mundane nature of a collection of American soldiers who find themselves guarding a seemingly indefensible outpost in the heart of enemy territory, in what appears to be a modern day Alamo waiting to happen.Those seeking bullets and gung-ho action from the get-go will be disappointed, with Laurie in no rush to get to the main event but once the bullets start to fly (along with a hearty dosage of expletives), The Outpost delivers the frenetic action goods that will keep fans of films like Black Hawk Down and Lone Survivor well and truly appeased.A long set piece that goes for well over 40 minutes, the siege of the films titular location is an impressive feat of in your face movie-making with Laurie and his DOP Lorenzo Senatore utilizing a Saving Private Ryan like technique of intense handhelds and innovative drone shots to throw the audience into the thick of the action.We might not know at all times who is being shot at or what they're trying to do, but much like a real battle, the chaos and carnage makes for devastating yet heart pounding viewing, making The Outpost feel like a step up from other straight to home release affairs of this nature.Final Say -Not attempting to break any new ground in the genre and filled with a bunch of characters that are the very definition of caricatures, The Outpost isn't grand movie-making but its a solid actioner that's main set-piece is a sight to behold.3 photographs out of 5",The Outpost

14,jzappa,"Another Ambitious, Deeply Personal Piece by Rod Lurie",8,31 July 2020,"The Outpost of the title was a U.S. military site designed to enlist residents in social expansion, but was located at the base of high mountains just miles from the border. U.S. and local soldiers and advisers would confront a never-ending loom of attack by rebels, who ultimately decided to make a statement.The key to this story and the way it is told is found in how completely unpredictably and abruptly the exchange of fire must be in warfare, especially in this precarious scenario. This is a defining feature of this movie, in its structure, in its suspense and in its character dynamics. The characters in Rod Lurie's The Outpost are young who may generally share the same age bracket but who are nonetheless at varying staging of life, displaced and frustrated guys who will be chewing the fat one second and covering their comrades in the next, against totally unseen enemies.I can only hope that movie-fan enthusiasm had a role to play in the casting of Clint Eastwood's son, Mel Gibson's son and Mick Jagger's son. They vary in their level of presence, but the film never conventionally signals when someone more ""important"" than someone else is on-screen. Everyone stacks up with each other, and they're all naturalistically revealed. Scott Eastwood, for one, has countless moments during which he must do something mortally risky while exposing his crippling fears, born out of empathy and experience.I'm aware that many professional reviews agree that Caleb Landry Jones steals it. There is no denying that.
What viewers need to know is that performance in a movie this maturely crafted, this carefully pragmatic about its potentially sensationalized subject matter, is not about centering any one character. Rod knows particularly well how loyal and synergetic soldiers are in platoons, squadrons and outposts.Jones is an inspired thread the film holds from the start to its final, crushing cut to black. Lurie understands how we all feel about the possibility of being involved in warfare, and how far out of one's element we would look to the rest of our squadron. The gift Jones gives us is the deeply felt human response to being in the very thick of the situation. He is alienated by the squad, because he is not like them. He wouldn't seem especially weird were it not for the fact that he is surrounded by ""proper"" pedigrees of American warrior.But somehow, in a brutal, tragic war film, there are no bad guys. No single deed is without dimension. Lurie has always been specific and definite in his choices. Here it is in how carefully everything plays out before an anxious camera which seems to be a silent addition to the cast.We are left with a story that is so compelling because no matter how immersed we become in it, how inescapable the thick of it feels, it is a needle in the haystack of stories like it, and other stories at other tiers of what has happened since we put troops in Afghanistan. One of the most important reasons why it is not an action-packed film, despite how sudden, brutal and prolonged the battle sequences are, is because it takes the time to show us regime change in a microcosm, how leadership matters, and affects what happens to those depending on it. It's a lesson we can all afford to take time to understand, for what should be terribly obvious reasons.",The Outpost
15,s3276169,How you feel about this film is will depend on how you feel about the US's role in Afghanistan,6,28 October 2020,"How you feel about this film is will depend on how you feel about the US's role in Afghanistan.Many nations down through history have tried to invade and hold this country but none no matter how militarily powerful, have succeeded. The US's role is, to date, following the same trajectory as everyone else. Swelling, at one point, to over 100,000 men plus more from NATO, its now down to a few thousand.Unlike the Soviets, the US were not invited, they invaded after the Sept 11 2001 attacks in the US. This is shown clearly in this film. The locals view the US presence unsurprisingly, as unwelcome. What's also obvious and this may or may not be this the intention of this action drama is the callousness of the US towards the locals.Aside from military menace from the occupying forces, pay offs are there for the taking for those who co-operate.
Its cynical stuff aimed at pacifying and buying out the local population who, again unsurprisingly, milk this for all its worth. They have not intention of selling out and who can blame them.Some of the characters in this film as really unlikable. The cold hearted officer, who shoots a dog out of what amounts to expediency, is one example. That said, he's hardly alone. Its quite alright when locals get killed (100,000 have been to date). When one of the US soldiers get taken down,by contrast, its a tragedy, with mournful music as an accompaniment and lots of soul searching.Acting wise this is solid if cliched fare. The soldiers are your classic US gun ho types, with lots of juvenile or cynical one liners to boot. Their counterparts are never really rounded out as people and are more an alien other.Action wise its on the money and gruesomely convincing.All in all, not a bad film but not one that makes the US's role in Afghanistan appear any less unsavoury.6/10",The Outpost

Sure , it tells an important story for those who lived out the attack on Camp Keating in Afghanistan and it's full of action but there really isn't anything about the film that will stay with me .We've seen many films that feature American forces with their backs to wall in countries they really shouldn't be in .Vietnam , Iraq and in this case Afghanistan . Watching this you do wonder what the Army was thinking putting a base at the bottom of a valley where the men are sitting ducks ?The film this reminds me of is Black Hawk Down and coincidentally it also has Orlando Bloom in and they lasted about the same amount of time in both movies!The best thing about this film is Scott Eastwood who really does sound like his old man and he's also playing a man called Clint !There really isn't anything new here but I enjoyed it anyway .",The Outpost

22,IonicBreezeMachine,An engaging and thrilling depiction of warfare that accurately depicts the mundane tedium and tension that's only occasional punctuation is bursts of violence,7,5 October 2020,"Based on the book The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor by Jake Tapper, the film is set at Combat Outpost Keating a few years into the Afghanistan war. The titular outpost is incredibly vulnerable, surrounded on all sides by the Hindu Kush mountains, and the atmosphere is thick with tedium and tension as daily life at the outpost is interrupted by grievances from the locals and occasional attacks by small groups of Taliban splinters. The film follows the events leading up to the battle of Kamdesh.The Outpost as a war film is almost documentary like in its take on warfare with the majority of the time in the first half of the movie dedicated to showing the cynicism, pessimism, and optimism felt by the various soldiers stationed at the titular outpost. Throughout the first half of the movie we're not only introduced to the layout of The Outpost itself, but also of just how hostile the surrounding area is with its bitter and mistrusting local population, the unusable roads that pose just as much threat as the insurgents, and the skirmishes with Taliban forces. The men at the outpost try to keep their spirits up, but the knowledge of the vulnerability of their position coupled with the fact there's no clear objective in the war begins to wear on them in one form or another.The movie is absolutely exhausting, from the tension and tedium in the first half to the unrelenting violence in the second half there's seldom a moments peace, and what humor or peace there is to be had will usually be undercut by a sudden and expected catastrophe in the next moment. If there is a criticism to be had, it's the fact that this is a very crowded movie. This is understandable, as the movie is based on real people it was clearly the producers intention to leave no one out to ensure justice was done not only to the events, but the honorable soldiers who gave their lives. There's nothing wrong with that, but it makes it very difficult to have emotional connection to them and the fact they're not allowed further development is likely why the filmmakers utilized subtitles to introduce the personnel on the base regardless of how much screen time they received.Despite minor criticisms, this is an effective war film that depicts modern warfare as well as everyday combat life accurately and honestly. While its large cast of real life individuals makes it difficult to remember who's who during the proceedings, the movie manages to respectably and accurately cover its depicted events and individuals.",The Outpost

After a somewhat confusing start with a couple of introductions and disconnected dialogue that felt cliche, the film really starts building up and by the time the massive attack happens, you're completely taken by the film, it just grabs you and never lets you go. This is supported by great performances from everyone, especially Caleb Landry Jones, he was so good in this, even Scott Eastwood, whom I don't consider a particularly good actor, delivered a good performance.I was never in a firefight, but the way the film depicts it feels very natural and much less Hollywood-like, I loved that there was no pompousness, no cinematic heroism, just men doing the best they can in a moment of crisis. Everyone did their part and it was shown to us.The film also looks very nice, I have to admit that some of the camera movements and drone usage were surprisingly refreshing, I had to re-watch some of the moments twice cause of how good they looked (props to Lorenzo Senatore). Some of the scenes were complicated and had lots of things in those, so I really think this is comparable to 1917 in terms of technical achievements.I expected this to be either a generic action film or a propaganda vehicle, but it is much more than that in a better sense of the word. The creators did a very good job honoring the memory of everyone involved and giving a couple of messages that are not invented by people who write pompous stories or political agendas, but by people who were there and tried to survive, losing friends (and not only friends..., a great final scene, by the way).A great film, very down-to-earth, dry, authentic. I recommend this for at least one viewing, also, be sure to stay till the end of the credits, since there is a lot of interesting information in those.I live in Europe and I am not very close to these events, but I fully support such films that help to communicate information to people and keep the rightful memory of the fallen.",The Outpost
25,Neptune165,High score for this one?!!,5,7 February 2021,"I honestly hated this movie, it felt really unnecessary. I know that it was bases on real events, but there were zero likable or relatable characters, there was zero respect to any living thing, and where those first person shooter overlays? Do not recommend. It was mediocre at best, especially when you compare it to some of the Great war movies of the past. Lame characters with zero development, lame jokes. They all wear brand new cammies, brand new boots- it takes away any realism the movie is trying to create. whose brilliant idea was to put a military base at the bottom of the mountain. But this shouldn't even have happened! The human parts are excellent, but those stupid CGI effects? movies are getting so artificial by those supposed ""special effects"". Those fake mountains? Those fake Talibans shooting? Those fake explosions? and tons of people like it. these new generations don't know what a good movie means. I miss those times when dinosaurs were mechanic, when monsters were people inside a cloth. What is going on? But producers have to stop making stupid CGI effects. Can someone explain to me the bridge scene. Did the two soldiers walk into an ied or was he hit with an rpg!? His body just exploded but the bridge was still intact and the older soldier didn't die from the blast. How!?",The Outpost

27,SoumikBanerjee25,Would have been far more significant as a Mini-series/TV Show,6,19 October 2021,"'The Outpost' borrows a considerable proportion of time to get into the gear, but when it finally does (almost an hour into the film); trust me, it would be hard to take a breather. The gunfights, the mayhem, the explosions; they won't let you settle easy, that's for certain.A word of advice though, don't be deceived by its outward appearance, regardless of the smaller budget, it has given tough competition to all the Hollywood Blockbusters out there. Just goes to show, how at the end of the day, Dedication and Intent is all that matters. Although, that doesn't necessarily mean a tiny bit more allowance wouldn't have done the film a favour. It sure would! But still, on a technical level; I'm pretty optimistic that most people wouldn't be having many complaints here.However, the majority of the criticism could emerge scrutinizing its monotonous Screenplay and nearly non-existent Character portrayals! Despite being a full-fledged feature, the layout of this particular narrative bears a strong resemblance to a TV show. I may as well be in the minority here, but in my honest opinion; this could have been something far more significant had it been made as a Mini-series rather.",The Outpost

It's engaging on many fronts since you get to know about actual military battle culture, comraderie, heroism, foolishness, discipline and the lack thereof, etc - there's just so much to be aware of in watching such a film. Don't be surprised when you and those you watch with are full of ""why this?"" and ""why that?"" Some of which is answered with the epilogue.

First, the movie is accurate to the facts. Second, acting here is great. Even not big stars here, excepting Orlando and Eastwood, the main cast is great. Real and believable. Last, cinematography and setting is great. It's unbelievable were the soldiers were sent. That hole was a trap.
So, overall a great action war movie based on a true story.",The Outpost
30,Xavier_Stone,Predictable and somewhat enjoyable,6,9 July 2020,"As with most military movies, they have to fit a certain narrative. Mainly that some high ranking officers are bad and ill informed and have to be saved by some enlisted men or another lower ranking officer. You could make this argument about almost any US invasion or war started in the last 20 years.This movie is just more of the same story retold another way. Some people need saving and this is their battle, and hand our medals afterwards. Most of the actors are competent and the action is realistic and engaging and almost Call of Duty chaotic.What this movie indirectly exposes is that our military soldiers are expendable and of little worth. A fact that has been shown multiple times before yet we still people signing up for service. Lets not forget that these types of movies need the help of our military in order to film them, so it's no surprise that all movies have similar story lines.If there was a movie that held the superiors accountable for their poor decisions I think it would be an easy blockbuster. This story would have to be fiction as I can't think of an actual instance of this happening. Plus it would be impossible to make as the military brass wouldn't support it.

34,nikola17,if you love True story war movies this is for you I highly recommded,8,13 September 2020,"This film is not biggest hit but normally if true story movies like this or others hits slaright to theaters I don't get why this film could have a theater release but shamefully it didn't but I know why because of COVID-19 but I still don't get why this film is not a hit still alongside with Black Hawk Down, We were Soldiers, Lone Survivor, American Sniper, 13 Hours. and Many more out their then this is film for you to watch I prefer this film better then remake of Midway that came out this early this year I know this Japanese invasion American war but this is Afghanistan war film, I thought sometimes you don't know about true story films that happened but now when it's made into a movie you now know film and realityI thought acting is good not the greatest or perfect but pretty good acting nothing wrong with acting I thought it's bit slow and some of scenes are unneeded like could of been taken out but it doesn't take me out of film but this film is far too slow but hey it's true story film no issue with that but just like with 13 Hours it's not long film the piecing is a lot quicker could done something like that. The storytelling around the lives of each soldier are built differently like you got cast is Scott Eastwood aka Clint Eastwood son as SSG Clint Romesha, CPT Ben Keating (Orlando Bloom) and CPT Robert Yllescas (Milo Gibson) aka other related father son actor Mel Gibson son. story follows 53 U.S. soldiers and two Latvian military advisors who battled a force of some 400 enemy insurgents in north-eastern Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom and deep in the valley of three mountains in Afghanistan, battles to defend against an overwhelming force of Taliban fighters in a coordinated attack, but in first hour film nothing really happens besides soldiers are just doing their own thing and messing around that's all then war doesn't happen until like for next hour then that's when everything hell breaks everything and I thought action war scenes were enjoyable fun, thrilling keeps you wondering what will happen next, It follows a similar line to 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, which I liked a lot too. Realistic action, gunfire, explosions, etc. that you expect to see in a war movie. The added aspect of realism was the trauma that you can see in the actors portrayal of their characters eyes that can only be a glimpse into what they experienced. Watch the movie, read the book, or vice-versa. Just remember the names who were very brave, helped fight war, fighted for their country men deserved a medal of honor and tons of awards just like with this film I wish this film could got delayed rather then slaright to VOD if this came out of cinemas then this would been a hit and maybe Scott Eastwood could been known and award for medal for this movie but anyway it's what it isit's crazy how The movie does a good job of capturing the nerve-racking tension of being posted at Combat Outpost Keating. The high mountains around the camp provided the perfect perches for Taliban snipers to pick off the soldiers. outpost so dangerous that they had to put on their gear just to go outside to use the bathroom man it's like getting out of bathroom after taking a dump or anything like that or if you in their someone fires a shot while your in their I know it's not funny but wow that was reality it's crazy that something we haven't even heard of before in real life story just like what you gonna see in this movie. in this film what real life soldier said says Clint Romesha that played by Scott Eastwood if you curious How often was the camp attacked by Taliban insurgents On average, we'd get hit three to four times a week that's really insane. what I read about film the true story film the reality that's how I
should say rest of film is true but little isn't true but hey that's how movies do they tell whatever it's true or not in it. film didn't shot in Kamdesh but they film and shot at set created at the base of a mountain in Bulgaria, not far from the city of Sofia. The entire Outpost Keating was recreated. The other two mountains that surrounded the actual outpost were inserted with CGI of Crouse film is based on company that made tons and tons great action films one of my favorite company's of time millennium films who did Expendables franchise, Hunter Killer, The Mechanic, Rambo V Last Blood many more to name I reckon it's great film company I luv and liked their films including this one I highly recommded watching this movie please give it a chance and give it a watch find a great time watching it's brilliant 8.10 for film and memorial of those brave soldiers who fighted their country and who fighted war will not be forgotten",The Outpost

But, with the B outfit 'Screen Media Films' handling distribution, ""The Outpost"" was doomed to a VOD release even before COVID-19 closed movie theaters indefinitely. And when you once see the movie, you understand why it is the case. Everything here feels familiar, while director rarely digs below the surface of the individuals fighting in it. You will like the movie, only if you are an American with strong military connections, because film fails to capitalize on any broader theme, while winds up feeling stuck and restless. Here, there is no broader message, while it didn't even documented at all how human (US Generals) errors led to the loss of life. Without that kind of overarching strategy, movie falls to pieces, much like the combat outpost it portrays.Rating: 5- (If you want really to enjoy modern Acton/War thrilling movie ""Lone Survivor"" is a much, much better option)",The Outpost

37,TwistedContent,"Immersive, Close-Up Experience",7,24 January 2021,"There are two genres I always feel like seeing more movies come out from, and those are War and Western. Rod Lurie has made sure we receive a technical, tactical, tight true story of one outpost, its soldiers and their battles, internal and external, during the war in Afghanistan.In 2006, a group of United States Army soldiers, together with allied forces, are holding an outpost Kamdesh in Afghanistan, with a mission to keep peace and help the locals. This is a story of 53 U.S. soldiers and two Latvian military advisors who battled around 400 enemy insurgents in the battle of Kamdesh. By the way, I am a Latvian, and had completely forgot about this story until seeing the character already well into ""The Outpost"".I cannot attest to the historical accuracy or its accuracy regarding the book it is based on, but I see a lot of positive comments and opinions, and I read that, when screened to the depicted soldiers and their families, commander Stoney Portis called the movie ""part of the healing"".All war films are on the task to be respectful, authentic and morally right and true, but not all succeed at that. ""The Outpost"", however, excels. It is a carefully, meticulously crafted film, with the filmmakers constant effort to place the viewer alongside the soldiers, inside the chaos. The pacing is quick, the danger is sudden, the cinematic action swift and close-up. The soldiers in ""The Outpost"" rise above cussing baddies, and explores not only the roughness around them, but the darkness, conflict and hurt inside. And not always the party are like brothers that unconditionally get on, ugliness happens everywhere. Lots of props go out to the rich cast, with great performances by Caleb Landry Jones and Scott Eastwood in the front, and Orland Bloom as their first commander, who goes too fast.First half of the movie is a little uneven, as the actual plot/story is short, and the characters, and their interactions fulfill the space, but the third act comes around faster than expected, providing a half an hour full an exhilarating Battle, the Battle of Combat Outpost Keating. From a technical standpoint, ""The Outpost"" is on point, it's always alive and the cinematography/choreography of the many action sequences is impressive.As far as war movies and action flicks go, it is a solid, devout one, telling a slice of history and valor with respect and content.

38,SnobReviews,A surprisingly great war film.,7,21 July 2020,"""The Outpost"" is surprisingly a well executed, well acted and intense film about the war in Afghanistan. I was hooked from beginning to end.
.
In this war drama based on a true story, a small team of U.S. soldiers battle against hundreds of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.
.
Director Rod Lurie takes the viewers inside the outpost rarely ever showing the enemy but always showing the bond between brothers. Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones are terrific in their roles and the action sequences are pulse-pounding. I started this review off with the word ""surprising""; and being a B-movie I didn't expect much from ""The Outpost"". Turns out I was wrong and you should see this film.

39,ragingbull_2005,Criminally underrated war masterpiece,8,20 July 2020,"This is one of the best war films, of all time. It is extremely intense and almost seems as relentless in the portrayal of war, as the Taliban must have been in their daily skirmishes with the American forces.This tells the story of the most decorated company of the Afghan war, their outpost, which happened to be a tactical blunder surrounded on all sides by the Hindu Kush mountains and their fight to the finish which led to the highest battle honours.There are interesting insights on leadership and the effect that it can have on the subordinates as well as the opponents. Then, there are pointers about the instincts ruling the heart and the mind, in the heat of the battle.It is first rate and it is a real shame that it hasn't received the recognition that it rightfully deserves. among my top 3 films that I have seen this year, pre and post lockdown.

It is filled with alot young and upcoming stars. Plus the fact its military movie and true story.The acting by everyone involved was great. It almost felt like you were there and were throughly connected to all of them. I also thought the visuals were vivid and out of this world. The movie overall definitely exceeded my expectations on few different levels.My only major complaint about this movie would be the pacing. I felt at first it kind of dragged for awhile. Kind like your dog when they don't want to go inside. However I recommend no one get discouraged because I feel like lot people did or might of. The last 30 or so minutes of this movie have to be seriously one most epic actions scenes I ever seen.

41,movieman6-413-929510,Beautiful and exciting war drama only with less developed soldier characters.,6,4 July 2020,"The Outpost is a new war drama movie directed by Rod Lurie, the director of Nothing But the Truth and The Contender.The film is about the American mission of a small group of soldiers consisting of 53 men, who defend the remote outpost Keating against the Taliban in Afghanistan. In this way they hope to support and defend the local population during social projects. When the US military decides to close outpost Keating, the remaining soldiers are surprised by a major attack by the Taliban. The soldiers must now protect the outpost and the population for the last time against an invasion of hundreds of Taliban fighters.Director Rod Lurie and photography director Lorenzo Senatore have portrayed the film in a good and exciting way. This makes it feel as if you, as a viewer, are also part of the small group of American soldiers, who are often attacked by surprise attacks by the Taliban. The film feels a bit like the war films The Hurt Locker and 1917. This film also shows well what life-threatening missions soldiers can experience and why some of these soldiers have received the Medal of Honor.Although the film is beautifully portrayed, you quickly forget who plays which soldier and what they are called. Only the more famous actors such as Orlando Bloom and Scott Eastwood can be recognized earlier in the film thanks to their fame.

42,Screen_O_Genic,Last Stand,8,15 August 2020,"Based on an actual battle fought between American forces and the Taliban in Afghanistan ""The Outpost"" is a raw, realistic depiction on the carnage of modern warfare and the humanity reacting to and affected by it. Vividly recreating the struggle from the American point of view the film recreates the interactions of the men as they face the daunting task of their mission where terrain and numbers are highly stacked against them. The horrors and brutalities of war are all too real here: gunfire, explosions, screams, blood and sacrifice hold court. The skillfully executed cinematography and good acting bring those to full force. Scott Eastwood is the heart and soul of the film as his tough and considerate portrayal give a gravity and depth to what leadership stands for. Slow-going in parts with lots of talking (this ain't no ""Platoon"" or ""Band of Brothers"") but the message gets through.

47,Slarkshark,"Fail to Plan, Plan to Fail",8,10 November 2021,"That's in no way a knock on the soldiers at the outpost or even their immediate superiors, but more so up the chain with whoever decided to have the outpost there to begin with and then postponing to abandon it. The men at the outpost knew they were dealt a crap hand and that it very well was just a matter of time till something like this happened. The valley surrounded by mountains was a built in grave. Win hearts and minds yes, but do not surrender security and make yourself vulnerable.Luckily, there were those who were quick to action such as Clint Romesha and Ty Carter. They were also the most interesting characters in the movie, and I would say Scott Eastwood's best acting that I've seen. Carter pretty well has the only character arc in the story, going from the untrustworthy comrade to selfless hero.The overall movie felt authentic, with feelings of 'Generation Kill' or 'Jarhead', but obviously with the Army. It doesn't stack up to the likes of 'Black Hawk Down' or 'Lone Survivor', but it definitely paints a picture of what these soldiers had to endure, and I very much appreciate knowing their story.

50,TheRadiobox,"Come for the second half, stay for the first",7,7 July 2020,"The Outpost was directed by Rod Lurie, written by Eric Johnson which adapted the book by Jake Tapper and Paul Tamasy, and stars Scott Eastwood, Caleb Landry Jones, Jacob Scipio, Taylor John Smith, Alfie Stewart, Jack Kesy, Scott Alda Coffey, Milo Gibson, Kwame Patterson, Sharif Dorani, Bobby Lockwood, and Orlando Bloom. It follows the soldiers of Camp Keating (ne Kamdesh) as they deal with their position, anger, and Taliban.Plotting is straightforward and kept at a slower pace for the first hour, keeping the audience in the mindset and the boots of the soldiers, following their daily activities: scouting, intelligence, camaraderie, tension, and leadership. The focus is always on their thoughts, they start out with Lt. Keating (Bloom) who is a strong and down-to-Earth leader who tries to make peace with everyone as best he can. When out on an assignment, something happens which causes him to be replaced by Yllescas (Gibson) who loses some of the relatability that made the soldiers appreciate Keating. After Yllescas comes Broward (Patterson) who almost none of the soldiers like due to his nervousness and unwillingness to side or associate with his men. It's this constant demoralization and increasing attacks by the Taliban that keeps the first half arresting. The second half is hectic, kinetic, horrifying action. It does not stop and it does not feel fake, the pressure is felt on all of the characters when the Taliban forces start their assault and it only ever lets up at the end.Characterization was very good, particularly Romesha, Carter, Bundermann, and Kirk (Eastwood, Jones, Smith, and Kesy). They're all given adequate backstory and ample personality in order to stand out among the others. Romesha is quiet, to the point, and an excellent leader. Carter is probably the most interesting of the bunch with his prior professions being brought up, how he ended up in camp Keating, and why next to no one likes him. Bundermann is sort of a hybrid of the stereotypical American soldier and officer; he loves to insult his colleagues, get dirty, and have fun but is also entirely capable of stepping up when necessary. All of the performances are good, with Eastwood and especially Jones standing out as fantastic. The rest of the cast is solid, despite the audience having to play a game of remember-the-last-name since there are so many.For a war film, there is a lack of a message, which is surprising considering the subject matter. It works very well which is bamboozling to say the least. The Outpost has no intention of trying to sway the audience's view towards the conflict one way or the other which allows for greater clarity of the events. It focuses on the soldiers for the whole feature and it never once feels preachy; only intending to tell the story and put the audience in the shoes (or combat boots, rather.) of the soldiers to try and give perspective to outsiders. These men just wanted to be done with that outpost and it shows with the writing and the performances.Budgetary restraints do not lessen the impact of The Outpost, but they are clear at points. The explosions, costume design, layout of the camp, and sound design are top notch for any war film and it is clear that a lot of time and thought went into each building and each technical detail of the movie. One aspect that shines the brightest in this movie is the sound design: it's terrific and terrifying all at the same time. Gunshots feel lethal and close when they hit, explosions are loud and bass-y. And you know what? Bulgaria makes a convincing substitute for Afghanistan. The only thing that makes the budget clear is the overt clarity of the images in that the movie looks as though it was untouched in post, which could've done with some better grading, and the CGI which is pretty subpar. Thankfully the CG is rare and the grading doesn't take much away from the movie. The pacing is a bit on the slow side for the first half; which can drag at points and may have benefitted from a light bit of trimming. All together though, The Outpost is a very well made movie.As a whole: The Outpost isn't the best war movie, with pacing issues in the beginning and innumerable characters to follow, but it is certainly a solid one. The story is interesting, action is brutal, most of the characters are well-defined and easy to sympathize with, and has strong technical aspects. I recommend The Outpost as a well done, and well told story.72/100",The Outpost
51,horst69,Better than many war movies,2,4 July 2020,"As war movies go, there seems to be little middle ground - they either are well made or low budget disasters .This film does sit in the middle in a way .
It is not a good movie by any standards, but perfectly watchable if your expectations aren't too high .
It is not Black Hawk Down, American Sniper, Hurt Locker, or anywhere near that level of film making .Where The Outpost falls short is the skill and craftsmanship of its creators .
There is a somewhat coherent storyline, but it is filled with stereotypical scenes and dialogue .
The acting is unremarkable for the most part, which is good ; because the few times the cast members are trying to really act, it gets corny and annoying , showing their lack of competence .The movie really falls apart during the second half, when the action happens .
Battle scenes are very hard to do well, and here we have editing, filming, scripting and directing - you name it - that doesn't manage to put together a picture the viewer can follow and be involved in .
It's just a messy pile of repetitive, disjointed shots, repeatedly running the story into dead ends , without the connecting arch good film makers create to turn even chaos into a coherent story .But considering how many really bad war movies there are , I thing this one still deserves a 4/10 , if barely .",The Outpost
52,azanti0029,An extremely visceral re-telling of a forgotten battle in Aghanistan,8,4 July 2020,"PREMISE - The Outpost depicts the battle of Outpost Keating, known as the Battle of Kamdesh, which took place on October 3rd 2009, close to the border with Pakistan in Afghanistan. The Outpost itself was located on the bend of a river in a valley, completely overlooked by high mountains on all sides. It was simply put, a nigntmare to defend and a prime target to over run. So it would be that 300 Taliban fighters would attempt to do just that over two fateful days that October.
In addition to the harsh terrain the location had other issues. Helicopter re-supply was extremely challenging and dangerous and could only be conducted at night (A previous re-supply attempted killed 12 people, not depicted in the movie) meaning only night landings when there was no moon were possible. Due the nature of the base being located effectively in the bottom of a funnel, in-direct fire support from artillary was impossible and the nearest close air-support was thirty minutes away. Into this nightmare scenario 53 American Soldiers were expected to defend the worst position possible, so the stage was set for a modern day Zulu and one of the bloodiest close quarter conflicts of the war in Afghanistan.THE CAST - Casting here is impressive and suspiciously full of the children and grandchildren of famous actors and directors. (Jagger, Gibson, Eastwood, Attenborough) Knowing full well that it is difficult to often tell men apart in uniform during depictions of conflict on screen, we have an interesting range of faces, the most easy to spot of which is SCOTT EASTWOOD, proving to be every bit his Father's son as Staff Sgt Clint Romesha, he and CALEB LANDRY JONES both give stand out performances but the rest of the cast are solid too, special mentions to: CORY HARDRICT, TAYLOR JOHN SMITH. and the ever dependable JACK KESY. Senior Officers are played by MILO GIBSON (Whose making a good name for himself despite the challenge of having to fill size 22 shoes) and ORLANDO BLOOM, who appears to have come full circle from playing PFC Blackburn in Blackhawk Down to playing Captain Keating here, whom the camp was ultimately named after. A number of younger British actors do incredibly well and even Producer JOHNATHAN YUNGER gets in on the action!PRODUCTION - The film was predominantly shot in Bulgaria, as you would expect for a film being produced by Millenium Pictures, but the set up for the camp is convincing and adequately conveys the issues facing the defenders, although the depiction of the terrain is slightly different. The first half of the film tells the story of the various officers who were stationed at the camp before leaving the final third of the film to depict the battle. It is here where ex-soldier turned director ROD LURIE and DOP LORENZO SENATORE do a superb job of giving us a balls to the wall depiction of the final assault and place you firmly in the middle of it, making me regret I could not have experienced the sequence on the big screen. Several long takes (all the rage these days) give a very realistic depiction of following one character in the battle, then another. They also employ a clever techique of depicting the deaths of the real personnel involved, seen primarily form the third person, which felt like a sensible and sensitive approach to the issue in question. One of the most dependable sargeants is wounded early on during the firefight which has an impact on the battle morale of the soldiers whom find themselves fighting for their lives minute by minute. Enough screen time is given to depicting the local political problems facing the American officers, who did their best under extremely challenging circumstances to placate locals.OVERALL - This film is one of the best depictions of close quarter fighting since Blackhawk Down and is extremely well handled. Some of the earlier dialogue between the soldiers lets the film down a little bit. Yes, we know soldiers do talk like this from time to time but some of lines are cringeworthy to say the least and I am sure this dialogue could have easily been improved upon, but minor gripes aside the film is a pretty gripping depiction of a stupid military blunder which cost the lives of several young men, completely unnecessarily. It does seem a shame however, that the release of this film, may have torpedoed a second film on the subject (RED PLATOON) based on the book written by Medal of Honour winner Clinton Romesha (Played by Scott Eastwood) - Eastwood was not able to speak to Romesha when researching the role he depicted due to this conflict which feels a real shame. So it is possible, we might see a second film depicting the battle. Bring it on.",The Outpost

Which up till now was the last third of ""Come and See"".
For me, this is essentially the Afghan version of ""ZULU"".
The criticism that the movie doesn't develop the 'minor' squad members is patently ridiculous. The movie is ABOUT them. If anything, this shows why you maybe shouldn't: it hurts when the stuff hits the fan and boy does it hit hard.

56,DennisBergkamp10,One of the better movies of 2020,7,16 July 2020,"I am a fairly well read man and truth be told I did not have the slightest inkling about this particular incident upon which the movie is based. You would assume that the strongest military in the world would be smarter than setting up a Base at the bottom of a valley surrounded by mountains on all sides.This is a story that deserved to be told and kudos to the director for doing exactly that.What irks me is when they try to mislead the audience by promoting a movie using a big name actor(If you can call Orlando Bloom a big name actor) who has a cameo in the movie. Orlando Bloom is in a cameo in the movie but the way the movie is promoted it would seem that he is the main character. As they say, build it and they will come. If you make a good movie the audience will come.Another thing that seriously irked me about the movie is the video game sort of directing. I am old school and that really gets on my nerves. Why repair something that is not broken. What was wrong with the way Saving Private Ryan was shot. Always makes me wonder if they benefitted in any way by doing something to appease a certain audience. How many video game addicts out there said....we dont generally watch movies but because the director made a movie that is shot like a video game we made an exception and watched it.

60,Willie-12,Absolutely Incredible War Film,9,7 October 2020,"One of the reasons I enjoyed the film The Hurt Locker so much was because of how realistic it seemed. When I watched that film, it almost had a documentary feel to it. And during some of the battle scenes, it felt as if the audience was right there, among the action. Another film that took place in a war zone and felt realistic and documentary-like, was Rescue Dawn, one of the most criminally underappreciated films I've ever seen. No doubt the director's (Werner Herzog) extensive experience making documentaries aided in portraying Dawn in such a realistic manner. And now, there's another war film that rivals both Locker and Dawn, and that war film is The Outpost. And it may be the best one yet, in my humble opinion. There are so many technical achievements in Outpost, that it would be worth watching for that reason alone. But, thankfully, the true story that surrounds this technically proficient film is absolutely gripping, so much so, that it will not easily let you out of its grasp, even days after watching it. I watched it with my dad on Saturday night (10-3-20), and it's still with me today. I cannot get over what these soldiers went through on that day...something I think most of them knew was inevitable. They were sitting ducks in one of the most poorly placed outposts in United States military history. And once the main battle begins, it does not let up for a considerable amount of time. Indeed, during that scene, the action was non-stop and graphic, and my dad and I both were on the edge of our seats. The Outpost is one of the best war films I've ever seen. The story, the writing, the direction, and the acting...all exceptional, and all worthy of recognition by the major awards associations, including the Academy Awards. I would not be surprised to see nominations for numerous technical awards and the individual ones as well, especially for the performance of Caleb Landry Jones. In fact, there's a scene near the conclusion of the film where his character is being counseled regarding the difficult things he saw and did during the battle. It's probably the most powerful scene in the film, and much of that has to do with Jones' portrayal of his character's interactions with the counselor. It's powerful, moving, and heartbreaking.Right now, with 11 or so weeks left to go in what has been a very long and unusual year, The Outpost sits atop the list of my five favorite films from 2020. Could that change before the end of the year? Maybe. Will it? I doubt it.",The Outpost

67,TheCasualReviewer,A disappointing moment of our history...,6,9 October 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Based on a true story about a small group of soldiers are ordered to post up in an unfavorable position that gives the enemy height advantage and a 360 view of the post.REVIEW:
It's so crazy to find out certain moments like these in our history that scream stupidity. Having a group of soldiers posted in a ditch surrounded enemies is equivalent to resting your hand on a burning stove.I've seen many war films and I've come to a single conclusion. That is that it's very important to build a relationship with the characters and the audience. Yes, this is important in most films, however, the genre of war is always so close to reality that it's important that we give a real sense of reality with the characters. It always hits harder when we care about the characters who have a lot at stake. No matter if the film is fiction or not, war is very real and the elements are always true. With that being said, I cared about a couple characters. This characters being SSG Clint Romesha (Scott Eastwood) and SPC Ty Carter (Caleb Landry Jones). With Clint (ironic that it's the same first name as his father), he plays the one character in every war film that just has it together. No matter what happens, you can count on this guy. With Eastwood's performance came a grounded character. A pillar to hold this group as one. With Carter, Jones gave such an incredible performance. I feel this guy has been under appreciated. Every film I've seen him in, he's been so good and I really hope to see him in more films in the future. In this film, he's the guy that no one really likes since it's clear he has a blocked off vibe as if he's had a rough past which they went over slightly. When s*** hits the fan, for a lack of a better phrase, you see his performance propel above the rest. He definitely stole the show for me.The Outpost was an interesting film based on a true story that I think people should see and will at the very least, enjoy. You'll just need to get past the fact that Orlando Bloom's American accent needs heavy work. 6.5/10.",The Outpost

Beyond the technical aspects, this movie immerses you by portraying the soldiers and everyday army life realistically. We don't know any of the characters in any type of deep and meaningful way but how the characters interact with each other makes the setting feel real and lived in.This movie also has an incredible performance from Caleb Landry Jones and there is one scene in particular where his performance knocks you off your feet.

Like the others, the new Rod Lurie movie balances the anti-war sensibility that any sane person shares with all of humanity with a rousing/worthy tribute to those individual people and 'bands of brothers' (Shakespeare, Henry V) who, as Tennyson said, do not have the option of 'wondering why' they are catapulted into in hell on earth, only that they must 'do or die.' An Alamo like depiction of an actual battle during our never ending war in Afghanistan, Lurie's film (based on a non-fiction book by Jake Tapper of CNN) does not so much document the fighting as it thrusts you into the epicenter of this human storm, the highest compliment any movie on any subject can ever be awarded. Though completed (and originally scheduled for release) in 1919 (long-delayed), we can only hope that The Outpost will be considered for Academy Award nominations for the 2021 Oscars.

This movie is based on an actual event... I emphasize the word ""based"" as it ventures far from the actual event.
I could not for a moment imagine one of the actual veterans of that event watching the movie and say ""nailed it"". No way. Clearly obvious or at least obviously lacking are veterans themselves not in the credits as advisers.There are combat scenes that do not at all match the reality of that battle, but certainly make for a good war movie.why why why do US film makers keep making movies about the war in Afghanistan keep portraying Afghan (Taliban) as poor shots, badly trained and appearing dumb? That is/was never the case in reality.My opinion is that this is an entertaining movie of the war in Afghanistan but in regards to accuracy, it could be perhaps be compared to a Yogi Bear cartoon as a documentary about Grizzly Bears.

82,cristinalinderman,A magnificent war film based on a true story.,9,9 July 2020,"* There are documentary scenes starting at the mid-end credit *The director Rod Lurie and crew brought magnificently to life a war film based on a true story about soldiers battling to survive against Taliban fighters in an outpost. I have watched many war films and this one made it to my top three, it felt so real as it can be. From the moment it started I instantly felt the greatness I was about to watch. The tension never stopped building up due to an unstoppable threat lurking all around them, what a terrifying feeling not knowing when they are going to be shot at and it captures the reality of it. The way they focus on the soldiers had a sense of truth by exploring what they do when they off duty giving them personality and how they miss home. Some are attached to what they left behind while others are focused on their mission to survive for what they left behind. The introduction of them was necessary for one not to only have a real war perspective but to get emotional when death comes. It shows how they look out for each other no matter even if they don't like one another, from the moment the mission starts all of that fades away and each of them tries their hardest to protect one another. It also explores how the chain of command keeps one in check of making a better decision due to rank, sadly it is something that happens everywhere, no matter what is right, following orders by rank is an obligation in which by this case could lead to victory or to disaster. The best line this movie had was: ""don't rush for failure"", something to be reminded of every day.The composer Larry Groupé brought one of the best suspenseful music. I have mentioned how I knew from the start that I was going to love this film and it was truly thanks to the music. So perfect for this kind of story, especially since it focuses so much on the tension, this music amplified the intensity with a haunting theme.The cast was perfection, everyone performed incredibly especially Orlando Bloom. I will honestly say that I was never truly a fan, yes he is a good actor but his name in a movie never had me looked twice at it until now.

89,matt_hew,Incompetent,5,7 June 2021,"Incompetent is probably the best word to describe everything to do with this movie.The movie is based on true facts (the Battle of Kamdesh) which sits with you throughout the rather long 2hr watch. Why? Because throughout you're shaking your head at how incompetent the US Military were in locating a base in such a vulnerable location where: ""Everyone Was Going To Die"".And this is part of the problem as the film tries to create a scenario where the US troops from the outset all know better - and 'are' better - but then spends the majority of the film highlighting their own incompetencies all the way up the military chain.The narrative of the movie also tries to connect the audience to the characters by highlighting their names &/or using them as chapter titles. However this really doesn't work as not enough effort is put into the characters for it to have any meaning and the direction is too incompetent that the chapters just become nonsensical. This coupled with some awful acting, dialogue (& accents) makes it at times confusing to watch.It seems a lot (most) reviewers who are giving the film high scores also see this as an example of heroism, patriotism and 'kicking the enemy's ass' - it really isn't though... it's about sacrifice - and you come away from the film not thinking about the movie (as it's average at best) but the reality and incompetence of the reality of the facts.",The Outpost

92,roondogbb,An excellent war movie,9,17 June 2021,"The outpost is one of those movies that tend to easily divide opinions between those who love it and those who dismiss it quite easily. I personally fall on the side of the side of those people who give the movie a high score, for in my eyes it deserves it.The first thing to recognize about this movie is that it's based on a real life battle in Afghanistan between taliban insurgents who attack a very isolated American outpost in the hindu kush mountains being completely surrounded by high peaks on every said, perfect conditions for attack and retreat tactics. During the times when there are no attacks, the mundane repetitiveness of routine kicks for the soldiers. They grind on each other but when it comes down to it they are brothers in arms.The intensity of the final battle scene is high and it's filmed in such a way that you do feel you are in amongst the action. The film although it has death, it doesn't focus much on showing it as it does on how death effects the people who witnessed it and who perhaps are going through survivors guilt and ptsd. Due to the fact that one simple order can perhaps unknowingly end a mans life. Seeing the psychological impact of war is perhaps more interesting than simply seeing the limps strewn across the battlefield. How realistic is the film? Unfortunately I'm not in a position to judge that. Some other reviewers who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan said its very accurate with respect to daily life in such outposts and also relatively accurate with regards to battles.The performances were excellent. I sensed the mental trauma that certain characters were going through and its not nice. PTSD is horrible.

102,SouthernViews,"Slow first half, then non-stop and brutal",8,15 November 2020,"I went into this movie not knowing the details about the true story. So, I can't speak to the accuracy of the events. I can tell you that, by the 50-minute mark, I found myself tuning out. The cast is huge, making it sometimes difficult to keep track of everyone. I also felt that, up until this point, the movie felt like nothing more than an overly macho band of bad-ass military guys. That's when things took off. From that point forward, it's a roller coaster until a highly emotional ending.
The cast is fantastic. I thought Scott Eastwood and Orlando Bloom were both solid. But IMO the stand out goes to Caleb Landry Jones. He put in a truly gut-wrenching performance as SPC Ty Carter.

in a story that engages you from second one.The sequence of events till the dramatic finale are a ride to a battlefield that you will appreciate to the max, not only because of its dramatic character, but because of its historic content.Eastwood is fantastic, you can tell he is got the best genes from his old-man, same as Briton actor Orlando Bloom as the first commander to give his life for his country. He will not the last one.If you have some extra time, you life historic action movies, and you have some bucks on your pocket, then i suggest you to grab your seat in your local cinema, and bring your brother or a male friend or your dad or cousin who love history as well.my humble opinion: do not make the mistake to bring a date or a girl or maybe your wife as this film has its share of blood, pain, tears, bombs, bullets and drama in the middle of war against a vicious enemy.but if your girl loves those kinds of things, then bring her on.The Outpost is one of the best movies of this year, in my opinion worthy of some oscar nominations, as you can tell the huge effort put into eat, you can see the directing and the photography shots are riveting.There is even a cultural clash examination as you may see different american commanders negotiating with tribe elders in the mountains of afghanistan. those scenes were very well done, with lots of care, respect and authenticity, making you realize immediately that The Outpost is not only guns and bullets.Enjoy the movie.",The Outpost

Nothing too compelling to get you to love the characters.2. There is a lack of action.
In a good movie, you have 2 minor fights, and then 1 big fight at the end.
The movie lacked that.3. Poor Quality Action Scenes.
In most movies, during an action scene, you show all of the different angles.
You show what is happening to the protagonist from their point of view, and you show what is happening to the antagonist from their point of view.This movie lacks the perspectives from the antagonists' point of view.
The scenes are always one sided.
You only see the US soldiers getting shot at, while they run around.
You don't see the Talibans. You don't see the Talibans from the soldiers' point of view.

I spent time there just before the main assault by the Tali, the Soldiers were NOTHING like what is being portrayed. Nor was the circumstances. Do they use the lingo, sorta, do they dress like them, for the most part, are they trying to obtain the feeling of daily life, maybe. Was it a stupid location, yes the CO had a lot to do with that decision, and it it was a poor one, but the accusations that a GI died because of a gang land style assassination or that an NCO would snap kick a subordinate is incomprehensible. Even for asinine behavior. That is not the dynamic I saw in those Soldier, I did see fear and concern but that was expected based on the location and knowing they had Zero support from the chain of command and certainly from the Commander and Chief on down, the ROEwas so tilted to the tali that it was terrifying in it self and would make for a more realistic scare thriller. Watch it for entertainment but no historical accuracy. The Soldier were heroic, with out a doubt, was it terrifying, I can be certain it was, but this was not the true story of heroism and raw terror those Soldiers and civilians survived through. Don't fall for the Hollywood tripe.

Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt is the most prime example of a fit male.

LACKING DEVELOPMENT & SLUGGISH Technical Rating: 7.5/10 My Rating: 4.5/10,5,4 August 2020,"At a two hour runtime, this film feels a lot longer - and that's not necessarily a good thing. The first hour is unbearably slow-moving and not very informative to the audience. The first few enemy encounters with random gunfire were a bit confusing for me because they really don't explain why in fact they are even at the Outpost. However, the biggest disappointment for me (other than the very lacklustre dialogue and sluggish pace) was the insufficiency in character development in that hour - and so unfortunately when the epic third act battle does finally arrive, you are not really invested in any of the characters.

1.5/2, great film if want to watch relations of civilians and soldiers, regardless of the nation they fight to uphold. Aka, Russian previously, now US. The shooting scenes seemed to be accurate as everyone was running out of ammo, and US Navy seals, in an interview, noted that running out of ammo was the most common thing to happen during combat.Aesthetic/Cinematography (2 stars in total):
Not great cinematography, not close to interstellar, not as bad as buddy games cinematography/aesthetic. Easy 1/2.Spiritual/Ending (2 stars total):
2/2, after the fighting, death, and emotional trauma, the survivors are rewarded for their acts of surviving. At the very end, Carter goes to therapy and is asked how he is doing. He replies not great because he tried saving his fellow soldier, whom he was not close with. Leads me to believe the film wants me to evaluate a soldiers presence in the world, fighting and protecting for others, and making themselves expendable. Or that soldiers have a bond that transcends their liking towards each other. Furthermore, the tribute for the fallen soldiers, and ultimate goal of this movie, was to show how terrible bureaucrats screwed up on the planning for the camp and how that resulted in tragic deaths.Acting (1 star):

Lots of slang and soldier speak, so for me I can't conceptualize all of it the first time through. Also takes some time to be able to truly recognize each character and tell them apart.With that said, this a great film about what soldiers deal with in places like AFG, I was vaguely familiar with this story having seen Sgt Romesha's story told in a documentary about CGMH recipients.

178,frosteliza,Gritty memorial to soldiers' valour in the face of US military command incompetence,5,3 July 2020,"I'm not going to discuss the political aspects of this film, as it deals with them with about as much insight as John Wayne and The Green Berets does the Vietnam conflict. This film is rather more a memorial to some very brave US soldiers who lost their lives through monumental command stupidity when a 'hearts and minds' US Military Outpost was placed (even to my militarily-untrained eye) in the most ridiculous location in Afghanistan (or indeed the entire Middle East), as was apparently acknowledged both before and after the event by the US Military themselves.
Based on a true story, the film is basically a record of repeated attacks on the outpost by the Taliban, and the soldiers' attempts to defend the indefensible, interspersed with the usual soldierly chit-chat and team-building.
I'm not entirely convinced that the real soldiers (US Cavalry veterans) who died would be entirely happy with the way their Hollywood counterparts portrayed them - for example, that no serious effort was made to secure or patrol the surrounding heights throughout the repeated attacks, even though the attacks always came from the same place. Furthermore, the soldiers are presented as chiefly concerned with the chit-chat instead of being careful - like keeping to cover, and not strolling across an IED-lined river bridge chatting happily to your mate.
For the first three quarters of the movie, the firefights are chiefly of soldiers shooting at an apparently empty hillside, and it difficult to feel compassion when someone gets killed because they are all in the same camo and helmets and you can't really tell who's who. This is something the director obviously realised post-production, as the film is heavily overlaid with titles saying who is who, and also where they are (as the location is also pretty samey). However, in the effort to be fair to all the combatants, there are just too many to remember, and the only one who really sticks is Clint Eastwood Junior, sporting a ridiculous moustache.
The barrack-room backchat is heavily-scripted, un-funny and generally pointless, adding to the difficulty in caring about the characters. It may be that this is real US army-talk - regardless, it isn't entertaining to listen to.
The firefights are confusing and, I suspect, grittily realistic. Unfortunately, this makes them unsatisfactory to watch as you, the viewer, have no more idea what's going on, where the enemy is, or who is shooting at who, than the soldiers themselves.
In summary, the film is a sound memorial to the soldiers who died and an excellent lesson for West Point in military stupidity - but as a war-film it lacks a sharp script, necessary character development, any real insight into the Afghan conflict, or the kind of close direction required for complex battle sequences to be comprehensible.",The Outpost

From a director's point of view the film is a catastrophe. There it hardly any storyline, no character development, just disarray and chaos at the heart of the action, embraced by an hour of the usual army-flick: tough boys doing tough stuff saying tough things.
The Afghans are depicted as underdeveloped if not brainless savages, who lack even the most basic military tactics, like taking cover when you're being shot at. How far from reality is that?
Not once does even a single character suggest that the Afghans are just trying to recover the country the Americans took from them?
Oh, and than there is a philosophical angle: ""the bible is full of Christians committing atrocities against other people...."" correct, the Old Testament is. But that was BEFORE the birth of Christ. So where are the Christians committing these crimes?

187,alopias1961,A war movie about a very historic and honorable battle....,4,21 October 2020,"...that I wish had been better portrayed. Of course I wasn't there, I just hope this is not accurately represented.
Starting with the horrible strategy to build a camp in a shooting gallery. The ""greatest military in the world"" with decades of experience somehow thought this was a good idea? I remember when this happened and could not believe that they put our brave military through this.
Then, concerning the production, many things leaped out at me as being unrealistic. One soldier pleasuring himself to a photo of the wife of one of his superiors? Did this happen? And if not, who the heck wrote it into the script?
The warnings by their Afghan attache that went unheeded? If this is Hollywood trying to make this a meatier film, it just comes off as more American military incompetence.
The script. The camp gets hammered by Taliban in a high tension firefight and ten minute later they are calmly strumming folk songs. Not preparing for the next onslaught ""just in case"".
The age old standard in American film making of one American can kill 20 enemies in seconds while 100 enemies can only kill a half dozen Americans in a half hour even though they are at a position advantage. (Schwarzenegger? Stallone?)
The acting. Nobody should be lining up for any Oscars. Although it was watchable, there were no really great acting performances that bubbled to the surface. Near the end with the soldier talking with the psychologist there was a glimmer of actual acting prowess, but the unlikely questioning by the doctor just torpedoed the whole scene.
The reviewers. ""Finally a movie that is accurate"". I hope not. ""Give the whole cast Oscars"". Maybe whoever was in charge of the sound, that was very good (Music, sound effects etc). ""Possibly the best war movie I have ever seen"". Watch more movies. I mean Saving Private Ryan? Gallipoli? Full Metal Jacket? Jeez there are DOZENS of better war films.

189,mcnamaradawnf,Thank you!,10,18 June 2021,"This cinematic gift in addition to Jake Tapper's biographical book gave me the opportunity to crawl into some of the headspace of these brave persons. I gained more perspective of the anguish during and after such a battle. I felt as if I experienced some of the intricate and confusing emotions one must experience from war.When my 1st cousin, Specialist Ed Faulkner Jr. Was participating in the battle of Kamdesh, I was starting my medical residency. I was often taking call through the days/nights for the main hospital & the VA that was physically connected. As a civilian & resident MD, I believed we needed to be much more educated in the military system. As a resident physicians, I often felt un knowledgeable & ill equipped to adequately diagnose and treat the extreme traumatic events the Veterans had recently experienced. I often ""felt"" their extreme pain, confusion, trauma, and frustration. I knew coming back to the States to reintegrate into a once familiar environment only added to their alienation. I could only guess or imagine the intensity and stress of their recent experiences. I believe the most I could do was listen, empathize, and try my best to place them in the right direction for optimal care & services.....In order to complete my residency on the East Coast, we moved back to Virginia in 2010. Also, due to a rare vascular illness, I needed to be closer to home & the Cleveland Clinic. But, more importantly, I was able to form a relationship with Ed and his loving family when he was going through some very harsh PTSD related trauma (in addition to traumatic wounds incurred during his 1st & 2nd tours). In the past, I never really got to know Ed. I was quite a bit older & living in different places. My uncle Edward, aunt Sharon, & cousin Sarah allowed me to talk to him as well as see him. We had a wonderful lunch post d/c from hospital & we were all able to share some very blessed time with him. I kept in touch with Ed until an accidental event took his life. Before his later passing, he expressed to me his wishes to relate his story, possibly write a book, and help others suffering from similar problems.He & his family will always represent the reality of war, the heroism persons present, and the love that can inexplicably result from such atrocities.Thank you Ty Carter & all of the brave men who helped Ed. Thank you Frank Tapper, Rod Lurie ( I realize this was an especially difficult time), Will Attenborough/Ed Faulkner Jr., Caleb Landry Jones/Ty Carter and the rest of the military and actors/production company for doing an excellent, difficult job in representing the brave persons who sacrificed their lives & comfort! I could have never come close to realizing the dedication & unimaginable horror that took place during that time. Most of all, thank you Edward Sr, Sharon, Sarah & Ed Jr. I love you and Ed Jr, I will always feel something brought us together for that brief time before you passed and God Bless the time we were able to get to know one another!

222,colinpw-32018,A solid film that depicts true events of heroism,7,20 November 2020,"When I first read the story of the battle of Kamdesh I was hoping that Hollywood or one of the streaming giants would make a film about it. The story itself is truly amazing as U.S. soldiers overcome the odds of being outnumbered and at a tactical disadvantage to the Taliban when COP Keating is attack by massive insurgent force. When I finally saw the trailer for the film I was excited as it looked promising with a good cast, good visuals and decent effects. The movie ultimately did not disappoint in its dipiction of the battle and the events leading up to it. The film definitely gives a true insight into the conditions the men faced at COP Keating; the issues they had dealing with leadership, the locals and constantly being contacted by the enemy. The performances of the actors were solid, at some points in the movie you see a couple wooden performances but for the most part it was done well considering most of the cast are up incoming. I found Scott Eastwood's performance as Clint Romesha was good but sometimes it looked like he was channeling his dad Clint Eastwood instead. I think the best performance came from Caleb Landry Jones as Ty Carter. Another criticism of the movie is the writing, it felt inconsistent in quality. The movie had chucks of dialog that could have been better written or maybe the delivery of them could have been better.

A few think this was too slow moving at the start but I thought the pace was right and a few false-suspense moments were subtle but added a great deal early on.Only major fault beyond OB was lack of minor character development, and it was a struggle to follow who's who for quite a while - though I find that typical in modern war films so perhaps just me.Well worth the watch.",The Outpost

232,madtomflint-99750,Finally!,9,11 July 2020,"I didn't even know this movie was being made, but I first heard about it when it was touted as a ""pro-America military movie."" I wasn't exactly sure what that meant, but it sounded better than the alternative.I served in Operation Enduring Freedom 7 and 8, in a little Forward Operating Base called FOB Tillman, named after Army Ranger Pat Tillman who died in that area (Paktika Province of Afghanistan, a few kilometers from the Paki border). We were one small Infantry company (A Company, 2/87) in a remote area, which was populated by neutral locals and Taliban forces. The American media called it a ""hot zone,"" and it was. The similarities between the setting in The Outpost and the reality of my unit's experiences are startling. Obviously, I'm a biased reviewer.That being said: I thought this movie was incredible! There were a couple of things I questioned the accuracy of, like soldiers firing full-auto M4s and the somewhat casual behavior of soldiers in an obvious death trap; but overall this movie gets just about everything right. Down to the small details like the water bottle used as counterweights to keep the exterior doors closed, and the local Afghan elder with the red dye in his beard. Those are the kinds of details that SO many Hollywood interpretations overlook. Also, the story this movie relates is an incredible tale of heroism, sacrifice and brotherhood, which really are common in the US military.

Hacksaw ridge was the last film to do that. This film stars Clint Eastwood's son and the more well known actor Orlando Bloom. Basic plot as a group of American soldiers are stationed in the most stupidly positioned Outpost that leaves them as sitting ducks to the Taliban as the Outpost is completely surrounded by huge hills on nearly all sides. The first half of the film does well at drawing you into the characters and the action is enough to keep you interested as the plot unfolds. The second half is all out war watching the soldiers defending their Base against 100s of Taliban who have them surrounded. Remember to watch the end credits!,The Outpost
240,nekto-49319,Great movie,10,9 March 2021,"An amazingly simple film, but one that received one of the highest ratings from me. Despite the image of the fighting, in fact, the film has a high pacifist thrust. Criticism of both the political administration of the country and the actions of the commanders is not only appropriate, but also very delicate, although objective and harsh.
Rough male army team. The servicemen follow the order. Everything is shown extremely harshly, but with justified, appropriate and grounded naturalism.
Combat clash. One group of people set themselves the goal of killing others, but met with armed resistance. On the side of the first is deep faith in their righteousness, on the side of the second - technical support, weapons, training and loyalty to duty. And above both sides - the understanding of the meaninglessness of confrontation.
And it turns out that in the end everything depends on the personal qualities of everyone, on the will to perform this or that action, and on the correctness of the decision made, on the accuracy of the orders given from above.
In general, there is nothing more to talk about. Only professionals can give a professional assessment of actions in defense against an attack, about the organization of a defense scheme. And I'm just a spectator, and I really liked the film.

This movie, in my opinion, did the book justice. As far as filmography is concerned, it was great. Realistic action, gunfire, explosions, etc. that youd expect to see in a war movie.

257,dannocummings,Take the time to watch this one,8,9 November 2020,"In recent years, I've been very disappointed with war films because, with a few notable exceptions, I find that they betray realism far too much. Hollywood likes to make action movies out of tragic, real-life stories which I find both disrespectful and disappointing. The Outpost could not be more different. It doesn't feel the need to give in to cinematic norms in any way. It doesn't even follow the standard three-act structure as closely as we're used to. For that reason, I can see many viewers feeling uncomfortable with it, given it's strange format (it's hard to distinguish the first act from the second.)This movie does a great job of building atmosphere. The soldiers look rough, talk rough, and live rough. I felt like I could smell the base they were living at, and even more importantly, I could feel the danger they were in. The performances are all very good (particularly Caleb Landry Jones's) and the actors had great chemistry with one another.Finally, let's talk a bit about the combat sequences. Wow. I was shocked to learn that this movie was shot on a relatively low budget. The action is edited and directed extremely well with long, tracking shots giving me the feeling that I was truly there in the thick of things. The editing and cinematography gave me a feeling of overwhelming fear and geographical awareness.The Outpost can drag at times, sure. It's also a bit difficult to distinguish the characters from one another for a large portion of the film. But overall, this is a wonderfully-directed, very well-shot tribute to our troops overseas. In the cinematic wasteland of 2020, I highly recommend this film.",The Outpost

263,rody1141,Finally a movie that's accurate.,8,6 July 2020,"I did two combat deployments to Afghanistan and one to Iraq. I can tell you without a doubt this movie is the most accurate representation of FOB/COP life, soldier lingo, and to an extent the combat.Most reviews I've read complain of sub-par dialogue and not a clear story as to what was going on prior to the attack, but I bet that most of the reviews were from people who have never been to war. In war Dialogue between soldiers is not interesting, it's dark, unfiltered, and usually disgusting. We degrade each other, fight each other, we say things so offensive and disgusting that most people would think we have issues. In war you also don't always have a clear cut mission that you can make into some grand Hollywood story. When you deploy you are supposed to find bad guys and help locals, that's it. Those hoping war has some interesting story will be disappointed. You sit around bored, exhausted, missing home, working out, eating garbage food, piss in tubes/bottles (first movie I've seen that showed the bottles), burn your own crap, watch movies, go on patrol and hope you don't get blasted in an IED. Every so often you get a big mission where the combat gets intense. Then it's rinse and repeat, that's how it is and I'm sure prior to the attack, that's how life on Keating was. This movie depicts life in the military so accurately that I was like ""my gosh finally someone did it, they got it right it"". So to anyone reading this, this is as real as you'll find it until something else is made. All those who talk smack about it are idiot keyboard warriors.The combat itself is good, explosions look real even the CGI ones were ok, none of that dumb fireball explosion crap, the dust and smoke generated from shooting and explosions to the point the soldiers in the movie were coughing from it was legit. Now I wasn't in this battle but I've been in my fair share of fights I can tell you that tracer rounds aren't as fruitful as you see here. Most of the time you get shot at and have no idea where it came from except maybe a general direction. Muzzle flashes also are hard to see unless it's at night and you could see them all over in this movie. Usually you just see dust or smoke from where they shot, not flashes. But Hollywood has to do this for the effect as it does makes firefights look cool and without seeing tracer bullets whiz by it takes away from the intensity.Also the soldiers were able to yell and talk to each other from long distances. Yea that doesn't happen, war is ungodly loud, you have to be screaming in a dudes ear to hear you.When the air support showed up finally, how it was being controlled didn't make sense, but that's just me being nit picky as not many people know what the hell is going on with that.The tactics were decent, you could tell there was some military advising for sure but some things didn't make sense. Not sure if that's how it happened or just Hollywood though.Overall if you want to watch the most realistic depiction of how the war in Afghanistan is, this is it. To all the naysayers saying this is garbage, hate the way the soldiers talk to each other, or wish there was a more clear story/mission, you obviously have never been there.RIP to all the fallen in this battle.",The Outpost

268,zjgilbert-85002,Possibly the best war movie I've ever seen,10,27 July 2020,"Don't get it twisted. This movie will likely go relatively unknown, not unlike the Battle of Kamdesh. I'd first read Staff Sergeant Clint Romesha's book, Red Platoon, of which The Outpost is based upon, in 2016. The book tells the story of the men of Red Platoon stationed at Combat Outpost (COP) Keating, a COP the DoD themselves stated had zero strategic value and was nearly indefensible. Ever since I read the book I've wondered why this story wasn't more widely known and why the book hadn't been made into a movie. I can't be more thrilled that it finally has as this story needs to be as well known as Operation Redwing (Lone Survivor), Day of the Rangers (Black Hawk Down), and Operation Vigilant Resolve and Phantom Fury (The first and second battles of Fallujah respectively).The visual depiction of Staff Sergeant Romesha's book is incredibly true to the text. In the book, Staff Sergeant Romesha doesn't write himself out to be a hero, but instead gives the facts of what happened during the battle and focuses more on the actions of the soldiers he served with. The Outpost mirrors that depiction, showing you that there is no singular main character. The movie is a tribute to the men who fought in the Battle of Kamdesh.If you are looking for a highly polished war story like American Sniper or Lone Survivor, this is not your movie. Having served in the military, I can tell you that the dialogue between service members is very much akin to what is shown in the movie. It is crass. It is disgusting. It is not wholesome. It is irreverent. The movie does an outstanding job of portraying the military experience of ""hurry up and wait"". The first two thirds of the movie are heavy amounts of dialogue, scenes showing soldiers working out, or humping packs up mountains with the occasional firefight that may last 60 seconds.The last scene is a visceral depiction of combat and I feel it does an amazing job portraying the odds that were stacked against the men at COP Keating. You easily empathize with the desperation the men likely fought as they did everything they could to help their brothers in arms and to not lose control of COP Keating. The movie relies heavily on this empathy and very little on gory depictions of violence to grip the viewers emotions and attention. That isn't to say the movie is without bloody depictions of wounds or kills, but it is very tame Compared to other R rated war movies.In something, The Outpost is an outstanding movie that greatly does justice to the story of the Combat deployed service member. I can't recommend this movie highly enough to anyone wanting to try to understand what the military experience is like when bullets aren't flying or to anyone wanting to get an accurate understanding of what it looks like to have everything go wrong during war.Side note, my only gripe is that in the book, Staff Sergeant Romesha tells a story of the JTAC (joint terminal attack controller) directing air assets onto targets. At one point, the JTAC had to take a shit, so was squatted over an empty ammo can as he was calling in bombs. Would have found it hilarious if that had made it into the movie.",The Outpost

Story wise I felt nothing when one of them died this surely is a failing of the script or director as there was WAY too many characters for significant development to be done prior to the battle scenes.

May have not been on that exact FOB, but I was 30 min down the road listening to it on the radio. A very good friend of mine was on that FOB that day...the token black guy is him. For Hollywood to actually get a movie right to damn near every comma is immaculate. The only discrepancy I have is the accuaracy of the date. But thats no fault of Hollywood, you can blame the big green weenie for that. They never want to be made out to be the bad guy, when they were in this situation. Its the same with ""Restrepo"", dates in that movie are wrong too. This fight didn't happen in 2009, it happened on July 4th 2013.

275,wz-95724,"Typical American ""Gung-Ho"" War movie - More brawn than brains!",3,17 August 2021,"This film shows the US military as poorly organised, poorly disciplined forces. Going in with a gung-ho attitude of spraying the enemy with bullets, regardless of the cost and accuracy of their aim. This is exactly what my late stepson described, when he fought alongside US troops in the Gulf wars. He said that on many occasions, the US Army was more dangerous to the British troops than the enemy were, as they shot at anything that moved and rarely listened to comms from other forces, so that they knew where they were, so the US regularly opened fire on friendly forces! So, I guess, as others have said, it it true to reality!",The Outpost

I don't usually like war films or drama but this movie made you feel what they feel and the violence was a bizarre real clash of culture the totally backwards problems of being in a low tech area with people who don't think the way you do and obligation to duty when there's zero sense to orders.

Cinematography was like Black Hawk Down and acting was top notch. Loved Eastwood's character but even the last scene was a tear jerker. There were a lot of characters, but you still get to hear about their general personal stories. I hear a lot about one shot filmography but this worked awesome how it was used.

295,kwakrider35,"As good as it gets, best modern war film since Black Hawk Down.",9,8 July 2020,"First half is tedious, aimless, poor dialogue, stereotypical....exactly like sitting in an outpost in the arse end of taliban held Afghanistan would be. Knowing that there's a battle to come gets you wishing it would happen earlier...but that's not how real warfare was/is.There were a couple of super cheesy lines and I'm sure it had a sprinkling of hollywood when there saving air support came but overall I felt immersed in the action. There's almost a parallel to the battle for Khe Sahn when at the end it's all really for nothing and the base is abandoned with no real mission being achieved.
Acting was solid, some highlights, but I preferred the overall feel of not knowing many of the actors, although they all have famous fathers it seems. Im going to watch it again tonight, BHD I watched again immediately, it's not quite that level of grandeur but it was the best of the genre I've seen in awhile.",The Outpost
296,jersklar-1984,THE OUTPOST is wake up call in more ways than one.,7,5 August 2020,"In coming to a war/combat movie as one knows you are in for with a title like THE OUTPOST, you bring with it as a filmgoer certain expectations: There'll be the tough brave rebel, there'll be the innocent who just wants to get home and put all this behind him, there's respected leadership and the leader who demands but hasn't earned respect, and then there's THE MAIN BATTLE sequence. Yup, the best ones have these tropes, the worst ones. And THE OUTPOST is not out to rewrite the book in the well executed war drama. But in effect THE OUTPOST hits these tropes with a kind eye and heart for detail of the very real young men this story is based on - nobody here is a cliche - even when their words and actions may at first glance render them as such - nobody's heart aches similar to another's, and we feel all the particulars of the here and now so adroitly and with neither political flag waving nor with insultingly on the nose sentimentality. These are just our soldiers in harms way... but in harms way multiplied by 100 and for no discernible good reason. THE OUTPOST is a painfully real story of an Afghanistan skirmish and the young men called on to defend an indefensible Outpost while making friends with the natives who don't want them there either. A great story doesn't necessarily mean a NEW story or an ORIGINAL story, no it means a story told with care and an eye and empathy for the details of the human experience. That what THE OUTPOST delivers upon. While at the same time... yeah it delivers the goods of a white knuckles war thriller. Rod Lurie's film is bravaura first person shooter you are there fighting a fruitless war in Afghanistan. It is a nightmare. Where COs are reassigned or just die in a skirmish in the night. Where a soldier you may personally hate May wind up being closer to you than anyone you'll ever know. There should certainly be best supporting actor Oscar talk for Caleb Landry Jones.",The Outpost

I do feel like I have a pretty good idea of what it must have been like. In fact, I don't think they politicized this movie as much as they could have.

299,jrsportsblog,Great War Movie,9,5 October 2020,"First and for most I loved this movie because it felt real. I don't want to watch another fluff piece about war, I want to get a realistic depiction of what goes on in these hero's lives. I really loved the joking around, stirring crap, and dialogue. It felt like what people really need to see in a war film because it felt real. The story is fantastic because of the people and the actions in it.The fighting is always intense and you get the sense of what it must have been like to be there. It portrays the characters in a realistic light from what I can see and it's not afraid to ask some tough questions. For example no one in the movie really knows their true mission of the base, but they continue to follow orders and do what they're told because that's what soldiers really do. Many don't know the true purpose of their mission but they understand that a superior decided it. I feel like this was good and could have been pushed a little more of the issue.The filmmaking is fantastic in my opinion. The camera work had some really cool shots and did it's best to help you grasp what was happening. I feel it gets lost a little bit when the battle starts going but it's still pretty good. It's not afraid to show it's characters who won the medal of honor in a human light and show their flaws. The acting is on point from almost everyone except scott eastwood who sometimes in the first 2/3's of the movie seems uninterested and it kind of pulled me out of the movie for a period of time. I haven't yet seen a movie I think he's great all the way through but I do think this is his best performance. In terms of the visuals it was also very realistic and almost everything looked great except a couple of CGI shots throughout the film. I do love that they also show some of the consequences of war, such as PTSD and family problems at the end.Overall it's a great slow burn till it punches you in the face story about true heros of one of the more interesting untold stories in Iraq. It falls flat in a couple of spots but is solid and has incredible action scenes. Definitely worth the watch.",The Outpost

I understand that Latvia was occupied by Russians. But you know we got our freedom back. And we have our own language as well.
So why the hell that soldier from ""Latvia'', has a Russian accent?? Like every movie or TV show. If there's a character from Latvia, and he speak English, he has a Russian accent... I know, I know.

I wanted to enjoy it so much but unfortunately I found it falling short of my expectations. The timeline felt very disjointed compared to its written page counterparts. I believe viewers who aren't familiar with what happened or haven't read the books will have trouble establishing a emotional connection with the characters. The Outpost severely lacks character development; as such you aren't able to get to know them intimately so you don't develop a bond with them throughout the course of the film.

I understand wanting to try and tell the whole story of the place, but Keating's story could've been told or shown separate. It tells the story, but not chronologically.
