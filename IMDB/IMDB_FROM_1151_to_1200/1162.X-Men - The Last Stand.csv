0,TheLittleSongbird,"The weakest of the series, but not as terrible as has been said",5,24 July 2014,"That's personal opinion of course. The first X-Men was well made and enjoyable and X2 was an example of a sequel being better than its predecessor with a bigger and darker approach that built on what was introduced in the first and made them more interesting. The X-Men series did however take a big step backwards with X-Men The Last Stand, but while it is the weakest of the series considering the stuff that has been said about it it was better than expected. X-Men The Last Stand boasts great special effects and a visual style that is both flashy and dark, both of which though in an effective way. The photography and editing is slick and you can at least see what's going on. The action scenes mostly come off very well, thrillingly choreographed and passionately performed, and it is at least edited coherently. One particularly striking moment was with Magneto manipulating San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge to become a highway to Alcatraz.John Powell's score is not as good as Michael Kamen's or John Ottman for the previous two films and it's not one of his best works either but it is rousing and haunting and in harmony with the story and action. There are some solid performances, as seen with Hugh Jackman whose Wolverine is full of charisma; Patrick Stewart is reliably cool(some not-so-good dialogue but he makes the most of what he has) though deserved more to do; Ian McKellen is wonderfully menacing; Anna Paquin makes a real effort to bring out Rogue's feistiness; Rebecca Romijin-Stamos brings sex appeal and iciness to Mystique, and Kelsey Grammar is a big surprise as Beast(his make-up looks fantastic too), giving a fair amount of depth to the character with wonderful aplomb. The interaction between Iceman-much more comfortably played this time- and Pyro has some genuine tension as well.X-Men The Last Stand's final action sequence was mixed. Spectacle-wise the final action sequence really delivers and it's very eye-popping but don't go looking for sense and for me it wasn't quite adrenaline-pumping enough. Ratner shows that he is completely comfortable in the action where he directs with a lot of style and technical proficiency but with the non-action parts he does fail to keep the momentum. The main problem really for X-Men The Last Stand was that while it impressed on the action and visual front, the depth, emotion and what made the first two as good as they were(especially the second) is lost. The sharpness of the dialogue that the first two films had is not really present here, the humour's corny, the exposition which the film is relatively heavy in just lumbers and doesn't go anywhere often and the emotional/darker parts feel forced, things that the first two films avoided(the second film being particularly successful). The film is too rushed and tries to incorporate too many interpersonal story lines and too many characters.As a result, a lot of the story felt plodding and incomplete and what is done with the characters has disappointed many and in my mind was where the film fell down hard. Angel is just useless here and Jean Grey/Phoenix had real potential but she was very underwritten. Cyclops, Colossus and Xavier are all short-shrifted as well and when the most memorable of the Mutants(Juggernaut)- excepting Magneto- is not very interesting either you know there's something wrong. The main characters are either out of character or distorted, Wolverine is moody for the sake of it here whereas he had a good amount of depth as an anti-hero previously and Magneto now has been reduced to a one-dimensional villain. With the Mutants the film never goes into detail about how they became to be and why, you just get the sense that they are evil for the sake of being so. And there are performances that don't come off, Famke Janssen actually does do her best but how Jean Grey/Phoenix is written works severely against her, Vinnie Jones is one-note and annoying as Juggernaut and while Storm is more prominently developed Halle Berry's performance is even blander, didn't think it would be possible, than in the first two where Storm was one of the least interesting characters. The rest don't have enough to work with to make an impression, it was saddening really for Angel to be such a wasted opportunity and for three major characters to be killed off so indifferently.Overall, not terrible but disappointing and I do have to agree with the consensus that it is the weakest of a mostly very good series of films. 5/10 Bethany Cox",X-Men - The Last Stand
1,Leofwine_draca,Endless CGI action dominates this superior sequel,6,6 December 2016,"The third and thankfully final entry in the interminable X-Men series is actually my favourite of the three. I'm not a comic book follower and I have no real interest in seeing creations brought to the screen, but I always felt this series was more highly lauded than it deserved to be. At the end of the day, the X-Men films are just straightforward adventure romps with bloated budgets and sci-fi imaginings. I liked this one the best because it was the most bombastic out of the three, and pretty much every minute is packed with great CGI effects and tons of action and fighting.Director Brett Ratner is far from a favourite of mine but he knows how to handle action here, ranging from a vicious fight in the woods as Wolverine tackles multiple foes to a wonderful scene where Magneto takes out a convey of vehicles. This is a film all about smashing things up and blowing things apart and it moves a lot faster as there's no necessity for ponderous back stories or character introduction. Things are also mixed up a little, which I liked, as central characters are killed off and there's a whole darker tone – I've never seen people exploding in a 12 certificate film before! The actors have less to do here than previously, as they're all just cardboard cut-outs. Everyone here gives exactly the same performance as before, although Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, as the experienced elders, dominate the proceedings. I barely noticed Halle Berry, her role as Storm is so small. Kelsey Grammar and Vinnie Jones are a couple of new mutants, although I think Jones would have been more effective if he'd just kept his mouth shut and refused to speak the rubbish dialogue they give him. Things end up with a massive action spectacle, a full-on mini-war between humans and mutants, and it's great stuff – the best the trilogy has to offer. So, yeah. I'm glad I watched the series, and I liked it for all the cool CGI effects (some of the best are the anti-ageing they've done on McKellen and Stewart) but I know I never need to go back here again. Once is enough with these shallow comic book thrill-rides!",X-Men - The Last Stand
2,SnoopyStyle,One too many storyline,6,16 November 2013,"This is the last of the original live action trilogy. A consortium of drug companies have found a cure for mutants and this sets off a fight from the Brotherhood led by Magneto (Ian McKellen). Meanwhile Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), dead at the end of last movie, returns as Phoenix in her place. She is now an infinitely more powerful mutant. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) must stop both Phoenix and Magneto.There is too much going on in this movie. There is basically one too many story lines in this. The cure storyline is great on its own. There are parallels to the real world. There are built-in conflicts. There are deep moral divisions that are only skimmed at. Jean Grey's storyline just adds too much complications. It confuses everything and is done really poorly. Her story could have been her own separate movie. That would be a better idea. Jean Grey has her own movie with Wolverine. It's certainly a better Wolverine movie than anything they've made. There are other issues like Magneto's wrong-headed motivation. This is still somewhat fun but with issues.",X-Men - The Last Stand
3,Hitchcoc,Interested bystander,7,5 June 2006,"I've attended all three of the X-men films with my son. It's been kind of fun. I never read the comics, so I don't know the intricacies of the characters and their powers. I don't know enough to tell if they are faithful to their comic book roles. Keeping that in mind, I have to say I enjoyed them. I liked the first two more than this one because it had more heart and more character development; more angst if you will. I was intrigued by the ""death"" of Jean Grey in the second film. This one is a special effects deluge. When the Golden Gate bridge is moved like a board across a mud puddle, it staggers the imagination. If I were to look at this with too critical an eye, I might say, ""Couldn't the bad guys have done this crossing of San Francisco bay a little easier (maybe a couple of helicopters or a big boat). This part is almost for laughs. I was entertained and involved through most of the movie but at times it became almost a parody of itself. I understand they changed directors and this may account for it. Maybe a summer film can't cut the short attention spans unless we throw so much at the canvas that we can't distinguish the pictures. The performances of the actors are quite good. There are a few questions that we neophytes have a little trouble with, but, all in all, I think most people who like this splashy stuff will be alright with it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
4,claudio_carvalho,Disappointing Last Battle,6,21 July 2006,"When a private laboratory supported by the government finds the cure for the mutants, using the DNA of a powerful boy, the mutants have the option of giving up their powers and become human, but their society split. Magneto (Ian McKellen) opposes and decides to join a force to fight against the government and kill the mutant boy. Meanwhile, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) resurrects uncontrolled by Xavier and with the personality of the powerful Dark Phoenix. She destroys Cyclops (James Marden) and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and allies to the evil forces of Magneto, making them almost invincible.The two first X-Men are among my favorite adaptations of cartoons to the cinema. Unfortunately, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is not in the same level of the foregoing films. The reason for the final battle between Magneto and his gang against the group from Xavier's school is not reasonable, since the cure was aimed by many mutants, but not all of them. Cyclops is wasted in the very beginning, and the participations of Rogue and Mystic are minimum and disappointing. At least the unreasonable death of Professor Charles Xavier is in a good scene. Most of the attitudes of Wolverine are quite stupid, only Storm seems to think and have leadership and there are many new characters with insignificant participation. I read some comic books of X-Men in the past, and this movie changed many relevant features of the characters, like with the death of Cyclops and Xavier, and a very weak Rogue. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""X-Men: O Confronto Final"" (""X-Men: The Final Confrontation"")",X-Men - The Last Stand
5,kosmasp,Not a Rat(ner) fan ...,7,25 April 2007,"... but I've got to give him kudos for this. I'm not an X-Men junkie, or anything (I'm not familiar with the comics and/or the characters), so I can't speak about the history or if Bret Ratner did a great job, of putting those characters on screen, as they were drawn/intended to be ...Still I feel that this movie does tie together the previous efforts, made by Bryan Singer. This is just one fun ride. And right from the start (a few minutes in maybe), Ratner let's you know, that anything goes! That he doesn't think that anything is sacred, might be too much for some fans to swallow, but I loved it. You could also say ""Balls to the walls""! A Hollywood movie that achieves it's goal to entertain enough, so that you can overlook it's flaws!",X-Men - The Last Stand
6,classicsoncall,"""Welcome to the Brotherhood.""",7,7 June 2006,"You expect intense action with the X-Men franchise and this one delivers as well. For my money though, the film is all over itself trying to be the greatest action adventure of all time, especially in the second half. I'd have preferred a bit more character development replacing some of the fight scenes, but hey, it's not my prerogative.There are almost 1400 posts on this film already, so I won't go into the story line. I WILL say I was happy to catch Stan Lee in his almost obligatory cameo early on and didn't have to strain to catch his appearance. You have to pay attention though, he shows up quickly as a homeowner watering his lawn in the twenty years ago flashback scene with Professor X, pre-Magneto and the young Jean Grey.I was also impressed with the way Kelsey Grammar mutated into his role as The Beast. Although it's hard to keep the Frasier personality out of it, I'll admit I only thought about it when he made his first appearance.There were a few downers though. Jean Grey's re-appearance following her demise in the prior film wasn't addressed at all, nor did her destruction of Scott bear any significance other than to provide a jolt to the viewer. I know that death in comics and soap operas don't mean a thing, but some sort of explanation would have helped on each score.Logan/Wolverine does the quick healing process one better this time out. When he takes that double shot to the stomach in the forest battle, he's able to heal the holes in his t-shirt too; how about that?For those who believe things come in threes, rest assured this is not the end of the X-Men franchise in film. That was established after all the endless credits rolled. Speaking of which, film credits these days are out of control. I mean, do we really need to know who made Wolverine's claws (It was the 'Claw King'), and who catered for the cast? Back to my prior thought. If you wondered about that scene at the hospital with Xavier and the comatose paraplegic, you find out why in the last five seconds or less. The voice of the man in the coma speaks to the duty nurse, and there's no escaping it was Patrick Stewart's.",X-Men - The Last Stand
7,jboothmillard,X-Men: The Last Stand,5,27 November 2006,"Taking over from Bryan Singer is Rush Hour director Brett Ratner, who does an okay job, but it lacks the same spark as the first two. Basically the government have created a cure for the mutant community, and this triggers a war between the good and bad mutant sides. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) believes that mutants should have a choice of the cure, and Eric Lensherr/Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) believes in survival of the fittest. It is just the typical battle with popular characters: Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Ororo Munroe/Storm (Halle Berry), Marie/Rogue (The Piano's Anna Paquin), Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden), the gorgeous Raven Darkholme/Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), also Jean Grey (GoldenEye's Famke Janssen) returns, but turns into evil and unthinking Phoenix. New characters include Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast (Frasier's Kelsey Grammar, Cain Marko/Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Warren Worthington III/Angel (Ben Foster), Warren Worthington II (Michael Murphy), Josef Sommer as the President, Peter Rasputin/Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Jamie Madrox/Multiple Man (Eric Dane) and Quill (Saw's Ken Leung), with a cameo by Stan Lee. The ending is particularly a letdown with Xavier (and Cyclops, though I'm not fond of him) dying, and Mystique turning human, although she is great naked, but it is still okay, and I'm glad Rogue got the cure. Worth watching!",X-Men - The Last Stand
8,ccthemovieman-1,A Fun CGI Orgy,8,13 September 2007,"I enjoyed this film, just looking at it for the striking visuals and special-effects, not really caring about the story, to be honest. I'm not into all the secular agenda that was promoted in all three of these X-Men movies, and the main ""heroes,"" who were not all that likable. They were just watch to watch to help provide the eye candy.... plenty of wild stunts and visuals, especially in this computer-generated images orgy.That's basically what it was, scene after scene of wild-looking characters with comic-book action scenes and supernatural feats by a variety of characters, all of whom had special powers. I think people who knew the previous movies forwards and backwards were hoping for more regarding the individual characters. Myself, I don't care, frankly, what happens to the wolf-man, the storm lady, boyfriends, girlfriends, kids and father--figures, mutants and humans. I just wondered if all these ""mutants"" would make the film fun to watch...and they did!Seeing the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco come apart and be transported to Alcatraz was very cool and a highlight of this special-effects. As usual, the old men, played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, were the best characters..Was the film entertaining? Yes, as all three of the ones in the series were and, although not a big fan, I'm sorry to see it end. It was a fun ride.",X-Men - The Last Stand
9,Tweekums,Too Many New Characters,7,17 November 2008,"I assume that people reading reviews for the third X-Men film will have seen the previous two, if not stop reading now as it is impossible to review this without giving away the ending to the second film.Those people who enjoyed the first two films will be pleased to know that most of the characters return, including one that we thought had died at the end of X-Men 2. Unfortunately as soon as Jean reappears it is clear that she isn't the woman she once was as she kills Cyclops who was the one mutant who didn't believe she was dead. If this isn't enough to worry about a company has developed a ""cure"" for mutants that will instantly remove their powers. Not surprisingly Magneto decides this must be stopped even though it is claimed that it is purely voluntary. When he tries to liberate Mystique from custody he learns that it is not fully voluntary as her guards are armed with weapons that fire darts that contain the cure, unfortunately they used it on Mystique so one of the best characters makes an early exit from the film.For me the main weakness of this film was the introduction of a large number of new mutants, so many in fact that it wasn't really possible to care about them as much as it was in earlier films. That said I was pleased to see Kitty Pryde. now played by the excellent Ellen Page, getting a larger role than before. There was also an over use of special effects; the moving of the Golden Gate Bridge while looking impressive felt like it was being done because such an effect is now possible not because the story needed it. All that said I still enjoyed the film and think it is worth watching, especially if you enjoyed the first two instalments even if only to find out how it ends. Talking of the end; don't switch off when the end credits start as there is a short extra scene after them.",X-Men - The Last Stand
10,ma-cortes,The usual X men are back along with a plethora of newcomers and fantastic heroes in an incredible adventure,8,14 May 2007,"Once again the Marvel comic group who were born with genetic mutations that give them superpowers . Thus, wheel-chair-bound intelligent telepathic Charles Xavier , Professor X (Patrick Stewart) , runs a young mutants school to help others learn to utilize their extraordinary mutant powers . He has appointed successor to Storm (Halle Berry) , but Scott Summer (James Mardsen) , AKA Cyclops , is grieved for death Jane Grey (Famke Janssen) . The sheer mass of water that collapsed on top of Jean should have obliterated her . But she's alive and the role most important results to be for Jane Grey . The only explanation of Jean's survival in that her powers wrapped her in a cocoon of telekinetic energy . Jane is only class five mutant-like Xavier , her potential limitless, her mutation is seated in the unconscious part of her mind and therein lay the danger . When she was a girl , Xavier created a series of psychic barriers to isolate her powers from her conscious mind and Jean developed a dual personality : the conscious Jean , whose powers were always in her control and the dormant side . A personality that , in the sessions with Xavier , came to call itself Phoenix . A purely instinctual creature , all desire and joy and rage . Far more critical is whether the woman in front of us is the usual Jane or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free . Xavier attempts to restore the psychic blocks and cage the beast again . He has a terrible choice to make , he chooses the lesser of two evil . In the meantime , a so-called mutants cure will be available to the public , reaction has run the gamut with mutants on both sides of the line,some are desperate for this cure while others are offended by the very idea of it .

Meanwhile , the teen romance between Rogue and Iceman is broken with the subsequent jealousy by Rogue , when Iceman develops a friendship with Kitty Pryde , then she flees of the school of Professor Xavier.The story is more complex and thoughtful to follow than previous entries for newbies and takes itself seriously and displays interesting characters involving new mutants . The screenplay provides a well-executed and exciting final solution and ties the threads were leaving in the first and second part . Special effects by John Bruno are fantastic but they don't overshadow the story . The film contains an impressive , breathtaking ending battle plenty of 3D computer generator effects . It appears uncredited the usual cameo by comic-books authors : Stan Lee , as a water-hose man and Chris Claremont ,as a lawnmower man. It contains lively and spectacular musical score by John Powell and colorful cinematography by Dante Spnotti .The motion picture was professionally directed by Brett Ratner . The setup calls for a four part and I hope to be continued . It's a must see for Marvel fans and X Men enthusiasts .",X-Men - The Last Stand
11,BA_Harrison,The X-Men do it again.,8,29 March 2014,"Brett Ratner takes the directorial baton from Bryan Singer and runs with the gay subtext established in the earlier two X-Men films: in this third chapter, the government have developed a cure for mutations, something that doesn't sit well with the majority of mutants, who are proud to be who they are. Subtle, this is not.Fortunately, the obvious parallels drawn between mutants and the gay community do not detract too much from the film's overall entertainment value (thankfully, there are no pink mutants firing sparkly rainbows from their fingertips). Ratner's movie might not be quite up to the standard of Singer's superlative second film, but it still delivers enough spectacular comic-book action to make it a very satisfying way to spend 104 minutes.",X-Men - The Last Stand
12,Quinoa1984,"flawed, in the way you'd likely expect with the 3-timer",6,27 May 2006,"I wanted to like X-Men the Last Stand more than I ended up doing, but it goes without saying that the film does lend itself to a certaincase of style going triumphant over substance, it just is. There is an unspoken trend in sequels where the third film 9 times out of 10 is the weakest of the bunch (even if it may not be necessarily a very bad movie). It's a little sad in a way too to see a director like Brett Ratner- who is admittedly by many including myself not as good with the material as Bryan Singer- get pushed aside by a studio far more interested in the action over the substance. And it's unfortunately Do the new mutants look cool? Sure, some of them; it's one of the more amusing things to see this year in a blockbuster having Kelsey Grammar and Vinnie Jones as mutants with over-the-top make-up and costumes. And the special effects and action scenes are given as good, but not having the same real interest as in the past films. Moments in these action sequences- mainly in the wild climax at Alcatraz prison- are exciting, but the problems in the film run deeper than that. If you don't have things all well enough in the script, things are liable to fall apart.One might think that the main plot line of the film, with Famke Janssen as Jean Gray's unbalance and quasi turn to the dark side of the mutant force (maybe just me seeing the 'Sith' comparisons), and the amount of tragedy that befalls the mutants under Xavier's school would make it a very engrossing entertainment. It isn't; there is the feeling more than anything that too much is stuffed into one film, where some sub-plots are left to being undercooked (i.e. the one with Michael Murphy and his winged son), or just given to a lack of creativity (the sub-plot with Anna Paquin's Rogue doesn't have much to it that isn't a mile away). Would I recommend the film as leave-your-brain-at-home-frozen to watch the film? Yeah, but it isn't much of a credit that it's lacking in the ways that would matter to most fans and just movie-goers in general. It will make a lot of money, that is certain, but it will also suffer in time from the good of the film (dependence on the cast like McKellan, Stewart, a couple of newer faces among so-so ones too) contending against the disappointing bits. As one critic somewhere wrote about this film, it's ""soul-less"", which is not what this potential material should have, and has me feeling less wanting to see it again the more I think about it.

13,hitchcockthelegend,You would die for them?,7,5 February 2011,"X-Men: The Last Stand is directed by Brett Ratner and written by Simon Kinberg & Zak Penn. It's the second sequel to 2000's X-Men and the franchise is based around Uncanny X-Men that was the creation of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It stars Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Famke Jansen, Kelsey Grammar, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin & Ellen Page. Dante Spinotti photographs it and the music is scored by John Howe. Plot finds mutants in danger of being wiped out due to a cure discovered at Worthington Industries. This could have desperate repercussions between Xavier's integration friendly X-Men, Magneto's human hating Brotherhood and the human race. Things are further complicated with the return from the dead of Jean Grey, who seems to not be herself and has gained some new and terrifying powers...Bryan Singer, director of the first two X-Men film's, left the franchise to go and helm Superman Returns. After much toing and froing, and many offers to directors, Ratner ended up in the chair. Director of Rush Hour 1 & 2 and Red Dragon, Ratner was charged with the unenviable task of trying to follow the excellent X2. Afforded a budget of $210 million (considerably the highest of the franchise), Ratner and his team made a good enough film to get double back that budget at the Worldwide box office. Not bad considering it was met with mixed reviews from the critics and fan-boys alike. X-Men 3 is a good film, in fact it's great entertainment, what it lacks is the flow and balance of its immediate predecessor. Ratner and his team have followed what seems to be the rule of thumb for movie franchises, i.e.: cram more in and try to dazzle as often as possible. Which in a film that only runs at just over 1 hour 40 minutes doesn't leave much opportunity for character depth, coherence and a solid structure. It's a shame that the makers couldn't afford to let the film be a two hour or longer piece, for there's enough in between the set-pieces to suggest that Ratner could have crafted a deeper movie to match the pizazz.But what pizazz it is. Magneto creates eye candy carnage via a rescue of one of his charges and a bit of bridge manoeuvring is really really cool. Then there's the sublime excitement that comes with the all out war of ""the last stand"", where the X-Men team go feral and showcase the best of their abilities and new tricks (oh we love Storm's new twirly spinning attack mode thingy). While Jean Grey's new powers brings breath taking rewards for the viewer. There's also plenty of little treats for fans of the source and one or two genuine surprises thrown into the mixer. But while the appearance of Beast (Grammer-great) and Kitty Pryde (Page-delightful) is most welcome, new additions that fall flat include Angel (Ben Foster-pointless) and Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones-laughable in a bad way). Which under scrutiny leaves us with a very mixed bag. But! And it's a very big but, for those looking for a slam bang popcorn piece this delivers all that's required. For those in hard with the source and those in need of X2's intelligence, however, the flaws may be just too much to bear. 7/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
14,Theo Robertson,Too Many Plot Threads Too Much Spectacle,6,25 November 2012,The potential of this Summer blockbuster is easily summed up in the flashback opening sequence . Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen exit from a car and indulge in some small talk . As far as I'm concerned these two great stage actors can indulge in small talk for two hours and the film would be above average for their electric screen presence alone . Their characters are there to meet a young girl who is an early mutant and a few scenes later the plot is set up of a cure for mutations . You can easily see where both the subtext and plot is goingSo far so good and Hugh Jackman ( Another effective actor )as Wolverine takes center stage. Being a Summer blockbuster we can forgive the occasional explosion laden action scene that seems clumsily inserted in order to excite the audience. What becomes more and more difficult to forgive is the film's need to include more and more mutant characters who clog up a storyline that becomes more and more messy as it continues and by the time we reach the CGI climax I was lost as to who was who and why we needed so many characters in the first place I can understand why people love this movie and it's not a bad film in the way a Michael Bay Summer blockbuster is a bad film . However you can't fail to notice much of the film's potential becomes sidelined in order to achieve spectacle and bigger and bigger set-pieces . A less noisy film with less characters would have certainly have made for a better movie,X-Men - The Last Stand
15,preppy-3,Too many mutants!,9,3 June 2006,"In this busy sequel from ""X2"" Jean Grey (Famke Jansses) returns from the dead--but is becoming evil. Magneto (Ian McKellan) takes control of her. Also the government has found a cure for the mutant gene--Magneto and his brotherhood intend to destroy the cure while Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his X-Men want to protect it.There's a lot going for this movie. It's under 2 hours and moves very quickly--there's barely a letup. The special effects are just incredible and the battle sequences are fast and furious. Also stay through the closing credits--there's a nice bit right after it. There were also a few twists and turns I didn't see coming. The acting is MOSTLY good--McKellan is excellent as Magneto; likewise Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Kelsey Grammar is fine as Dr. Hank McCoy (Beast). But this movie has some problems too.The fast pace leaves no time for introductions or to really get to know the characters. Shawn Ashmore as Iceman is given little better to do than to look worried; Aaron Stanford scowls through his role as Pyro; Ben Foster as introduced as Angel--and given about two lines. Same with Collosus (Daniel Cudmore)--only a line or two. However there is a great sight gag when he casually walks down a hall with a huge TV under his arm. Anna Paquin and Ellen Page are given boring 1-dimensional roles. It's not the actors fault--they're given NOTHING to work with! They throw way too many mutants at us and then drop them. Also Patrick Stewart is TERRIBLE as Xavier. And I've had it with Halle Berry. She said after ""X2"" that it was over for her. Then when her Oscar didn't help her career she comes back for ""X3"". She is NOT Storm--she's pretty bad too.The script is dumbed down too. The mutant cure would have been interesting to explore (but it isn't) and the Dark Phoenix storyline (lifted directly from the comics) is a lot LESS complex. The movie is just interested in throwing mutants and special effects at us as fast as it can. Also a main character was needlessly killed off at the beginning.Honestly though I DID like it. I was never bored and the effects were just perfect. Afterwards though I realized it was all loud music, special effects...and little else. Still it's a perfect summer popcorn movie. For that I give it a 9.",X-Men - The Last Stand
16,poolandrews,Reasonable big budget comic book superhero Hollywood blockbuster.,5,26 January 2009,"X-Men: The Last Stand starts as it is revealed that a company called Worthington Labs have developed a cure for the mutant gene that almost instantly turns a mutant into just another 'normal' person. The cure is seen by the majority of the mutant community as an attempt to eradicate them from the planet, in particular Magneto (Ian McKellan) forms a mutant army to seize control of the cure & destroy it. Meanwhile the distraught Cyclops (James Marsden) visits the lake where Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) died & is amazed to see her resurrection from the watery depths, unfortunately she kills him by accident. Unsure of who she has become Jean hides away but Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) finds her & tries to talk with her, she kills him too. Seeing her almost limitless power Magneto convinces Jean to side with him in the war against us humans & the cure, it's up to Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry) & the other minor X-Men to save the day... again...This American English co-production is also known simply as X3 & was the third film in the X-Men franchise, one of the most successful of all the Marvel comic book to screen adaptations with the original X-Men (2000) film helped kick-off the trend by Hollywood studios to plunder comic books & turn them into live-action CGI packed big budget summer blockbusters that have generally proved very popular at the box-office with paying audiences. Directed by Brett Ratner I watched X-Men: The Last Stand yesterday & while I didn't think it was brilliant I thought it was entertaining enough for what it is, having said that I generally don't like films adapted from comic books since by their very nature these sorts of character's with these sorts of special powers & silly costumes work far better in 2D on a page rather than in 3D on a cinema screen. Still, at least it's fairly short, the pace is decent, there's a few good action scenes with some impressive CGI computer effects & I would think most X-Men fans would be happy with it although I admit I have never read an X-Men comic book before so I can't really say how faithful this is to the character's origins. As a film it's alright although the first half is mostly concerned with small sub-plots like the cure, the politicians son being cured, like Jean Grey coming back to life, like Magneto finding some new henchmen & there's even a couple of minor love triangles as well. At some points it's like the makers were trying to turn the X-Men into some sort of soap opera but it does come together for the final forty odd minutes & a big budget action scene as mutant fight mutant & the X-Men inevitably save the day. Certainly worth a watch if your a fan of the X-Men character's, the franchise so far or comic book adaptations in general.The film looks nice enough, there are some very impressive special effects sequences with the bending & moving of the Golden Gate Bridge by Magneto probably the stand-out moment. There all all sorts of mutants & X-Men character's from the comic books here but not being a fan I don't really know if they are faithful representations or not. Originally to be directed by Bryan Singer, then Matthew Vaughn who both quit for various reasons Ratner took over & the whole production was apparently quite rushed. The story for X-Men: The Last Stand is apparently a combination of two X-Men graphic novels, Gifted by Joss Whedon & The Dark Phoenix Saga by Chris Claremont & John Byrne.With a supposed budget of about $210,000,000 surely this has to be one of the most expensive films ever made, amazingly it was a success & made over $122,000,000 on it's opening memorial day weekend. Filmed largely in Vancouver in Canada. The cast do alright although many will be familiar with the character's as they return from the previous films while Vinnie Jones makes an appearance as Juggernaunt & an almost unrecognisable Kelsey Grammar makes his debut as Beast.X-Men: The Last Stand is a decent enough big budget comic book superhero film that entertains & passes 100 odd minutes harmlessly enough, I can't say I loved it but I didn't hate it either. Certainly worth a watch especially if your a fan of the character's or the genre.",X-Men - The Last Stand
17,Bunuel1976,"X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (Brett Ratner, 2006) ***",7,18 August 2006,"This is possibly the best in the series, due to the development in the relationships between the various mutants on both sides (though so many of them have grown complexes by the end of the film that the final confrontation is virtually fought between a handful of brash but inexperienced mutant kids about whom we don't really care!).It also utilizes a familiar device in superhero films where the latter (or, in this case, one of them) is converted to the evil side. Besides, one of the villainous mutants who has been 'cured' (the main novelty here is that a boy's special power is that he can turn mutants into normal human beings!) betrays its comrades after having been scorned by them.Still, the effects are overwhelming and at times threaten to drown the narrative. Also, the fact that the leaders of both sides (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen - who are digitally rejuvenated in an early flashback sequence, surely the film's weirdest-looking effect! - are either killed or stripped of their powers) would indicate that this truly is the final entry in the series...but the last shot suggests otherwise!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
18,utgard14,"""Since when did we become a disease?""",5,12 October 2015,"Following up the first two excellent X-Men films from Bryan Singer is this mess from the awful Brett Ratner. The plot's about a battle between the X-Men and evil mutants led by Magneto because humans have discovered a way to turn mutants back into regular people...or something like that. There are subplots out the wazoo but these are mostly distractions that do nothing to help the main story; they just add to the confusion. It's a movie built around the premise of a super-powered battle. Everything else is just padding. The action scenes are pedestrian and the special effects are all over the place quality-wise. Ratner's direction is workmanlike, as anyone who's seen his other movies will expect. The reason why I don't rank this one lower is because of the cast. The returning favorites like Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen are so good in their roles I would watch them regardless of how bad the rest of it is. The new characters are hit and miss with the standouts being Kelsey Grammar as Beast and Ben Foster as Angel. The worst are the new villains (""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!). Also, bigger roles for some characters introduced in the second movie is nice. Brett Ratner shoves as many characters into this as he can, no doubt in an effort to appease the fanboy audience. It's too bad they don't have better material to work with. It's not a good movie, although it is watchable for fans. Weakest of the series by far.",X-Men - The Last Stand
19,lastliberal,Getting the cure so you can go home to mommy and daddy?,6,2 June 2007,"I really could not help thinking throughout this movie about gays and lesbians. This movie was so much about acceptance and about a ""cure,"" that is is a natural jump to acceptance of gays and lesbians and the so-called ""cure"" that some right-wing religious groups are promoting. I know it is not a political movie, but maybe that is what the writers had in mind. I don't know, but it certainly affected my viewing.Of course, the reason I even watched the movie was Halle Barry. I realize that many watch it for Hugh Jackman, and that is cool, because he was great in this as he has been in the previous two. Berry, of course, is to die for.Ian McKellen and Famke Janssen were also great. Really, the whole cats was good. I could not criticize any of them.I just cannot get the picture of Rebecca Romijn lying on the floor of the truck and being rejected by those who used to be her friends. Even the rejected reject.

20,zardoz-13,"What A Revelation of an ""X-Men"" Movie!",10,25 June 2011,"Initially, ""Rush Hour"" director Brett Ratner's ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" did not appeal to me as much as the two Bryan Singer ""X-Men"" movies. After I saw ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" again, I changed my mind and consider it a great way to conclude the ""X-Men"" trilogy. This costume-clad, comic-book, crime-fighters flick is every bit as good as its two predecessors, but it is far darker and less exhilarating than those first two movies. Indeed, if you haven't seen ""X-Men"" and ""X2: X-Men United,"" then you will be lost watching ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" This briskly-paced but serious saga clocks in at a trim 104 minutes and doesn't pull any punches. Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto/Eric Lehnsherr clash over Jean Grey (Famke Janssen of ""GoldenEye"") and the plot centers around the lady. Comparably, the more upbeat ""X2"" ended on a tragic note with Jean sacrificing her life so that the rest of the ""X-Men"" could escape in a chopper before wood flooded it and killed them. Essentially, ""X2"" functions as the equivalent of ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"" where Mr. Spock sacrificed himself for the good of the many. Jean Gray vanishes in ""X2,"" but she returns in ""X-Men: The Last Strand"" and assumes dominance over Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Panquin) whose lives were the focus of the first ""X-Men."" This qualifies as a gripping movie because important changes occur in the Simon Kindberg and Zack Penn screenplay. ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" bristles with surprises and revelations and the character of Jean Gray and her alter ego Phoenix. Phoenix shakes up everything. Professor X dies within the first hour and Mystique fares no better. Part of the plot continues the public debate over the dangers that mutants pose and the appearance of a new drug that has been designed as a cure. Mystique (Rebecca Romijn of ""The Punisher"") is the first casualty and becomes a normal person in the process of shielding Magneto from the medicine. The demise of not only Professor X but also Scott Summers / Cyclops (James Marsden) lends the movie a heavyweight sense of soberness. Nevertheless, this is an actioneer and several new characters, like the muscular Cain Marko / Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) appears as well as the girl who can walk through walls, Kitty Pryde / Shadowcat (Ellen Page of ""Juno""), and Dr. Henry 'Hank' McCoy / Beast (Kelsey Grammar in a remarkable performance). The battle between Phoenix and Wolverine is cool. Stick around for the end of the end credits if you want to see another surprise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
21,Boba_Fett1138,"A nice and spectacular action flick. Nothing more, nothing less.",7,2 December 2006,"I expected the worst. No Bryan Singer, the previews didn't looked very good and the critics were not exactly raving about the movie. But really, the movie was not as bad as I expected it to be. On the contrary. The movie is a good looking and spectacular science-fiction/action that is perhaps lacking in the same depth and layers the previous two X-Men movies had but it's good and entertaining enough on its own.In essence ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is a good looking and spectacular action flick. This is perhaps not what the fans hoped and expected it to be but the neutral, unbiased viewer will be surely entertained by the movie.There are plenty of action sequences in the movie to thrill and please the viewer but even superior are the special effects. No expenses were spared, with as a result some spectacular looking action- but also non-action sequences. It makes the movie good looking and entertaining at the same time.It's a bit of a shame that with the many new characters and different new plot lines the movie yet fails to create some depth and make the story more multiple layered and meaningful, as the previous two X-Men movies were. This is probably due to the short running time of the movie; 104 minutes. It doesn't leave the movie any room to flesh out the characters and create some more plot lines with depth and emotions. The movie is a bit shallow and simple at times. The movie has plenty of emotions in it (the death of characters, love-stories) but yet the movie fails to ever get emotional, due to this previous mentioned reason. It doesn't make the movie halve as powerful as it perhaps could had been.The movie brings back lots of old character from the previous two movies but also introduces some new ones. This time Storm plays a bigger role in the movie just as Jean Grey, who sort of is the central character of the movie and plays a key-part. It gives the both actresses Halle Berry and Famke Janssen more chance to show their great acting skills. It has as a result that some of the characters are pushed to the back (Rogue, Cyclops, among others) though. The movie also introduces some new characters such as Beast, Juggernaut and Angel. Beast is perfectly played by Kelsey Grammar, who fits the role like a glove. And don't ask me why but I have the feeling that Ellen Page (Kitty Pryde) is going to be a big star someday. Angel seems like a sort of redundant character, since he hardly plays a role in the movie, though he is yet often prominently present. But I guess it's OK, since he'll obviously play a more significant role in future X-Men movies and this movie was merely used to introduce his character, very much like was the case with Iceman, Pyro and Colossus in the previous movie, who all also play a role again in this movie. The villains might perhaps this time not come across as intriguing and prominent as in the previous two movies but that is due to the fact that the true enemy this time in the movie is not a person but it's 'the cure'. Nevertheless Ian McKellen still impresses as Magneto, who by now surely has grown out to be one of the best and most memorable villains of this decade.Not only the special effects look good but so does the cinematography by Dante Spinotti and so does the action editing, that always keeps the pace high and the movie interesting. The musical score from John Powell also impresses and works very well in the movie.It all in all is one of the better and more entertaining action movies of the year, with a fantastic ending that leaves the door open for (hopefully) more sequels.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",X-Men - The Last Stand
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Well, sure, it's *fun*",7,5 May 2009,"I base this on the Collector's Edition DVD. You may already know what the events around this one were... in any case, since they're on the Trivia page, I won't put them here. It should be noted that this isn't all bad. At its best, this really has some interesting things to offer, much of which is in line with the first ones. The same/similar themes are explored, in a different way, through a device new to the movies. The tone and the realistic approach is kept relatively intact, if this gets pretty grand. There are strong women in this, too. It's can also be fairly dramatic. The effects are excellent. The score is quite impeccable. The cast is fantastic at its best... Grammar is spot-on. Stanford makes a great Pyro, again. Foster does marvelous with very little time. The returning players are as good as before(well, Berry is better). This has the problem of the others, to boot... too many characters, and an immense abundance of mutants. It's worse than ever before in this. They try to fit in so many, to make fights and such possible, for example, and most don't even get a hint of personality. A specific occurrence is the easy way out(you shouldn't know it if you haven't already watched this). Rather than writing out, or working around, abilities, this sometimes ignores them, hopes the audience doesn't think about why they aren't used. At the same time, there is power use that is just gratuitous(not to mention that one bit of sensuality). The action is genuinely awesome, if it doesn't always come off entirely right. It certainly is the biggest of these, and it is never this central to an entry in the film-series in the others. Why the couple of intense/exciting sequences that... go absolutely nowhere? For advertising purposes? This is complex at points, but it's the only of the trilogy where the words ""stupid"" and ""superficial"" can be used about portions of it without immediately being dismissed. The dialog varies. The pace is uneven(well, it's not boring, nor does it entirely overwhelm the viewer), and this is one of the major issues with this one. You can take this as a Summer blockbuster flick, a smart piece of science fiction or a healthy mix of those, however, it can't be genuinely denied that this is rushed, and that it is in a hurry throughout. The R. Lee Ermey bit, literally, shouts ""come on, we have to keep moving"", and is unintentionally laughable. The editing is well-done, and the cinematography is, at times, stunning. This has something that borders on sexuality, and infrequent language, almost invariably reasonably mild. The violence, whilst plentiful, is similarly children-friendly, though there are disturbing visuals. The disc comes with several alternate endings and plenty of deleted/extended scenes(ranging in quality), about ten minutes worth, with Ratner, Kinberg and Penn sharing their thoughts. That's it for extras, apart from trailers, two color schemes, and a commentary track with Arad, Donner and Winter as well as one of the director, Simon and Zak(they're both worth a listen, but this one is more humorous). Well, that's not entirely accurate... it comes with a comic book, featuring Stan Lee's favorite three stories(including the origin, #1) and a new one(that's four in all, a total of 60 pages). I recommend this to any fan of the graphic novels, the franchise, and/or the silver screen efforts preceding this. 7/10",X-Men - The Last Stand

The Dark Phoenix storyline of the resurrected Jean Grey (the statuesquely sexy Janssen) will appeal to the inner fanboy as well as a fierce Jackman as the impervious to pain Wolverine (earmarked as the next solo X-Men character worthy of his own film) struggling to do the right thing in his ongoing crush for the lovely yet malevolent Jean. Director Brett Ratner, filling in for Bryan Singer who had commitment to ""Superman Returns"", does a better-than-imagined attempt yet allows too many new additional mutants getting short-shrift and lost in the shuffle with the exception of blue furred Dr. Hank McCoy AKA ""Beast"" (well-cast Grammar) as the liaison of ""mutant"" affairs.

Nor did being an X-Men enthusiast mean that I would be overly picky regarding every minute fact and detail regarding ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" thereby making me dislike it.That being said, there were three conditions that needed to be satisfied for me to like ""The Last Stand"", and four conditions in order for me to love ""The Last Stand"".1.) A good story.X-Men delivered on having a good story by having intriguing underlying stories accompany the main story.2.) New characters.Being that X-Men has been around for over 40 years there have been many characters that have been introduced in the popular comic book. Some of the characters are forgettable and others are unforgettable. X3 introduced enough new characters to make sure they would not fall short of showing some of the unforgettable characters.3.) Display of the abilities of the new characters and/or the untapped or unused abilities of the old characters.I'll just say check. There were some very cool and interesting characters introduced and we got to see their abilities. AND we also got to see some untapped abilities of the old characters.4.) An epic battle.X3 delivered the epic battle. It could even be said that there were two epic battles which is one more than any X-Men fan or non-X-Men fan could hope for.This movie delivered more than I anticipated and I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.

25,neil-476,Far from a disaster,7,24 March 2011,"Brett Ratner's 3rd (and final) instalment in the (original) X-Men trilogy has come in for a lot of vitriol, and it's my job to say that much of it is undeserved. That's not to say that it isn't without its bad points, but I'll get to those.Within the wider sweep of deepening tensions between the mutant / militant mutant / humankind factions, the love triangle between Jean Grey, Wolverine and Cyclops reaches its tragic conclusion in a plot thread loosely adapted from the dark Phoenix saga, hinted at in the very final moments of X-Men 2. The development of both plots is well handled, and the last half hour or so is both spectacular and emotional.The good points? Kelsey Grammar as Beast is note perfect, and I defy any comic fan not to come over all funny when he says ""Oh my stars and garters."" The final battle, a full-on battle between two groups of super-powered mutants, is strikingly well done. And the resolution of the Dark Phoenix problem, as tragically inevitable as it is, is never overpowered by the spectacular destruction taking place behind it thanks to heart-breakingly passionate and honest performances from Famke Janssen and Hugh Jackman.There are some negatives, though, and the main one - in my book - is the sidelining of Cyclops. Scott Summers, as the long-time leader of the X-Men in the comics, and also the leader in the previous films, deserved better than to be casually killed off screen. His death should have had a major emotional impact (as a major emotional character and also as jean's notional first love), and it had none.Apart from that, I enjoyed this film a lot, and I return to it more often than I do to its predecessors.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Hugh Jackman as Woverine faces a task he wishes not to fulfill. Halle Berry as Storm can control the weather, and will eventually be given leadership skills after a particular plot twist occurs. Ian McKellen as the evil Magnito is given his best scenes towards the conclusion. He is nearly hit with the cure until the resourceful Mystique intersects it thus sacrificing her own powers. Famke Janssen is given the most growth in her defected personality. Due to events from the second film, she has spawn evil and the X-Men are reluctantly faced with the task of exterminating her. Finally we have Patrick Stewart providing wisdom and a mind control power as Professor Xavier. Makeup and production is overwhelming with detail.

New mutants include Shadow Cat(played by Ellen Page), along with Juggernaut, Colossus, and Angel, among several others. After Mystique is accidentally cured, then betrayed by Magneto, she helps the humans learn about the plan, thus forcing a climatic battle, where a resurrected Jean Grey(Famke Janssen) must battle forces led by Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) and Beast(played by Kelsey Grammar). Audacious sequel provides surprising fates for Cyclops(James Marsden) & Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart) that ups the stakes considerably.

The effects are amazing, the set pieces exciting and stunning, and the inclusion of The Dark Phoenix, would have been amazing, if it was handled by someone who didn't follow the Michael Bay rules of Hollywood.All in all, if its an event film with lots of spectacle and that true Summer Blockbuster feel, you've got it here.But within half a day, you'll forget about the movie, apart from the fact that Vinnie Jones is truly awful in this.Empty fun.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Of course to elevate Storm to leadership position and thus satisfy Barry's huge inflated ego, you would have to get rid of any better more rational choice of characters to lead he X-men. Rationality and good characterization be damned. Halle won an Oscar, she get's her way.

31,Wuchakk,A good finale to the original trilogy,7,10 April 2012,"I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is generally well-regarded but has a very vocal segment of fans who revile it. This makes little sense since, despite having a new director, the film has the same tone and principle actors as the previous two and brings to culmination the ideas presented therein. Aside from the final fight between Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men we get the resurrection of Jean Grey and her struggle with the dark side of her psyche.Some complain of the deaths of two prominent characters, but how often are characters resurrected in comics? Isn't one significant character resurrected in this very film? Others complain about the supposed short runtime and lack of depth but X3 has the exact same runtime as the first film (104 minutes) and there's plenty of depth to mine, take Rogue's dilemma over taking a cure in order to have human intimacy, Phoenix's incredible inner conflict symbolizing the universal clash of flesh and spirit (id and super-ego), Cyclop's grief and astonishing discovery, Pyro's moral degeneration, Mystique's plight after getting kicked out of the Brotherhood and Wolverine's struggle to do the right thing despite his deep love, to name just six.On the downside, the big clash on Alcatraz Island feels routine and dull. They should've kept the focus on the Dark Phoenix, but the producers probably felt this would take away from the other characters, plus they wanted the clichéd big battle sequence. Nevertheless, there's enough good here to appreciate.GRADE: B+",X-Men - The Last Stand
32,Aaron1375,"Good movie...but if it is the ""Last Stand"" it should have been more.",9,28 May 2006,"I enjoyed this movie better than the first one, but it lacked what the second movie had. Still many good things were to be found in this movie as I really enjoyed the fact Magneto really showed how powerful he was with some really jaw dropping deeds in magnetism. Beast was finally a main player and played really well by Kelsey Grammar. Great ending fight scene between our hero's and Magneto's virtual army and the Juggarnaut was just great. Still it had some flaws too, if this is supposed to be the final movie I didn't care for the fate of one of my favorite X-men from the comics (though admittedly not everyone else's favorite) though reading through some blogs I understand why now (I think I would rather have him recast instead). The plot needed more development as the Dark Phoenix plot mixed with the cure plot needed more than just an hour and forty five minutes coverage. They could have easily added at least thirty to forty minutes of movie. Then there are the characters that were not very distinct...other than Pyro and Juggernaut I didn't really recognize anyone in Magneto's army and I hear Pyslocke was one of em. And why oh why didn't two of the characters that you would expect to trade punches never did (you know who I am talking about). All in all it was a great thrill ride with wonderful special effects. Ian and Patrick Stewart once again steal their scenes, but nearly everyone did a good job. If this was the last one (and I hope it isn't) it was a rather nice end, however, if they choose to make more I will be on board and quite frankly the way the left it they need more.",X-Men - The Last Stand

But given that stance, watching this very colorful film was an art study in how far computer generated graphics have come in a relatively short time. And that makes the time spent on the non-story worthwhile.Of course it is always a pleasure to see Sir Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, and the newly buff Ben Foster in action: nice costume effects despite overdone makeup etc. But the story is so slim that it can be ignored and the viewer can watch the rather extraordinary special effects - until they ultimately wear thin (as when the house lifts off the ground, etc!). So advice for those fellow viewers who avoid these Marvel Comic movies: drop the prejudice long enough to see what is au courante in special effects. It is rather entertaining...for a while.

34,The_Void,Characters overruled by action sequences,7,25 May 2006,"After director Bryan Singer decided to leave the X-Men series in order to direct the new Superman film, many feared that the third instalment would not be as great as the first two. Unfortunately, replacement director Brett Ratner has only confirmed those fears, as while the film features all the action that would expect from a comic book movie; the characterisation that put Singer's film above a lot of comic book fare has been lost, as new blood such as Ben Foster's Angel and Vinnie Jones' Juggernaut aren't given much to do, and established characters such as Mystique and Cyclops get left by the wayside. The plotting doesn't work as well as in previous films either, as Simon Kinberg & Zak Penn's script tries to do too much, and the result is a film the leaves several threads hanging far too long before returning to them; and the result ultimately is a film that doesn't explore every possible angle. The plot this time largely focuses on the idea of a cure for mutancy, which divides the population between those that want to be cured, and those that don't. One again, the major story point features the battle between Professor Xavier and evil genius, Magneto.To be honest, I've never read the X-Men comics; and so can't comment on the faithfulness to the source material. I don't imagine writing a script for this film would be easy, as there's so many different characters and keeping the focus away from special effects is a near impossibility. The special effects are impressive, but not as much as they could have been simply due to the fact that astounding effects have become part and parcel of the modern day blockbuster. The film does feature several action scenes, which are sure to delight the target audience, however, and although certain scenes; including one that involves the golden bridge, are somewhat over the top - that's hardly a weighty criticism for a comic book film. The dynamics of the story have changed, as Halle Berry's storm takes a more frontal role this time around, which is a shame as it means other, more interesting characters such as Anna Paquin's Rogue barely get any screen time at all (the white hair looks great on Berry, though). Ian McKellen stands out as the leader of the wayward mutants, and is gifted with the best character in the film. Hugh Jackman fits his role as Wolverine like a glove; while Famke Janssen and Kelsey Grammar do nothing but fill out the plot with their roles. The amazing Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is given nothing to do, which is a major flaw as far as I'm concerned while younger stars such as Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford and Ellen Page do well in the action sequences but don't shine otherwise. Ex-football star Vinnie Jones is great only when his mouth is closed.I'm sure that this film will appeal to fans of the comic book, as despite several painful one-liners and a lack of characterisation, the film is very entertaining and the action sequences are largely well done. In comparison to the first two movies, The Last Stand doesn't stand out and it's a shame that a series with so much promise had to end on what can only be described as a low.",X-Men - The Last Stand
35,zetes,"Not as good as X2, but still pretty good",8,29 May 2006,"Worthy follow-up to the near-masterpiece X2, perhaps the best comic book movie ever. Ratner isn't as talented as Bryan Singer. The film is a lot clunkier and imbalanced. The plot is somewhat less clear and a bit slow-moving. But the story is good, and it is generally very entertaining. Several of the action sequences are exceptional. My favorite sequence was the one where Juggernaut chased Kitty Pryde through Alcatraz Prison (she can move through walls  he can smash through walls). I'm sure a lot of die-hard geeks will have plenty to say  some of their favorite characters are disposed of rather nonchalantly. A couple of the main characters  Cyclops and Rogue  have almost no screen time. I was a little bothered that Ratner and his screenwriters weren't able to wring the proper amount of emotion out of the deaths of some major characters. I won't say who, but several characters go away in one way or another. Two of the main villains have more powerful final moments than three of the main good guys. Of course, the title hints that this will be the last X-Men movie, but there is plenty more story to tell and I will certainly be in line for the inevitable X-Men 4: Give Us More Money.",X-Men - The Last Stand
36,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: X-Men: The Last Stand,9,22 May 2006,"As always, you get the beef here - stay tuned until the end of the  credits for one small scene which will probably put a smile to your  face. Don't say I didn't warn ya! Oh and as usual with good Marvel  movies, watch out for Stan Lee too!  The X-Men movies did one thing which I thought was almost impossible to  do for the movies, and that is to massage the multi-characters' egos  into one feature length film within reasonable screen time. Kudos are  necessary for Bryan Singer and his team for pulling the original X-Men  off, then top it with X2, beating odds that sequels generally suck,  what with bigger sets, action, and horrors, even more characters!  With Singer's departure for another summer movie this year, the grand  daddy of superheroes, Superman, the X-Men franchise was temporarily put  into development hell, and was left directionless. Having its stars ask  for more money and a bigger role, was natural too. But I'm glad that  these issues were resolved and director Brett Ratner took on the  thankless task of adding a rudder to steer a fitting last movie of a  trilogy (will there be more? Hmm....)  And I'm glad to announce it's the best summer movie so far, one which  surpassed my expectations, which probably was low to begin with. It had  a decent storyline which is a direct continuation from X2, and had  bleak moments interspersed throughout the movie. A cure has been found,  extracted from a fellow mutant boy, which the humans offer to the  mutants to become normal again. But just what is normal? Herein lies  the ra-ra themes like you-are-who-you-are, stay-true-to-yourself etc.  But it doesn't bog down the pace of the movie, not quite, especially  since most will be in it for the action. And it's always human tendency  to want to weaponize anything for that advantage over our enemies. We  come in peace? Hell yeah :P  There are again plenty of set action pieces, some of which will  disappoint, like the beginning which somewhat reeked from a bad  Terminator setting, but on the other end of the spectrum, the Grey  House battle is the best amongst all, beating even the finale. It's  full of concurrent action, tense moments, loads of special effects with  a dash of character development. The finale battle was cool (look out  for the Iceman teaser), but I thought it was a bit of a letdown with  its major continuity error with the cars on the bridge.  Not surprisingly, having Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry's names  headlining the marquee, Wolverine (as always, the most popular  X-character) and Storm had more leadership roles in this sequel. But,  and no offense to the fans, it seemed that Wolverine's solo action  sequence was a bit ordinary, like watching a scene from Mortal Kombat.  If there's gonna be a movie spin off, show off more slicing and dicing,  up the violence a little and slap it with some rating.  But with the focus on the 2 main leads, as well as The Beast, little  attention is paid towards Magneto and his brotherhood (then again, we  need not have much introduction and can afford diving straight in), and  fans of Mystique will be disappointed with the diminished role, as do  other characters like Rogue, Cyclops and new kid on the block Angel  (really cosmetic if you ask me).  The Phoenix was introduced to great fanfare, and it made a bit more  sense without the fusion of that outer space element from the comics.  This story-arc is the main pivot, and it was a fantastic scene in the  beginning to witness the camaraderie between Charles Xavier and Eric  Lensherr, before they became bitter enemies. I'd tip my hat too to the  little moments of acknowledgement and admiration one has for the other,  despite being on opposites.  All in all, it was very much enjoyable, and I'm sure fans of the movie  franchise will agree it's a fitting end to the trilogy, though it  hinted the option of making a fourth, and the more lucrative potential  of solo character spin offs.",X-Men - The Last Stand
37,siderite,Bad movie even by X-standards,5,30 May 2006,"OK, this is (again!) a movie based on a comic. The third part. How good can one be, anyway? But it was worse. I've watched the X-men animated series and I enjoyed them, I liked even the ""young x-men"" crap. So I should be relatively unbiased, yet I feel I was cheated! this movie completely sucked!Not only the mutant powers are now so powerful that the existence of humans as a species is already useless, but the reasons for their actions are really dumb. Magneto must be the worst strategist since general Custer, Xavier dies stupidly, Cyclops dies stupidly, Wolverine doesn't die, (again!), and the whole thing goes round a cure for mutantness, which in the comic was a cover for the experiments of Apocalypse. Nothing so interesting in X-Men 3 - The Can't Stand.Conclusion: even the special effects are dumb. Expensive and good looking, but purposeless. Stupid, stupid movie. Let me decrease the Vote mark again.",X-Men - The Last Stand
38,StevePulaski,Maybe we needed this to show us how good we had it,4,8 May 2014,"A facility by the name of Worthington Labs has announced that it will now look to suppress the X-gene, the gene that gives their special, superhuman abilities, and is trying to get as many mutants to forgo their special abilities as they can. Any fan of the X-Men knows this will upset the series' main villain Magneto (Ian McKellen), who works to establish a world where mutants have complete control over traditional humans. This leap in science, however, has concerned Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his band of X-Men, and this is their cue to investigate. On the case are mainly the clawed anti-hero Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the unpredictable Storm (Halle Berry), who work to, once again, stop Magneto and try to convince that humans and mutants can indeed coexist.X-Men: The Last Stand immediately turned heads for the sole purpose that, for the first time in the franchise's history, it was not directed by Bryan Singer, who didn't quite have a third film in mind. Singer left to direct Superman Returns, which was released the same year as The Last Stand. Instead, the studio hired director Brett Ratner, whom was one of the many in talks to direct the first X-Men. Ratner has publicly proclaimed his lack of knowledge when it came to the comic book series, but was optimistic that 20th Century Fox's writers - Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn - knew enough about what they were doing in order to make a successful and loyal adaptation.Learning of Ratner's ignorance of the series fuels one of the more lofty complaints I have about this third installment, and that is the project feels very insincere and lacking in the similar grace and charm of a comic book on screen. What Singer and the film's writers had built, up until then, was a film that existed in respect to the franchise it was blowing on the big screen, not simply to exist. With Ratner on board, and Singer's quips nowhere to be found, X-Men: The Last Stand feels like an advertisement for the series.For one, there is much more action in this particular film than in any other film in the franchise. After watching the gleefully kinetic and wonderfully stylized violence in X2: X-Men United, it's a shame we have now retraced our steps to incorporate tiresome, listless battles that go on for several minutes at a time, sometimes ten or maybe even fifteen minutes. Because of this, the effect of the series' enticing setpieces has dwindled from creative and something to anticipate to something that causes little else besides exhaustion. Things explode, characters fall, some of them die, most characters move out of the way just in the nick of time, and so forth.It's not that Ratner's direction and the camera work here is subpar, it's just there doesn't seem to be a method to Ratner's madness here in terms of excessive amounts of special effects and chaotic fight scenes. The nail in the coffin, however, is the writing, which is some of the most atrocious I've ever witnessed in a screenplay for a superhero film. Character development and connections are halted greatly when they were expanded throughout the first and second film, characters speak heavily in goofy puns and inexcusably poor jokes, and Wolverine is given speaking lines that leads one to believe the intent was to make him the most unbelievable character in the mix.What we have with X-Men: The Last Stand are undeniably good special effects, a further, if half baked, expansion on the idea of mutants and how the themes of this franchise potentially reflect society's discrimination of race, sex, and orientation, direction that clearly lacks the heart of what its predecessor managed to conjure up, and downright awful writing.While the first two X-Men films were definitely not two of the superhero films I cherished the most, they exercised their ideas and themes of discrimination and individuality to the fullest degree. With that, they took numerous heroes with the common attribute of being physically unique and possessing different powers and a wide range of talents and turned it into a complete two-part film. X-Men: The Last Stand shows what the series would've been like had its ideas been shortchanged and action would've taken prominence; perhaps it was a necessary miscalculation for us to see how lucky we had it for two films straight.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen, Kelsey Grammar, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, and Vinnie Jones.

39,Smells_Like_Cheese,This was the coolest movie ever!,10,7 October 2006,"I used to watch the X-Men cartoons constantly when I was a kid, so over all I knew their stories pretty well, I was very enthused when I heard about X-Men the movie, so automatically, I saw it in theater, even though I liked the movie, I felt it had no justice to the stories and back rounds. The second one had a little more taste and even more fancy shamcy effects that seemed to overpower the movie. The third X-Men was so awesome and effective to the story.It was a really nice completion to the X-Men story, if this is the last movie, we're not sure. But basically, now the mutants have a ""cure"", it comes from a young boy who can turn all the mutants back to humans. This is good for some mutants who want a normal life, but it makes you wonder if the humans are just trying to hide from what fate has brought to them. Gee, like we don't have that going on today with certain subjects. ;) The story is so beautiful and wonderfully done. It still had a comic book feel along with great eye candy to boot.The cast looked like they had so much fun making this film and it had great lines. I would HIGHLY recommend X-Men: The Last Stand, it's a terrific movie that I guarantee you will not want to miss. This is my favorite out of the three, it stuck to the story and made a great conclusion to our hero's end.10/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
40,MovieAddict2016,"Far better than I expected, although it lacks the emotional depth of its immediate predecessor",7,11 June 2006,"When I read that Brett Ratner was replacing Bryan Singer as director for ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" my hope for the project instantly diminished. After reading Ratner's plans to have a ""fantasy mutant"" of his own creation in the film whose purpose would be to satisfy the sexual appetites of men, I was really worried. And finally, after viewing the trailer, I really lost all interest - it looked like a typical action blockbuster, no better than ""Fantastic Four"" and lacking the better elements of the first and second films. I also picked up on the fact that there was really, REALLY bad dialogue in the trailer - which indicated to me that the film was in bad shape.However, it's good. Not great, and not in any way, shape or form as good as the second film - but it's a small notch below the first film and still quite entertaining. Ratner imitates Singer's cold, blue-tint directorial style - and does so pretty well. There are obvious sequences where it isn't Singer and Ratner's penchant for loud action shines through - but it still works.The acting isn't as bad as I had feared but ultimately the film's 88-minute running time prevents it from delving into the emotional depth of these characters. A character is killed early on with little hesitation and he comes across during the beginning of the movie as a self-absorbed jerk. Wolverine's mysterious background - which proved to be a highlight of the second film, as well as an emotional roller-coaster for him - is totally abandoned and he just becomes a live action figure. His rah-rah rally speech to the other guys at the end (""We're the X-Men!"") is simultaneously disappointing and totally lame.Nevertheless, I found myself entertained - and surprised that, overall, the film wasn't nearly as bad as I had feared it would be. For the most part, Ratner doesn't give in to his eccentricities (when I saw mutants on the trailer that looked like NIN groupies with goth haircuts I was worried) - and as a casual fan of the first two movies, who was surprised by their depth as superhero movies, I can say that I found this at least to be a suiting finale to the series (if there aren't any more sequels - the end seems to indicate there will be) - it may not be as smart or mature as the previous sequel but it provides a nice jumping point for the spawning of character-sequels such as the ""Wolverine"" movie that's rumored to be made next - and hopefully that film will provide a bit more depth for Hugh Jackman's character, because his lack of characterization this time around is one of the movie's lesser aspects.",X-Men - The Last Stand

42,KineticSeoul,"Not a terrible installment, but the first two was much better",6,29 June 2011,"Had the biggest budget from the three movies and yet it's probably the worst one in the trilogy. The director obviously wasn't a comic book fan cause this movie contradicts a lot of the stuff in the comics. It just seemed like the director didn't know what he was doing and just relied way too much on the special effects instead of concentrating on a good story that wasn't too far off from the marvel universe. Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) is the main hero this time once again and with every installment Jackman seems to nail the character even better each time. But what I really disliked is how his character is a bit too emotional, which isn't a part of his characteristics in the comics. The special effects I will admit is entertaining to watch but a more tighter and better script that will leave the audiences engaged most of the way through would have made this movie a great summer movie. But it just lacked those key elements and just concentrated way too much on mutants and powers. Some of the characters were pointless and it seemed like the director just wanted to put in as many mutants as possible. Even the direction and the plot with the characters is incoherent. Which might be okay for some viewers as long as it has a lot of action and special effects but I didn't find it all that engaging or gripping. Overall this movie is a very poor comic book adaptation and the Phoenix part of the story almost went nowhere. It's not a terrible installment, but the first two was much better.6.8/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
43,Buddy-51,bland conclusion to a thought-provoking series,5,21 January 2007,"In the first two ""X-Men"" films, perceptive viewers could easily detect the ""pro-gay rights"" subtext that ran through the storyline about a race of superpower ""mutants"" let loose on the world and the debate over their place in society. The latest installment, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" takes the issue a step further by proposing a complex moral dilemma: should the ""mutants"" be encouraged to partake of a supposed ""cure"" for their condition or should they be proud of who they are and not change merely to placate a society made uncomfortable by their presence?Unfortunately, even though ""The Last Stand"" raises this intriguing ethical issue, it really doesn't do anything all that interesting with it. The main problem is that the screenplay simply fails to come up with a character commensurate with the movie's theme. In fact, there are so many mutants running around that none of them is ever able to grab the center of the movie's attention or the focus of the audience. Storm, Wolverine, Phoenix, Iceman, Rogue etc. all have their individual moments but they are soon crushed under the weight of overblown actions scenes and over-the-top special effects. Only Ian Holm's evil Magneto has a chance to break through all the pyrotechnics and create some impact as a character.I loved the original ""X-Men"" when it came out in 2003 precisely because it felt so bold and daring in its willingness to explore social issues along with all the CGI effects, stunt work and explosions that are par for the action film genre. But the two follow-up editions have not lived up to those expectations. I'm sorry to say that, despite all the technical fireworks of the grand finale, the ""X-Men"" series ends not with a bang but with a whimper.",X-Men - The Last Stand
44,thesar-2,Stand against violence,7,13 May 2010,"Originally, I didn't like X-Men: The Last Stand. Today, I watched it again and it's still my third favorite of the original 3. (It goes: X2: X-Men United, then X-Men and finally X-Men: The Last Stand.) However, what I originally gave 2 or 2½ stars turned, tonight, to 4/5 stars.) Why? (Spoiler alerts following. It's so hard as the expert journalist I think I am to avoid giving away the major points in order to review. So, if spoilers aren't your bag (baby) then skip to lifesaboxofchocolates.com.) So many mutants and humans (or homosapiens) die. This is NOT your childhood, your Superman: The Movie. This is WAR. An adult comic book movie, as if this could ""really"" happen. So there will always be causalities. Does that mean, I have to like it? No. I don't want to see the majority die or get ""cured."" Oh, sorry, that's another spoiler.Humans have developed a ""cure"" for the common mutant in the form of awell, mutant. That little mutant boy, Leech (or Jimmy (Bright)) is capable of transforming any mutant into, well one of them, orus (humans.) Naturally, there are those against it, namely Magneto (so wonderfully played again by McKellen) and his ""brotherhood"" of mutants-against-change.Meanwhile, and this is another major plot-point, Jean Grey (Janssen) is back, but now as ""Phoenix."" Hey, that's where I live. That was bad. Sorry. Anyways, her split personality is weighing heavily on multiple sources: Wolverine (Jackman) who loves her, Cyclops (Marsden) who mourns her, Xavier (Stewart) who wants to help her and Magneto who wants to, uh, evolve her.Sure there are more subplots roaming. But, suffice to say, I loved the fact we left Wolverine's backdrop behind, Rogue (as annoying as she isin all three original features) is only minimal, and the action was intense, when it did happen. Hates? Well that a huge amount of mutants either got evaporated – and I won't spoil who, or ""cured."" Stick around for the before-and-after credits for some nice surprises.Also, the bridge moving scene went on for far too long and was a completely unnecessarily (CGI-excuse) scene as Magneto could've easily lifted everyone over via metal slab.Fine, (since I'm still p*ssed) I'll give away one transformation I didn't care for: Mystique (Romijn.) She was definitely one of my favorites in the first two chapters and could've been used here more.If you liked the first two, this is definitely worth a shot/viewing. It's not perfect, and suffers from a lot of the same old comic-book/sequel dilemmas: too much, too late. And it's very violent for a ""comic-book/super-hero"" movie. It's not for smaller kids. I admired that ""stand"" against the norm. Watch it. And, again, stay through the credits Side Note: and I wish they would stop that. It's definitely no fun to stay through a 2 hour movie, wait 4-9 minutes for the credits to finish so you can see an additional 20 seconds. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's marketing or attempts to get you to read/see all the people involved. But it's annoying. Seriously.",X-Men - The Last Stand
45,bensonmum2,What a mistake!,4,28 May 2006,"Sadly, the third movie in the X-Men series doesn't come close to living up to either its potential or the precedent established by the first two movies. But before I get to that, I'll cover a couple aspects of the film that really worked for me. First, the action sequences are generally well done. As individual set pieces, the action scenes work. Second, when I first heard that Kelsey Grammar was brought on board to play the Beast in X-Men: The Last Stand, I was a little apprehensive. I mean the thought of Frasier Crane doesn't exactly conjure images of an action hero. After seeing the film, I cannot imagine anyone else in the role. Grammar is the center of attention in every scene in which he appears - and it's not just the makeup.On to the problems: I can sum up most of the issues I have with X-Men: The Last Stand in two words - Brett Ratner. The decision to allow Ratner to direct X-Men: The Last Stand was a total mistake. Ratner seems to think that throwing together action sequences and CGI effects is all you need to make a good movie. Sorry Mr. Ratner, but the first two films were much more than this. The script and direction feel rushed and sloppy with little thought given to what made the series so good to begin with. There is no character development. Mutants are thrown on screen with the sole purpose of showing off special effects - not in an attempt to create memorable characters. And the characters from the previous two movies are handled poorly. Jean Grey's conversion to the Phoenix isn't explained at all. And she does nothing for most of the movie other than standing around looking like a reject from an army of the undead. Cyclops, a major character from the other movies, is killed off with no fanfare. And his death occurs off-screen! Why? Rogue is totally unnecessary. None of her scenes have anything to do with the plot other than adding some unneeded WB style melodrama. Professor Xavier and Mystique - gone far too quickly. And Wolverine has been reduced to little more than an Arnold Schwarzenegger wannabe spouting one-liners like he's working at the local comedy club.I could go on and on, but you get the idea. In short, it's a disaster.",X-Men - The Last Stand

47,Robert_duder,Good...but very different...the evolution of the X-men is at hand,8,28 May 2006,"Perhaps the exit of Bryan Singer made a bigger impact than people realize on the enormously successful, and justifiably so, X-Men Series. Brett Ratner attempts to pick up the story so carefully woven together by Singer and he does a decent enough job but I think he also managed to completely dismantle Singer's creation and start a new evolution of X-Men. Besides this being turned into a Storm and Wolverine extravaganza, he successfully kills off three of the main characters from the first two films and the X-Men in general, introduce practically an entirely new team. None of this is bad or good, just different and interesting. The story does continue and the war that has been brewing between the humans and mutants and Magneto and the X-Men comes to a boiling point and breaks out on Alcatraz Island.Hugh Jackson, who since the first film has become a big star, returns as Wolverine. His sharp edged wit, and bad attitude have been toned down to almost the point of domestication and his Savior relationship with Rogue (Anna Paquin) is now non-existent. The entire character was just different in this one as was all the old cast members. They felt like old news and there wasn't the magic that they once had. Still Jackman fits the role flawlessly and he is a great star. Halle Berry is now a front runner in the cast (refusing to return if she wasn't) as Storm. Her character has changed a lot too. She really isn't the Storm from the first two films and I think ultimately she did even less even if she had more screen time. Anna Paquin returns as well for a small almost insignificant role as Rogue. She is there mostly to continue the debate on whether or not Mutants would be better off as normal humans. Two exceptions to the rule about the old cast members being old news were Famke Janssen, and Ian McKellen. Janseen, who was killed off at the end of X2 returns as Phoenix, an alter ego who uses her power to hurt anyone in her way. Janssen gets to release her wooden performance as Jean Grey and really let loose and that's good!! It was fun to see her on the other side of things and finally get closure to her story line. McKellen...what can you say about him...his performance as Magneto is brilliant. Angry, evil, powerful, yet you feel sorry for him, you see caring and fear. For the record at 66 years old he now has TWO movies in the last two weeks with a grand total of approximately 400 million dollars world wide!! Impressive!! McKellen comes full circle with Magneto and really uses his powers a lot. He is at the head of one side of the war and he is a powerful adversary. No one could do this role better. Rebecca Romijn, and James Marsden both return briefly in smaller roles which is unfortunate. Marsden I think has got a bum rap from day one in this series as Cyclops. He should have always had a bigger role and was good in his role. He was barely existent in this installment. Romijn's excellent, sexy villain Mystique has always been great and in the second one she had an even bigger role but she is quickly neutralized in this one. Patrick Stewart also returns as Charles Xavier and no one could do better than him either. Him and McKellen have a great chemistry and he is a fantastic leader. He always seems to become indisposed in some way though in every film. All these changes...mutations to the story if you will...are all to make way for the new breed of mutants. Kelsey Grammar takes the lead of the new group as The Beast. Diplomat, and as it turns out great fighter. Grammar is well cast and looks fantastic in his blue get up. When he finally starts to fight...well it's just damn cool. Shawn Ashmore gets a much bigger role as The Iceman. He's almost the biggest hero in the film at this point. Ashmore is one worth watching because I think he's got a big career ahead of him and his character is great. Aaron Stanford is Iceman's former friend and his opposite...Pyro. Their building conflict comes head to head finally in a one on one battle worth seeing. Vinnie Jones is a good addition as Juggernaut. I don't mean to take anything away from his performance but that character seems almost too forced onto the story, like they had to add him. Ben Foster, Ellen Page, Daniel Cudmore, all play new mutants with smaller roles in this sequel.If nothing else X-Men: The Last Stand doesn't need any more cast additions. They could easily make new films on these new characters because they've successfully weaned out the old ones or killed them off. Like the rest of the series the story is so vitally important and Ratner definitely doesn't take that for granted. But like the second sequel the action is significantly lower than what the original offered. It almost felt slow at times despite how good the story is. Perhaps there was just too many characters?? Nonetheless the last half hour or more of the film when the final war (The Last Stand) takes place is just awesome, a battle worthy of a final showdown. It felt epic, it looked epic, it was blockbuster material!! The one great thing about the series is it has definitely not gotten worse...it doesn't overly improve but it builds on itself and stays consistent even through a change of director. I hope there is more to come in this series or with the spin offs because they are absolutely a unique and interesting take on the action/Superhero genre. If you love that genre, you must see the X-Men trilogy!! 8/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
48,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Does nothing the other two didn't do, but is quite good fun all the same",7,13 July 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Cyclops are still struggling to come to terms with the loss of Dr Jane Grey (Famke Jannsen) who died at the end of the last film and was the love of both their lives. But strange dreams force Cyclops to travel to a lakeside retreat where he's been hearing her voice in his dreams. The good doctor has been resurrected- but her presence is about to be exploited by both the forces of good and evil. Meanwhile, a 'cure' has been discovered for the mutant 'disease.' While the forces of Dr Xavier (Patrick Stewart) try to downplay the cure by civilized means, it is cause for the forces of Magneto (Ian McKellen) to resort to their militant means and it draws the forces of good and evil into the ultimate confrontation.As I said in my OLS above, there is ultimately little to see here that you wouldn't have seen in the first two films, that is to say that if you liked them you will probably like this too. Brett Ratner handles his directing duties well, moving things along as well as the first film's director Bryan Singer, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen remain well cast as the old time adversaries, as well as having a lively and colourful supporting cast and things really heat up at the end with a spectacular battle that splits the Golden Gate bridge in two. But it's too easy to sympathize with the villain and thus not feel prepped up for the good guys to serve his comeuppance.As others have said, the title implies that this is going to be the last film in the series. It's always best to go out at three, which I hope this fairly superior comic book series does. ***",X-Men - The Last Stand

It feels like it was rushed into, and through ,production simply to cash-in on the franchise's success, with little thought given to the status of the screenplay. Still, it has some good moments sprinkled throughout and a tight enough pace that it's never boring. It definitely isn't as bad as some would have you believe. It's just disappointing, given that the prior title had bucked the trend of sequels never being as good as the first. This one just cemented the fact that the third is usually the worst. 6/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
50,bowmanblue,The whole is NOT better than the sum of its parts,7,12 May 2014,"Amazingly, X-men 2 - being the sequel - actually surpassed the original. It was longer, fleshed out the better characters a bit more and generally improved on the original. People awaited the conclusion of the trilogy with baited breath. Then came the news that the behind-the-scenes staff were not happy. Bryan Singer left. Other directors came and went, as did other crewmembers and X3 limped onto the stage trying to convince us that all was still well with the franchise.To be fair - it's okay. The action is good, as is the special effects. However, overall it seems like a backwards step for the story. It's quite short (just over an hour and a half) - nothing wrong with that, apart from the fact that it's X-men and the clue's in the name. The X-men is about multiple characters and, when turning it into a film, you have to try and cram as many of them in as possible. You can't please everyone. There will always be some left out (""Where's Gambit?"" many cried before he showed up later in Wolverine's own film). However, there are still too many to really care about. Characters - good and bad - come on screen for one or two scenes and that's all we get of them.Old favourites Wolverine, Professor X and Magneto get the most screen time and do their best to try and hold things together. But none of their characters are pushed forwards in terms of development. Wolverine has some cool fight scenes. Magneto shows his dastardly side with a brilliant scene involving the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and X reminds us of the X-men's overall message.But these are just scenes. They're all good, but they're interspersed with second-rate, under-developed characters taking up screen time just so the producers can say, ""See, look, there's Collossus!"" It's a fun action film, but, after X2, just leaves you thinking it's not much of an improvement (incidentally the same thing I said about Terminator 3's relationship to T2).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",X-Men - The Last Stand
51,ThomasDrufke,Nearly Killed the Franchise,4,23 February 2017,"Every franchise has a low point. For some it's a scene or maybe a full act of a film. For the X-Men series, it's The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. After two acclaimed outings to kick off the new age of the superhero genre, The Last Stand is just about as goofy and messy as you can get. It nearly killed the franchise.The reason comic fans are still yearning for a Dark Phoenix adaptation is because this film did a poor job of giving fans anything that closely resembles the classic storyline. In fact, what makes it even worse is it's hardly an adaptation at all. The first chunk of the movie certainly seems to indicate a Dark Phoenix direction, but once she has a big showdown with Charles Xavier in her childhood home, it becomes a movie way more about the cure than Jean Grey. It also doesn't help that Jean Grey's phoenix alter ego resembles another absolutely insane Famke Janssen villain, Xenia Onatopp. Yes, she also turns to an intimate make out position in an attempt to kill a few of her victims. Really, Brett Ratner?Ratner gets a bad rap for The Last Stand, and most of it is warranted. But there are some redeemable qualities to this film. Plus, he did inherit the directing duties pretty late in the game (after Bryan Singer left a few weeks before production began because of Superman Returns). Although it still doesn't feel necessary at all, I definitely felt an emotional impact when Charles died and Wolverine killed Jean. The way those particular scenes were directed and shot made for an emotionally resonant few scenes. The action is also amped up a bit. Rightfully so, the first two films keep the action to a minimum and instead focus on story as the backbone. The Last Stand tends to do the opposite, hence another reason for the film's failure.As with pretty much every other X-Men related film, there's no sense of continuity whatsoever. Whether it's the appearance of Moira MacTaggart or Bolivar Trask, the bad CGI used for young Charles and Erik, or the horrendous attempt at Angel as a character, The Last Stand gets a lot wrong. The grounded tone from the first two films is gone entirely. Why the heck is Juggernaut running around acting like he's from the 60's Batman TV series? Why does Pyro act like he's a worthy right hand man to Magneto? I think the questions raised here still frustrate me to this day. This could have been one of the best superhero trilogies but instead The Last Stand tries its hardest to tarnish any reputation the first few built. There are a few moments of classic X-Men joy, but it's really a bunch of nonsense for the most part.+Some emotional moments hit-Tone is all over the place-Continuity issues galore-Was this an attempt at a Dark Phoenix saga?-Everything feels rushed4.4/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
52,MLDinTN,"If this is the best sequel that the writers can come up with,,,",5,7 May 2007,"then please don't make another one. The third sequel pales in comparison to the first two films. The first X-men was fantastic. The second was pretty good, but not as good, and the third is a real let down. Gone are the cool action scenes and story lines involving Wolverine and Rogue. And for a movie that was supposed to center around the Phoenix/Jean Grey, she did not have much involvement through out the film. At the big fight at the end of the film, she just stands there most of the time. It was cool to see some new mutants, but lack of character and plot development did not do a lot for the film. Mystique had a good role while it lasted. Magneto did some cool things with smashing cars and moving a bridge. But I still don't get why the X-men wanted to stop Magneto from destroying the cure. It seems they would not want the government to force cures on mutants. Plus, what happened to the boy who could cure at the end. We see Kittie leading him out of the prison and that's it.I'm very glad I didn't see this in the theater now. The plot was totally lacking and didn't make good sense. The movie was just no where near as entertaining and fun to watch.FINAL VERDICT: If you want to see the continuation of the X-men series, you may want to check this out.

53,g-bodyl,A Grand Finale!,9,5 March 2012,"X-Men:The Last Stand is an almost perfect movie to the end of the original X-Men trilogy.

This movie actually had emotional qualities and that was unexpected.In The Last Stand, a cure for mutation has been found. Magneto wants to use the cure for his own cause for mutant domination and the government has a plan that all mutants be cured. It's up to the X-Men to save the world.The acting is pretty strong. Hugh Jackman delivers another great performance and Halle Berry as Storm has a bigger role this time around. Ian McKellan is still sinister as Magneto.Overall, this is a fun superhero movie that closes out a great trilogy. This movie has plenty of action, comedy, and heartfelt emotions.

Jean miraculously appears in front of Scott. After being told that it is OK to let Jean see his eyes, they engage in a kiss, but Jean can't control her alter-ego, which is Phoenix. A cure is finally found for mutants, enraging some of the mutants in the process. When Charles Xavier tries to help Jean control the Phoenix, Charles is killed. Magneto takes advantage and it's up to the X-men to save the day againI haven't read the comics at all, so I'm not overly knowledgeable about X-Men. I'm a big fan of the first two movies though. It's not like I hated this sequel or anything, It's just extremely blasé and half-assed. There were so many story elements at play here and they failed to do anything riveting with any of them. It's been a long time since I've seen some drop the ball like they did with this sequel. It started off exceptionally. It was intense and emotional. Everything Bryan Singer did with the first two movies is noticeably absent here. Singer knew how to properly build things up and give us jaw dropping action as well. I don't buy into the excuse that the running time was too short. Singer had about the same amount of time in the first X-Men movie and he did a lot of terrific things with it. Brett Ratner's shoddy direction shows in this one. It lacks efficient tension when it should be filled to the brim with it. Jean Grey's storyline is the heart of this movie and I felt barely anything for her. It wasn't Famke Janssen's fault, but that's what happens when you have to deal with mediocre writing. With The Pheonix being so tantalizing, they should have knocked my socks off with The Phoenix. It's what I deserved, but more importantly, it's what X-Men fans deserved more than anything else. I didn't care for the injection of new blood either. I'm all for new blood, as long as I have a reason to care about the new characters. Juggernaut was absolutely laughable. Vinnie Jones looked foolish in the role. Ellen Paige tries her best, but I wasn't all that interested in her portrayal. Kelsey Grammar is a bit embarrassing as Hank McCoy. Even Hugh Jackman seems subdued in this movie. Also, could Charles's death be any more anti-climatic? I just sat there emotionless. They even managed to mess up the cure storyline. That was another missed opportunity. Final Thoughts: This had all the ingredients to be something special. This one is sorely lacking Bryan Singer's creative vision. As far as a movie is concerned, it's fairly enjoyable. As a follow-up to two great movies, it stinks. I'm not saying it's void of entertainment, far from it. I just thought they p****sed all over a potentially dynamite sequel. What a waste6/10",X-Men - The Last Stand

58,tabuno,Enjoyable But Lacking Depth,7,22 January 2019,"29 May 2006. This third installment while enjoyable as summer action-thriller entertainment lacks the emotional, dramatic, and empathic, psychological compelling storyline. The characters are not given much opportunity to develop the critical possibilities that this storyline could have tapped into. Magneto had the best emotional conflict on display while the rest of the characters were only given lines that scratched the surface. The special effects, the pacing, the action were riveting. Unlike the earlier two X-Men movies, the inner haunting conflicts were submerged while the action took on a more prominent role. The demise of several major characters follows the script that the television series 24 took this past year substituting dramatic personal disaster in lieu of the more subtle, difficult personal turmoil of more qualitatively satisfying movies that even Spiderman movie scripts contained. Nevertheless, this most recent X-Men provide the typical clash between good and evil with man in the middle with reasonably satisfying results. Seven out of Ten Stars.",X-Men - The Last Stand

60,The-Sarkologist,The Final Installment,6,27 January 2012,"This is the conclusion of the X-men Trilogy, and since the release of this film the focus has shifted to prequel movies, such as Wolverine and First Class. There are rumours that a sequel to First Class is in the works, and a sequel to Wolverine is in production (due for release in 2013) where Wolverine goes to Japan. However that is a bit of a tangent. In the film we are introduced to Beast, a heavily mutated human which the qualities of an orangutan (and it is rather amusing to see him refer to Wolverine as a boy when we discover, later, that he fought in the American Civil War, and I believe in the first film it is suggested that it is impossible to know how old he really is due to his ability to regenerate, and also that he has lost his memory).This film is based on two story arcs from the comics, Dark Phoenix Rising and Gifted (which was written by Buffy and Firefly creator Joss Wheldon). This first story arc is about how Jean Grey is overwhelmed by her telekinetic and telepathic ability, while the second is about how a cure to the mutation is discovered. It should be noted that by referring to the comic books, Brett Ratner said that there were over 40 years of stories that could be adapted to the big screen, though it is a shame that a number of the main characters (Cyclops, Sabretooth, and Toad) are all dead.This film starts sometime after the end of the second film, and Wolverine has been co-opted to assist in the school since Cyclops has fallen into a fit of depression. However, after hearing voices that suggest that Jean is not dead, he travels to Northern Canada, and does not return. After a psychic alarm is triggered, Xavier sends Wolverine and Storm off to Northern Canada where they discovered Cyclops' glasses and an unconscious Jean, however no Cyclops. It is quickly discovered that Jean did not die when the water collapsed onto her, and that the event has triggered a number of latent abilities, and not only does she become more powerful, but she embraces that power, and leaves the X-men to join Magneto's brotherhood of Mutants.Magneto is traveling about looking to regroup his Brotherhood, and begins to approach a number of mutants who have not joined Xavier's school. It is here that we learn that the mutants are organised into classes, with one being the lowest and five being the highest. Most of the main cast are rated as four, and I suspect that it does not necessarily relate to their powers, but their ability to control their powers. Magneto's power is so great that he is able to move the Golden Gate Bridge, while Storm not only has the power to manipulate the weather, but she can also fly, and shoot lightning bolts from her hands. Wolverine has the claws and the ability to regenerate (the adamantium skeleton was added later).There are a few continuity issues in the film compared with First Class. The film opens with Xavier walking into Jean Gray's house with Magneto. In First Class, Xavier was able to walk, but also had a full head of hair. Further, when Xavier and Magneto were still allies, they had not actually met Jean Gray, but it is suggested that it happens later. However, it can be difficult to to try to remain consistent, and we note that since they once again recast Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in first class (though he only makes a cameo) it is suggested that they are trying to maintain continuity. Personally I feel that these films are pretty good, and it would be good to try to maintain continuity, however it may be necessary to redo a couple of the scenes (and as entertainment slowly moves in the direction of internet streaming, this may become possible).",X-Men - The Last Stand

62,slightlymad22,Enjoyable But.....,7,21 November 2014,"X-Men: The Last Stand is the weakest of the original trilogy. All the heart and character development from the previous movies is gone, and it's replaces with more effects, explosions and action scenes. But it's still an entertaining flick, it just won't be the X-Men movie I rush to watch again. Plot In A Paragraph: It has been several months since the events at the end of the second movie, Scott Summers (Cyclops) is having a hard time and is grieving about the loss of Jean Grey. Meanwhile, the rift between humans and mutants has finally reached the boiling point. Humans have discovered what causes humans to mutate and have found a cure for the mutation. When news about the cure comes to Magneto, he decides to organise an army of mutants and wage war against the humans. If I thought James Marsden's Cyclops was under used in the last movie, it's worse here. Halle Berry is given more to do than in the previous movie and I'm sure it's more in relation to her having an Oscar (Monsters Ball) than a Razzie (Catwoman). Rebecca Romijn isn't given as much to do here as one would hope likewise Patrick Stewarts screen time is all too brief. It's nice to see Bill Duke (Predator/Commando) in a movie again, but Ian McKellen over acts an awful amount and (I hate to say) he is hamming it up to almost pantomime villain level and Famke Jenssen is certainly no Sally Field when it comes to playing someone with multiple personalities. Kelsey Grammar is a welcome addition to the franchise, as is Ellen Page. Sadly the same can't be said for Vinnie Jones. It's Hugh Jackman who is the movies saving grace and along with (Grammer and Page) the main reason I made it all the way through!! The movie got better every time he is on the screen.

67,tomgillespie2002,"Careless, scattershot and insulting to its fans",4,27 May 2014,"Back in 2006, it seemed like Brett Ratner's third instalment of the X- Men saga was a textbook way to kill a lucrative franchise. The Last Stand kept the satirical undertones of the previous two, and even introduced some new, interesting ones. It also had the biggest set- pieces yet, climaxing in a mutant brawl on Alcatraz that pits the saga's big bad Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his army of cronies against an earnest and inexperienced X-Men led by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry). However, gone was the love injected into the franchise by Bryan Singer, and gone was any form of coherency and care. But it seems that The Last Stand was not the franchise-killer many envisioned, and, now that Days of Future Past (2014) has apparently eradicated it from the time-line, it is little but a dark blip in an overall successful series of movies.Horrified by the announcement of a new mutant 'cure', developed from a power-draining mutant child named Jimmy (Cameron Bright), Magneto reforms his Brotherhood of Mutants and sets out kill the boy. Sensing trouble brewing, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) enlists the help of former student and current Secretary of Mutant Affairs for the U.S. Cabinet Dr. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar), also known as Beast. After disappearing at the end of the previous film, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) resurfaces but re-born as the Phoenix, a mutant fuelled by rage and unbelievable power. When Xavier fails to subdue her mind, Jean allies herself with Magneto, whose army is growing steadily stronger.The X-Men movies have always succeeded in channelling larger issues such as segregation and racism through the eternal battle between mutants and humans, and if The Last Stand is successful at anything at all, it's in bringing to mind the many differences people are born with, and how these 'afflictions' damage their ability to fit into regular society. Naturally, the issue will divide those affected into those who have fully accepted and embrace how they were born, and those who are eager to slot nicely into the mainstream. The cure offered in the movie also comes with a choice. Magneto sees this as an affront to mutants, who he feels are the next natural step in evolution. Yet Rogue (Anna Paquin), cursed with being unable to come into human contact with anyone, sees it as a way to finally end her pain.But this is not enough to save The Last Stand from being a complete mess. The two previous movies managed to keep enough of a hold on it's massive ensemble to still tell a decent story. The Last Stand introduces a ridiculous amount of new mutants, from the impressive but little-seen Angel (Ben Foster), whose screen-time betrays his position on the poster, to the ridiculous abomination that is Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), a wafer-thin villain whose induces cringing every time he opens his mouth. The plot is little more than a way to get the goodies fighting the baddies, and lazy plot-holes and inexplicable tactics on both sides riddle what is an incredibly dull and simplistic climax.The development of Jean Grey into Phoenix, one of the key X-Men plot threads beloved to fans, admittedly allows for the odd visually spectacular set-piece, but on the whole is a massive let-down. Janssen is perfectly fine in the role, convincing as a seductive yet extremely dangerous mutant capable of God-like powers, but is seriously underwritten. And it's this aspect that really sums up The Last Stand - careless, scattershot, and insulting to its loyal fans. It seems to care far more about how much money the movie can put into it's wallet than creating anything of artistic merit. As said before, the film is such a mess that Bryan Singer had to find a way to quite rightly delete it from the X-Men timeline, and that sums up this pap better than I could ever dream of.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",X-Men - The Last Stand

Hugh Jackman made again a really great interpretation, for one more time the interpretations of Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart were exceptional.Finally I really recommend this movie because of all the above reasons and because it's a movie with many nice visual and special effects which give us a really nice feeling about this movie and makes it more interesting.",X-Men - The Last Stand
69,Dr_Coulardeau,Peace at last,8,21 October 2008,"The third act of this tragedy or drama is this time bringing the fight within the mutant community. The President of the USA, with his Secretary to Mutant Affairs who is not even informed, let alone associated, to the President's decisions on such a matter, has paid for the invention or devising of a special genetic vaccine to ""cure"" the mutants of their mutant-ness. This gives the opportunity to the bad mutants to gather some groups and even crowds and to start some terrorist action against this cure in the name that mutant-ness is not a disease. The final battle in order to destroy the research center that devised the ""cure"" and the scientist who is behind the discovery is spectacular with a bridge rotated in order to tie up San Francisco to Alcatraz by way of the Golden Gate Bridge. This time the battle will bring the bad mutants down once and for all. The leader of them, a certain Magneto, will be injected four doses of the ""cure"", the winged son of the President of the USA will save the scientist, and Wolverine, the man with metal bones and claws on his hands will get rid of the too famous Jean who had gone wild and evil after her resurrection from the water catastrophe in the previous film. Then peace and safety are finally assured and men and mutants can live happily together thereafter and have many children. Such films are definitely naive as for the meaning but they are saved by the special effects and are entertaining after all. We could of course compare this trilogy with the Aliens first three films, or with the Terminator trilogy, or the two Star Wars trilogies. We would always find somewhere the belief that the future is not so grim as it may look and that good will always get over evil. Then the differences are in the surviving or winning models. From the Genesis or Ragnarok model of Terminator, to the bi-partisan peace of this X-Men trilogy, to the never ending resurrection of the Aliens in the Aliens series, to the democratic victory of the two Star Wars trilogies, we can write volumes on the persistence and return of such ideological, supposedly religious or philosophical models, but the best novel ever written on that subject remains Stephen King's The Stand.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",X-Men - The Last Stand
70,Floated2,A step back from its predecessors,4,6 December 2017,"X-Men: The Last Stand is the third film of the X-Men series and has been routinely criticized and panned somewhat in comparison to the two previous X-Men films, and deservingly so. Having seen this film only once when it was released and having little memory of what occurred, a more in depth rewatch was in need. The film's tone was noticeable different, being more over the top, silly and more comedic in some one-liner dialogue and overall tone as it feels like it was more watered down for children. This is perhaps more due to a director change with Brett Ratner directing The Last Stand, in comparison to Bryan Singer directing the first two films. X-Men: The Last Stand doesn't fully live up to the hype for several reasons. The plot is less thickened and more messy and rushed as to where many characters don't feel as fully developed. A few too many subplots are brought in. Also the film went out and killed main characters (Cyclops- very beginning, Charles Xavier- midway, Jean Grey- ending) giving more screen time to some of the lesser uninteresting characters. Halle Berry as Storm feels miscast as her role is larger and the character is more annoying, whinny, grumpy and overall there to lead (which isn't a great thing). Anna Paquin is still there as her role is more reduced than the previous films where Ellen Page comes in and takes up some of her screen time, setting a somewhat love triangle between them and Shawn Ashmore. Mystique is also reduced as she is there briefly and made out to be a human, once injected with the ""cure""- which was a waste of her appearance. What worked in X2 isn't here for the Last Stand such as Nightcrawler who was great, where they replaced him with Beast (a large part of the film) and Angel (Ben Foster).The action is still there but the film isn't as clever and interesting and entertaining. The end finale scene with Magneto and his crew coming together battling the other mutants by the Golden Gate was well done as the action there was fulfilled. There are still some moments of entertainment and the special effects and visuals are very nice (which was one of the main highlights). Though in comparison to X- Men (2000) and X2, The Last Stand as a film is a disappointment and let down, as one can see after watching the film directly after the previous two films,.",X-Men - The Last Stand
71,filipemanuelneto,It could have been better.,6,6 October 2020,"I am not very used to films that have characters from the comic book universe as their theme, but the quality and impact that some have had makes them a mandatory visit. So, even without knowing much about the characters or their fictional stories, I decided to watch the X-Men franchise films. This decision was followed by some reading about the characters and the films. I tried to follow more or less the chronological sequence of events starting with the prequels and continuing, in order to better understand what I was seeing. So this film, which was the third in the franchise, was the fifth film I saw.In this film, we see the US government's attempt to administer a cure to mutants. In addition to the fact that the issue is clearly fracturing among the mutant community (if some accept the idea of becoming normal, others consider it insulting), its quite evident that the Government has an interest in massively administering it. As usual, Charles Xavier defends the diplomatic approach to the problem, while Magneto sees that as another aggression by the ""homo sapiens"". Jean Gray will join him, of her own free will, after gaining new life through her dark side, Phoenix.This is the third film in the franchise and gives a logical continuation to the story started earlier. However, I felt that its a much less coherent and uniform film than their predecessors, as the story told has a lot of good points and some frankly bad points that I cannot forgive. I liked the dense and dark way in which everything develops and how the climax is gradually built. Its a film that feels more epic, like someone who really wants to be taken seriously: there are not many humorous notes in the dialogues and the only romance that matters is Wolverine's passion for Jean, as it ends badly. On the negative side, the pace is much faster, with some sequences that I felt were in a running pace. There are many new characters but most are not relevant to the story and have only been added to appear once or twice. And there are several situations that make the most receptive viewer raise an eyebrow in disbelief: for me the most unlikely point was Jean Gray's ""resurrection"" and the way she becomes a fearsome villain. This was something I just didn't swallow.The cast is massively inherited from previous films and is composed of great actors. Most, therefore, are already familiar with the characters. However, there is a big drop in the quality of the cast's overall work. This can only be a consequence of the bad work of the writers, Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, Rebecca Romijn and Sir Ian McKellen got along well with what they were given and the work of each of them was important for the quality of the film. Kelsey Grammar was excellent as Beast and Ellen Page shone in the role of Kitty; Shawn Ashmore and Aaron Stanford are excellent together but average when separated; Anna Paquin did what she could but is uncomfortable in the fight scenes; Halle Berry is very tasteless and uninteresting; Vinnie Jones is an idiot brute; Ben Foster and Daniel Cudmore don't have time to do anything.In addition to these merits, the film has excellent production values that should be highlighted. It is a Marvel film and there are huge millions of dollars involved, which is quite evident from the beginning. Visually it is a show in itself, with great visual effects and the best CGI that money could buy. The scenes and action sequences are great, but when you overdo the effects, things tend to become unbelievable, as if you were watching a video game. This is quite clear in the final sequence, in Alcatraz. As in the first film, the film maintains excellent sets and costumes. Cinematography is good and uses color and shadow well to make the film darker. The editing work was decent, but uneven and the pace of the film is sometimes quite fast. I think it is fair to also greet the makeup department and the soundtrack by John Powell, very well done.",X-Men - The Last Stand
72,leplatypus,X-men 3: the last stand ..... in the comic-shop for a good adaptation...,1,10 June 2006,"X-men is a comics book, so the visual is essential to the ""brand"".I felt it in X1 (perfect), not in X2 (a failure for me), and X3 is in the middle: some respectful & worthy moments (a sentinel in a Terminator beginning, added characters like Colossus, Shadowcat, the eternal Wolverine, the Golden Gate) but the list falls short with a lot of flat sequences: the house battle, the forest hiding, the final battle... Well, any talented artist could have done it better in a book!!! The story supports the same vision: some interesting plots: the underlying political & discrimination thematic, the no-mutation mutant, but we find also some silly stories: the lake with Cyclops and the stupid killing of Phoenix... Why wolverine doesn't use the anti-mutation serum on her in the same way he did on Magneto a few minutes before? In conclusion, give the script to the original authors, give the camera to the artists, and goddammit give us a real X-men! Sin city is a success, because the easy formula has been used: Just take a existent story & film each panel with dedication.... No more interpretation or originality by people who aren't fans....",X-Men - The Last Stand
73,TheMovieDiorama,X-Men: The Last Stand is a mess of juggernaut proportions.,5,28 December 2018,"""Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut..."". Well, not exactly the disaster that everyone harks on about, but still a substantial step down from the excellent 'X2'. Franchise fatigue? Nonsense. Plenty of good 'X-Men' stories to be adapted. The removal of Singer, who is replaced by Ratner, only makes the latter's mediocrity shine through even more so. Thus, concluding the trilogy on a low note. Jean Grey is resurrected as Dark Phoenix and is unable to control her formidable powers. There's also a ""cure"" available for mutants to remove their powers, where Magneto wants to use Dark Phoenix to rid ""homosapiens"". A predictably bland father/son crisis between Angel and his dad, who happens to be the individual to manufacture the cure. Not one, but two crucial characters get vaporised. Rogue is still going through puberty and having boyfriend troubles. Juggernaut smashes walls...Mystique is no more...yeah. It's an unfocused mess. The Dark Phoenix arc is arguably the more interesting plot, involving all of the X-Men with themes of love and loss. Unfortunately Ratner chooses to put the whole ""cure"" plot at the forefront, as he attempts to put his own argument into the mutant/human war. Problem is, it's been done before. Twice. We know where each character stands. We know their ideologies and motives. We wanted Dark Phoenix, we got a Dark Pigeon instead. The performances were all good, consistent as always. McKellen's Magneto gets a generous amount of screentime, who is irrefutably the best character. The increased action was somewhat mindless and messy, but was entertaining to watch. Except the monotonous third act, where Ratner unleashes his inner Michael Bay as flaming cars rain down on Alcatraz. The visual effects were decent, particularly the Golden Gate Bridge scene, and the narrative's pacing was perfectly fine. It just doesn't know what story it wants to tell. The character development had been substituted for frantic action and plots rarely intertwine. Resulting in a forgettable superhero flick. 'X-Men: The First Mess'.",X-Men - The Last Stand
74,digitalbeachbum,Junk,1,9 August 2021,This is another cash cow by Marvel to make some quick money. Never mind putting any effort in to making a good script or getting a good director. Let's just pump out what ever BS that we can as quickly as possible.Quality should never take a backseat to quantity when making movies.,X-Men - The Last Stand
75,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Grade ""A"" superhero action but sacrifices too much for it",6,13 February 2009,"If an alarm didn't go off in many people's heads when ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" director Bryan Singer left the third X-Men project for ""Superman Returns"" and ""Rush Hour"" director Brett Ratner was hired in his place, it should have. While a lot of the fault for lauders of this movie can be put on writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn for letting the script get way too out of hand, Ratner lets this film become what Singer would have never let it: about the plot and the action and not the characters.""X-Men: The Last Stand"" takes place not long after ""X2"" at the announcement that Worthington Labs has developed what they call a ""cure"" for the Mutant X gene. Naturally, this upsets both schools of thought: Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) human and mutant cooperation/coexistence and Magneto's (Ian McKellen) mutants are superior and should embrace their abilities to the fullest at the expense of humans. Magneto uses the cure as a symbolic way to rally mutants for his cause and to take immediate action while Xavier takes the cautious and civilized approach.There's a lot more to the plot than this, but to describe all these subplots would require too much effort. That's the point: there's too much going on and while it makes sense, that doesn't mean it plays out well into a 100 minute movie. Take for instance Magneto's right- hand woman Mystique (Rebecca Romijn). She is imprisoned in a dangerous mutant transport vehicle and in the scene after Magneto discovers a way to get her back. Maybe 20 minutes and some major scenes later, we finally get back to the truck and Magneto's plot to get her back. If consecutive scenes like that have to be split up to make way for all this other material, it should be a red flag that this movie is overloaded. It might all make sense, but it inflicts serious damage on character development and themes.Another serious misstep in this script is the addition of too many characters. Singer would never have brought so many new characters in. There's Beast (Kelsey Grammar) as U.S. Secretary of Mutant Affairs, Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Warren Worthington III (Ben Foster) and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore, who did make a brief appearance in X2) all on the good side alone. That's absurd. Plus, Halle Berry, who plays Storm, requested a bigger role in the film, so she gets more attention in addition to the other characters from the first two films that we're already familiar with. You simply can't expect your viewer to invest emotion let alone believe in the characters with all those names to follow. ***Slight SPOILERS*** With people dying like it's their job in this film, it's not all that helpful when we're not moved by it. One tip might be not killing so many characters before the climax of the film. There's a reason people usually die at the end of movies.Sure, the characters all aid the plot in some way, but that's just plot. Characters need to exist to be developed or minute enough to move the plot but not generate interest. Some characters (a lot of the bad guys) do just exist to be cool, but too many exist in this limbo area of seeming important but really just moving the plot.Another problem with the script is dialog. You know the fast-paced action movie cliché of ending scenes with one-liners? Yeah, ""X3"" does it a lot. The President says some really awful lines and even the great Sir Ian McKellen can't deliver all of his lines in believable and not cheesy fashion. Plus, many of the lines are squeezed in to service the plot or enlighten the audience to something they may not know. Another sign that you should stop writing a movie like this is when you have to force people to say lines just to create comprehension.All that badmouthing aside, this is a visually stunning movie. The action is top-notch and the special effects are unlike anything you've seen in this decade. That alone makes this valiant attempt to pack all this into a movie worth price of admission and 100 minutes of time. While it might have been more appropriately done in 120+ minutes, it keeps your attention and moves quick, almost enough to overlook the flaws. For people who can step back and see what the writers tried to do as opposed to how they did it, you have to give them credit for a good idea. It's just the execution and Ratner's inability to keep humor out of things even when it's not necessary. Singer didn't care if you laughed but the writers and Ratner clearly believed it was part of the action movie experience. So there is a letdown factor for those that loved Singer's work with the franchise, but for everyone else, this is high in entertainment value.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I thought they dealt with his demise too easily in the final battle, and that in general the ending feels anti-climactic. I didn't feel that it was real for some reason when they were moving the Golden Gate Bridge.... it was just a little too elaborate an effect to feel real. A lot of the dimensions that were in the characters in the earlier film (I didn't see X2) are missing as well.Kelsey Grammar acquits himself well as the blue beast.

78,lisafordeay,Not the best of the franchise but still its a lot of fun to watch,6,4 September 2015,X Men The Last Stand is the final X Men movie of the franchise before it got rebooted. This one is about a cure that could heal mutants and turn them back into normal again. Of course we find out that Jean Grey is still alive and is now evil as she killed Cyclops(James Marsden)in the first 30 minutes of this film and later Professor X(Patrick Stewart). So its up to the rest of the X Men mutants to save mankind and to stop the cure that could get rid of there powers. Bottom line there isn't really anything to say about this film. The effects are better than the first one which was so CGI. The acting is all 3 of these films are very good like I always loved Hugh Jackman. In fact his my celebrity crush. As for the rest of the actors they are all very good too. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't much of Mystique this time around as she finally got normal as she got zapped by a gun with the cure formula inside and now she is a darked haired beauty now(Rebecca Romijn). With a new director(the man that brought you Superman Returns)and a new composer(who did How To Train Your Dragon). This one was pretty much.....OK. Not the best like I said but if you love X Men then check it out.Also surprise surprise Stan Lee makes a cameo in the beginning of the film.,X-Men - The Last Stand
79,FiendishDramaturgy,"Bottom Line? This Isn't Fantastic, But Neither Is It Terrible.",7,31 May 2006,"THIS REVIEW IS FULL OF SPOILERS!With a $210MUS budget compared to $110MUS for the 2nd and $75MUS for the first, I don't know why I expected more substance. The money obviously went for the effects, but I would not go so far as to say (as have many reviewers of this work) that the action overshadowed the characters. To an extent, that is true, but only to an extent.The action was great, and the character development was nonexistent, but in all fairness, the characters (for the most part) were previously developed, which precluded a need for extensive work in that area. What DID upset the Fiend was the long, laborious, and desperate contractual wrangling performed by Hale Berry. She saw to it that the entire movie was aimed at her character, was paid a ridiculous sum, and held out for a better script which would allow herself more screen time. The result? A lackluster performance dialed in by Berry, Xavier is killed to afford her screen time, and the more interesting characters were left on the sidelines.The action did not override the characters. Berry's contract did.The new X-Men looked wonderful, but the failure to give character exposition did little in the way of fostering love with the audience members. Angel was beautiful and, while he was only touched upon, that was more treatment than the other new additions received.Frankly, the casting of Kelsey Grammar made me stop and say, WHAT? But my misgivings were apparently unfounded, as he managed to wrangle a great performance from behind a cold, calculating, shroud of ineptitude woven by the would-be director. Beast shone through, and no amount of sidebar inadequacies could shake him from it. The makeup artistry did not hurt, either. He was huge. He was hairy. He was blue. He was irascible. He had a human heart. He WAS Beast! NICE JOB, Kelsey! I won't underestimate you next time. NOTE TO Bryan Singer: I hate that you did not continue to finish this series of works. You are an unfaithful lover, who has broken trust with your fans. Will you bail on the Superman franchise when the next ""new"" franchise is introduced? Will you disappoint your fans like this AGAIN? Once a lover strays, they continue to do so until they are bitten. Unfortunately for them, by the time they realize the meaning of faith, no one else will trust them. It might serve you well to learn that now, rather than after it is too late.The Phoenix storyline I had greatly anticipated, was left to the comic books. This work was more geared to the Dark Phoenix saga, which meant a fast forwarding into a whole new X-Men sub-genre. I said it was ""geared to"" the Dark Phoenix saga, because it certainly was not THE Dark Phoenix saga. There were no aliens, there was no Apocalypto to bring us the ""cure,"" which wasn't a cure but a poison. There was only Jean Grey, and her inability to control the more dangerous aspects of her gift, and no storyline concerning the Phoenix Herself. None whatsoever. That, in itself, is enough to make fans of the comic book series (You know, those little books upon which this was supposed to be based? Those comic books?) detest the film.There WERE deaths. Or were there? We never saw Scott's body, and the ""bonus scene"" shown at the back end of the ending credits clearly gave us Xavier's voice emanating from the mouth of the man who was born without a consciousness. The ""cure"" turns out to be more of a ""fix"" (disregarding the debate concerning whether mutants need to be cured or not), and is not as permanent as we were led to believe, as Magneto's powers appeared in the final scene to be returning; however minutely.That final scene, along with the bonus scene, indicates to me that there are, indeed, plans to go on with this franchise. If not, this entire movie was a waste of film, leading to nowhere. If so, they have broken my trust in their original claim to make the trilogy, and then stop. For this to be the ""final chapter"" of the X-Men saga, it neither felt finished, nor WAS finished. It is completely open-ended. This was NOT the way to finish off a popular franchise.Oh, and just in case you were wondering? There was STILL no sign of Gambit.That brings us to the last. Is this movie entertaining? In spite of everything, I have to admit that I WAS entertained. While this work lacked any and all shreds of substance we came to expect from the X-Men franchise, it was still ... fun. I highly enjoyed the BlockBuster-y KABOOM factor of this work. But directors like Ratner need to learn that you can't replace style and substance with noise and effects, and expect serious fans to love it.It rates a 6.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",X-Men - The Last Stand
80,elshikh4,"Why it is The ""Last"" Anyway ?!",7,31 January 2010,"I remember, in 2002, checking (Bryan Singer)'s page on IMDb, to read about futuristic pre-production projects like X Men 3 and X Men 4. Then, after 4 whole years I knew that (Singer) left, with nearly all the technical team of the first 2 X Men movies, to make Superman Returns. Furthermore, they made the third installment of X-Men already with another director, new technical team, and a pressing - incomprehensible - desire to terminate the X Men's cinematic series!The first movie was astonishing. The second was more astonishing. Now this one got nothing to do with the level of its antecedents, with many not flaws, rather ""crimes"", along the way!There are slight matters. For one is the number of the unused new characters; that can fill at least 2 movies. The thing about them is that they are all amazing. So their uniqueness deepened the bad irony of their swift appearance. Simply there is a certain descent when it comes to writing this time. Just listen to Magneto's lines to feel that well. Add to that things like the CGI that has been used to de-age (Patrick Stewart) and (Ian Mckellan) at the intro scene. It transformed them both into a silly joke!Then, the sins. There are plenty of idiot events and stupid excuses. Sometimes the matters run crazily and in disgraceful way. For instance, Scott is murdered, suddenly and cheaply, just to assure that Jean became uncontrollable!!! Believe it or not, he didn't have the chance to leave respectfully after a good fight, or even a memorable scene. Let alone that we didn't have the chance to see that in the first place (just his glasses flying = he's murdered!). Then what about Jean's glorious returning back to life! That could be the easiest scene ever written at all; Scott, angrily, beams towards the sea, and Habra Kadabra she's flying out of the water alive, unharmed, and dry?! Welcome to X Men 3's silliest joke (or what was about to make the movie as one!). Annoying question: If she was alive in a cocoon, why she didn't come out earlier, especially while having all of these *recent* powers?!!Speaking of which, what will surely make you frown is the fact that it's impossible for Jean to have all of these powers (did death give her that???!!!). And there is nothing mentioned about her schizophrenic disorder, or her appalling self-destructive alter ego, before. Actually, the scene of (Patrick Stewart) as professor X telling that to (Hugh Jackman) as Wolverine pushed me to pity some actors for what Hollywood forces them to do or say sometimes! Still the greatest moment of absurdity that this movie has is when Jean kills professor X; who's smiling so unintelligibly while his death?? It's needless to notice how many unintelligible things this movie is crowded with!And why not some extra goofy stuff as well: Magneto lost his powers, then at the last shot he's moving a piece of metal?? Xavier is dead then, after the closing credits, he's talking through another person?? I believe the question marks aren't necessary since the movie makers, or accurately the producers, wanted to repair their wrongs, proving that there might be a sequel (or a TV spin-off), and lightening the load of sad nonsense that they made throughout the movie!The main conflict was brilliant. I loved the hard choice that the script shows about giving up whatever distinguishes you between the people, to be normal among the very people; so is the gift a disease to be cured from, or something to live with and show off? Also the sequence of killing Xavier, the director got to be proud of that. But the problem is.. there wasn't more! In general, it doesn't utilize a lot of its powers, and deals awfully melodramatic with the others, to end up as poor, forced, and disappointing.It's not X Men part 3. It's X Men: the murder and the weak swan song. It is clear that the producers wanted to wrap it up anyway, anyhow, so they axed the series by this hasty end, canceled part 4, and attended to the prequels after. However, I'm still asking, after experiencing a big success, why to make a last stand?! It's more like a rough ""stand aside"", and even not with a decent farewell that could be a fair climax for the previous 2 movies.See Wolverine getting out to one of the school's balconies meaninglessly before the last shot; he got grouchy look up his face mostly for this blank finale of a movie!..Even (Singer) didn't make a great Superman movie in the same year!",X-Men - The Last Stand
81,thinker1691,X-Out Originality,6,11 October 2006,"Ever get the feeling while watching a movie, the producers are growing complement and you can predict what's coming next? Such films like Rocky XII, the second or third Dirty Dozen, The last of the Dirty Harry stories, the Final Star Wars saga. they're all Representatives of Film Fatigue. Well that's what you'll get with X Men, The Last Stand. It isn't that the film isn't interesting, it is! But when you start seeing the Good Guys lose, the film starts to imitate the comics. I'm not saying that's bad either, it's good, but I suspect a set up. Stan Lee is an exceptional storyteller, but it's sneaky when a particular character or two is bumped off, right away. That implies a comeback is in the wings. Consider how Lucus did it in the original Star Wars when Darth Vader is flung into the spacial abyss. Neat trick, but necessary for a sequel. Here, two X-Men, join one already dead, or we viewers thought was dead. That smacks of a set up. How often do heroes have to destroy Freddy on Elm Street, Jason, or Michal Myers? The dam monsters just don't want to die. Good for money milking producers, but bad for viewers who seek originality. Now here we have, X-Men returning from the dead and this time joining the Bad guys in, yes, you guessed it, world conquest. Not original, but expected. Despite the fact we got mutants coming out of the woodwork and amassing into an army, the director sees fit to kill them off by the hundreds and in a variety of ways including one which eliminates their powers altogether just by contact. If you're interested in seeing leftover mutants from Star Trek, Star Wars, Twilight Zone, Outer Limits or other fantasy sites, this film is for you. If you're not that shallow, read a book. About the only redeeming character from the entire show, I give you Ian McKellen as Magneto. At least, we know he's originally sincere in his madness. ***",X-Men - The Last Stand

Dark Phoenix/Gifted The Last Stand chased both rabbits and lost them both. It couldn't decide which plot to follow and it robbed from both of them, predictably pulling off neither.It wasn't the lack of experience on Brett Ratner's behalf--although to be fair he hasn't exactly pulled anything off. It wasn't the fact that he had too many characters to try and balance.The fact is, pure and simple, X-Men: The Last Stand failed because it couldn't decide on what story it wanted to tell.",X-Men - The Last Stand
84,freemantle_uk,Disappointing,4,4 March 2008,"I am a big fan of X-Men, the comic books, the cartoon in the 90s and the first two films. I was looking forward to X-Men 3 when it came out and I had high hopes, unfortunately they was dashed after the first half-hour. This film has a number of problems. Firstly the lost of Bryan Singer. He gave the film character development, the society context and made it as realistic as possible. Brett Ratner came from an action background and he just focused on the action. They was no character development and they were too many characters in the film, so it was hard to care for some of them. The lost of Singer's writing team was also an important factor and Simon Kinberg was brought in to write the third film. He writes with major plot holes and under developing many aspects in films. Examples of his work are XXX: 2 State of the Union (a very bad film), Mr. and Mrs. Smith (a good film, but I think it ends too abruptly) and Jumper. If I was a producer of the film I would have fought tooth and nail to keep Singer and his writing team.My other major criticism is that X-Men 3 strays too far from the comic books and the first two films. Cyclops and Xavier were both killed off very early in the film, which never happens in the comics. Cyclops was only killed off because James Marsden ended up being in Superman Returns which ironically a Singer movie. Mystique was also removed from the film with little screen time. This was because Rebecca Romjin ended up in Ugly Betty. She ends up giving up Magneto to the US government which I don't see as realistic because I can't picture someone like her changing ideology that easily: it would be like a senior member of Al-Qaida walking into the headquarters of the FBI and telling them where Bin Laden and everyone else was. Rouge also had little screen time in the film and hardly featured in it at all. Nightcrawler was not present in the film which was a shame because Alec Cumming played the role very well and the storyline of him and Storm together could have been built on from the second film. Characters were added but I wonder why with some of them. Angel was added and in the advertising for the film he was set up as a major character. He added NOTHING to the film. Juggernaut was also in the film, but he was played by Vinnie Jones, who just can't acted. I also felt X-Men 3 was not loyal to the first two films. At the end of X-Men 2 the Dark Phoenix story was set up as the major storyline for the next film, but it was just regulated to a side story in the third film. The whole point of the Dark Phoenix story was absolute power corrupts, but again this was not shown and she was shown to be a schizophrenic. I also felt that the way they were going to set it up was the machine in the first film made Jean Grey more powerful because it was shown slowly in the second film that her powers had growth, and it was even mention at the beginning of the second film.They are many other criticisms of the film and many other people have already mentioned them. The only one that I will add to is Haile Berry demanding more screen time, I personally would have casted another actress to put her in her place, because I don't think she's anything special.The film is still fun in places, Beast and Colossus were good additions and the actions was good, especially Wolverine in the forest.I personally think that the third film should be ignored and redone by the studio to give the fans what they need. I would have also liked to have seen more of the mutant discrimination on the ground level of society (i.e. normal people), or seen a storyline involving groups like Friends of Humanity. I would have like to see Gambit in the film because he is a more dark and complex character and the film-makers could have added a love-triangle story involving him, Rouge and Iceman.",X-Men - The Last Stand
85,Polaris_DiB,No.,4,3 June 2006,"I have never expected to like any of the X-men movies. The first X-men surprised me with how willing it was to take the time to develop so many different characters, and X2 had enough good action and follow-up character development to make it surprisingly good as well. With the mixed reviews of this one, I figured I wouldn't like it at all. I liked some of it; it exceeded my expectations. But it's still highly flawed and I don't like the direction it took.The key problem with this movie is that it makes the ultimate transition away from what the mutant's powers MEAN to focusing more on what they DO. That means while the writers and Ratner were more than willing to figure out interesting battles, they lost track of a lot of motifs and arcs that could fully encompass the general trend of the movies and make it very good. The driving force behind the franchise has always been the tension between mutants and humans and what to do with that tension, but this one seemed much more willing to give that (and any actual drama) second tier to just hurrying up and getting through all the events that it seems must take place. Unfortunately for Ratner, removing the drama and the point makes the events not matter, which means ultimately a very poor cinema experience.For example, most of the mutants introduced are no longer introduced by how important they are to the main circle and how they help range the debate and understand this new world everyone's entering... mostly they're just introduced as a contrivance to get the plot moving along. I'm definitely not the only one who thinks Angel could have been cut completely from the movie and not changed much. Leech and Phoenix also suffer this fractured character arch, most especially represented by the completely anticlimactic and unnecessarily random ending: The driving force of involving Leech is that he can suck powers away. The driving force of involving Phoenix is that she has an excess of power. Well look at that, don't those two make a great opposites cancel out! Unfortunately, I think the writers decided not to go that route because it would be too obvious... or worse, they didn't even think of it. Whatever the case, they missed a precise and organized denouement to the proceeds, ultimately causing both threads to be mostly spectators to the events as they unfold instead of their supposed function of indicators. In fact, now that I think about it, nothing in explaining who Phoenix is explains why she'd join Magneto like that anyway.This complete lack of functionality is further proof of the loss of focus on what the powers mean. I mean, come on... She's a phoenix, literally. Rise from the grave, more power, passionate... the openness to symbolism and the effect on the human/mutant debate is almost limitless.... did Ratner care? No, he seemed more interested in presenting situation after situation which ultimately proves that we're not even going to pretend Wolverine can die at this point.In fact, for a movie willing to kill off very iconic characters (though, maybe, not really...), it seems unwilling to really understand what killing off those characters will ultimately mean to the remaining mutant characters. Deaths are dealt with with a quick moment of silence and then a discussion of what to do next. There is no grief, or fear, or guilt or anything. What it really feels like Ratner says to his production during these scenes is, ""All right, the audience already knows what this means to the characters and stuff, no need to linger... let's move on to the next scene."" Not only does that suck the drama right out of the proceeds, it also pretty much destroys its pacing.Luckily for it, the movie has some pretty strong moments spattered here and there despite itself. The race between Juggernaut and Kitty was excellent, and for some reason I really started digging the enmity between Pyro and Bobby (even if it did feel like a cheap Star Wars rip-off from time to time). I also loved the imagery around the protesters and the people waiting for the cure, because during that time the movie alludes to famous protests from around the world.Otherwise, the movie was just overstuffed and under-functional. Even the dialog represents that, with Wolverine officially sounding like he's trying to be James Bond, all of the good lines taken straight from different works, some rather redundant lines like ""And that's why the pawns go first,"" and so on. I have no doubt in my mind that subsequent X-men will lose further sight of what makes the franchise good, and they're beginning their full decent here. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.--PolarisDiB",X-Men - The Last Stand
86,ebiros2,Good finale to the trilogy,9,8 September 2006,"I think more than few people found the X3 to be lacking based on the reviews I see on the IMDb. I was scared to be disappointed to go and see this film at the theaters because Bryan Singer was not the director. I got to see this movie, of all places on an United Airlines in flight movie. To make the long story short, I wasn't disappointed. The movie had all the elements that I wanted to see about X-men that hasn't been shown on the X-men and X2, and still wrapped the story in a satisfying way. The things that I wanted to see - Angel, Beast, and the Juggernaut - (without them, it ain't the X-men) finally showed up on this movie, and all the other mutants that we wanted to see more of (ice man, pyro, phoenix, colossus) was part of the action.Professor X was killed, but in more than one occasion in the comic he came back to life, so if they're going to make X4, I wouldn't be surprised if he came back to life again. It's difficult to show how awesome the power of Phoenix/Gene Gray is without knowing the original comic, but they did a credible job on the destructive power of Phoenix.As a long standing fan (over 30 years) of Marvel comics, I wasn't disappointed at the treatment this movie gave to the X-Men saga. I only wish that they would make X4, X5, X6 and X7 before the actors age too much.",X-Men - The Last Stand
87,dfranzen70,Better than 1 or 2,8,27 May 2006,"I liked X Men. I liked X2 a little bit more. And I think that X Men: The Last Stand puts them both to shame. And the best part is that not only are the special effects astounding, the plot twists and character changes will make your jaw drop.Seems a research lab headquartered on Alcatraz Island has created what they term a ""cure"" for the mutant gene; that is, a mutant who is injected with the serum will be transformed into a nonmutant - normal, in the view of the makers of the drug. This naturally causes consternation and confusion among the myriad mutants. Do they take the medicine and leave their life of mutancy? Or do they renounce it, choosing to remain true to themselves? Magneto (Ian McKellen) doesn't want to take the chance, realizing that with this serum the government - which has been hunting him - could effectively eliminate all mutants, whether they want to be ""cured"" or not. His plan is to raise an army of disaffected, resentful mutants and destroy the serum - along with any who stand in his way, including Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his team.There are plenty of other subplots, all of which intertwine gracefully with the main thread. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), thought to have died at the end of X2, reappears - but is she the same Jean Grey they all know and love? And what's up with her and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), anyway? And what of poor Rogue (Anna Paquin), who's frustrated at not being able to hold her boyfriend Iceman (Shawn Ashmore)? The screen crackles with sexual tension on many levels, among many mutants. And of course many of the mutants' powers carry an undercurrent of sexuality all on their own.New to the cast is Kelsey Grammar as Hank McCoy, aka Beast, the Secretary of Mutant Affairs. He's big, blue, and furry, and he's basically the liaison between the mutants and the government. Only the government's a little leery of mutants, now that Magneto's waging war against them.You know how there are some movies that give you OH MY GOD moments? I don't mean wowie-kazowie special effects - like, say, moving the Golden Gate Bridge - I mean more like I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT TO THAT CHARACTER! Even if you're not an X Men fanatic, you do have a sense of who's who in the X Men universe, who's more important than whom. And more often than not, although you know bad things will happen to the heroes, they'll probably all live to fight another day. In X3, though, there's a strong sense of unease throughout the movie - indeed, will they all survive? i've heard conflicting reports about whether this is the final X Men film, but I really hope not. In fact, I'd prefer an X Men 4 to a spin off of Wolverine or Magneto, or any of the other characters. This is a cast of characters that acts supremely well as a team, and my impression is that however compelling the actor is, the characters might not be strong enough to carry a film on the level of the X Men films. I mean, look at Daredevil and Catwoman.All in all, the X Men movies have been progressively better, never letting up and never allowing the viewer to get comfortable with the plot; doing so would lead to the usual predictable, unimaginative story lines that sink most big-budget movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
88,PWNYCNY,A Powerful and Intense Movie,10,20 June 2006,"What I thought would be just another dumb Hollywood special-effects piece of junk (indeed, I confess that I was curious as to how bad this movie would be), was, to my surprise, an excellent and well-acted science fiction movie. The acting was outstanding, the plot was original, and the movie had good continuity. This movie may be the best science fiction movie since The Predator. What makes this movie especially good is the how the the mutants are a metaphor for all people who are considered different, who do not conform to what is considered to be the norm, and what the larger society will do to achieve conformity. Don't be fooled by the corny title. This is a powerful and intense movie. It's worth watching.",X-Men - The Last Stand
89,alindsay-al,The worst of the original X Men trilogy by far,3,2 April 2014,"Whoever thought it was a good idea to continue this film without Bryan Singer is a complete idiot as this film is a large step down from the others which is so disappointing. This film picks up just after X2 with the X-Men attempting to recover from the events of the previous better film, while Magneto is creating a huge army of mutants to destroy the humans. This film is just not very good, it isn't horrible but it just isn't good in my opinion for several reason. For one a problem with all the X-Men films but most of all this one is the continuity of these films unlike Disney's Marvel films plot points in this film contradicts the previous films but also future X-men films. Also even though this film is meant to be more epic then the previous films with higher stakes how come it is shorter then X2? it should have been at least 15-30 mins longer to possibly attempt to save this film. There is more as well as one thing that angered me was taking out two huge fan favourite characters in the first 20 mins in this film which was another thing that angered me. However, there is some positives with great performances once again from the usual group of Magneto, Professor X, Storm, Jean Grey and Storm but a few of the new characters introduced I really liked with Beast and Juggernaut being great in my opinion. Also there are some great effects in this film that are a great positive. But I am sorry this film is not good enough for all these reasons and I must emphasise how happy I am now Bryan Singer is back.",X-Men - The Last Stand
90,Chris_Docker,"If all the X-Men films could be this good, I could watch one every week . . .",9,29 May 2006,"When I was a kid, my parents used to give me a Big Carrot to look forward to all week, one that could only be realised on Saturday mornings. Every Saturday, I would troop down to the local cinema with my buddies for the kids matinée and, after the Pathe News and a cartoon, we would be treated to the Big Picture - usually a monster movie or superheroes spectacular. By standards of grown ups, the Big Picture wasn't that big or spectacular - usually a B-movie with awful special effects: but we would thrill to every leap of the hero, feel every whack as the monster or bad guy took a beating, and hide our boyish tears (or whoop and laugh manfully) as the heroine died in the arms of her lover.X-Men, the Last Stand, brought back that magic to me. If I could watch a Marvel-Comic-made-Celluloid this good every week I'd soon become an addict again. I caught the late night showing expected to be mildly entertained - and was awed. Comic book adaptations have advanced by leaps and bounds over the past few years - from the intellectual and emotional involvement of Spiderman 2 to the remarkable mixed media look of Sin City. So much so, comic book cinema no longer has to apologise for itself, play exclusively to children or appeal to a minority of fans. There are some people who will be turned off by the idea of mutant humans with super powers - you know who you are, and this movie is not for you; but for anyone wavering about going to see it, this represents a quality offering in what has now become an established and respectable genre. The story lines and moral dilemmas are well thought out, the acting on a par with any good mainstream film, and the special effects accurately delivered. I am no longer a pre-adolescent in short trousers, and yet felt my spine tingle to the magic of the X-Men's Last Stand the way I did years ago to those tearfully boyish Saturday matinees.This story revolves around a new 'cure' developed by a leading pharmaceutical company that can suppress the mutant gene of creatures like the X-Men. At first, the serum is offered only to mutants who want it, who long to be simply human, but the political battle over the rights and wrongs of the new discovery soon reach fever pitch. Of the two main groups of mutants, one, led by Patrick Stewart, seeks only peaceful coexistence for all - mutants and homo sapiens. The other, led by Ian McKellan, sees the battle as one between the two species. The lines are soon blurred as the new serum is misused by the government, and also as one very powerful mutant, known as Jean or Phoenix, awakens with part of her powers lodged with her subconscious and so beyond her control.For those that like reading meaning into science fiction and fantasy, many questions about evolution are raised, about democracy, freedom of the will and where (and how) individual freedom ends. Halle Berry's role (as Storm) has been slightly expanded, but it remains an excellent ensemble performance from all the main characters.This was not a film where I expected the audience to remain behind for the credits, so I was somewhat surprised to see so few people leaving their seats. Was I (as a non cult follower of X-Men) in the dark about something they all knew? Quite possibly - there is an extra scene kept back for dedicated fans . . .",X-Men - The Last Stand
91,MaxBorg89,X-Men: The End?,7,27 May 2006,"The best and most emotional movie of the trilogy. This is what the director, Brett Ratner, and the actors involved have said of X-Men: The Last Stand. This year's Revenge of the Sith? Not really: it's not as astonishing as the final Star Wars chapter (or, staying in X-Men territory, the amazing second installment), but it has the degree of spectacular that makes it count as a solid franchise epilogue (assuming it really is the last film in the series, that is).The Last Stand's premise is based on a recent X-Men storyline written by Joss ""Buffy"" Whedon: we learn of the existence of a young mutant(Cameron Bright, aka the ""creepy boy"" from Godsend and Birth), whose very particular ""gift"" is to make other mutants powerless if they're too close to him. So far, though, the loss is temporary. If, however, you receive the ""cure"", obtained from the boy's DNA, you will become ""normal"". Forever.This discovery causes three main reactions: some mutants, including Angel (Ben Foster), a winged teenager whose father financed the making of the ""cure"", and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who, because of her abilities, can't even kiss or touch her boyfriend, see it as a miracle; Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his students, particularly Storm (Halle Berry), think it's ridiculous, given being a mutant isn't a disease you can just get rid of; and then we have Magneto (Ian McKellen), who immediately realizes the truth: let the humans have it their way, and the mutant race will be completely and irreversibly exterminated. Which means, the ultimate war is about to begin. In addition, the X-Men have to deal with another issue: Jean Grey (Famke Janssen, at her best), back from the dead and more powerful than ever (she's a Level 5 mutant, virtually invincible, whereas Xavier and Magneto are Level 4). In fact, her personality has been replaced by a more aggressive one known as the Phoenix. Translation: the proverbial thing is going to hit the fan.The main pre-release complaint made by fans was the departure of director Bryan Singer, who moved on to resurrecting Superman on the big screen. His replacement, Rush Hour director Brett Ratner, maintains the same tone and, like Singer, aims for something a bit more breathtaking in scale compared to the previous film. Starting with a Danger Room sequence, blatantly inspired by the famous Days of a Future Past storyline, and tying the two plot arcs (The Cure and the Dark Phoenix Saga) together in an epic confrontation as good as anything Singer would have come up with, he manages to deliver action and suspense without sacrificing the story's heart for the sake of comedy (as seen in the Rush Hours). Actually, sometimes the action overshadows parts of the story, with key subplots from previous installments - the Rogue-Iceman situation most notably - being sidestepped to make room for new characters (not that it's a bad thing, when you have someone like Kelsey Grammar playing Beast). This, paired with a running time that is, astonishingly enough, shorter than that of X2, means that while the overall result is pretty satisfying, there are some specific sections that could have used more work.Bottom line: this might not be the last official X-Men film (the last two scenes, one of which plays after the closing credits, seem to suggest a fourth chapter is possible), but if it is, it's a worthy, if not entirely accomplished swansong. Then again, asking a new director to outdo someone else's work is a pretty big challenge, so Ratner deserves credit for accepting the challenge and delivering an intelligent, exciting summer blockbuster - an X-flick worthy of the name.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Taking a quick look at some other reviews and it seems to main gripe is how it treats certain characters from the comics, which is fair enough for sure but that doesn't come into play for me as I'm not a comic reader.I can only judge it as a film and as one I found it suitably entertaining. Hugh Jackman remains the top dog, though at the beginning the way Wolverine acts felt off to me - though that quickly went away. I would've liked if they found a spot for Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), though one of his replacements in Beast (Kelsey Grammer) went down well with me.From what I read I can understand other people's complaints with this, especially with the aforementioned iffy character treatment, but I gotta be honest and say that I found it to be a good enough watch - even if it is comparatively the weakest entry of the original trilogy./copied directly from my Letterboxd review\",X-Men - The Last Stand

She goes with Magneto (McKellen) and is the most powerful mutant. Meanwhile, people have found a cure for mutants, and Magneto and his bunch rally against it, but Rogue (Paquin) feels its the only way for her to have a normal relationship. The actual action doesn't kick in until about an hour in, but it shouldn't displease X-Men fans. If you watch past the end credits, you should realise that a sequel could easily happen, though at the end, two of our X-Men are dead (again some will say three, but watch after the end credits). So, in conclusion I do recommend this, for the good action scenes, some funny lines and good special effects.My rating: B. 98 mins.

Prejudice at its worst is making life miserable for the mutants, and now the cure takes on a really dark tone because it essentially validates the point of view of many who see different as bad and something wrong. Add to the central plot point, that Magneto and Xavier are still pretty much clashing with each other, though the film establishes early on that they do understand each other's different natures.All of the mutants are back, and this time there is no denying that each actor is fully able to handle each character's nuances very well. Halle Berry acquits herself beautifully with her performance as the ultimate weather freak. Then we have Hugh Jackman, throwing all of his Shakesperean training behind one of the most emotional moments of the year. Here is a man who is not afraid or unable to show emotions: a true cinematic hero in my book. Ms. Jansenn is formidable as the most powerful of them, a force of nature who can certainly cause more damage than anyone can predict.There are many wonderful moments in the film, and they make the film very enjoyable.

96,Agent10,Talk about limping to the finish line,2,27 May 2006,"Amidst the explosions, bad one-liners and cool special effects, those that made this movie subtly insulted the intelligence of all that watched this film. Hmmm, no exposition, no background, no development, and of course, no dialogue. In a span of 100 minutes, the fruits of two great movies was for naught as the whole concept of the X-Men franchise was flushed down the drain by a bunch of short-sighted boobs.It's hard to really focus on who brought the movie down more. The writers clearly had a hand in it because it's quite obvious they didn't notice that the movie was filled with rather useless lines and quotes. It probably would have been better off as a silent film. We could blame Brett Ratner, the biggest gravy training chump in the industry, for his lack of insight and inability to really make a film. Or we could blame Halle Berry, who's Touch of Death has now inflicted this franchise just when it looked like she was going to be written out of the saga. And to make matters worse, too many new lame characters were introduced when some of the best (like fricking Gambit) continued to be on the back burner.Let's just face it, this film is just a cluttered mess. While fanboys will flock to the theaters and push the no. 10 on the ratings list, they are only deluding themselves from not fully witnessing the troubling truth about this film. Another sequel couldn't save this franchise, not even if Bryan Singer comes back and Rattner goes back to directing schlock.

100,davidmvining,"Oh, no...",3,13 April 2021,"What had held such promise so completely fell apart in the hands of Brett Ratner. Gone is any real sense of character, narrative construction, or even action chops. This is a dreary, uninteresting movie with too many movie parts, too many unfulfilled promises, and a complete misunderstanding of the story it does try to tell to the point where we have the wrong main character. Singer didn't want to come back for a third movie. Matthew Vaughn left the production as director. So, Fox found Brett Ratner, proving to the world that he can barely keep things in focus even though he hired a cinematographer to handle the camera.This movie is essentially trying its hands at two stories. The first is of a mutant cure, and the second is Jean Grey coming back from the dead to become the Dark Phoenix. I'll say this up front, while I've never read the comics, I have heard that the Dark Phoenix storyline is a great one. I have a feeling that it doesn't resemble this at all, though.The movie begins with Jean Grey getting recruited at her childhood home by Professor X and Magneto before their rivalry turned antagonistic with early de-aging effects applied to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen that is actually okay, especially considering the film's age. The scene itself isn't very much, showing that Grey was really powerful in her youth, Xavier was worried about it, and Magneto was excited about it. It works as a flashback. And then we get another flashback to characters we've never seen before, a pharmaceutical executive and his son who has discovered he's a mutant by growing wings that he tries to shave off.So, it's been some time since the end of the second film. It's really unclear how long, and that's a bit of the problem at the beginning. Wolverine has a line near the beginning about how he's just passing through, and we all need to get over Jean's death, but Cyclops is taking it really hard still and Wolverine, being the least emotionally sensitive one, is the only one to tell him to move on while everyone else is still kind of in mourning. Is Cyclops' mourning unreasonably long or not? It's unclear. The problem is that this movie takes no time to really establish any emotional grounding in anything it does. It's the payoff moments without anything to actually build up to them.At best, the movie wants to rely on the previous films for that, which is largely a mistake generally, but it usually just skips to the emotional bits without laying any of the groundwork. Cyclops is sad and shoots lasers into the lake where Jean died, and she instantly comes back and kills him off screen. Wolverine brings an unconscious Jean back to the mansion, and they almost instantly start making out when she wakes up. The kid with the wings grows up and is the first to get the cure for mutation, but he's in the room for about ten seconds before he's having second thoughts with his dad saying that they've talked about it, except we never saw any of that previous conversation. Magneto rescues Mystique from prison, and he instantly says goodbye to her forever because she got shot with a cure gun and is no longer a mutant, despite this being their first scene together in this movie. No single emotional moment is built up.In terms of the larger two stories, the one that works best is the cure storyline. It's not good, but it's better than Jean standing around mutely for an hour until later for reasons. The cure is voluntary for mutants. Storm (who should have been the main character, which I'll get to in a second) finds it reprehensible to even consider it. Rogue (who should have been the other main character) desperately wants it because she can't touch her boyfriend, Iceman, and he's been getting too close to Kitty Pride, who can walk through walls, for her comfort levels. There's also Hank McCoy, Beast, who is a cabinet level secretary for the president who, um, shows up to give exposition and then is part of the final action scene.Magneto hates the very idea of the cure and thinks it'll be used against them forcefully at some point. He makes oblique references to his past as a Jew in Nazi Germany to justify the belief. He's convinced it's happening when they break into the highly secure mobile prison and, as a last resort after the guards have been beaten/killed, one shoots a cure weapon and turns Mystique human. Does Magneto believe that this is genuinely the direction the US government is going to take? Is he using the situation to start the war that he's been egging on for three movies now? It's unclear, but it does point to a more interesting and morally ambiguous take on the material where each side is lying to justify what they want. This was directed by Brett Ratner, though, so the opportunity passes him by and he doesn't even seem to notice.The final big action setpiece is when the film enters complete incoherence. Remember how Storm was all against the cure? Well, she leads the defense of the facility where the cure is generated for reasons. It's really unclear. And this points to how she should have been the main character instead of Wolverine. Wolverine's story is effectively over after the second one unless you find a new direction to take the character. Instead, they focused on his never terribly convincing romance with Jean to carry his story and anchor the film as a whole (as much as there is an anchor, which isn't much). Storm, though, gets chosen by Professor X to take over the school in the event of his death, which happens. She's presented with a moral quandary that she needs to work through. She's thrust in the middle of a larger conflict that tests her leadership skills and her morality. She's the natural central point for this entire story, and she's a side character at best with Wolverine taking up the leadership mantle in the final conflict because reasons.Rogue also completely disappears for the final third of the film despite being the only prominent character who wants the cure. She feels like she should be at the center of it all, not completely forgotten.So the final action sequence is a boring little mess. Filmed obviously on a set when its set outside, Magneto brings the Golden Gate Bridge to Alcatraz, connects it to land, and we never see anyone cross the bridge to fight on the island. I'm guessing it's supposed to happen considering the number of mutants in the final fight versus the number of mutants on the bridge with Magneto when he moves it, but there's, again, no build up to the fight. It just happens. And what happens is dull, borderline incomprehensible visually, and silly.This movie is a complete mess. This is the work of a rushed production under the hand of a director who doesn't understand how to tell a story at all. Dreary, unfocused, shallow, and pedestrian, this franchise fell off a cliff all of a sudden.",X-Men - The Last Stand

104,Matt_Layden,"""This Is A Perfect Example Of How To Destroy A Franchise""",5,26 June 2006,"A so called cure is found in the blood of a young mutant, which divides the world into two sections. Those who want it and those who don't. Magneto and his brotherhood seek to find this boy and capture him, while the X-men must stand together, through hard times and put a stop to Magneto and his evil ways.Being a fan of the comics, I can say that the first X-men film did an okay job at bringing them to the big screen. The second film took the mutant powers to new levels, with more action and more mutants for us to feast our eyes on. It was a treat seeing so many childhood favourite characters come to life. The Last Stand is the third installment, the makers of the film decide to go heavy on the eye popping action and forget to bring everything else with it. Take a note, X-3 is the perfect example of how to destroy a franchise.When Singer left the job to go direct Superman, I had my head searching for a director that could take over the job, Joss Whedon was my choice and after seeing Ratner's piece up on the big screen, I have come to think that many others would agree with my choice. The Last Stand has many problems with it, mainly the story line and how close to strays from the source material. Although, with the bad does come good, so the film is not a total travesty.Some of the nit picks come from a continuation of the first two films, such as introducing Beast and Angel in the third film, when they are in fact original members (along with cyclops, iceman and Jean) of the X-men team. The Last Stand adds too many characters into the film from the comics, giving them only a little bit of screen time. Here's a lesson, when you want to please fans, do not introduce a character and use them for five minutes. Introducing Beast, Kitty Pride/Shadowcat, Leech (horribly done, I'll mention later), Angel, and Juggernaut, cause hell, they weren't juggling enough characters in X-2. Back to Leech though, what's with the complete an utter disregard of the character? In the comics he is green and lives in the sewers, here he is played by the always creepy looking kid (See Ultraviolet and Godsend). If you need a cure type character, make a new one, do not soil another. Juggernaut is Xavier's stepbrother, yet nothing. Would it be confusing to the plot, possibly, but maybe a nod or something when they pass each other to Grey's house. Don't get me started on how they handled Callisto, they totally changed the character and her powers. Storm would wipe the floor with her, although, yet again Storm as a character is underused, just like the first two films. Even with Berry commanding a bigger role, she is still not used to her full potential. Could it possibly be because of Berry herself not being confident in her role?Out of all the X-men story lines, the Dark Phoenix is probably the most recognizable. It is vast, emotional, and everything you could ever ask for in a comic book story line. Hmm, now why would you throw that into this movie when you already have another story line. The Dark Phoenix SAGA, did that word mean nothing to you? SAGA, should have a movie of it's own, one in which unites both Magneto and the X-men to take on a greater evil. Her story was completely rushed and used as a second handle to the main plot, of the cure. Granted, to make the story movie friendly, you'll need to change the fact they go into space, but please make it more friendly then what has been fed to us. Some major characters do hit the hay. Is it just me, or has one of the X-men character been getting the shaft over the last two X-men films? Read the comics guys, after Jean's death Cyclops leaves the X-men, not what happens in the film.I was happy to see some nods for the hardcore fans out there, such as the ""fastball special"", the danger room and sentinels. The film, as I said before, is not all entirely bad. This review is from the fan boy in me. The Last Stand has a lot of action, which should please those who want to see the mutant powers in full effect. Unless you're a Colossus fan, he is underused yet again. The Juggernaut, after small fight with Logan, does nothing but run through walls. Iceman actually turned to ice, that was neat. Wolverine, doesn't seem like the brutal killer that he is in the comics, here we see him kicking guys in the nuts and saying comical stuff while doing it.Ultimately, Ratner was the wrong man for the job. While the action was superb and the special effects off the wall, it all doesn't make up for the butchering of the story they've done. The ending has either finished the franchise all together or changed it drastically. If there are more films to come, will there be new villains? A Mr. Sinister perhaps, or how about Apocalypse. Probably not, we're probably going to get a BS story about how the cure is only short time, as what was hinted at by the end. Stupid story aside, and if you're not a die hard fan, Last Stand is...dare I say it....enjoyable.",X-Men - The Last Stand
105,lewiskendell,Half the movie of the previous X-Men.,6,19 April 2010,"It doesn't take long to see that The Last Stand has a very different director than X2, and it also doesn't take long to figure out what Brett Ratner's philosophy for the third X-Men movie is. MORE! BIGGER! More mutants! More action scenes! Bigger explosions! More special effects! X-Men 3 tops X2 in all those areas I just mentioned, but it's definitely not the better movie.The main area I think The Last Stand suffers in, is the story. They took two absolutely huge stories that easily required their own movies (the Dark Phoenix and the mutant ""cure""), sand tried to stuff them all together into one plot. It just doesn't work well. Events seem too hurried and under-developed, and after the solid story of the last movie, that just isn't acceptable. I understand that story choices have to be made, and they won't always be made in the way I would do things, but the large body count and drastic character changes just seemed unwise, to me. X-men 3 is a decent movie, and nowhere near the horrible disaster that was still to come in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but this pales in comparison to its predecessor.",X-Men - The Last Stand

107,brando647,Mildly frustrating but still a good conclusion for the X-Men,8,29 September 2007,"So, Bryan Singer ducked out of this one, which is a shame. He was doing so well with the franchise. Brett Ratner jumps in to pick up the slack this time around, concluding the X-Men trilogy. Though I have to admit, I hate to think of it as the end of the series. I'm hoping the studios decide to continue, or maybe switch gears and jump on with X-Force or X-Calibur. I don't plan on going in to too much detail but I will say that by the end of this movie, they had FUBAR'd their chances to continue the story of the existing X-Men team. When I first saw this movie on opening night, the story ticked me off. In my opinion, there are too many casualties/losses for me to feel that it had any sort of happy ending. But it's been done now, and I hope the series won't suffer for it.We get the usual awesome performances out of the main cast (Stewart, McKellan, Jackman, Janssen, etc.). Once again, we get to look forward to the introduction of more characters. Ben Foster impressed me with his minor role as Angel (a major change from the role he played in 'The Punisher'). The best part of this whole movie? The introduction of two of the coolest characters in the X-Men series (in my opinion, anyways): Beast & Juggernaut. I wish they had both had slightly larger roles, particularly Juggernaut. Kelsey Grammar was the perfect choice for Beast (think Fraiser, with blue fur). As for Juggernaut, Vinnie Jones does a great job with the little bit he is given.The only newly-introduced character I had a problem with was Kitty Pride. I didn't mind that she was brought into the story, but I didn't like her place in it. I thought the whole Iceman-Rogue-Kitty triangle was unnecessary; it didn't really add anything to the plot. Not to mention, it was just weird seeing Iceman flirting with her (the girl looks like she's 15!). I think the only reason I'm biased against Kitty in this movie is because one line...a single line of dialogue: her line at the end of the Juggernaut chase sequence at the end. Those who have seen the movie know which line. It makes her sound even younger and more immature than she looks and it sounds completely out of place in this movie.I still ended up giving this movie a decent rating because, even with all of the little things that bothered me, it was still a good movie. The final stand-off between the X-Men and Magneto's Brotherhood makes for a great battle. It's definitely not as good as 'X2' but this movie still manages to do its job and entertain. It makes for a satisfying end, but leaves you with hope (especially after the credits) that there may yet be more to come...",X-Men - The Last Stand
108,moviewizguy,Take a Stand,6,1 May 2009,"When a cure is found that could turn mutants back to ""normal,"" the reactions seem polar. Some, like Magneto, deeply oppose to it, while others, like Rogue, want the cure as soon as possible. As a war is brewing between the mutants and the humans, can the X-Men stop Magneto and his destruction?Let me start off to say this: The plot for the film is really great. Honestly, I think it's the best out of the trilogy, seeing how it's very political and it offers much more than usual superhero movies. One can even make up a metaphor, and, probably, there is a social commentary being said here. I really appreciated that. However, this was a disappointing film.After what has been set up in the excellent part two in the trilogy, it wasn't not hard to see that this one would fall short, like many threequals. The running time is so short that not even many of the new characters are on screen long enough, let alone many major characters left in the dust. Also, although the story is excellent, the execution is mediocre, replacing character development from the last two chapters and replacing it with more explosions and action scenes, which, I must admit, are quite amazing.You might even find yourself amazed at how many major characters are being killed off, possibly just for the sake of trying to limit down the millions of characters on screen already. Even characters like Mystique, Rogue, and Cyclops, major characters in the last two films, can be missed if you blink once on the screen. Saying that, the film manages to do well with cramming millions of things in one short film. The story may be a little fast paced, and maybe there's no time to stop and feel for characters being killed off, but it's good enough for what it has.As said earlier, the action sequences are amazing. The special effects are flawless. I even liked the new characters on board, like Ellen Page, Vinnie Jones, and Ben Foster. The original cast also do well here, Hugh Jackman with his tough attitude and Halle Berry with a new hairdo. Overall, it's not the sequel one might hope for, especially if it's the end of a trilogy, but it's good enough for what it is: An entertaining, fast paced romp. Let's just hope they make another sequel.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Not to mention that I REALLY miss Gambit to be in this movie, as well as other mutants like nightcrawler who was only in X -Men II and Jubilee. I missed the Sentinels and Apocalypse too. (that cameo that one of the Sentinels did doesn't count much)I hated some conclusions of the movie: Rogue( my favorite female character)Mystique and Magneto looses their powers, Jean, Xavier and Cyclops die,Warren(the angel)has a small participation.

110,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""X-Men: The Last Stand""- A disappointing and overstuffed conclusion",5,7 August 2007,"The fatal flaw of ""X-Men: The Last Stand""... studio greed. Bryan Singer, the marvelous director of the first two entries in the series departed to work on his Superman film, though he promised he would return to helm the third and final installment of the ""X-Men"" franchise afterword.Apparently, his word was not enough for 20th Century Fox or Marvel Entertainment, who promptly hired a new director (Brett Ratner of ""Rush Hour"" and ""Red Dragon"" fame) and apparently had a script hastily written. Why? More than likely because of the money the film promised, and their unnecessary bitterness towards Singer's brief departure.Now, I like Brett Ratner's other films. The ""Rush Hour"" films are fun action/comedies, ""Red Dragon"" was a sharp and well-done thriller. But putting him in charge of a summer-blockbuster ($100 million+) film was a mistake. Especially when that film already has a strong fan-following. His light-hearted and fun style and interpretation of the characters/stories clashes with the dark and harsh stage that Bryan Singer had already set.Also problematic is the script/story. While the first two films built up slowly towards emotionally-driven and spectacular finales, this third film starts big and tries to maintain it's sloppy and recklessly special-effects driven pseudo-story. And it often fails at keeping a good pace and structure.Like many ""third"" movies, specifically comic-book films, this one tries to cram a lot of story into a fairly short time-frame. However, unlike ""Spider-Man 3"" or ""Blade: Trinity"", which at least maintained or even extended their running times to accommodate the overstuffed tales, this film tries to fit more into LESS time. Running about half an hour shorter than either of the previous films, while trying to tell what seems to be twice as many plots and subplots, we end up with a jumbles mess. It is no secret that some characters die, and some traumatic events unfold, but the film deals with these events and moves on so quickly, I found myself feeling more anger than the sadness that was intended. ""Why did they just kill so-and-so, and why do none of the other characters seem to care?"" I asked myself several times during the film.All that being said, the film is not without some good moments. While the rest of the film falls flat, the several action scenes throughout work very well and may be the only part of this film that outdoes the previous two. Specifically well-done is the climactic battles.Also, though far too many new characters are introduced, Beast (Kelsey Grammar) shines as the intellectual-yet-visually-intimidating character we all know and love.The plot line? A young mutant (Leech) has been discovered, who is able to render other mutants powerless by stripping them of their abilities. The father of the mutant Angel, ashamed by his son, plans on harvesting the ""cure"" from Leech and mass producing it, for the purpose of ""fixing"" mutants.In a nutshell, the X-Men become somewhat divided with conflicting feelings regarding this cure, and Magneto plans on storming the structure holding Leech (Alcatrez) and killing him. This is a set up for the supposed ""final showdown"" between the Brotherhood (Magneto's cronies) and the X-Men.Like I have said, though it does sound promising, most everything in this film falls flat.Also notable is the blatant style changes Ratner has made. The X-Men seem more ""cartoonish"", with costumes and looks that are just cheesy. Dark Pheonix's red outfit is laughable if you pay attention (where the heck did she get it?) and Colossus looks like a bad 60's cartoon hero with jetting hair and a huge chin.My final verdict... though a severe letdown for me, I am betting enough people will like the film. I suggest giving it a rent, because it isn't the worst movie ever made, and it at least has some fun action scenes and silly jokes to hold you over.5/10 (By the way, I give the original an 8/10 and ""X2"" a 9/10)",X-Men - The Last Stand

WE saw the terribly weak, vapid and bloodless sequels such as Terminator 3 or Blade Trinity, but, at the same time, we witnessed such marvelous examples of strong sequels such as Destination Point or Matrix. What about the X-Men? Did they stand their ground and did this final part prove it had been worth waiting? Yes, it did! This final part is a sweeping, majestic and grand take, full of breathtaking video effects and excellent tag-lines, dialogs, moments, and on top of it all, full of deep tragic events. Well, this is the darkest out of the three parts. Several main characters die, including Xavier himself, some of his aids and enemies. The plot is great. WE see a new vaccine that will eliminate the X-genes from the mutants' organisms and many of the mutants are striving to do so. Then, a terrible bloody war between the Magneto's gang and Xavier's part rage on. We see the struggle between these two parts and then the intruding of the people to this battle. The film is very quick, fast and ferocious, we cannot stop or have a break, since it is so thrilling and exciting.

112,shakercoola,Comic book thrills but far less given over to character building,5,18 November 2018,"This third film in the series is more on action, and a theme on acceptance and the morals of bio-engineering but lacks on substance. It delivers on a surface level the thrills required of a third film in a successful series. The magic of CGI is expertly carried out but there doesn't appear to be much at stake in terms of the drama, and fast editing reduces tension in the final act.

113,valadas,Gorgeous visual effects,6,7 June 2006,"When I was a kid fairy tales had fairies, witches, wizards, gnomes, dwarfs, magic wands and fantastic castles or palaces. Now they have mutants, monsters, heroes, politicians, presidents, superpowers, explosions and violence galore. Well but this movie curiously combines odd people dressed in normal clothes (with a few exceptions) circulating in normal streets with normal buildings inside and outside normally decorated and normal vehicles passing around. Despite that the movie has got some of the greatest visual effects ever seen on the screen. We are here in the presence of a society composed of humans and mutants endowed with superpowers both physical and mental. Apparently those mutants are assimilated in American society (the movie takes place only in USA and we don't know what happens in other countries) but when a medicine is discovered that can ""cure"" them that is deprive them of their superpowers and sometimes peculiar appearances and make them ""normal"" human beings, then, while some of them resort to democratic peaceful street demonstrations, some others form a brotherhood that opts to resist violently starting a war against established powers and authorities to seize and destroy the source of that medicine. In the fight that ensues a handful of ""good"" mutants side with the established powers against their fellow creatures. The final battle in my opinion is the weakest part of the movie even in terms of visual effects not rising above of lots of other similar scenes already seen in alike movies. There are also a few logical flaws like for instance the fact of one of the most powerful mutants going on a wheelchair instead of putting himself to walk normally being true that he could do much more difficult supernatural things. Love is also present mainly in the relationship between one of the ""good"" mutants and a mutant young girl endowed with the most powerful superpowers.

114,dunmore_ego,X-eunt in X-asperation.,6,26 June 2006,"Action without heart. Spectacle without logic. Brawn without brains.Director Brett Ratner balances on Bryan Singer's shoulders, attempting to hold up the mutant world Singer so reverently rendered in *X-Men* (2000) and *X-Men United* (2003). But he falls off - and helms *X-Men: The Last Stand*, the third in the x-franchise, with as much reverence and talent as Bryan Singer's shoe.Ratner and screenwriters Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn feign respect, drawing in the fan-boys (with teaser ads featuring edgy photography and magnificent visuals, like Angel's breathtaking wingspan; dangling the reunion carrot of the five original Uncanny X-Men members - for the non-mutant readers, these are Cyclops, Jean Grey, Iceman, Angel and Beast; giving us tastes of legendary idioms, when Bobby Drake eventually goes fully Iceman for a few seconds, or Beast exclaims, ""Oh my stars and garters!"")  but then tumble off the grid completely, as they kill off half the main characters, never show the original five on screen together, twist legacy into dramatic cliché and fulfill the worst fears of intelligent moviegoers. *Last Stand* is not a case of ""more of the same,"" but TOO MUCH of the same; a runaway George Lucas effect.Forgetting that ""He who sips from many cups, drinks of none,"" Ratner loads this 104-minute movie with so much content that it implodes under its own weight.The government has isolated an antigen from scary Cameron Bright (playing Leech, a mutant who negates the powers of other mutants) and markets it as a ""mutant cure,"" drawing mixed reactions from mutants. Magneto (Ian McKellen) sees it as usurpation of mutants' very souls, whilst some, like Rogue (Anna Paquin), who cannot touch anyone without draining their life-force (and whose pink bits have been quivering for man flesh since she met Wolverine back in *X-Men*) see it as an opportunity for some Jagger-like satisfaction.While Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) insults everyone back at the mutant mansion of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Cyclops (James Marsden) wastes his 3 minutes screen time weeping like a bitch over dead Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). The blue-furred, Presidential Mutant Diplomat, Beast (Kelsey Grammar, perfectly cast), attempts to find the right spin for the antigen campaign, whilst boy-band member, Warren Worthington III (aka Angel, played by Michael Murphy, doing Jay Mohr), uses up his four seconds of wingspan screen time to make good on the startling trailer and fly out on the cure.Before anyone can say ""mutant overload,"" Jean (with her long, luscious, burgundy wig slightly crooked), has returned from the dead as Dark Phoenix, had Cyclops for lunch and is hot for some Wolverine whippin'.Magneto scorns Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) after she sacrifices her mutancy for him, and proves to be quite the playa; no sooner dumping the blue babe than hooking up with a Dark Phoenix.If all this seems confusing, rest assured, it is. *Last Stand* makes little attempt at explaining relationships, superpowers or logic (except for a flashback which finds the two Shakespearean veterans, McKellen and Stewart, amusingly wrinkle-free, meeting Jean as a child, exploring the complexities of their love-hate association) and is unapologetically for fan-boys who have continually sacrificed the love of a good woman for plastic-bagging their comic books in chronological order; ironic, considering the film-makers themselves don't display much love or knowledge of these characters.And Cyclops! Oh, Cyclops! I have never condoned the dismissive treatment of the Uncanny X-Men's prime member. In the comics universe, everyone respected his authoritah - but the first two Singer movies demoted this master tactician, group leader and masculine love-interest for Jean Grey into a metrosexual strip-o-gram. We tolerated his film deficiencies because the films themselves lauded the X-Men legacy. With *Last Stand,* Cyclops' pussified ousting is unconscionable.Screen becomes clogged with super-beings who only figure how to utilize their powers as the plot denotes, otherwise stand around doing nothing.Only Magneto and Wolverine ever use their powers intelligently, Wolverine usually with his shirt off; alas, his action scenes are all too brief (and how does his singlet heal its holes anyway?). Magneto's power is truly awe-inspiring and the vaunted Golden Gate Bridge sequence is remarkable.The themes of this movie  offering homogeneity to those who feel alienated and forcing homogeneity on those who wish individuality  are lost amongst the movie's many plot-holes and poorly-directed action. For example, why was the government transporting Juggernaut, Multiple Man and Mystique without first shooting them with the antigen? Well, so that Magneto could rescue them, of course.And why does Wolverine try to stop Phoenix being shot with antigen? This would have eradicated her nihilistic death-persona and left behind a supermodel. Instead, whilst the world is being sucked into her destructive vortex, he opts to kill the Dark Phoenix (with his shirt off). Seems he'd rather have a dead Phoenix than a live Jean Grey.Economically, the *X-Men* franchise has fallen victim to its own plot line: in order to recoup its astronomical budgets, it needs to homogenize its product; in doing so, it kills off impact and integrity, thereby risking *lesser* income through inferior product. This will be the last collective X-Men production; the future of the X-Men lies in their spin-offs. Already, *Wolverine* has stalked into pre-production.Yet the marketers force-feed us a cliffhanger, just in case: while Storm assumes matronly duties at the mutant school, while Beast presses White House flesh; while Wolverine insults someone and Angel flies high on CGI; while Rogue (cured of her deadly touch) and Iceman make the beast with two backs in the nearest broom closet, two sidelined Shakespearean veterans slyly find their mettle once more(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)",X-Men - The Last Stand
115,xredgarnetx,Disappointing,5,30 May 2006,"BEWARE SPOILERS! The final episode in the X-MEN trilogy proves disappointing on several levels. The script is atrocious and confusing, the actors are not nearly as compelling as they once were, and in general this second sequel flies in the face of what went before, much like the first MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE completely rewrote and dishonored its much-honored TV source. Xavier as a villain? Magneto as a hero? Cyclops disposed of in under five minutes? Angel used strictly as window dressing? These are just a few of the film's many sins. A couple of decent action sequences do not make up for a muddled plot that has the government offering a ""cure"" for mutants and Magneto trying to take over the world as usual. At least Bobby finally gets to be Iceman as we know him from the comics, and Beast shows up to provide some blurry ass-kicking near the end. Speaking of which, the final battle is way over the top, with CGI standing in for most of the live action. A ""gag"" involving Magneto redirecting the Golden Gate bridge tells us we have left any sense of even comic book reality completely behind -- and speaking of which, why is Magneto back yet again? He was unimaginably boring and pedantic in the two previous films, and is even more boring here. Tthis Magneto seems about as dangerous as a hangnail. Well, at least the series is over.

I liked it the least because many people died and Jean(Famke Jansen) is a major bitch. I know she can't control it, but could she have tried. I do like some of the new co-stars, like Kelsey Grammar as Beast. I thought The Last Stand was inventive and cool at many times, but it was a disappointment. I was happy to see that Storm(Halle Berry) finally got a big role. After the awful Catwoman, it's what she needed. I was happy to see that almost everyone from the first two returned. Though X-men: The Last stand was a disappointment, I still give it a recommendation.The Plot:When the government decides to come up with a cure for mutants, The Brother hood led by Magneto decide to act, and get revenge. It's up to the X-men to stop them. also, Jean Grey returns from the dead and causes more destruction and kills some of the X-men.",X-Men - The Last Stand
117,Angelus2,A great end to a franchise,8,22 February 2008,"The X-Men must fight a new cure developed by humans to stop the mutant gene from developing.The film is a little less about Wolverine which is good and more about the characters, something I found enlightening, yet some characters have back stories which are nothing like the comic book.Juggernaut and Charles Xavier which is probably the main one.The film has great scenes however were Wolverine fights Spike in the forest and the climax battle is definitely one to remember integrating a scene from the comic books, Wolverine killing Jean.Overall it is a good end to a well loved comic book adaption, although we could have seen a little more of Cyclops, who had no real role in any of the movie's.Hope to see a fourth or maybe a restart to the franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
118,lambiepie-2,Let the Summer..begin!,8,27 May 2006,"X-Men, the Last Stand has a lot going for it. So much so that many of the things that should have had more development and time, didn't really matter because X-Men was very entertaining and a worthy movie for the beginning of the Summer Movie Season.There is a lot going on - but the one thing I came away with was that mutants - as well as humans - have a life cycle and it is pretty much explored here. All things being equal, we got to see both sides of the fence: the mutants quest for acceptance and the humans quest for being the superior top of the food chain.But here's the thing: A few holes that were done ""just in case there IS a 4th X-Men film"" or because the character development wasn't complete or maybe a tad of each. The teens were great - except Magneto had more than the X-Men ...and that didn't make a lot of sense to me: especially in a school filled with mutant teens.And then there is Jean Grey/Phoenix. I did find a story there, but not enough of a story for her being one of the strongest mutants in the world. The director didn't do enough with this potential gem. I feel the same with Angel. A lot of opportunity there, but I didn't get much of a background from that character and I would have loved to seen more, know more about him.But...it didn't bother me too much from the popcorn entertainment value of the film. I loved it, it was a lot of fun. I do want to say the action outweighed the story - such as in X-Men 2, there was more of a story and the action and story blended nicely.But gosh.....it was great finally seeing quite a few dozen of those mutants do their thing. And Magneto? Well, what a 'yang' to Charles Xavier's 'ying' he was shown to be. He was cool in the worst sorta way but what power! I loved watching Sir Ian on the screen as this character.All in all a pretty decent beginning of the summer film season with a few holes, but a lot of good action scenes and a few things to think about when people of different natures and backgrounds try to co-exist together on this earth.",X-Men - The Last Stand

120,mstomaso,Great potential somewhat squandered,5,8 October 2006,"Just when it seems that the coexistence of mutants and Homo sapiens sapiens is secured and safe, a pharmaceutical company comes along with a ""cure"" for the X gene. The cure is offered voluntarily at first, and several troubled mutants take 'the cure'. Of course, the government immediately weaponizes it and this feeds Magneto's predictably xenophobic reaction. And by the way, Jean Grey is back... sort of... Fans of the comic books will know what that means.X-Men III is a pastiche of some of the most profoundly emotional and well conceived stories the X-Men comics have produced over several decades. In saying this, I am actually saying that some of the stories pilfered for this film are among the best that have ever appeared in the comic medium. Unfortunately, from beginning to end, this third installment suffers from detached and nearly inept directing, a mediocre script, and inconsistent characterization. Characterization is not simply inconsistent with the characters portrayed in the X-Men comics, as several reviewers here have pointed out, but inconsistent from film to film within the trilogy. The fans have it right this time, this film should have stuck much closer to the original material. In compensation, the audience is treated to some amazing visualizations and effects. And while effects also helped to make the first two movies, X-Men III subordinates characters, feeling, and intelligence to effects and plot - a fatal mistake in the comic book film genre.Having said this, I should also note that the film is not absolutely awful, but just mediocre. It is the comparison with its excellent predecessors that forces my low rating. The major message the film should carry to would-be film makers is ""don't fix what ain't broke"". In this case X3's creative team should have stuck with the original stories and the original characters rather than half-thinking out personalities and plots and trying to force so many different stories to weave into one. Less would have been much much more in this case, and the Phoenix saga would have been more than enough for an emotionally engaging and intelligent film to cap off this trilogy. The worst aspect of The Last Stand, however, is probably the clichéd, over-dramatic and unengaging soundtrack. Kudos to Famke Janssen for an outstanding performance. Hugh Jackman also handled his somewhat difficult interpretation of Wolverine well enough. The rest of the cast did what they had to do but were not given enough script to fully realize their characters.",X-Men - The Last Stand
121,sarastro7,Moronic movie-making,6,27 May 2006,"This movie had one good thing going for it: The first half hour. For the first 30 min. or so, up until the first funeral, I loved it. Perfectly produced superhero movie. Story, action, comic-book references (the Danger Room!!), lots of cool stuff. Establishing a great threat as Phoenix kills the proff.And then it all just goes poof! All gone. No characterization, nothing even remotely exciting or meaningful happens thereafter. It's just an extended version of the trailer. Nothing has an emotional impact, and the storytelling doesn't even begin to live up to the most basic of narrative requirements. How the bloody hell can the producers think that this is even remotely acceptable?Yeah, the Golden Gate thing was cool. And all the characters, and the way they used their powers. That worked. I didn't even mind that there were so many characters who didn't have much to do. What I minded was the ridiculously poor storytelling ability and the complete lack of any emotional matter or motivation on the part of the major characters. Jean Grey/Phoenix, for most of the time, was just standing around like a zombie doing *nada*! The climactic scene with her and Wolvie contained no feeling whatsoever - none! That is the worst possible betrayal of the original story.This is clearly the worst of the X-Men movies, and a tragic squandering of a great, great opportunity. I hated Hollywood yesterday and I'll hate them again tomorrow, but this movie made sure I hated Hollywood TODAY! Only the first half hour of this movie keeps it from being complete excrement, and all the four stars are for that opening third of the movie. As a whole, the movie deserves much less.4 out of 10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
122,mentalcritic,As Alien 3 is to Aliens...,2,26 May 2006,"In 2000 and 2003, two films appeared in cinemas that reaffirmed the old adage. The more you take the source material seriously when adapting a comic book to the big screen, the more successful the adaptation will be. There is another adage in film these days, namely that when the first sequel is as thrilling and life-affirming to watch as X-Men 2 was, the next sequel will be a horrendous disappointment. X-Men 3 upholds this adage like a badge of honour. To be fair, I was expecting a disappointment, but alarm bells started to ring in my head as soon as I saw that Brett Ratner had asked someone to proclaim that Einstein was not a mutant. It has been confirmed both through archival footage and the testimony of individuals who knew the man that Einstein, like Bill Gates or myself, was as close to the real-world equivalent of being a mutant as it gets. And unfortunately, with a war of words raging being Aspies and the normalists who wish to ""cure"" them, the rest of the film is insulting to the same people who cheered for X-Men 2.Among Brett Ratner's problems is an attempt to weave two plot lines together. The aforementioned curebie war is enough to sustain at least one three-hour film. Sadly, Brett tries to weave it in with the Phoenix saga, a piece of X-Men lore to which a mound of comic books as thick as a standard hardback has been devoted. This, combined with a running time that cannot sustain either plot idea, dooms the film to a ceiling of mediocrity. Another problem for Ratner is his inability to treat the demands of his cast in the manner they deserve. Halle Berry, the worst actor of both previous films, demanded a leading role, and her name appears in the leading credits of the theatrical poster. Bryan Singer would have listened to her demands before informing her the door is behind her. Put simply, she is not capable of carrying a film, and hopefully X-Men 3 will be the last time she gets the chance. Hugh Jackman does his best to outfight her mediocrity, but it is no coincidence that the worst scenes all feature her prominently. Contrary to what she seems to think, she is about as much a mutant as I am a normie.Another big problem lies in the action sequences. The previous two films kept them small, on the level of duels. As a result, the camera-work made them easy to follow, and the judgement of which side was doing what was easy. In X-Men 3, the camera whips around like a drunk in occasional shots, and making out who is fighting what gets confusing in a hurry. Making matters worse is that, in a total contrast to X-Men 2, Ratner is unable to provide a compelling reason for Xavier's mutants to fight Magneto's. Sure, Xavier and his people are dedicated to forging an alliance with humankind, but considering the behaviour of the humans in this film, that Xavier's soldiers would stoop to defending the human contingent from Magneto and his cohorts beggars belief. Find an Aspie and ask them if they would defend people who are trying to force a cure upon them from an organised Aspie army looking to prevent forced cures by any means necessary. Brett Ratner seems to think the answer is yes. Looking up the words Aspies For Freedom on the Wikipedia, for instance, will tell you a very different story.And that is the one crippling problem that X-Men 3 cannot get past. I do not know if this story was put into production because someone half-read the war of words I just spoke of and thought it would be topical, but they fumbled the ball from the get-go. What I do know is that aside from Rogue, no mutant in this film has a shred of motivation to take the cure. Were I making this film, I would have included at least one scene of a mutant who has suffered terrible abuse due to their mutations being told happily that there is a cure by family members who fail to understand the extent of their suffering. Said mutant would tell them what to go and do with themselves, simply saying ""I do not wish to become any more like you"". Considering how much abuse the normalists put anyone who shows any difference, positive or otherwise, from them through, one would expect this scenario to be literally dominated by such scenes.Are there good parts to this film? Well, yes, it is not a complete write-off. Ian McKellen proves once again that he knows far more about the subject matter than either director in the series, and that is not meant to be a put-down to Bryan Singer. Ian just hits the right notes without fail in every scene, no matter how badly written or directed it may be. I still wonder if Ratner really intended for the final shot to so accurately depict how one of our world's real mutants would feel about being cured. Hugh Jackman also manages to hit the right note every time he is in a scene, and proves himself to be at least worthy of acting in the same set as Ian. Kelsey Grammar is a very pleasant surprise, as I had always associated him with Republican politics. That he is able to portray an intelligent mutant struggling to diplomatically solve the communication problem is a credit to him. Vinnie Jones also gives a great performance as Juggernaut, portraying a mad and dangerous man as only Vinnie Jones can. So we can say at least they got the casting right, although Ratner criminally underutilises some of its best parts such as Anna Paquin.In short, X-Men 3 is a three out of ten film. On its own, it is decent, but compared to its two ten out of ten predecessors, it is insulting.",X-Men - The Last Stand
123,Victor Field,"Not X-cellent, but not X-ecrable either.",7,7 June 2006,"There were those who were worried about ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" when it was announced that Brett Ratner was directing; my worries came when I saw that the script was credited to Simon Kinberg (""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" ""xXx: State of the Union"") and Zak Penn (""Last Action Hero,"" ""Elektra"")... that this movie doesn't wind up as a bomb is a relief, therefore.That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws - some movies suffer from being too long, but with the amount of story strands in this one (Jean Grey's resurrection, Rogue's heartbreak, the discovery of a cure, and so on) the movie isn't long enough to deal with all of them satisfactorily; another half hour would have helped (the first two movies didn't have such a problem) and would have given this movie the scope it was crying out for - what should be as powerful as ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" or the final episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is instead a bit undernourished, with lots of characters and not enough heft. It would also quite possibly have removed such jarring moments as an abrupt change from day to night in one crucial scene towards the end, but as this is a No Spoilers review I won't elaborate.As well as shortchanging Rebecca Romijn's Mystique and several other mutants, the movie also suffers from some weak performances (Josef Sommer is particularly bad as the US President) and a worrying tendency to be comic book in the worst way (case in point: every single scene with Vinnie ""Why the hell is he in this movie?"" Jones's Juggernaut); Ratner might have been advised to take a tip from ""Prison Break"" and let other people... say, Bryan Singer... direct while he took executive producer credit. (And yes, I realise Ratner did the first episode.) The main cast members are for the most part effective, both veterans (Stewart, McKellen, Jackman, Janssen, Paquin, Berry etc) and newcomers (Ellen Page, in addition to benefitting from the most convincing FX in the movie, is wonderful as Kitty); John Powell's terrific score is another plus, and even the general semi-dumbed-down approach can't hide the intelligence underneath the concept and the ambitious ideas. It still falls short of the first two films, yes, but there's still a big gap between ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and, say, ""Daredevil."" (And I thought I had figured out what the post-credits scene would be like... I was, happily, wrong.)",X-Men - The Last Stand
124,Beta_Gallinger,"With a different director and lacklustre writing, it isn't quite the same",5,23 April 2008,"Like ""X2"", I saw this third installment in the ""X-Men"" trilogy on the silver screen. Back in 2006, I was very impressed with ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", and couldn't understand all the criticism! However, watching it again on the small screen, I sort of wondered why I liked it so much in the theatre. When I saw it on the big screen, I hadn't seen either of its predecessors too recently, whereas when I saw it again on the small screen, I had just seen both ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" again, and could see that this third film wasn't quite the same, and not in a good way. This could be why I could then understand why it's widely considered a disappointment.A ""cure"" for mutation has been invented, which can turn mutants into part of the rest of the human population. This provokes an uproar among the mutants, as some want to be ""cured"" (including Rogue, as she wants to be able to touch people without hurting them), while many others strongly object to the new potion and to the belief that their special X-Factor gene is a disease. When Magneto learns about this, and obviously objects, he forms an army of fellow mutants called the Brotherhood and plans to start a war against non-mutated humans! Professor Charles Xavier and most of his X-Men also object to this new ""cure"" for their powers, but with their hope for peace between mutants and the rest of humanity, they obviously don't support the Brotherhood's plans, so they must once again fight against him and his mutants! For Xavier's side, it doesn't help that Jean Gray, who was lost in the last mission, has been resurrected, but is now controlled by the power of the Phoenix, making her evil and extremely powerful! With this demon inside her, she joins Magneto's side! When I saw this in the theatre, I didn't know it had a different director than the previous two efforts. However, I am now aware of the fact that ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" were directed by Bryan Singer, and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" was directed by Brett Ratner, apparently so Singer could direct ""Superman Returns"" instead. I haven't seen any of Ratner's other films, but he doesn't seem to be as well-liked as Singer, and judging by this film, I think I can understand. The first major action scene takes place too early in the film, and the action sequences sometimes seem like Power Rangers ones, though they never get so bad that they're funny. The sex scene involving Jean and Logan is also lame. If Ratner wasn't involved in the writing for this movie, then I guess he isn't entirely responsible for its low quality, so I don't know exactly how much of this is his fault. The writing is also a tad disorganized, throwing in some characters who aren't in the first two films without properly introducing them, such as Hank McCoy. The story also certainly isn't as touching or deep as the first two sometimes are, or at least the second.Fortunately, the film isn't all bad. There are some fairly tense moments, especially towards the end. Still, even 6/10 is not quite the same as the 8 I gave 2000's ""X-Men"", and the 9 I gave ""X2"". I think the best parts come around the end, and the film isn't usually that entertaining. So, the first sequel turned out to be superior to the original, which doesn't usually seem to happen with sequels, but sometimes does, and then the third installment turned out to be significantly inferior to the previous two. If you ask me, the same happened with ""Spider-Man"", another popular recent comic book movie trilogy. Well, ""Spider-Man 4"" has apparently been confirmed, and an ""X-Men"" prequel called ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is also in the works, so let's hope they both show an improvement after ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and ""Spider-Man 3"".",X-Men - The Last Stand
125,vip_ebriega,The series 'X'-cels again.,7,18 July 2008,"My Take: It's just as imperfect as the first two was, but when it's fun, it doesn't disappoint. One of the first big must-see summer blockbusters of 2006, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is everything what you'd come to expect from a loud an reasonably entertaining finale of a long-running, big-budget franchise. This may not be the best in the series, it's certainly the most action-packed, even if it isn't exactly as kind to its writing department like the second film. THE LAST STAND, nonetheless, is an improvement over the original (and I kinda like that film), not just in terms of special effects, but also its pacing and writing, but basically more on pacing as the second was more on the writing. For fans, THE LAST STAND sorts out every single cliffhanger, plot strand and question thrown at you in the previous films, some of which you rarely thought of. To everyone else, like myself, who simply walks into a film like the X-MEN franchise expecting a pure summer popcorn bonanza, will have a grand time in pure ""check-your-brains-at-the-door"" entertainment.The plot in this finale concerns the discovery of a ""cure"" for mutants who kill off their mutant cells, therefore making them as human as the next guy. The X-Men, led by Professor X (Patrick Stewart), feel that mutation is not a disease in which it can be cured by a simple antidote, but their approach of the situation is more on curiosity and concern. While the ever-rebellious Magneto (Ian McKellen) feels that the Human race has gone too far, and decides to build his own mutant army, recruiting every mutant in America, to rebel against the ""cure"" project. While this war ensues, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is reunited with Jean Grey, know a mind-controlling juggernaut who destroys everything in her path.Every single thing you could possibly think of to finish the series are resolved here, and even if it is beyond your concern, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND will still delight its audience with pure action-packed popcorn-chomping excitement. The film makes you care less of plot and screenplay and lets you drown more on action the best that visual effects have to offer. With that and all, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND makes a great start for yet another busy year of popular action blockbusters.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",X-Men - The Last Stand
126,educallejero,Entertaining and that's about it,6,15 June 2021,"The ending of the trilogy is the best, but not by far. It's just way more entertaining, with less terrible romantic and over melodramatic scenes and more action set pieces with a more diverse use of the mutant powers.At least we have a movie that knows that it wants to be (action) and deals with the romances so prevalent before with appropriate attention. But because it is forced to close those stories it wastes precious time without caring to do it with any quality and the movie suffers from it, making everything weightless and the scenes and characters a bit too empty.Anyways, this is a better ending that you could've expected watching the two that came before, but it doesn't make it great.",X-Men - The Last Stand

128,fwomp,X-Men Probably Won't Be X'd Out,6,30 May 2006,"Learning how to keep an audience enthralled is one of the essential curves for good cinema. For me, it's all about the characters. Always has been, always will be. And on many levels, this third installment in the X-Men movie series succeeds.After having watched Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) die in the second film, I felt that the series directors, screenwriters, producers, etc., were beginning to understand what audiences need. But then we have Dr. Grey return in X-Men: The Last Stand. The emptiness of her passing was now miraculously refilled as we learn that Jean is not in control of her faculties. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) had previously held Jean's mind in check by separating her destructive side from her more controllable one. Jean was (is) a level five mutant, one with unlimited power. But with that power comes a fractured mind. Something called ""The Phoenix"" (uh-boy, not that name again) lives inside Jean's head and refuses to be reigned in. A path of destruction and death reels before Jean as The Phoenix part of her mind takes control.Against this we have the discovery (by humans, of course) of a ""cure"" for the mutant gene. This cure lives (naturally) inside the body of a little mutant boy who's kept out of harms way at a new facility that rests on old Alcatraz Island in San Francisco.Magneto (Ian McKellen) sees this as a threat to everything he stands for. It's only a matter of time, he believes, until the government makes it mandatory for all mutants to be ""cured"" of their ""disease"".A personal, social, governmental, and worldwide movement begins on three fronts. First is Magneto's group of mutants who want this ""cure"" threat destroyed before it falls into the wrong hands. Secondly, we have the government who says that the vaccinations are strictly voluntary and want to protect the child/cure. And in-between them we have the X-Men. Battling amongst themselves as much as any external threats, we begin to see the extreme price the X-Men are willing to pay in order for peace.New mutants abound in this third film. First, we have something called ""The Beast"" (Kelsey Grammar), a blue cowardly lion with anger management issues that acts as a Presidential aide between mutants and humans. I don't know why, but I half expected to see Lilith from Cheers come stomping in and pull him out of a scene by his ear. Go figure. Secondly, we have The Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), a bulky um guy who gets rolling and can't be stopped. And finally, we see Angel (Ben Foster), a winged boy whose inability to accept the ""cure"" ends up saving someone very close to him.Although this film is subtitled ""The Last Stand"", I seriously doubt if it'll be ""The Last Film."" An end scene with a ""cured"" Magneto opens up an entirely new miasma of questions: Does the cure really work? Or is Magneto immune? Will mutants need to be re-vaccinated every so often? I feel pretty confident that X-Men movie aficionados haven't seen the last of Wolverine or Storm.",X-Men - The Last Stand
129,Bob-45,X-Men 2.2,5,9 January 2007,"""X-Men 3: The Last Stand"" is so underdeveloped, it plays as more a continuation than a sequel to the fine ""X-Men 2"". While better paced, more exciting and with much better special effects than the first ""X-Men"" film, the paucity of character development, alas, makes it the weakest entry so far in the series. The film is further drained of urgency by the elimination of two of the most compelling mutants during the first quarter of the film and a pivotal character by the half-way point. Some interesting characters from ""X-Men 2"" are, here, no where to be found. While Kelsey Grammar does his best to make his role interesting, he simply has too little to do. Halle Berry, usually so effective, lacks resonance or substance in her nonaction dramatic scenes. ""X-Men 3"" is certainly an entertaining time killer, but nothing more than that. I give ""X-Men 3"" a 5.",X-Men - The Last Stand
130,jon.h.ochiai,Taking a Stand,10,27 May 2006,"Brett Ratner assumed the helm of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" when Bryan Singer had forsaken completion of the ""X-Men"" trilogy to direct ""Superman Returns"". Concerns regarding Director Ratner's vision of the Final Act of the beloved trilogy are unwarranted. Ratner along with screenwriters Simon Kinberg (""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"") and Zak Penn ignite new energy in the X-Men saga, and provide an emotional catharsis in ""The Last Stand"". Hugh Jackman returning as hero Logan emerges as a powerful force in this dramatic story arc. Consider the context: ""X-Men"" has transcended from comic book adaptation to heroic mythology on its own. Mutants born with the X gene, the source of their great powers, are also cursed in a society that professes diversity without the distinction of profound acceptance. In ""X-Men"" the Mutant plight is a metaphor for the danger of prejudice in all its forms. The Mutants fall into two polarized factions in confronting prejudice. Those who follow Dr. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) believe the path lies in tolerance, and protecting those who may hate them that being humans. Eric Lensherr (Magneto) proclaims, ""We (Mutants) are the cure!"" Magneto (powerful Ian McKellen), a Holocaust survivor, believes in his heart that Humans are calling for the genocide of all Mutants, and in fact that Mutants are the next evolution of Humanity. A war is coming, and Magneto intends to win. Lensherr asks, ""Who will you stand with?"" In ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" a ""cure"" for mutation now exists. Dr. Hank McCoy (unrecognizable Kelsey Grammar), Secretary of Mutant Affairs, informs Xavier, Storm (Halle Berry), and Logan (Jackman) that a mutant vaccine has been discovered and manufactured by a major pharmaceutical company that is being offered to the public. The vaccine suppresses the Mutant X gene allowing the recipient to live a ""normal"" life. Storm points out that there is ""nothing to cure"". The key to the ""cure"" lies in Mutant Jimmy/ Leech (Cameron Bright), who has the paradoxical power to neutralize a Mutant's powers. Warren Worthington II (Michael Murphy), whose company manufactures the vaccine, intends to cure his mutant son Warren (Ben Foster).On a more personal note, both Scott Summers (James Marsden) and Logan (Jackman) are dealing with the loss of Jean Grey (charismatic Famke Janssen), who sacrificed her life to save her fellow X-Men. Scott has withdrawn emotionally, telling Logan, ""No one heals as fast as you do..."" Apparently, Jean is telepathically communicating with Scott. For those familiar with the comic book, this follows the Dark Phoenix saga. Flashback 20 years ago, as then ""School for the Gifted"" partners Xavier and Lensherr visit the Grey household to talk with young Jean, who is a rare ""class 5 mutant"". Jean demonstrates terrifying telekinetic prowess. Here writers Kinberg and Penn expertly spin our allegiance. Xavier, questioning Jean's capacity for restraint, imposes subconscious controls upon her power, part of the Dark Phoenix origin. What is captivating: Xavier's actions are all control and for normalcy, and not at all about freedom. So does this make Lensherr freedom's champion? Perhaps. Although the militant Magneto (Lensherr) is all about ""The ends justify the means."" Ian McKellen is simply compelling as the charismatic Magneto. His is a strange wisdom in the matter. This ideological paradox along with the visually stunning physical conflict distinguishes ""The Last Stand"". Famke Janssen as Jean Grey and Dark Phoenix is a surprisingly powerful presence as she battles to retain a vestige of her own humanity. The love story of Jean and Logan (Jackman) is heartbreaking, and the soul of ""The Last Stand"". Logan pleads with Jean, ""(I would die) for you!"" ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is Hugh Jackman's movie. He is the right actor for the right role. Jackman is powerful. As Logan, he delicately balances this unbridled rage and touching compassion. Jackman also embodies the hero's honor which is the core value of ""X-Men"". Logan is not a nice guy by any means. But no one fights as fiercely or has as noble a spirit as Logan doescredit Jackman again. Logan's forest fight scene is totally amazing. Jackman looks phenomenal and has such a physical presence. No one does hero like Jackman. Oscar winner Halle Berry fairs much better here in Act III. As Storm, Xavier anointed leader of the X-Men, Berry is very strong and the voice of reason. The stunning Berry's cool presence and composure are finally capitalized upon. Patrick Stewart gives a renewed passion and complexity to Xavier, whose character until now seemed void of gray. Stewart is valiant as a character serving penance for a grave misdeed. Of the numerous new mutants, Kitty (Ellen) and Colossus (David Cudmore) distinguish themselves. Some of the familiar characters like Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Mystique (Rebecca Romajin) have been delegated to background stories. One of the weaknesses of ""The Last Stand"" is the introduction of way too many characters. ""The Last Stand"" is also stripped of some welcome exposition in its lean 105 minutes. However, Ratner's alacrity does do justice to the story. Like great mythology, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" tells a story of impassioned conflict, courage, love, and honor. This is a great ""Last Stand"". And perhaps, this is not the last, after all.",X-Men - The Last Stand
131,DarthBill,"An entertaining, professional effort by Brett Ratner, but still suffers from the same problem that the first two X-Men films suffered from.",6,2 June 2006,"Plot in a nutshell: Picking up not long after #2, a supposed ""cure"" is found for the mutant factor, stirring up tempers on both sides of the mutant and human front, pitting noble mutant savior Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) heroic, S&M leather clad X-Men against anti-hero terrorist with a heart of gold Magneto (Ian McKellan) and his rag tag Brotherhood of mutants once again. The unexpected and uncontrollable factor - the resurrected Jean Grey, AKA: Phoenix (Famke Janssen).I must confess I've had a love/hate relationship with the X-Men films for some time now. While they are generally well made, they make the mistake of placing too much emphasis on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and not enough emphasis on the other X-Men, which is truly sad because the X-Men is meant to be an ensemble piece, not a showcase for Wolverine with the X-Men as his supporting cast. All three movies made the mistake of working it around how the X-Men figure into Wolverine's life; it should be how Wolverine fits into the X-Men's existence, not the other way around. Cyclops (James Marsden) in particular, such an important character in the X-Men comics, has always been mistreated in the film adaptations, and he is similarly mistreated here, killed off within the first 15 minutes of the film by his one true love, the resurrected Jean Grey, now possessed by her demi-goddess alter ego the Phoenix, who then dispatches a slightly more callous than usual Xavier. Cyclops deserved better. Another character long mistreated by the films would be Rogue, still played by a miscast Anna Pacquin, though she gets considerably less screen time here.Another slight problem is the way it handles new characters. This film finally introduces Beast/Dr. Henry ""Hank"" McCoy, well played by Cheers/Frasier veteran Kelsey Grammar, but Angel/Warren Worthington III, played by Ben Foster, is treated as little more than angelic eye candy, as if his only purpose is to look pretty while soaring through the sky with heavenly music. Colossus, again played by the powerfully built Daniel Cudmore, serves little more than as an action figure, though it is great to see him for what few minutes he gets. Which is not to say the film is terrible. While not quite as smooth/slick as the first two films by Bryan Singer, who abandoned the franchise to helm ""Superman Returns"" (which doesn't look promising), the much maligned Brett Ratner still churns out a professional summer roller coaster effort. In addition to the eye popping violence, there is a very sweet, tender scene following Xavier's funeral where Bobby ""Iceman"" Drake (Shawn Ashmore) takes shy, sensitive, soft spoken Kitty Pryde (here played by the yummy little Ellen Page) ice skating, much to the aggravation of Rogue. There is also a scene both arousing and heart-breaking for Mystique/Raven Darkholme, played by Rebecca Romijn, where a guard tries to shoot Magneto with a cure loaded dart, and she takes it to save him. Mystique then collapses, trembling violently as her scaly blue skin gives way to pale human skin, her slick red hair becomes silky black and her yellow eyes become blue, and she is just laying there completely naked while Magneto stares at her in shock, and then leaves her there, completely naked and helpless, informing her that she no longer one of them, but now one with the enemy. And the look of betrayal on the naked Mystique's face is heart-breaking because it is not only a forced rebirth, but she looks violated, for Mystique now looks like a rape victim, a virgin who lost her innocence against her will, for the mutant power that she had come to take pride in has been stripped away from her, and she is left alone, a weak, frail, fragile naked human, yet she does not belong on either side now, and her sacrifice goes unappreciated by the very man she had come to believe in, who merely shrugs it off and abandons Mystique in her naked vulnerability just when she needs him the most. Thus Mystique's loss of her mutant powers along with her loss of faith in Magneto serves as a symbolic rape or violation, and she is left alone, powerless, helpless and naked, but vengeful. Iceman's tender moment with Kitty, along with the struggle he and Rogue both feel to maintain their relationship, combined with the metaphorical, symbolic rape of Mystique, the innocence of a character like Kitty VS the loss of innocence of Mystique, and Magneto's reaction to the death of Xavier, help to remind the audience of the humanity within the characters as they try to persevere and suffer in the world. Jackman is fine as usual in his neo-Han Solo way, but many of those emotional scenes for him, both regarding Xavier and Jean, should have been played out by Cyclops. Famke Janssen seems to enjoy being the bad Jean, and Ian McKellan is dependable as usual as Magneto, as is Patrick Stewart as Xavier, though Stewart seemed a bit tired. Halle Berry is alright as Storm, finally given an opportunity to whip some ass.",X-Men - The Last Stand
132,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Kind of a weak end to a good trilogy.,6,12 March 2019,"What a difference a director makes. While the previous two films in this franchise used Bryan Singer, the choice to go with Brett Ratner in this final film of the trilogy was a mistake. There was a tone and style to the previous X-Men movies that was just never quite captured in this one. The comedy seemed unnatural, the plot wasn't taken quite seriously enough, and the new characters were never given enough time to really fully develop. Perhaps some of the weakness of this film can be blamed on the previous two films being strong, independent storylines, thus not giving much to tie into a conclusive chapter of a trilogy.Despite X2 (2003) not holding to the traditional form of ""the trilogy conundrum"", the fact that X-Men III has to start with some very main characters missing is a plot point that requires viewers to have seen the previous film. The concept of a ""mutant cure"" definitely gives the film a good sense of finality (regardless of its pre- and post-credits scenes), except that much of the focus of the film is on Jean Grey's (Famke Janssen) unrivaled power bringing untold destruction to everywhere she visits. The distracted nature of the subplots and way too many new mutant introductions really waters down the whole film.I also understand that the end of a trilogy should bring some finality, but I really didn't like how they essentially kill everyone off in one way or another. Of course, this is just below my dislike of the cop-outs to bring characters back after they had been killed or disabled. Now that Bryan Singer has directed two more X-Men films in this six-film saga, none of this even matters anyway; essentially giving Singer a way to show us all how he would have ended the trilogy were he given the chance.Kind of a weak end to a good trilogy, I give X-Men: The Last Stand 3.0 stars out of 5.",X-Men - The Last Stand
133,jluis1984,The result of Rushed project...,4,9 June 2006,"""X-Men: The Last Stand"", chapter three of the film adventures of Marvel Comic's most popular superhero team has finally arrived after a long chain of pre-production problems and repeated changes in the crew. Sadly, all this problems are reflected in the final product and it is safe to say that the studio's insistence on making the film on time to compete with ""Superman Returns"" no matter the cost is directly responsible of the mediocre results of the film.The movie starts off with a ""cure"" for the mutations being discovered, giving the mutants a chance to abandon their powers and become ""normal""; this discovery is taken by the powerful mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen) as a threat and decides to eliminate it causing a confrontation with Prof. Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) X-Men. In the middle of the confrontation a tremendous source of power appears that seems to be linked to the deceased Jean Grey (Famke Janssen).Brett Ratner takes on the spot left by previous director Bryan Singer and attempts to continue exploring the universe Singer and his writers developed in this adaptation of the comic book. While writers Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg construct an intriguing plot that continues the story arc set by the previous movie, they fail to develop believably the characters and in an obvious attempt to include as many new mutants as possible, they forget to give them a purpose to be there.The visual style follows the same realistic sci-fi vibe that Singer created for the previous movies, keeping a continuity in design that is very effective. However, Ratner's movie feels too short, or more exactly, too fast; as its non-stop pace makes one wish they had not rushed the project because the amount of continuity errors and overall the film's poor edition are fatal flaws that terribly affect the movie. The epic-scale tale penned by Penn and Kinberg is left as another typical and predictable ""good VS evil"" fight with terrible plot twists and bad characterization.The acting is average at best, with Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart being (as usual) the best in their roles. Jackman's Wolverine, who is probably the only character who receives attention from the writers, is still very good, although his lack of chemistry with Janssen is apparent. the rest of the cast is as dull as usual, and not because the actors are bad, it is just that their talents are wasted in pointless roles. Complex characters such as Rogue (Anna Paquin), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) or the newly introduced Beast (a superb Kelsey Grammar) are reduced to shadows of their former selves.The special effects range from outstanding to cheap looking, and this big variation in quality makes one suspect that Ratner had not enough resources to work with. This is could be called the trademark of this film: there are things that are simply outstanding while others are very, very disappointing; leaving an overall mediocre result and definitely not a worthy follow up to what Singer had accomplished in the previous two movies.Director Singer and his writers build up a universe where the audience not familiar with the characters could enjoy a coherent and entertaining story; in contrast, Ratner's attempt to continue Bryan Singer's labor in the X-Men saga ends up as an inconsistent and weak episode in the series, and surely will disappoint not only fans of the comic book, but also fans of the first two movie episodes.",X-Men - The Last Stand
134,ivo-cobra8,A good X-Men movie but a minor disappointment.,7,25 October 2015,"X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) is a good superhero movie, but way down than the first two films were. It wasn't a bad film that would be Days of Future Past and Origins Wolverine I just like this film a lot of better then the new X-Men films. Well I love it. It is my favorite movie of all X-Men. People who criticize this movie and saying bad things about it seriously get the hell out of my face and you don't get it at all. [:To me it was a great movie and I love it. I love the new mutants they are more mutants. At the end they are all six mutants. I am a fan of Wolverine and Storm. I love when Wolverine was fighting against mutants and Magneto's army in the woods he come back for Jean Phoenix. Than they find a cure against mutants to become a humans again it was a little boy and Magneto wanted him dead. The fight scene between Pyro and iceman was fantastic. Pyro was with Professor X in the second movie but than he cross the line and he become magneto's alley. Mystique become human again after one cop throw on Magneto the cure and she saved him. What Magneto did? He throw her away because she was a human and he said she is not one of them anymore. So Mystique betrayed magneto and she told authorities were is Magneto's hide out. ""Hell has no fury like a women scorned."" Jean Phoenix did died at the end of the second movie but she come back in this one. Wolverine loved her more than Cyclops actually did. It was sad that he had to killed her at the end but she was a treat to all of us. The first appearance of Henry 'Hank' McCoy / Beast he was never mentioned in the first two movies. I love the finale battle, they are more mutants in this one, than they were in the first two movies. Final conclusion and end to the trilogy. Wolverine stays at the school at the end without professor X I really love it. I know a lot of people will say that I am stupid for liking this movie. And I am really not a big comic book fan of this movie because I don't know everything but I really love it. But is not my best favorite movie.X-Men: The Last Stand has a few put holes and errors: Like death of Professor X the return of Phoenix from the grave when she died at the end of the second movie. Mysterious death of Scott Summers Cyclops. I also don't think that he is dead, there was no body and he does also not do anything in this movie. Than Rouge,she doesn't fly she doesn't even fight. All she does is complaining and waning about been a mutant and not been a human. She is useless here. The third installment into the trilogy, is a good film in their own way. But not my best favorite movie. That would be X2 and than is X-Men because, it is the first movie I watch in the summer 2001 on tape and it is the second best one for me. X2: X-Men United is better than both of them together but to me are all three good one of the X-Men trilogy. What could have been an epic conclusion to the X-trodinary trilogy, was a minor disappointment, Gone is Byran Singer who left the project to direct Superman Returns, in comes Bret (I only work with Jackie Chan) Ratner. He's OK, but he's no Singer. It also sucks that characters you care for get killed off in such un-ethical ways. Oh well. It is not the film that people except but is not by the worst one for me. I love action and this is a science fiction, action flick. It has a lot of changes which it sucks but it is still an enjoyable flick. Experience the awesome power of The X-Men's epic, final battle. Join well-known mutant heroes and villains, and meet a cadre of all-new warriors -- including Angel, Beast, Juggernaut and Colossus -- in this thrilling, explosive adventure! After a controversial cure is discovered, mutants can choose to retain their superhuman abilities or give up their unique gifts and become normal. When peaceful mutant leader Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) clashes with his militant counterpart, Magneto (Ian McKellen), the battle lines are drawn for the war to end all wars. Bursting with nonstop action and spectacular special effects, X-Men The Last Stand is a force of nature that will blow you away!I am sorry if you disagree with me.

135,fernandoschiavi,A good ending for the first trilogy of the mutants,7,1 October 2016,"Years after the debut of the movies of the mutants, comes to an end this first trilogy of the franchise. The main low for this third film is the director Bryan Singer, commander of the previous films, which hit with Superman - The Return (2006), is offering to direct the 3rd film of the X-Men then. However, like Fox wanted to launch the 3rd film in the series in 2006, he decided to replace it with another director. Singer eventually led to the sets of Superman Returns filming, much of the technical team of the previous films in the X-Men series. Among them were the composer and editor John Ottman, photographer Newton Thomas Sigel and writers Mike Dougherty and Dan Harris.The script by Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn has many positives with some twists and emotional scenes. The narrative basically has two plots occurring in parallel: the history of Phoenix and the discovery of the cure for the mutants that will converge in the decisive climax, of course. Behind the discovery of a cure, again, as is intrinsic these characters, the question of prejudice (which even made a mutant being inserted into the top government to address issues between humans and mutants) and issue of coexistence that would becoming more peaceful between humans and mutants to cure be announced and, above all, the consequences that would bring after choose between returning to a normal life or accept what is and remain on the margins of society, but can opt for it now .The big X-Men Trump: The Last Stand is the establishment of the mutant race as a social reality. They are already far more accepted in society and to have a representative in the government to deal with specific issues that may interfere with the peaceful coexistence between humanity and mutants. If this element had been more exploited, probably this third adaptation rival with the others in importance. Even as a well-designed script. Out the character development, the most deepest issues of prejudice and gets a lot of action, whose aim is the simple entertainment without major insights.Notoriously, in more capable hands, the script could be more developed. The question of healing for a new breed created from a mutation in the genetic code already yield a discussion at the political level, moral and social and how to diffuse within the minority - there would be those who be neutral, others who would join and those who would be against the cure, causing in them a veiled conflict and, why not, prejudice. There was the possibility of criticism of the government and the pharmaceutical industry, which would certainly want to profit from the discovery of a mutant healing and the possibility of a racial cleansing. Mutants are even ""sick"" and should be ""cured""? These issues are addressed very superficially.The action scenes are spectacular and the effects have taken a giant leap in relation especially to the first film in the trilogy, specialist merits in action, Brett Ratner. Along with the sound editing some scenes were with an incredible result. The great visual effects are even better on the soundtrack always brilliant John Powell gave the touch of anticipation, adrenaline and drama in propitious times. The photo and direction once again fall in art to perfection in magnificent scenery and in the apocalyptic and decisive climate that was built gradually. While some sequences could yield more, others were well fitted and held. Some scenes that give emphasis are in the mutant Angel tries to hide his father springs wings in a very strong and well-directed scene. Another scene that was great was the psychological confrontation between Professor Xavier and Jean Grey, where we first notion of the real power of Jean in a sequence of breathtaking and with a sad ending and impressive at the same time. Not to mention all the final sequence with the struggles between the two ""armies of mutants"" on Alcatraz Island, which plays out the thrilling climax. The scene where Magneto rescues Mysticism and liberates other mutants of military cars is also a show of visual effects as well as the displacement of the Golden Gate Bridge by Magneto to Alcatraz Island and all the final climax, built darkly, impact and with all the grandeur that the time required within the plot.The exchange director brought some specific features for this movie. Director Brett Ratner replaced the heart, emotion (and character development) of the X-Men previous films with more action, which is not exactly a problem. Because it is a conclusion of the trilogy, with an issue as urgent and impact for all humanity and especially for the mutants, a more somber mood and conclusions to various stories that have come developing gradually over three films was more expected as well as more grandiose stunts and fights and a final battle memorable. Brett Ratner knew entertain, keep many of the narratives and visual characteristics of the previous films and raise the level of their specialty action. A good end to a trilogy that started the ball rolling for the superhero movies that invade increasingly dark cinema halls.",X-Men - The Last Stand
136,Animany94,Rushed and over crowded story.,5,17 June 2019,"As a stand-alone movie, X-Men: The Last Stand is about average superhero stuff with decent action scenes and a couple of eye-popping sceneries here and there, but it sadly pales as a follow-up to X2, which had so many deep character moments.X-Men: The Last Stand is filled with awesome characters, but almost non of them have any moments which makes you care for them. And those who did were either tossed away or had rushed arcs. The two opening scenes including Jean Grey and Angel were promising and made me think that this movie could be powerful, but then the feeling of two plots being strung together ensued.I think if the writers had decided to focus solely on the Pheonix Saga it could have worked, because a good portion of it actually worked out pretty well, but with the overall plot being the development of a cure for mutation, it felt like two different plotlines not being well connected.Yeah, I didn't find it insufferable, but it was a disappointment after watching the two predecessors both of which I still value as comicbook masterpieces.",X-Men - The Last Stand
137,cchase,'X-Termination' of 'X-cellence?',8,4 June 2006,"With the assignment of directorial duties to series newcomer Brett Ratner, (RUSH HOUR 1 & 2; Fox TV's PRISON BREAK), much of the heart, humor and wit brought to X-MEN by fanboy-at-heart Bryan Singer is absolutely M.I.A., and the larger themes of discrimination, assimilation and intolerance become almost afterthoughts in service to driving everything and everyone towards the franchise climax: ""The Big Battle.""LAST STAND begins, we can only assume, a few years after the events of X-MEN UNITED transpired, climaxing with the noble death of Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Storm (Halle Berry), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Cyclops (James Marsden) have taken a more active role in the day-to-day administration of Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Children. Well, actually that would be Storm and Wolverine. Cyclops is still too torn up over the death of his beloved Jean to do anybody much good, so gone is the testosterone-fueled banter that sparked the amusing-if-contentious relationship between himself and Wolverine.Magneto (Ian McKellen) is out of sight but most definitely not out of the minds of Our Heroes or the Feds. It would take a major event of seismic proportions to bring Xavier's buddy-turned-nemesis out into the open, and one finally happens: subsidized by the Government, Worthington Labs manages to formulate a ""cure"" for the mutants to provide them with the choice to revert back to their human selves, if they wish.Big news, indeed, and it can only be delivered to the School by a big messenger: hulking and hirsute blue-furred Former Secretary of Mutant Affairs Dr. Hank McCoy, a.k.a. Beast (played to the hilt by former FRASIER star Kelsey Gramm er.) The possibilities split the mutant world immediately into two camps: those who see it as a godsend and those who revile it as a veiled form of genetic fascism, bordering on actual genocide. Storm comes down in favor of the latter camp, (and as it has been pointed out a number of times, she IS biased, guilty of not only being one of the hotter mutants, but also of possessing the coolest powers bar none), where mutants like the forlorn Marie, aka Rogue (Anna Paquin), take the former stance. Rogue, after all, would like to have a boyfriend she could actually hug and kiss without worrying about killing him, said boyfriend in this case being Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore).Meanwhile, as Magneto uses the controversy as a catalyst to reunite his renegade mutant band and to amass an entire army of rogue mutants, some weird psychic vibes that profoundly affect Cyclops compel him to return to Alkali Lake, the scene of the previous movie's climax, where he discovers a revived Jean Grey. Not to give a lot away, but some major stuff goes down, leaving Jean to be discovered by Storm and Logan.Xavier (Patrick Stewart) offers an explanation for Jean's return. To say that she's ""not quite herself"" is a gross understatement, as her new persona, 'Dark Phoenix,' makes herself known in some unexpected and frightening ways.So the stage is finally set for a war where it's good mutants vs. bad, which may be irrelevant if the unpredictable powers of the ""new"" Jean Grey winds up destroying everything and everyone indiscriminately, be it Man or Mutant.This is probably oversimplifying everything just a tad, but I've done it for two reasons: 1) so that this review can be as spoiler-free as possible, and 2) to mirror the more simplistic approach taken by director-for-hire Ratner.As a result, LAST STAND looks great, has the pre-requisite dazzling special effects sequences, (the Golden Gate bridge sequence is the centerpiece of the whole movie), a magnificent score by John Powell, and all of the bells and whistles provided by whipcrack editing and sharp cinematography. But in serving his own vision of the film, Ratner also short-shrifts his cast for some unique opportunities to shine, and that's a shame.Halle Berry's Storm, who looks better than she has before in the previous two films, really doesn't have that much more to do. In fact, Beast, a ""new kid on the block"", gets about as much screen time as she does, and both deserved more. Same with new hero Warren Worthington III, aka Angel (a newly buffed-out Ben Foster of SIX FEET UNDER and HOSTAGE), whose first appearance packs as much visual punch as either Beast or Jean Grey, (not to mention the metaphor of his mutation representing a kind of ""coming out"" adds even more of an edge to the themes of discrimination and assimilation), but then he's gone for much of the movie and doesn't reappear until things are almost over.And then there's Jean/Dark Phoenix. Resurrected by who-knows-what, (the anguish of Cyclops? the threat of mutant annihilation?) the psychological baggage she brings with her dangerous and exponentially growing powers make her the most compelling character in this installment, yet the scenes that involve her use (or abuse) of her talents seem cribbed from the best work of Brian De Palma and David Cronenberg, (hawkeyed buffs will recognize lifts from CARRIE, THE FURY and SCANNERS immediately).For those not into analyzing every frame of a summer blockbuster, who are just content to ""go with the flow"", this will all seem like fussy nitpicking. And maybe it is. But for my money, I still found myself missing Bryan Singer's signature touches deeply, and regret that he couldn't stick with the franchise that is basically his baby, though the mind reels at the prospect of what he has contributed to the rebirth of the SUPERMAN series.All-in-all, not a bad day at the movies, this. But I'm hoping that whatever is on the boards next, they'll have Bryan back to do a little ""clean-up"" work.",X-Men - The Last Stand
138,Danusha_Goska,Kinda Klunky; Good Actors Poorly Used,5,4 June 2006,"This ""X-Men"" is pure standard issue, the kind of comic book movie Hollywood could crank out with its eyes closed. It lacks the occasional moments of transcendent magic that have made some comic book movies special, and attract fans of other genres.There's the by-now-standard-issue scene where an American Landmark, in this case the Golden Gate Bridge, is targeted by destructive forces. One thing we can say comic book movies and Al Qaeda have in common: they both want to blow up American landmarks in cinematic ways.A bad guy forces the Golden Gate Bridge to perform unnatural acts. And it's an amazingly flat, uninteresting scene. Nothing like its predecessors: the blown up White House in ""Independence Day,"" etc.Famke Janssen, as a powerful female mutant in a very bad mood, causes a suburban home to explode, and the scene is just not very fun to watch. It just looks ... messy. Who's going to sweep up all the broken glass and toppled jelly jars? And Janssen's powers, not directed by her, but manipulated by powerful men, are ultimately pretty passive and boring. I've seen women going through a particularly bad time of the month who were more intimidating.A key character dies; one should be moved. Uh uh.There are many interesting characters in this movie, played by great actors: Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, Kelsey Grammar, Anna Paquin, Halle Berry, Shoreh Aghdashloo, etc. And the director could not care less about them. They may as well be random shoppers at a mall; they just mill around.I was almost certain that I could sense Bill Duke, playing a presidential aid, delivering his lines with a complete sense of boredom and disdain for the jumbled nature of the scenes in which he found himself. It's as if he was just putting absolutely no energy into what he was doing, and as if he was daring the director, or the audience, to even notice his complete lack of investment.""X-Men 3"" is not a bad movie. It's reasonably fun. There's the interesting theme of Charles Xavier as Martin Luther King, and Ian Mckellan as Malcolm X. Hugh Jackman is a tremendously charismatic actor, and he makes anything worth watching.I just wish that the director had taken the time to make the scenes stunning, rather than just serviceable, the action thrilling, rather than just standard issue, and the characters moving, rather than just disposable.",X-Men - The Last Stand
139,Agent_Iris,A misfire,4,11 October 2020,"While there were moments of fun action and surprisingly good casting (Kelsey Grammer as Beast), this film was a bit of a mess.It combined two famous X-Men storylines from the comics: The Cure and The Dark Phoenix sagas and managed to screw both of them up big time. Abruptly killing off Cyclops, Professo X and Jean Grey, as well as de-powering Mystique, Magneto and Rogue were all incredibly short sighted. Where was the franchise supposed to go from here?I know that they showed that Professor X was not really dead during the end credits when he spoke to Moira, but this entire film left a big mess to be explained or at least retconned by any future director.""Days of Future Past"" was made almost solely to try to erase the events of this film from existence.",X-Men - The Last Stand
140,itamarscomix,Great action scenes,6,30 May 2006,"The Last Stand is decisively the weakest film in the X-Men 'Trilogy'. Director Bryan Singer was replaced by Brett Ratner, who, like Singer, never made a sci-fi film before; but while Singer took a restrained and dramatic approach to the genre, Ratner behaves more like a child with a new toy and plays the high-budget special effects to excess. Dramatically, The Last Stand is not as convincing as the first two parts; it does continue the action/soap opera combination that characterized the first two films  as well as the X-Men comics  but the romantic side, namely the love interest between Wolverine and Jean Grey, fails to deliver. Hugh Jackman gives a performance that is hardly as strong as in the first two films, and other than Ian McKellen  clearly the best actor in the whole trilogy  who does as breathtaking a job as he always does  there are no characters here that are very interesting by their own right.That's another major problem the film suffers from  there are way too many new characters, and very few of them are interesting enough, even if most of them are well-cast. That same problem was apparent in the first film, which introduces all the main characters in a very short span of time; what made the second installment the best one was that it focused mainly on a tight group of main characters, leaving more room for drama. Iceman, Juggernaut (a wasted performance by the fantastic Vinnie Jones), Callisto, Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Pyro and the rest are half-baked characters, mainly in it for the action scenes; Angel  who was marketed as one of the lead characters  has a remarkably small side bit. The only new character that really made a mark was Hank McCoy AKA Beast  played, in a bit of casting genius, by Kelsey Grammar.But all complaints and grievances taken into account, although the film is not very strong dramatically, and has serious pacing problems with scenes that drag out with not enough action to balance them  when the action does come it's spectacular. The final battle of the film is the most impressive action scene in the trilogy, thirty minutes of beautifully shot and choreographed mayhem and destruction. It's a credit to Ratner that he took very bold decisions of letting a large number of main characters die, making a sequel  although possible  very unlikely; and he really let go and went all the way with the carnage, making this final scene a feast to the eyes. This is where the large number of new characters finally makes itself worthwhile, and for any fan of sci-fi and high-effect action this scene is a pleasure.The Last Stand is not as good a film as the first two X-Men's, but it's a very well made action film. If that's what you're looking for, then you'll love it. If it's drama you're after, you'll be less impressed, but there's still McKellen, always a pleasure to observe, who plays a stronger part here than in X2. A worthy conclusion to the X-Men trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
141,russem31,About as good as the first film.,7,2 June 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), the third and supposedly final film in the X-Men trilogy, is on par with the first film in terms of enjoyability. And although it cannot stand up to the superb second film, this film by director Brett Ratner (who is new to the franchise) is actually satisfying enough. This is probably because the story didn't do a standard follow-up from the previous film, but decided to veer a sharp right. Watch the film to see what I mean. The visual effects were also top-notch, and perhaps the biggest asset this film has. It's also great to see our favorite characters back again (though I was wondering where Nightcrawler crawled off to). Overall, a satisfying film - a 7 out of 10.One thing to note: I can see why some of the X-Men comic-book buffs hated this film - I won't give away the story but let's say that some pivotal characters have interesting story progressions.",X-Men - The Last Stand
142,Maziun,Chaos instead of epic conclusion,2,19 August 2013,"It was a double tragedy that Bryan Singer decided to leave X-men franchise to direct Superman returns"" and left it in the hands of Brett Ratner . ""Superman returns"" sucked badly, while Ratner murdered X-men . There is strong possibility that if Singer directed the third part of X-men it would be at least decent.The story is all over the place. There are 5 or 6 story lines from the comics collapsed into this movie, none of them working at all. Like 2 or 3 movies were made and just cut together. The characters either disappear (Nightcrawler) or appear (Juggernaut , Multiple man) without any explanation . New mutants are introduced without developing their character or even their motivation one bit. Important characters get killed very quickly without any emotional impact on the viewer . Other like Angel are simply pointless. Jean Grey is badly developed and so is Magneto.The cast seem to be unmotivated . Only Kelsey Grammar as The Beast and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut shine. The action is not bad and so are the special effects. The movie is definitely not boring.The first movie wasn't bad , the second was great and this is simply bad sequel . Not necessarily the worst comic book movie ever , but what a wasted possibility for heart wrenching epic finale... I give it 2/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
143,rebeljenn,a good follow-up,6,28 May 2006,"'X-Men The Last Stand' is a good follow up to the equally-entertaining previous films in the series. Despite the last film being released a couple of years ago, I remembered enough of the characters and plot to understand what was going on, but I think new viewers to the X-Men films will be lost if they did not see the previous ones.The film is packed with a lot of action and wacky new characters, and it also provides some good resolutions through a climax of conflicts between the mutants and the humans. It is not a flawless film, but it does its job, which is to entertain. The action sequences and special effects are done well, and there is rarely a dull moment in context of he film. I would recommend this film but only after watching the previous two.",X-Men - The Last Stand
144,EijnarAmadeus,"A much missed Singer in a empty, but entertaining action-movie",5,27 June 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand could have become the ultimate blockbuster this year but it doesn't. Why this is I think is pretty obvious, director Bryan Singer is much missed from the very opening of the movie and it's not putting under the carpet that it was Singer that made the whole X-Men franchise more than the average action-movie. Singer had structure and depth, and the second installment of the X-Men series may just be the best superhero-movie of all time. With Singer departing the production and making his go for the new Superman-movie, X-Men was left behind and they had to make a problematic solution; Brett Ratner.Brett Ratner makes the third one big and explosive, probably the most crowd-pleasing of them all. The set-pieces are fantastic (Magneto removing the Golden Gate is one especially memorable), the action is louder and rougher and there's thrown in many new mutants with fascinating skills. Though Singer had a brilliant way of putting Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in focus, Ratner looses touch and grip of his character and Wolverine falls behind and is overblown by freaks as Magneto and Phoenix. X-Men: The Last Stand hasn't got the punch and grit of the two earlier movies, and this is very much felt and so Ratner has to do what he does best; making explosive action. And some of the scenes are outright impressive and without doubt highly enjoyable watching. Even Famke Janssen's returning Jean Grey aka Phoenix makes some burning' hot scenes here, though her ex-boyfriend Cyclops is wasted and so is Professor Xavier (!!) X-Men: The Last Stand offers new superheroes too, and though they're all okay Ratner makes a huge mistake offering Vinnie Jones a role here; playing the ridiculous Juggernaut he is the biggest throwaway.X-Men: The Last Stand has got several good times but also some bad things and what's supposed to be the last roll of the dice even hints at a fourth coming. Let's hope for Singer if so.",X-Men - The Last Stand

146,Igenlode Wordsmith,New isn't always bad,8,11 June 2006,"I've seen a succession of rather disappointing old films recently, including a couple that were very well reviewed everywhere, so I decided to take a risk and go to see the latest 21st-century holiday blockbuster, just for a change -- despite the fact that the local reviews have been decidedly mediocre.To my astonishment and delight, I actually enjoyed it very much. I rate this an 8, but it's actually verging on a 9 (I'll deduct a mark for some apparent plot holes and continuity slips); the 'tears' sections don't really work for me, but the humour, shock and excitement were all spot-on, and I really felt an emotional connection with the film: something I've sorely missed of late. The plot was intelligent and even-handed, resisting the temptation to draw heavy analogies with contemporary issues, and the character of Magneto was outstanding; it is impossible not to sympathise with this brilliant man as his worst fears come true, and as we see the old friendship between him and Xavier, and yet every time we are tempted to view him as a misunderstood prophet, we are reminded of just how ruthless he really is.The humour I found more effective than in the first two films; I liked little wordless touches such as the way in which the woman in the car finds herself surrounded by unbelievably powerful mutants and... locks the window -- a very natural and yet ridiculously out-of-scale reaction. Jean Grey's distress and instability after she kills both her lover and her mentor were very well done; she has put herself in Magneto's camp almost by default, and yet she is not truly on either side any more. I'm not particularly happy about series that kill off popular characters and then diminish the impact by casually resurrecting them, but in this case the film redeems itself, as it were, by tapping into the longstanding law of consequences (""The Monkey's Paw"", ""Pet Sematary"") that warns that it is never that easy -- that bringing back the dead can be worse that simply mourning them. (I do cringe every time characters refer tritely to 'moving on', though...) My acquaintance with the X-Men is limited entirely to the big screen; I've never read the comic strips and so have no beef with supposed liberties taken with the original characters. Considered as a stand-alone product I found this film better-paced and more effective than its predecessors, although it would make no sense without them. Definitely the best new release I've seen this year... although admittedly it's the ONLY new release I've bothered to see this year, so this isn't saying much! The most recent 'old' film I enjoyed more than this one was ""On the Beach"" (1959); so that's quite an endorsement. I'm glad I went.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Then, make a surprise ending so that we can come back and nullify everything with a fourth one. But if their are enough fights and quips, the fools will still like it. I was skeptical after the first and excited after the second, this was one of the biggest disappointments in a long time. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Ian McKellen's Magneto are still the focus, they keep the movie watchable. Brett Ratner should stick with those Rush Hour movies that he does so badly with.

While the switch in directors did not really affect anything, airhead Brett Ratner does seem to enjoy glossing things up more then most. What seems to be lacking here is just any sort of memorable plot to latch onto throughout the 100 minute rehash. Yes, there is a climax that will have many fans emotional, the final moments in the end do attempt to build up to the epic finale we we're anticipating, but it feels like merely a distraction to make up for the majority of the film being endless retreads into characterization and moralization. By recycling, ad nauseam, the articulation of it's mutant themes, the franchise somewhere lost it's focus from an action film and instead lazily caters to the fans they know will always offer support by serving up the never-ending secret geeky handshakes of nerd recognition via mindless, pointless character cameos and undercooked, overvalued comic-specific references.",X-Men - The Last Stand
149,katyayan-12892,X - 3,4,3 March 2021,"Review By Kamal KFull of comic book action, rudimentary passion, and fiery tragedy, this third entry in the film franchise is also unfocused. Tying together a number of dangling plot strands, dropping in a couple of additional themes, and introducing new X-Men, X-Men: The Last Stand isn't as quirky and endearing as the first two, though it does deliver the usual family melodrama and sensational finale.The plot has never been this franchise's strong suit. Rather, the X-Men films delight in quirky, complicated, flamboyant characters,sometimes subversively funny, sometimes outrageously desirous. As Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) goes missing in the early part of the film, the next closest fun freaks are the thudding Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and the charming, coming-into-her-own Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page). But their appearances are brief, as the film is crowded with other characters and plots, such that its end -- yet another celebration of diversity that remains at risk -- only seems like more of the same.",X-Men - The Last Stand
150,Prichards12345,3rd in the series delivers the goods,6,28 May 2006,"With a new director, Brett Ratner, replacing Bryan Singer there was bound to be some concern amongst those of us who enjoyed the first two movies. I need not have worried: Ratner delivers in spades, skillfully managing to pack an enormous amount of plot-weaving into the 105 minute running time. Indeed there are so many characters in X-Men: Last Stand it's beginning to feel like a Tolstoy saga! Once again Wolverine and Storm are strongly featured, and there are good performances all round - particularly from Famke Janssen; her turn as the resurrected Jean Grey/Phoenix is terrific. Ian Mckellen is a sumptuous (once again) Magneto. He's a complex character, far from just an out-and-out villain, and you sympathise with him in his battle against the mutant ""cure"" that's floating about. And indeed this is the central thrust of the film, examining the implications amongst the mutant community. Do you cure yourself of that which makes you different? To some it's a hideous curse; to others a blessing to revel in. There's much angst to be had here as both the X-Men and The Brotherhood of Mutants have tough decisions to make.And of course, this being a summer blockbuster, there's action in spades. Ratner and his screen writers give us little snippets of stuff throughout, before unleashing a monumental climax every bit as spectacular as the Spider-Man Doc Ock train scrap in Spidey 2. It's breath-taking stuff.There's a few weaknesses - it isn't as emotional as it ought to be - you should care more about the characters by the time we get to film three, but this doesn't spoil things. I'm trying not to give too much away here - there's some real surprises in store, and the ending just made me wish for another instalment. This is one franchise that has definitely NOT worn out it's welcome.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Arch Angel is only here to service one story beat, that is not strong enough or even worthwhile. The storyline betrays characters and in the end It's one anti climatic disappointment.

153,DonFishies,A solid effort that has a few shortcomings,8,26 May 2006,"Growing up, I was an oft comic book fan. I read a few, but I paid more attention to the TV series of the 1990's, which from what I've seen, heard and read since, followed the comics much closer than any movie could. So with great anticipation, I watched the first X-Men film back in 2000, and was fairly disappointed. Yes, it set up the foundations for everything else to come, but it just did not feel right to me. When X2: X-Men United came out, I was fairly stoked, but was ready to be disappointed again. Luckily, I was not. The film was excellent in all phases of the word, and stands as one of my favourite comic book adaptations.But then, Bryan Singer left the production of the inevitable X3 and Brett Ratner stepped in. I can't say I was immediately impressed, but I was still very hyped to see it. After seeing the film, I can say that I was happy that it was not completely mangled from what Singer delivered in the first two films, but it still does manage to deviate a bit from what I can only imagine was the original vision for the film.So there really is not a whole lot to say about the movie that most people do not already know about. A drug has been discovered that will help ""cure"" mutants of their powers, and let them be completely human. Of course, there are some who embrace this idea quickly, but many do not. Leading the charge is Magneto (Ian McKellan), whose ideals for mutants and humans have always clashed with that of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). So as this whole ""cure"" business begins to come together, many begin questioning their ideals about being mutants, and in a sense, take a stand (an obvious nod to the subtitle of the film) and choose how they will continue to lead their lives.All of the core performances, no matter how big or small they are, are all well done. I was a little worried about how Kelsey Grammar would handle Beast, but he puts all worries to rest. Hugh Jackman continues his perfection of playing Wolverine, while Halle Berry is given so much more to do as Storm, that you begin to understand that she may not just be total eye candy (although she still does not prove to me that she deserves an Oscar). Stewart and McKellan continue their great performances, and returnees like Shawn Ashmore, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn, Aaron Stanford, James Marsdan, Daniel Cudmore and Famke Janssen are all completely at home with their roles, and continue playing them gracefully. Newbies like Ben Foster as Angel, Ellen Page as Kitty Pride and Cameron Bright as Leech among others were questionable choices and additions to the cast, but unfortunately, are given very little screen time and real character developing moments to be anywhere near comparable to all the returning actors. Vinnie Jones is sadly underused as Juggernaut, but his few moments are memorable and show off his talent greatly. Cameos from Stan Lee and R. Lee Ermey are also quite memorable.The story on the other hand, is iffy. It seems like the filmmakers really wanted to cram a lot into this movie, but still use many of the characters we know and love. So unfortunately, some come and go, and some unfortunately get very little screen time at all. And while the film completely changes some of the key story lines (like Dark Phoenix), it tries to continue the momentum of Singer's pictures, and not allow it to completely halt any of the continued ones that were in the first two films. While some changes are downright upsetting, others are handled very well and are easily acceptable. While Ratner may have directed it, you can still feel the heavy influence from Singer. For that reason, he does not completely mangle everything the films had going for them. He does add a lot more comedy, a lot more sex, and a lot more emotion, but he makes a solid attempt to stay close to what Singer had. While he does not handle the emotional scenes the same way Singer does, his valiant effort is not unnoticeable.Ratner's main change from Singer was the amping up of the mutant powers, effectively upping the number of special effects within the film. And they are all a marvel to see. While being much more low key in the original films, they are very much present and being showcased here. All of the shots are well done, and look extremely realistic, even when we know what is happening is downright absurd. From Storm's weather changing, to Iceman's ice, to even Wolverine's quick healing, all are captured excellently, and help really bring to life the powers these people have. Beast's complete agility and fierce fighting are also great to see finally brought to screen after so long.While Ratner made a solid effort to not completely destroy the X-Men series, I can't help but say that some of what ends up happening in this vastly shorter film, is a bit of a disappointment. What built into something excellent, ends on just a great note. Ratner lets it falter a bit, but his handling of the rest of the film is valiant and a compliment to Singer. I just cannot help but wonder what could have been done if Superman Returns had not finally been green-lit. It's a worthwhile close to the franchise (at least for now), and is very entertaining, but do not expect it to hold a candle to the second film.8/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
154,gigan-92,Good But Flawed Compared To The First Two,5,13 May 2009,"Damn, why is the third film also where things go downhill? ""Mummy 3"", ""Spider-Man 3"", ""Jurassic Park 3"", and now the X-Men series joins the list unfortunately. This is undoubtedly due to the absence of Bryan Singer. Singer wanted to fulfill his dream of directing a Superman film, therefore released the same year as ""X3"" we receive ""Superman Returns"". The better of the two in my opinion would definitely be the Man of the Steel. The main problem is a very rushed story given no time to develop these insane new mutants. Not to mention Night Crawler, who was such a remarkable character in the last film, is completely forgotten. At least a cameo would've been nice. Pushing that aside, this film serves up some very well done action scenes, and I love Juggernaut! The Golden Gate Bridge sequence was an amazing sight that showed us the power of Magneto. However, even here, director Brett Ratner felt it was necessary to shorten things. If you buy a copy of the DVD, as I'm sure most fans did, you'll see an enormous amount of deleted and edited scenes. All this cutting shortened the film and just took away from the depth of the characters if you ask me. Plus I was somewhat disappointed by the end battle on Alcatraz. Sure there were several baddies against a few heroes and there are some well done moments, but it felt too easy. Few of the mutants stood a chance against the formidable X-Men, making it feel as if the superheroes were up against an army of regular men and women.In other news the score by John Powell was fantastic, but overall when the credits roll, one can't help but ask: ""It's over already?""",X-Men - The Last Stand

Magneto (Ian Mckellen) is upset about the idea the most as he wants to lead a revolution that can destroy the human race and Cyclops (James Marsden) still feels bad about losing Jean Grey (Famnke Janssen) as now she's reborn as someone different known as The Phoenix with superior powers to her original and seems to have a dark destructive side. Rogue (Anna Paquin) just can't stand being so dangerous around everyone she touches as she wants the cure to be normal so she can kiss a man, it's up to the fellow X-Men Storm (Halle Berry), new member Beast (Kelsey Grammar), and Wolverine (Huge Jackman) to head to where the cure is and try to stop Magneto's war.Very weak finale of the series! the story is very interesting and complex including the concept of how a cure can change the life of a different person. Bryan Singer has been replaced by Brett Ratner as director who made the first two excellent ""Rush Hour"" movies didn't do such a bad job as some fans proclaim. The film does offer yet another batch of mutants such as Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) even though in the comics he's not really a mutant but was given magic powers, Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) and Angel (Ben Foster) but the problem with the film is that the humor isn't as funny as the ones in the excellent first two movies and the film feels very rushed to be an ending of the series.It's fun but nowhere as excellent as the first two.",X-Men - The Last Stand

But hear me out.I thought ""X2"" was a dull film because the human antagonists, led by the extremely hammy Brian Cox, were too weak to pose a serious threat to mutantkind.""X-Men: The Last Stand"" circumvents this problem by giving humanity the mutant cure, the first truly effective weapon against Magneto and company. The cure ensures that the battle scenes are actually exciting.It also forms the basis of a solid plot, rich with the kinds of ethical issues that nudge the X-Men films above your standard action-movie fare. I particularly like Rogue's dilemma over whether she should take the cure. Her story arc is brought to a very satisfactory conclusion.The special effects are great, too; I wanted to cheer every time Ian McKellan hurled a car. (That's superficial, I know, but hey, I'm a superficial guy!) The closing battle scene is truly thrilling - much better than anything we've seen in the previous two films. And it was nice that some unusual X-Men, like Shadowcat and Beast, finally got good parts in this film. I always had a crush on Shadowcat, to be honest...I guess I liked this so much because of the aforementioned cure plot, and because it focused on Magneto, my favorite character. Ain't Ian McKellan brilliant? He manages to be extremely dignified and chew the scenery at the same time.The Dark Phoenix elements of the story are somewhat glossed over, I admit, but then again I always thought that story was overrated. Certainly the Wolverine/Jean romance works well here, even if it doesn't get a ton of screen time, and lends the film emotional punch.

Anyway this is what I think: The movie is entertaining but more or less a disappointment and heartbreaking. I blame it on studio executives for not waiting for Bryan Singer and let him do his magic but let Brett comes and ruin the series. I'm sorry to say this Brett but the movie is not good. His directing and his ability to do everything are not even close to what Bryan can do despite having all the money to do anything he wants.Screenplay: Badly written despite having a good concept. Instead of developing the story all they do is cramp up tens of characters which none of it is even close to develop. Extremely disappointed with Angel and Cyclops, who have a scene only for 2 min, but they used him to promote the whole movie. Simon and Zak are to blame for this awful screenplay. Truly is horrible, they record show that. Couldn't believe this could be used to make a movie. The movie is very comic like, too a-like. The story concentrate on how to make it like a comic and overlook how it would it look like in movie. And the outcome is not good.Only the casting seems to be doing the right thing, otherwise I'm really sad to say this, but it hasn't live up to the standard.

I have never actually seen the second film of X-Men, although I heard it was the best of the trilogy. I instead saw the first film and enjoyed it thoroughly. So, I see the third one with better expectations, hoping it could be the best one. The film was really entertaining. The action scenes, which there were a ton in this movie were really good and the special effects seemed pretty real. Most of the characters played their parts well especially Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and my personal favorite from the film, Kelsey Grammar as Dr. Hank McCoy/The Beast. I was really surprised how the film ended in 1 hr and 45 minutes. It went really fast and seemed too short, for it being the last film in the trilogy.*Spoiler Ahead* Of how much positives you found in the film, there were some negatives too that kind of let down my thoughts on if The Last Stand was going to be the best in the trilogy. Unfortunately, it wasn't. I mean right when the movie took off some characters that were huge in the last two films, just die off. There wasn't too much explaining to why also, they just die off and the characters that see it are like ""hell with it."" Also, there were some characters in the film that were kind of pointless such as Rogue, Kitty, Pyro, and Angel. They really didn't have to be in the film and no one would of cared if they weren't.

I must admit I can't remember that much from part 2 anymore, and that probably says a lot of how I liked that one.This one then. It's much of the same. The red line of the story is that some scientists have found a mutant that negates the powers of other mutants. They have also found a way to sap the power of that mutant into a ""cure"" that will remove mutant powers from others by injection. So far, the story.The film then. As said, it is much the same as the other two parts and I guess that if you liked these two that this one isn't one that should be missed. The effects used are pretty funny and some of the new mutants are nice to see, with one exception: The Juggernaut.

An enjoyable film that will be forgotten just as quickly as the other X-men films.6 ""cured"" mutants out of 10",X-Men - The Last Stand
164,Rickting,"The Last Straw, not The Last Stand",4,7 September 2016,"Comic book movies may have been done to death, but the X-Men films are interesting. Not only are they not in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but they are set in the real world and feature many thought- provoking themes. They also have one of the best comic book movie villains ever; Magneto, who is played brilliantly by Ian McKellen. The first one was good, the second was better though not as perfect as everyone says it is, the prequel was excellent, this movie sucks. It actually just plain sucks. Bryan Singer has left and is replaced by Brett Ratner, who does OK but doesn't add anything to the film. Meanwhile, the script is a cartoonish, muddled mess with underdeveloped plot elements and boring scenes left, right and center. The action scenes are the only part of the film that truly work, but even they drown in endless CGI eventually. Killing off Cyclops and Professor X, 2 of the most pointless character deaths in recent memory, was just the icing on the cake. What makes things worse is the numbingly awful acting from nearly everyone aside from Stewart and McKellen. Even Hugh Jackman isn't as good as usual, while Halle Berry and Vinnie Jones are simply dreadful. It's a deeply tedious affair, and while the thematic depth that made the others work is there, it never truly shines through and the film dissolves into a CGI beat-em-up video game which is completely broken.4/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
165,dilipbts,X-men the last stand,6,10 June 2020,"I must be one of the few, it seems, who enjoyed X-Men: The Last Stand. I have been an X-fan for many years and my expectations were still met by this film. Do I think that it could have been a bit better? Certainly. The script seemed to pack too many elements into a short running time. With those issues solved I believe that it would have been fantastic. Still, I felt that X-3 was almost on the level with X-2's greatness. It has taken another viewing and some time to reach this point. At first, I felt betrayed at the many liberties taken with story elements. But after I left the theatre, I could not shake the feeling that I needed to view it again. After the second time, I came to grips with the film and now like it quite a bit.Contrary to some critics' reviews, I do not believe that X-3 became overshadowed by action. There really is quite little of it until the finale, which feels quite epic. There are excellent character moments sprinkled throughout. The acting is generally superb across the board. More Ian McKellen is always nice, and Hugh Jackman impresses again with Wolverine. Kelsey Grammar actually does a respectable job with Beast. The other characters all do well with what they are given. There are a few poorly written one-liners that reminded me of the ones in X-Men 1, but the script is mostly intelligent with powerful themes such as the Cure. Another difficulty is that the film cannot pay the proper amount of attention to the many characters, including the new ones. But they still all seem to contribute something to the larger plot movement in the film. Ratner's only obvious difference from Singer is his frenetic pacing and energy. X-3 really moves quickly, and this does not have to be a negative. I also enjoyed the emotion that was hinted at in X-2, and came into full force during X-3. I do not think that it reached sentimentality or was melodramatic; it really felt powerful. The stakes really do seem to be high for the final chapter of this trilogy. The viewer finds this out quickly concerning Cyclops and Mystique, later with Jean and Xavier (in a particularly awe-inspiring scene), and during the finale in a nice moment with Jean and Wolverine. I think that many of the problems people are seeing in the film resulted from the pressure the entire production team was placed under in order to develop and finish the entire film in less than a year.But all in all, I have really come to enjoy it as a satisfying film that met my high expectations. Look at it this way if you must. Try to see X-3 as not a stand-alone film but more as the third portion of one large story. The first X-Men had the difficult job of introducing a large ensemble cast of mutants and establishing a story and tone (other superhero films with one primary character have it much easier). X-2 had the most enviable position as most of the characters had already been partly developed and it did not have to conclude the entire story. It could work mostly on its own, just having to leave threads open for the next one. X-3 had the extremely difficult task of closing out the entire trilogy for good. I see it more as the third portion of one expansive tale, thus in the larger scheme it must move quickly toward a complete conclusion. In my opinion, the many actors under the abrupt switch in direction did an x-cellent job.",X-Men - The Last Stand
166,MichaelMargetis,"""Way to go, Furball."" - Logan (Hugh Jackman)",7,20 June 2006,"For the most part, Marvel Comic movie adaptations suck. With the exception of the amazing surprise 'Batman Begins', the majority of them disappoint, like 'The Hulk', 'Spider-Man 2', 'The Punisher' and the dreadful 'Daredevil'. One of the only Marvel Comic movie franchises that is actually enticing is the 'X-Men' series. The first two were great successes, not to mention very good films that were both enjoyable and meaty when it came to the storyline. I had heard some pretty negative things about the third installment however, that it was sappy, confusing and ultimately a disappointment when compared to it's predecessors. After three weeks of putting it off, I finally saw 'X-Men III: The Last Stand', and I have to tell you, I really enjoyed it and actually felt it was the best out of the three movies.Unlike the first two films, 'X-Men III' offers something the others didn't -- the surprise element. Three of the main characters die in this one in unpredictable places which take you really off-guard. Some people found this annoying, but I found it brilliant because unlike the other two movies this one keeps you guessing and anxious about what will happen next. The acting in this one is on-par with the other two films. Hugh Jackman is excellent as usual as the tough SOB that is Wolverine while Famke Jansen, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, Ben Foster, Michael Murphy, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Cameron Bright, Shawn Ashmore and Ellen Page are solid in their roles. Patrick Stewart is fantastic as the wise old Professor X and Ian McKellan steals the movie as the troubled and complicated villain, Magneto. I also loved Kelsey Grammar in it as the mutant politician turned X-Men hero. The villains are all exceptional including Aaron Stanford, everyone's favorite brit Vinnie Jones, and even Rebecca Rojimin whose acting doesn't really impress me but she does a pretty decent job in this role. The only disappointment in the cast is the Oscar winner -- Halle Berry. I never found her to be a particularly good actress, in fact 'Monster's Ball' was a fluke and the fact she won the Oscar for that was just Hollywood political correctness bullshit. Berry staggers her way through the role trying very hard to make you believe she's i n trouble, but she's just not a good enough actress to convince you. The only other down-point of the movie, is the terribly tacky dialogue. Some of it is just a little too much, but you have to keep reminding yourself 'X-Men' isn't 'The Godfather' it's a friggin' Marvel Comic book and of course it's going to have silly dialogue.All in all I highly recommend this installment. There's a twist ending, and there's another twist after the movie is over and the credits have all rolled so make sure you stay after the credits. The movie has everything every superhero movie needs. It could very well be the best superhero movie o f the year, if the upcoming 'Superman Returns' doesn't step up to the plate June 30th.

167,departed07,Let the fireworks begin!!!,10,26 May 2006,"This one is the final battle featuring all of our favorite X-Men characters, is it? X-Men III is like Revenge of the Sith, where in the latest installment of the comic book franchise, this is a crowd pleaser. Bryan Singer, who donned the director's chair in the first two installments steps away as Brett Ratner of the Rush Hour franchise takes over.Picking up where X2 left off with the death of Dr. Jean Gray (Famke Janssen), the United States government has stated that they found the cure to all mutants: a child nickname Virus, who's blood not only can take away their powers, but when encounter face-to-face, the power of a mutant can be taken away temporarily. The process has started where after a government official (Michael Murray) discovers his son (Ben Foster) having wings on his back and can fly like a bird in the sky.Back in the school for the gifted, the other characters still mourn for the death of Dr. Gray as some of them try to get on with their lives, while others like Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden) can't forget the past as conflicts arise between those in the school such as Rogue (Anna Paquin) and her boyfriend (Shawn Ashmore) falling for another mutant during target practice.Like each of the X-Men installments, we get a new set of characters who steal the movie scenes; while in the first sequel it was Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (played by Alan Cumming), in this installment we see Kelsey Grammar (Frasier) as Dr. Hank McCoy, better known to fans as Beast; Vinnie Jones as the barbaric Juggernaut, who cannot be touch or be damaged by any object; Ben Foster as Michael Warrington III, better known as Angel. Many more characters are mentioned, but like the films itself, it scrambles through so many people that we don't have time to know the others while the action takes place. But then again, it is great to see Hugh Jackman reprising his role as Wolverine; Halle Berry as Storm, Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, and Famke Janssen as Jean Gray, reprises from the dead as Phoenix whose powers are much more dangerous than the mutants around her as she can efface a person's flesh and blood into thin air.The plot to the original X-Men movie where it was mutant vs. mutant; the sequel involved mutants, both good and bad reuniting to fight for their species to survive; in this one it is again mutant vs. mutant where Magneto (Ian McKellan) leads his army of Brotherhood with Phoenix by his side and try to stop those who are against them along with the cure registration while the X-Men try to stop Magneto and his army of thugs from trying to kill people and at the same time, not let humanity drive them afraid.Despite what you think of my review, or hear what others say, X-Men III is a fantastic film, fully blooded with special effects where the roller coaster ride doesn't end. In general, this is the best way to end a great comic book trilogy! I wouldn't be surprise if more installments would be in the works!",X-Men - The Last Stand
168,FilmFanInTheHouse,"Not as good as X2, but VERY ENJOYABLE!",8,3 December 2007,"X-Men: The Last Stand (2006, Dir. Brett Ratner) When a cure is created, which apparently can turn any mutant into a normal human being, there is outrage amongst the mutant community. Whilst some mutants do like the idea of a cure, including Rogue, many mutants find that there shouldn't be a cure. Magneto, who still believes a war is coming, recruits a large team of mutants to take down Warren Worthington II and his cure. Might seem easy for the X-Men to stop, but Magneto has a big advantage, which Wolverine doesn't have. Jean Grey has returned, and joined with Magneto. The Phoenix has woken within her, which has the ability to destroy anything in here past, even if that 'anything' is a X-Men.For the third and currently the final part of the X-Men trilogy, Brett Ratner took over the directing duties of Bryan Singer. 'X-Men' and 'X2' were huge successes, and it was obviously going to be a hard job of making it even better. Although, it doesn't manage to achieve the same status as the first sequel, it was still an enjoyable movie, which i enjoyed a lot more than the first film. All the character development had been set up in the first two films, so this movie was able to focus on the story and the action more. The action in this movie is great with some wonderful fight sequences. There are two problems i do find in this movie though. Firstly, the running time is too short, and should be a lot longer. Secondly, there are too many minor characters that could have been cut. The romance between Kitty Pryde and Bobby Drake was pointless, and Angel was hardly included in anything important. Still, it's a great way to finish off the trilogy.""Jean. Enough. Enough"" - Magneto (Ian McKellen) ""You sounded just like him."" - Jean Grey (Famke Janssen)",X-Men - The Last Stand
169,Al_The_Strange,X-Men The Last Stand Review,7,14 June 2014,"After two satisfying X-Men films, it only seemed logical at the time that a third film should round off the series and provide a big-scale conclusion to the fight between mankind and mutant-kind.If nothing else, The Last Stand has plenty of action to satisfy; the fights occur pretty frequently, and seem much more hard-hitting than before. It has always been great to watch Magneto take out an armored convoy with impunity, before gathering his army and taking over Alcatraz. The final battle is a fun free-for-all with so many mutant powers being thrown around that it's crazy. A bunch of new mutants - Beast, The Juggernaut, the Phoenix - are welcome additions to the lore of the film series.Unfortunately, the film has not sat well with many viewers. Part of the issue is that the film doesn't take itself as seriously as its predecessors, and there are moments throughout where it tries to be funny but mostly isn't. What really ticks viewers off will be the storytelling decisions; many of the characters go into undesirable directions (including death). One's enjoyment of the film may also hinge on how seriously you can accept that mutation can be cured so easily. There are probably some plot holes to be found as well.A lot of these issues have never bothered me personally (save for what happens to certain characters). For casual popcorn entertainment, the film is enjoyable in a laid-back manner. Its story flows well enough, and provides at least some closure to the series (at least at the time it was made).The film looks nice and slick, with quality photography and editing. Actors continue to do their job admirably, with Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, and everybody else pulling their weight well. Even Halle Berry seems to step up her performance a little. Writing is okay. This production boasts good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are often good, but some are weak. Music is alright.X-Men: The Last Stand is an enjoyable onslaught of mutant brawling, but many viewers won't like what they've done to the characters and plot. It is a thrilling enough climax to the original three movies, but it's not quite as powerful of a catharsis as it thinks it is. It is often considered one of the worst comic-book movies ever, alongside with Spiderman 3. I personally don't think it's that bad, but it certainly has its share of weaknesses, and isn't quite as sublime as the first two movies.Recommended only as a rental.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Marginal | Film: Pretty Good)",X-Men - The Last Stand
170,DavidSim240183,The Big X-it,7,9 October 2006,"Bryan Singer did a fine job with the X-Men films. He laid out the framework with the original, then expanded the scale for X2, which emerged as one of the finest superhero films ever made. But he had to bow out for Part 3 because he was handling Superman Returns. Instead Brett Ratner had to pick up where he left off.X-Men: The Last Stand is sadly a slightly disappointing conclusion to the trilogy, because Ratner doesn't have the same feel for the characters the way Singer did. It also has some of the same problems as the original. Too many characters, and not enough time to cover them all.But X3 is not without it's merits. It's quite a rousing adventure. There are some interesting new characters, and a fairly intriguing plot with lots of possibilities. But they're not explored in the way Singer was able to do in the past. X3 emerges as only a good conclusion to this trilogy when it should have been a great one.At the end of the previous instalment, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) nobly sacrificed her life to ensure the X-Men could escape from certain death. The rest of the gang have been trying to pick up the pieces ever since. Without much success.Cyclops (James Marsden) distances himself from the group. He feels drawn back to Alkali Lake, the sight of Jean's untimely demise. Where he finds Jean very much alive. Only now she's been consumed by her mutant power, and named herself Phoenix.Before the X-Men can even begin to deal with this revelation, a new crisis has stirred up human/mutant relations. Apparently a 'cure' has been discovered that can reverse mutations. This discovery has split mutants right down the middle. Those who have accepted what they are and have no wish to change. And those who find the idea of being 'normal' appealing. Like Rogue (Anna Paquin). As you may recall, she can't touch anyone without killing them. She is left with a dilemma. Whether or not to deny her true self just to fit in.Meanwhile Magneto (Ian McKellen) sees this cure as a weapon to be used against mutants. He amasses an army of followers to pave the way for mutant domination. The only thing that stands in the way is the boy who holds the gene that created the cure in the first place. Being held at Alcatraz, Magneto intends to kidnap the boy, with the help of the Phoenix, to initiate mutant takeover.X-Men: The Last Stand is certainly ambitious. It's just a shame it feels so rushed. At only 100 minutes, that isn't nearly enough time to address the wide variety of issues raised. And with the amount of new characters being introduced, the film sometimes feels like a queue for each character's place in the spotlight.Cyclops for one only gets about ten minutes of screen time before he gets killed. Granted James Marsden never impressed me in the part, and doesn't here either, but that's quite a bizarre twist so early on. And Cyclops is not the only one to get bumped off. That goes for Xavier (Patrick Stewart) too. Disappointing considering he was sidelined last time as well. But his tragic death at the hands of the Phoenix is still quite shocking, and it does seem to lend a dynamic to the gang and their latest job.Storm gets to play leader this time, which is not a good thing because whenever she takes charge, Halle Berry only shows off her limitations as an actress. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) should have been made head honcho, and sadly only gets a few good moments to shine. His goodbye to Rogue is nice. Its played without a single false note of sincerity. And the part when Phoenix seduces him, prompting him to decide should he kill Jean to save others is startling, which is followed through at the end.Famke Janssen gets to have fun with the Phoenix. But I wish she could have played it a bit more edgily. It would have made the moral choices over what to do with her that much more fascinating. Kelsey Grammar's a charismatic Beast. Lending his rich voice to the character, he imbues him with the characteristic intelligence, and a pure heart of gold. And Iceman and Pyro get to have a great standoff towards the end. It almost seemed like WWF Wrestling!I was disappointed Mystique was shortchanged this time around, especially since she was given such exposure previously. I thought the way she was written out of it was haphazardly handled, as if Ratner thought there were too many characters as it was, and they had to lose a couple early on.Rogue gets sidelined almost completely and replaced by Kitty Pryde, a mutant who can walk through walls. A spunky little thing she is too, her power comes in handy at the end, making her a nice addition to the team. But Rogue's absence is still sorely felt.X3 does have some grandstanding effects sequences and fantastic action set-pieces. There's a real corker where Magneto manipulates the Golden Gate Bridge to form a pathway to Alcatraz, and the final battle reaches almost epic proportions. The last 30 minutes are very absorbing. It's just a shame the direction isn't as solid as it has been previously.There are individual moments that work. Magneto being made mortal is handled with genuine poignancy for the character, and the debate over whether or not it is right to give up being a mutant also works very well, but these moments just don't come often enough.Overall, I did enjoy the film, but not as much as I wanted to. X2 is the real high point in the trilogy, where X3 should have been the series finest hour.",X-Men - The Last Stand
171,moviemanMA,So you don't want to be a mutant...,7,26 May 2006,"Who wouldn't want the ability to walk through walls or fly away into the sky? Who wouldn't want to be able to lift cars hundreds of feet into the air or turn a cloudy day into a gorgeous sunny afternoon? For some this is a dream come true. For others than can't function without destroying their natural way of life, it is a curse. The premise for the latest installment of the X-Men saga is just that.X-Men: The Last Stand goes deeper into the mutant versus human controversy. All of the favorites are back with the addition of some needed support. The main focus of this film is the introduction of a vaccine that can rid a mutant of its powers. It is called, ""The Cure"". Magneto, played once again by Ian McKellan, gathers his Brotherhood for a war on the mankind once more. His eyes are fixed on the one person who holds the answer, a small, innocent child with a gift so powerful, Magneto will risk everything for it.Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) upon hearing gathers his group of X-Men to stop the menacing Magneto. He is short a few of his troops from the last film. Cyclops is still lamenting over the loss of his dear Dr. Jean Grey. When he can't take it anymore, he drives out to where he last saw her. Her voice has driven him to the edge until she appears. Who he meets isn't Jean, but her true self; Phoenix. She is Jean's alter ego, the most powerful mutant Charles or Magneto ever encountered.Director Brett Ratner of Rush Hour fame delivers an action packed, special effects driven adventure. His style is unlike that of the previous X-Men films. His version is more along the lines of a regular action flick. A lot of explosions, stunts galore, and a so-so script. What made the other films enjoyable was the emphasis on the characters. This film has almost too many to include. Although some weren't present and some don't make it, there are too many side stories going on than are needed.The mutants are always a blast to watch. Hugh Jackman returns to his old guns, relying on witty remarks and vicious attacks on unsuspecting victims. Somehow it doesn't get old. Kelsey Grammar is introduced as Dr. Hank McCoy, better known as Beast, a blue skinned, blue haired genius who wants nothing more than this war to cease. Also introduced is Angel, who sadly doesn't play too much of a role. On the other side of the battle is Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones). A one man wrecking crew whose momentum is unstoppable to the strongest of obstructions. Beside him is Callisto, a speedy little devil whose impact is virtually just filler. There is more emphasis on characters like Kitty, the girl who can walk through walls, and Collossus, a metal strongman, and less emphasis on Rogue and Mystique.Without these characters in play, the film is special effects driven. Impressive CGI graphics and and intelligent use of the mutants powers go a long way in the making of this film. Characters like Storm (Halle Berry) rely solely on the effects provided by Ratner and his team or visual effects artists.As far as summer blockbusters go, this film isn't one to be trifled with. It presents a lot of aspects that a blockbuster should have: a lot of big name actors, reliable story lines, stunning effects, and most importantly, an appeal to a large audience. The movie might be a little bit mature for children, but comic book fans and fans of the films will thoroughly enjoy this. The only remaining question left is; will there be another?",X-Men - The Last Stand
172,Flagrant-Baronessa,Possibly the most uneven film I've ever seen,6,22 September 2006,"EDITED: Why do people keep reporting me for spoilers?! There isn't a single spoiler in this review. That Jean Grey is back? The trailer showed that! Idiots.The war between mutants and humans rages on  as well as between mutants and other mutants  and the spark that lights the fuse in this X-Men installment is the government-funded ""Mutant-cure"" project that is taking place on Alcatraz. Magneto and his fanatic followers are appalled by this idea (""They want to cure us? I say we ARE the cure  for homo sapiens."") and go into military mode to fight the humans. Because we all know the best defense is a good offense. This conflict pins Xavier and his academy somewhere in between, raising questions such as how far should we go for social conformity? Is mutation a disease, or is it part of who we are? I think that X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) has got it all right when it comes to ethics and message because it is not in-your-face or preachy at any point. It is an objective study how this cure changes people and mutants alike (not just the ones it is injected to). Magneto cannot stand the prospect of losing his mutant identity to a human cure while Rogue wants it and Jean needs it. Director Brett Ratner neutrally navigates the themes of social conformity and ethical values with effortless skill in the film which I find impressive since it is a heavy topic and he only recently jumped onboard the X-Men fare. So ""well done"" here is an understatement. He does a great job.The problem is that at some point greedy hack producers deemed this well-sketched template of mutants vs. humans going to war over ethics ""insufficient"" for a long action-feature. More was needed, they thought, and slapped on extra-template love-stories, reborn-stories and offputting attempts at establishing moods that reeks of cheesy character development Kodak-moment. The latter manifests itself at several points in the film, mainly in scenes with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) coming to terms with his love for Jean. He does this by brooding and exchanging meaningful glances.Jean's woeful reborn storyline is X-Men's fatal flaw. Sloppy writing. When reaching the point when Jean's miraculous survival from the impact of the water needs to be explained by some brainy scientist (in this case Xavier), he simply offers the explanation: ""Her powers wrapped her in a cocoon of telekinetic energy."" OK, so no we now. Idiotic. Poor Famke Janssen gets to inhabit a truly badly-written character as The Last Stand plays on, and she plays it badly too. She has come back super-powerful and super-sexy (logically??). Most of the film she is not really doing anything, but stands aside looking imposing while the other characters remark how superhuman she is and how powerful she has become: ""She's so strong."" - Xavier (yes, he actually says that -- it's a joke). When she finally does get to shine, she does not really shine at all but her scene becomes completely over-the-top and desensitizes you to the action. Luckily, X-Men: The Last Stand is not Jean Grey's show. Curiously enough it is not Wolverine's show either. Instead the central characters take a backseat to the wide montage of new, eccentric, colourful mutant character from both Magneto and Xavier's camp  such as Juggernaught (""...bitch""), Arclight (hands down the coolest mutant power) and Callisto. Whenever there is a showdown between the two camps it is absolute gold. Even early in the film in Jean's house when they meet and fight briefly for the first time, you know you're in for a cinematic ride of vivid special visual- and audio effects as the characters blow ice, shoot metal, stir up storms and walk through walls. They mess up the house so much that it looks as though its walls are made out of paper that they just tear down and walk through. It's brilliantly handled with creative new scenarios.However the single most poignant scene is only a few minutes into the film  in a flashback of sorts that zooms in on a little mutant boy who has locked himself in the bathroom, cutting off his wings. He cries and there is blood and white feathers everywhere and it is just a staggering image. This little boy is Angel. This scene convinced me I was in for one hell of a ride  and I was because there is a lot of the cinematic ""big, bigger, epic"" formula but ultimately it is a terribly uneven film with poor dialogue (lines you can guess before the character says it), mediocre acting and plain silly extra-template story lines.6 out of 10",X-Men - The Last Stand

176,socrates99,"To be entertaining, but not satisfying, is not a good thing",7,31 May 2006,"This movie was a clear disappointment. I have this feeling that the Fantastic Four films are going to be more satisfying in the end. And speaking of 'The End' that's largely the problem here. After building up some suspense the payoff fizzles out, and if you're not particularly into action films it may give you a headache like it gave my wife. Were the original comic books that lame too? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion that they were.I can't help carping on one point that REALLY irritates me. Famke Janssen is not showcased well in this flick. I'd much rather watch her as the center of attention in a positive and adoring way than her treatment here: she's almost abused in this one. I can't think of any other actress who seems to have all the lights on upstairs as clearly as Famke. I've never seen her in any film where I didn't want to see more of her than the film makers were willing to give me. Here she's on screen a lot, but not in a particularly positive way. I felt cheated and I wish someone would put her in the spotlight far more than she has been. As to the other players, Hugh Jackman does a great job. This guy has a feel for this part that is quite unusual, I think. There's no condescension in his interpretation. And that's true of the rest of the case as well. So the talent's there. What they need is a proper script.They've touted the philosophical question at the core of this film in the trailers. I was looking forward to a popular treatment of an important question with real implications, but I found the exploration of that question pretty superficial and unsatisfying. Clearly there will be great science fiction made around this question eventually, but this isn't it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
177,charchuk,Slight disappointment but still a good film,5,28 May 2006,"I walked into this film with great trepidation and apprehension. I set myself up for a big disappointment. And, to an extent, I was right. This is a far cry from the first two, both masterpieces in their own right. X1 is one of the best pure fun films of recent memory, and a fantastic starting point for the franchise. X2 is just brilliant. X3, on the other hand, is a step down from both. It has neither the fun of the first nor the drama of the second. The screenplay is quite lazy and poorly written here. That being said, this is still a good flick.The movie did have its moments. The action scene at the end was quite good, as was the scene in Jean Grey's house. Wolverine remains the best character of the films, but he is rivaled here by Magneto. Jackman and McKellan are by far the best. The effects were perfect, but I would have preferred some more ""background mutants"" like the second one had. The new mutants were interesting, but underused. The general story about the cure was intriguing but, again, underused. I didn't really mind the random killing of some beloved characters, but Cyclops and Mystique should have been given a proper send-off. And Xavier's death was too... disturbing. I did like the way they did away with Magneto, though, as well as the last scene which leaves room for a sequel. And the scene after the credits was pretty cool.The real problem with this film is the script. Ratner's direction is fine - he certainly knows how to film action - but Singer brought his writers with him to Superman, and their replacements aren't that good. Many sub-plots are introduced but not resolved. Many characters are underused (Colussus and Angel especially). Some of the dialogue borders on after-school special cheese. Some scenes are perfect examples of lazy writing. And the plot attempts to bring about some moral and ethical depth but ultimately falls short. This is a film which would have greatly benefited by being 20-30 minutes longer and broadening the story. Greatly disappointing.All in all, this is a worthy addition (conclusion?) to the X-Men series, albeit a step down. I doubt it really is ""the last stand"" as the scenes bookending the credits seem to suggest otherwise. I am sure that with Singer at the helm, and more competent writers, this would have been just as excellent as the first two. I give it a B+.",X-Men - The Last Stand
178,EthanBJones_03,Just plain average. Wouldn't Recommend.,5,9 April 2017,"Plot Overview: ​After news of a possible mutant cure breaks, Mangeto(Ian McKellen) gets angry and raises his Brotherhood of Mutants to combat humanity. It's up to Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) and the X-Men to save everyone.Directed by Brett RatnerStarring Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen and Famke Janssen# NO SPOILERS!Overall: This movie was just average. I don't see anything offensively bad or anything ridiculously good. It stands on two feet but just barely. The pros and cons cancel each other out to make a pretty bland and forgettable experience.Wouldn't Recommend.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Hugh Jackman was excellent as Wolverine but that has become mostly common knowledge at this point. Halle Berry was good as Storm as was Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. Kelsey Grammar was a decent Beast. Patrick Stewart was good in his short time as Professor X but the star performance by far was Ian McKellen as Magneto who makes yet another genius performance as he gave in X-Men and X2. The relationship between Charles and Eric was explored more in the beginning of this film which I like and would like to see a more in depth look into. Famke Janssen was very weak as Jean Grey but I feel like she was just directed poorly. Aaron Stanford and Shawn Ashmore were equally awful as polar opposites Pyro and Iceman respectively.I love the implication of Magneto at the end of the movie. Apart from that however, the story and ending were both pretty weak. One main flaw I can say with this movie and I may be the only one who thinks this but I think that more main characters should have died. For a film called 'The Last Stand' I expected more character deaths and give the film more stakes.The cinematography was pretty decent all around and I cannot really flaw that.The effects were mostly good with a few poor looking ones.The attempts at comedy worked for the most part and this movie displays a good range of mutants and utilises them effectively. The action was pretty mediocre and they spent too much time on a build up that didn't pay off. It attempted a much more dramatic turn but it drastically failed.The ONE and ONLY reason the climax is set around San Francisco is because of the Golden Gate Bridge scene.Personally, I really didn't enjoy this movie as much as the others in the franchise but I can see numerous strengths in the movie that made it bearable.5/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
179,johnnymacbest,The captain (YES YOU Ratner!!!) should've went down with his ship.,3,3 June 2008,"Shocking. Shocking beyond belief. Right up there with the Hindenburgh disaster 40 years ago. This (final?) third installment of the critically praised first two films is proof in that comparison. Was it writer's block that fumbled this film? Was it sheer ineptness? Lack of any real genuine motivation or conviction? Or was it to simply make money; at the cost of artistic value? It's all of the above, unfortunately clearly as in the case of this film.The plot: Poorly executed and lopsided. Since Brian Singer had great respect for the material and was deeply passionate on his craft, very little if any respect is given to the film whatsoever. Brett Ratner's take on X-men is more in line with commercial interests in mind and it is very apparent throughout the entire film; namely that of the new characters such as Angel, Beast, Juggernaut, Multiple Man, and Leech. Barely any of them as well as Storm or Kitty Pride get a chance to develop due to the hyperactive, ADD-infused screenplay with no backbone. Never do the audience get an insight into the inner workings of the actual plot (or lack thereof) and atmosphere that made parts 1 and 2 so riveting.The acting: With regards to Halle Berry, the beautiful actress who won an Oscar for her performance in ""Monster's Ball"" is still awfully restrained and wooden in X3. I found it hard to emote with her simply because all her lines were spoken as if they were read off of cue cards as things went along. The screenwriters and Ratner make a HUGE critical mistake of reducing Cyclops (James Marsden) for lack of a better term a ""token character"" who gets ""cop'd out"" early in the film. This is also true of Famke Janssen as the Dark Phoenix, a mutant with astronomically astounding psionic powers. Her scenes with Cyclops and Wolverine were so lifelessly stilted it almost felt as if I was watching Charlie Chaplin for the first time. It's a shame the producers couldn't elaborate more on her character or ANY of the old and new mutants for that matter and that's why the film suffers for those very same reasons.Continuity errors: Oh my. There are so many in abundance, I'll just note some of them; especially the scene where Magneto (played excellently by Ian McKellan) uses his magnetic powers to move the Golden Gate bridge when day INSTANTLY turns to night. The first time I saw that scene, I nearly burst into laughter and tears and as far back as I can remember, I don't think I was ever alone at the time it happened and when the Juggernaut said ""Do you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!!!, I completely lost it. Personally, I don't know why the Danger Room was included, other than to be ""just another cool effect"". with no rationale behind it all. Frankly, showing the mutants on a coffee break should suffice. One thing I can't do is accuse the film of lacking action. The action scenes and special effects are simply impressive. Watching them was like witnessing a very good fireworks display with the wide eyes of a child. Yes the film has some very good action scenes but even they couldn't save this film from mediocrity.X-Men 3: The Last Stand is the worst movie in the franchise...period. None of the awe, mystery, and magic are in this film. Brett Ratner butchered the treasured mythology of these classic mutants into a bloody, incoherent mess. This crap-fest should be done. Done.And one more thing: Iron Man grossed more money than X3. YES!!!!!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
180,jetkot,A Nice Entertaining Film,9,10 September 2017,Great on Special effects but slightly low on content. The Climax is filled with too much action. It did not do justice to the previous two films of the franchise. I am still to watch the Four other films that were made after this. In this part I enjoyed the character of the Beast. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine played his part well. Famke Jensen had a the most fantastic role with grey shades. Mystique ended too early and left me disappointed. But this franchise is purely entertainment. I love watching it again and again.,X-Men - The Last Stand
181,theshadow908,Save The Best for (The) Last (Stand).,8,26 May 2006,"In this amazing third entry to the X-Men franchise, a man named Warren Worthington invents a cure for mutation. This angers Magneto, so he gains an army hundreds strong to tackle the problem from its source, a young mutant. However, the X-Men, who have been facing dark times after the return of Jean Grey (now the evil Pheonix), are banding together to fight Magneto one last time, and stop the cure from going into production. This is the best of the three movies due to it's great plot, the extravagant action scenes brought by new director Brett Ratner, and the addition of several new mutants.This X-Men film has a great plot that couples amazing action sequences with a real story that involves all sorts of conflict from the X-Men to the Brotherhood, Jean Grey to herself, and the humans to the mutants. The political and real life subtexts are too many to count, and it gives the film a more emotional base. You actually have to stop and think that if this was really happening, what side would you be on? This movie has many plot points that you're not expecting to happen, and it makes the film really exciting to watch. Screenwriters Zak Penn and Simon Kindberg take advantage of the fact that this is the last film in the trilogy by tying up all of the characters' story lines. I can't tell you exactly what happens, but some characters die, while some characters discover new sides to themselves. The series really ends nicely...Until the last scene, and an extra scene after the credits where it leaves it wide open for a 4th entry, even though we know the 4th entry won't come.The new mutants in this film are very well handled by the actors playing them, and it makes really interesting characters. Kelsey Grammar's Beast is as great on screen as on the comic page. He played him perfectly. I was worried that Dr. Fraiser Crane wouldn't be able to pull off Beast's brute fighting skill, but when that time came, my jaw dropped at how cool it was. The only mutant I had a problem with was Angel, who was over-hyped in the trailer and yet only had two scenes. Magneto showed some new tricks in this film, including one with the Golden Gate Bridge, and it was amazing to watch. Brett Ratner's direction when it comes to action is top notch.X-Men: The Last Stand is a non-stop action film that is worth all X-Men/action fans seeing. Great film.8.5/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
182,dilbertsuperman,Don't bother with this worthless ripoff of the other two OK Xmen movies.,2,5 June 2006,"Oh crap, where do I begin with this turd there are SOOO many things wrong with this movie on so many levels. Wolverine is looking pretty old and weak and his blades seem to be some kind of crappy CGI now or something. Rogue is fat and unconvincing as a super hero. A large number of situations occur that defy the laws of simple physics and left me CRINGING at the STUPIDITY of the writers of this script- what idiot losers. I think the standard pack of coke snorting hollycrap bisexuals wrote this trash because there is a scene where a suspension bridge is torn up and then used as a bridge elsewhere- without the pylons or the suspension!!! NOt only would that bridge fall apart the second the suspension snapped it would sink to the bottom without pylons. Various other things occur that can only happen in the imagination of someone who has no imagination.One of the DUMBEST scenes was when all the mutants land in front of a long line of soldiers all armed with a weapon that could take their mutant powers away from them- and they turn their back on them and fight evil mutants. What a plot hole you could drive a mack truck through. All the Xmen know they are hunted as well and would never trust a soldier not to shoot them in the back or accidentally shoot them with something that would take their powers forever.. it's idiotic to the extreme. This movie is A RIPOFF of the success of the previous two BOYCOTT this movie it is TRASH.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I also don't care about the right translation of books into movies. The only reason I saw the last stand is Mrs. Famke Janssen portraying Jean grey aka dark Phoenix. I absolutely LOVE her performance. She has unfortunately a very limited screen time but once she's on she is truly on! Her presence and acting is spectacular. The Xavier - house scene is in my opinion the best scene of the whole x men franchise. She shows so much power and presence, everything works in this scene just perfect. The tension, the havoc and ultimately the shock once she evaporates Xavier. The sensational Phoenix theme/score underlines everything. To me by far the best x men movie due to Mrs.Janssen and the evolution of an average Jean Grey Charakter into an epic Dark Phoenix.",X-Men - The Last Stand
185,nobbytatoes,a fitting climax to the x-men trilogy,8,25 May 2006,"The in-differences between humans and mutants are starting to simmer; a moment of peace. Though this peace doesn't last long when a pharmaceutical company has discovered a cure for the mutant race; a cure to suppress the mutant gene forever. Division is drawn through the mutants. Many look towards this as a way of freedom from persecution and a path to normality, while others say they need no cure. Still grieving over the lose of Jean, Scott is an emotional wreck, while Logan still mourns, he figures best to move on. From the ashes of Jean's resting place, Jean has resurrected, but not the Jean she originally was.When director Bryan Singer, of the previous two films of the X-Men, dropped from the third installment to direct the next Superman film, tension had risen. Taking the director seat, Brett Ratner has been given the argues task to deliver the final installment of the X-Men series. Screen Writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn have tapped into a vital themes that underpins the X-Men; acceptance, intolerance, change, individualism and the uniqueness of everyone. While Simon and Zak have tapped into these themes, when you look at their previous films they've penned, they all been in the realm of action. While the X-Men franchise has been in the action genre, it has gone above the limits to dig into the characters, to drive the film. X-Men: The Final Stand has lost that character driven force.From the get go, the action shoots in ever direction, with an opening fight that draws upon the original cartoon series. The energy doesn't drop from there, the pacing is lighting fast without stop for a breath. It's chaotic and frenetic. Not until the second act does the pace slow down and characters are fleshed out and the sub-text starts to be drawn out. While mutants divide on the cure, friendships are torn and tested to there limits; Rogue and Bobby, Xavier and Magneto, Jean and Logan, the human population and the mutant population.While the action does over run the film, its hard to say that it isn't of a high standard. The adrenaline pumps so hard and fast. The special effects are outstanding and visually amazing. The scene on the Golden Gate bridge is breath taking, while the final battle is perfectly crafted and executed.Reprising their roles, the original cast return, though Nightstawker to be seen this time. All do a great performances in their roles, with the induction of new character that are added to the mix. Kelsey Grammar is amazing as the humble Beast. Vinnie Jones brings a tongue in check quality to Juggernaut. Ben Foster is good as Angel, yet very under used. Dania Ramirez as Callisto and Ellen Page as Kitty are good too.Brett Ratner has delivered on all accounts a fitting end to the X-Men trilogy, it just would have been better to see Bryan Singer's version, to finish off his master piece trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
186,kgprophet,"All the Strong Points there, except the Music Score",6,26 May 2006,"I was delighted to see my fears were unfounded as the 3rd outing still had something new to offer, except for periods where it felt like ""X Men: 90210"". There were imaginative set pieces, huge plot twists, a good amount of Wolverine, and the ""Mutants are People too"" vibe. What kept it from being a gripping and driven film is the absence of a compelling score (see IMDb trivia about this movie and ""Superman Returns""). It is easy to tell when a movie is not greater than the sum of it's parts. I think of ""U.S. Marshalls"", the sequel to ""The Fugitive""; there was something not quite there in the pacing, or in the framing of the shots, or the subtlety in the lighting. There are few FX shots that are that kind of 'wow' these days, and only near the end do the fireworks really begin. However, the script was thankfully bulletproof. With all characters well established, the arc of each character's stories are exciting to watch, and I can only say that the Blue Beast was too boring to justify the amount of screen time given. Here the Hairy over-sized cookie monster has to muddle through boring C-SPAN political dullness that gave me flashbacks of the Intergalactic Senate in the ""Star Wars"" prequels. None of that procedural mumbo jumbo carries an ounce of the story's momentum. Whatever is discussed can just be recapitulated as a CNN news report, or in a few lines of dialogue. But back to the Music Score, John Powell's bland scoring was lacking when the right moment was needed, or, the film mix needed tweaking. Actually, the showing I was at had some sound glitches in the beginning two reels, so that may have been a factor as well. I think the story material more than makes up for the weaknesses, and you may find yourself choking a tear or two. I recommend those who have seen the other X Men movies to go see how the X Men world turns.",X-Men - The Last Stand
187,alainenglish,Uneven but still quality ending to the X-Men series,7,14 November 2009,"The conclusion to the X-Men series (discounting the ""X-Men Origins"" franchise) is a quality film experience. Whilst lacking the touch and character involvement of the first two films, it's still an exciting ride.Scientists have discovered a cure for the mutant gene, leading to a violent campaign by Magneto (Ian McKellen) to halt it's production. He is opposed by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who must also contend with Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen), his former apprentice who has returned from the dead in a new, darker persona...There are too many new characters here and only a few of them have any effect. Kelsey Grammar's Beast is no substitute for Alan Cummings similarly blue-skinned Nightcrawler, and Ben Foster's winged Angel looks great but does not have much of a character. On the other hand, Dania Ramirez is sizzling as Callisto, Vinnie Jones plays it for laughs as musclebound Juggernaut and Ellen Page makes a great debut as Kitty Pryde. Her scene with Juggernaut is funny, and demonstrates the actor's knack for comic timing.Of the returning players, Hugh Jackman is still good as the rough-and-ready Wolverine (hence why he got his own film) and McKellen and Stewart stamp their usual gravitas on proceedings, although a scene where they're digitally made up to look young is unconvincing. Daniel Cudmore, Shawn Ashmore and Anna Paquin are great in their respective roles. Famke's Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix does not have very much to do, limiting her dramatic impact.The special effects and action scenes lack the touch of the first two but are still great fun. The finale in San Francisco is superb.Not a great motion picture, but still polished and entertaining enough to deserve a place alongside it's predecessors.",X-Men - The Last Stand
188,tankace,A failed ending,6,15 March 2016,"The last Stand is without a doubt the worst of the original x-men trilogy. It is dumb,boring and the characters in the movie are neither likable nor persons that you could relate to like the first two movies. This movie was the beginning of the ""New Dark Age"", as I call it, of comic book movies that lasted for about 3 to 4 years and the majority of that type of film was either critically, commercially or both banned and it took the rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the the superheroes to come back even stronger than before. This would the worse movie in the x-men film series up until the X-men Origins Wolverine ,which is considered to be one the worse films of the superheroes' movies as a whole",X-Men - The Last Stand

For the first time, mutants have a choice: retain their uniqueness, though it isolates and alienates them, or give up their powers and become human. The opposing viewpoints of mutant leaders Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who preaches tolerance, and Magneto (Ian McKellen), who believes in the survival of the fittest, are put to the ultimate test triggering the war to end all wars. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) becomes possessed with the power of the Dark Phoenix and the X-Men must stop her before her powers destroy the entire planet. This movie should have had some more fight scenes to make it a more interesting final battle but it was still good. The only new characters in this last X-Men movie are Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Hank McCoy/Beast (Kelsey Grammar) and Warren Washington/Angel (Ben Foster). Plus Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) and Shadowkat (Ellen Page) get some more time in the spotlight since they had little time in X-Men 2. But it was too bad that Cyclops (James Marsden) and some other characters had to be killed off. Plus I have always enjoyed Hugh Jackman's performances in the X-Men movies as Wolverine. All and all X-Men 3 was good but there some characters from the comic book that they forgot to include in the movie.BOTTOM LINE: A GOOD ENDING TO THE X-MEN TRILOGY",X-Men - The Last Stand
190,Puroo,Okay so whose idea was this?,5,11 April 2021,"X-Men: The Last Stand was the first X-Men movie I had ever watched. The house fight scene where Wolverine, Storm and Xavier get beaten was the first scene I saw of an X-Men movie. So you can understand how heavy of an impact this movie left on me. My hero, my man, all 3 of them, getting beaten to pulp. But I thought probably that's just one scene and they may get their comeuppance later. And so I stopped watching this movie. I watched it many years later when I began watching every movie from this franchise.So this movie suffers from something I like to call ""replacement disruption"". It means when someone replaces the director of the movie and then the director makes the movie as if he has never seen the franchise before. Like Joss Whedon for Justice League, Chris Miller in Shrek the Third, Richard Lester for Superman III, Joel Schumacher for Batman Forever etc. This movie throws away all the concepts established previously. Wolverine no longer cares about Rogue, Scott dies as soon as the movie begins, Xavier is killed off, Magneto discards Mystique once she's of no use to him and Wolverine KILLS Phoenix!I really hate what this movie did to my favourite heroes, but I like the fact that this movie has some really good CGI. It shows the concept of mutants being shamed into thinking that they are bad because of their superpowers, and that they should give them up and live like humans. This was actually a really interesting storyline, and it should have been the one which should have been given more emphasis instead of whatever Jean was doing. Warren Worthington III was also a very interesting character and should have been given more screen time.The visual appeal, the score and the acting are all perfect, but the terrible storyline and lack of understanding the concept is what ruins it. Batman v Superman also had the same problem, but at least that was supposed to be the tone of the franchise. Here the tone of the franchise was very different, and this movie is the one which completely changed it and made X-Men the diverse franchise which it is. It is the reason why we got Deadpool and Logan, so I guess that's one good thing that came out of this movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
191,Trevor-Kerensky,A good idea hindered by lousy execution,6,29 July 2018,"I had so many hopes for this film, though I heard Bryan Singer was not returning. We got Brett Ratner of the Rush Hour films as the director, but here he may have overdone it. Too many heroes, too many villains, and too many plot points all mashed together. It could have been better if they had just limited the characters. I'm not sure Angel and Beast were even needed for this (Beast looked like Grover from Sesame Street with his blue fur). The mutant cure idea sounded a little far-fetched but it could have worked alone without the other plot lines. And there were a lot of other far-fetched WTF moments in the movie, but I'll keep the details to a minimum. Not only that, how were there so many mutants involved in the movie? It's like they all popped out of nowhere. There were many things in this movie that felt tacked on and forced.Bottom line: If you enjoyed the first two, you might want to skip this one. If you enjoy mindless action, give it a try. If you're not a comic book nut, don't bother.",X-Men - The Last Stand
192,GeorgeRoots,"In All Honesty, Something Really Bugged Me About This One.",5,3 September 2014,"Brett Ratner takes over directing duties this time around. In all honesty I feel that this film isn't all too bad, but it can't help but seem like a horrible cash-in just so we can see portions of the ""Dark-Phoenix"" saga come to the big screen. Being that the ""X-Men"" film rights are owned by 20th Century Fox, what is probably one of the biggest moments in Marvel comics history ultimately gets sh*t-canned in it's big screen adaptation.In the wake of the last movie, that wonderful character development is gone as well as that smart dialogue driven story. The tense fear of mutants is escalating, and what we end up with is ""the Cure"". The Cure for genetic mutation has been discovered, and Magneto finally begins his master plan to (Shocker) eliminate mankind. This involves enlisting the help of similar idealists such as the ""Omega-clan"", and ""The Juggernaut"" (Possibly the worst casting idea there ever was, was putting English hard-nut Vinnie Jones as ""The Juggernaut"").However, we are extremely fortunate to get Beast in this movie played by Kelsey Grammar, and is possibly the best casting decision in this film by far. Aside from that, the film just felt lazy for the whole 1 hour 40 minutes. The exposition is heavy as we watch some noticeable cast members die, and events unfold at a snail's pace. We get a pretty impressive, yet kinda dull ""Last Stand"" fight scene, horrendous dialogue as well as un-driven and uninspiring characters that above all destroy everything that made Bryan Singer's movies so respectable. If that's all you wanted then I recommend it, but if your expecting a better well paced progression from ""X-Men 2"", you may be disappointed.Final Verdict: Looking back ""The Last Stand"" is on it's knees, but it's also far from being atrocious. 5/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
193,jmbwithcats,Not for the Picky,6,29 January 2008,"Overall an enjoyable movie, but it might have been far better if it had followed the comics more closely... I was a little disappointed, and here's why ... but first the review.Rogue, Anna Paquin is gorgeous, and this film had some nice pacing. Many of the characters are sidelined for most of the film, going so far as to alienate them even in death.Some great effects and character interaction, I had fun.What they did though is completely bastardize the X-MEN comics by throwing together elements from a What If comic, elements from X-men time lines that didn't even align, and left out major players and relationships.1 Handling of Dark Phoenix I was really looking forward to them creating Dark Phoenix as larger then life as in the comic, but they instead opted to portray her with a more zombie look than her fire aspect from the comics which were beautifully deadly.Check out the pictures here of Dark Phoenix, her costume and intensity... why didn't they have those elements in the film? Also in the comic ""What if Phoenix Had Not Died?"", what brings Jean down is her own torment at having killed Scott, her true love from her innocent life... in the movie Scott dies and no one seems to give it a second thought? A huge disappointment for me was since this movie was largely based on a What if comic, in which Dark Phoenix kills Scott and Professor X, in the end she destroys the entire world after realizing she had killed her one true love. hell she might have even destroyed the universe.I didn't expect that, but I did expect her to come down from her Dark Phoenix trip by acknowledging she had killed Cyclops, remember him? Her true love? But no, no mention of his death at all! To me that's just lazy writing.What a loss, they really could have used that, it would have made more sense than Jean saying to Wolverine, ""save me"".Jean has the power of a phoenix. A phoenix always rises from its ashes.Phoenix is the most powerful mutant (I believe), and a tragedy. She is nearly archetypal in importance.2 Kitty/Colossus In the comics Kitty and Colossus were a pair until he killed for the first time and gets all scary and estranged from her, things don't get any better when (now correct me if I'm wrong) Kitty dies in the comics and he completely loses it after that.Kitty Pryde - Too short and stubby in the comics she was about 5'9"" and slim and very bouncy like a kitten.3 Colossus He didn't even fight at the island that we saw, and we saw nothing of his awesome look from the comics.4 Wolverine I mean Wolverine's height has really fluctuated over the past few years in the ""core"" X-titles, but all of us real fans know he is only 5'3"". Hugh Jackman is Wolverine Even though he's 6'2, there really is no question about it. Just as Christopher Reeve was the quintessential Superman. So I let the height thing slide.5 Juggernaut In a comic book where Wolverine is standing next to him, he is standing on top of a bar... and Juggs is STILL 4 feet taller than Wolverine, not to mention his arms are the size of wolverine's torso... though Jugg is like 9' tall in the comics so you'd have to CGI him to make him look right I suppose. Also his helmet looked like crap.6 Finale In the comics, when Professor X died, Magneto becomes a good guy and takes over as leader of the X-Men. I'd like to point out that Professor X did not die by the hand of Jean in the comics, that death is from a ""What If"" issue called ""What if Phoenix Had Not Died"" and exists completely outside the X-men universe) Turning Magneto into ""one of them"" was just stupid writing.7 Sentinels The sentinels were hardcore and didn't come til later and nearly killed every mutant and became the toughest fights for the X-men, if I am remembering the comics correctly, it's been awhile, but they were only shown once in the film during a holographic training session.In closing we must remember the ""cure"" Suppresses mutant gene X, doesn't get rid of, which means it could dissipate over time and lead into a fourth installment.Speculation? X4 will possibly align with the comics with Magneto replacing Professor X as leader of the X men against the Sentinels... maybe... and introduce the Kitty/Collosus love story, and Wolvie's fascination with Asian bombshells post Jean.",X-Men - The Last Stand
194,troyputland,Not so bad when you get your head past the shocks.,6,1 March 2016,"Bryan Singer should have never declined The Last Stand. The reigns went to Brett Ratner, who's taken us on a severe roller-coaster of emotions. Now having watched this more than once, I can safely say I feel warmer towards it, knowing full well what takes place, and to be honest, it's not all that bad. TLS doesn't stand up to X2, but it has big guts with a battle to end all battles. The government are giving mutants a 'choice', by providing an antidote to cure them of their powers. Whilst some mutants accept this bargain, others refuse and unite against this 'threat'. Stuck in the middle are the X-Men, who have Jean Grey to contend with. Her powers are too strong for her to handle. Her alter-ego Phoenix threatens to destroy everything. The Last Stand is both riveting and insanely annoying, because it dare do what other superhero films (or most of films for that matter) do not. The aggravation comes from certain events being brushed swiftly under the carpet. The end show-down more than makes up for the haphazard middle section, so it does not end on such a sour note.",X-Men - The Last Stand
195,barberoux,Good effects; confusing story.,7,6 June 2006,"""X-Men: The Last Stand"" was OK for a summer action movie. The special effects were good and the story moved quick enough to keep me entertained. The story consists of the mutant X-men against the government, who want to ""cure"" mutants. If you are familiar with the stories this episode is just more of the same. That leads to one of the criticisms I have about the movie. Too many of the characters, and events, have a back story from the comics and in order to really appreciate the fullness of the plot the audience must be somewhat intimate with the Marvel comic culture. Many events and characters are presented in a kind of abbreviated fashion, like short hand. I never read Marvel comics and so much of the movie was not quite confusing but hazy, like who was Kelsey Grammar supposed to be, someone with testosterone poisoning and a heart condition? I figure he was a mutant due to the blue skin and hairiness but since I wasn't privy to the back story the character was just another oddity. I'm sure I could find lots of information on his character on the web but I think a movie must stand alone and not require research before seeing. The acting was OK given the preposterousness of the plot. I found the interpersonal scenes a bit maudlin. Of course the scene with Ian McKellen at the chess board hints at more sequels making the ""Last Stand"" part of the title a bit of a joke. Overall the movie was fun with good special effects and if you don't take it too seriously, nor care for character development, it is worth seeing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
196,monstermayhem32,good but too short,7,31 May 2006,"x men 3 was the best out of the three films but the film felt a bit too crammed. James mardsten, Rebbecca romijn, Daniel cudmore, Ben foster and Anna paquin were given hardly material to do. Hugh Jackman and halle berry were given a lot to do in this film but as always the films focus too much on wolverine even though Hugh Jackman plays the part extremely well. i certainly hope that there is a fourth x men film since there is no way to end the x men franchise after three films which is quite dumb. the fight scenes were quite cool, Kelsey grammar was believable as beast and gave the film some great humor between him and wolverine which was cool to see. i recommend this film to fans who love the x men franchise dearly but i think there are many future sequels to come and can be done without some of it's main castmembers.",X-Men - The Last Stand
197,cosmic_quest,Fun flick but not the X-Men,6,25 May 2006,"I found 'X-Men: The Last Stand' to be enjoyable enough for an action flick yet it was lacks the essence of the comic books and leaves you wishing they had just waited for Bryan Singer to finish with 'Superman Returns' so he could work on this.This film sees tensions between humans and mutants reach an all-time high as the government turn a mutant 'cure' into a weapon, something Magneto is all to quick to exploit for his Mutant Freedom cause. Meanwhile, Jean Grey has returned from the dead to unleash the darker side of her powers and her old team-mates are forced to realise she is now the enemy.The usual main protagonist characters of Xavier, Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Jean, Rogue and Bobby are back and in usual form (with the exception of Jean, who has undergone a few changes!). Without giving too much away, how this film differs from the previous two is that we don't get almost full focus on Wolverine, Rogue and Xavier this time and instead Storm and Bobby are given the chance to play a larger role while new and lesser known characters are brought into the limelight. Kitty Pryde is finally given a bit of a personality rather than just being 'the girl who can walk through walls' and we get to meet Beast, who is wonderfully brought to life by Kelsey Grammar. On the sidelines, there is also more of Colossus and an introduction to Warren 'Angel' Worthington.On the side of the antagonists, there is a deeper insight into Magneto's character and the audience are truly left wondering whether he is unhinged or just a determined man whose goals may be harsh but are right way for mutants. It's a dilemma that makes clear why Magneto is never short of supporters and Sir Ian McKellen's excellently vehement performance in the role serves to highlight there is much more to the character than his just being a stereotypical 'bad guy'. It's also interesting to see how he and Xavier were once good friends and even as their friendship has cooled when their differing goals for the future of mutants has divided them, there is still an underlying sense of respect between them. Pyro is back and though he tries to come across in a darker light, instead he just seems like a moody, self-absorbed brat who is in a huff because Bobby was teacher's pet. On the other hand, Vinnie Jones is effective as Juggernaut, getting to indulge in his real-life thuggery in the role.The special effects are as spectacular as expected, with impressive action scenes (especially in the final battle) as we see the mutants' powers brought to life. So, what's the problem then? Well, quite simply, it wasn't all that was promised in the second film. X2 was superior because it did portray the idea that the X-Men are a team who all work together whereas here leaves you wondering 'where is everyone?' Also, Phoenix was not the awesome creature hinted at in X2 or depicted as in the comic books and instead she just seemed like Jean suffering from a bit of PMT. As such, there wasn't any sense of shock when she unleashed her powers but rather a sense that you wished she'd just give herself a shake and grow up. Purists of the comic books will definitely find it hard to digest the fact this film veers further away from comic book canon in the same vein as the previous two films did, especially the timeline of events like Angel's introduction and the fate of three major characters.'X-Men: The Last Stand' will keep most people amused for a couple of hours, if they ignore comic book mythology, but I personally was left feeling as if it wasn't the X-Men that I loved in the comic books and Nineties cartoon show. And the ending is such that it is both a satisfying way to round off a trilogy and also leaves room for a possible fourth film, I hope they just reboot and start afresh if they ever do go back to the franchise. Maybe then, we can get a Cyclops and Storm who aren't a B-characters, the real Phoenix, an adult Rogue, a Gambit and many other important elements missing from the film series.",X-Men - The Last Stand
198,curtis-8,Great Second Sequel That Wastes No Time,10,20 June 2006,"Personally, I think the producers, writers, and Ratner hit this one out of the park. In my opinion there is little if any validity to the popular notion among fanboys that the film lacks characterization. To me, a third act--and that's what this really is as there is a conclusion to the general story arc of the trilogy-- is not so much about further developing characters, but in driving the characters and situations already presented towards the conclusion. We already know the main characters, their backgrounds, relationships, motivations, etc. By this point the actors are inside the skins of them to such a degree that a raised eyebrow or particular movement or tone of voice carries more weight and meaning. And I think the actors carry it off with aplomb. Are the minor mutants less developed? Yes--that's why they're minor characters--a sketch is all we need of them to develop the story, which focuses on the established main characters.Now, would X-3 stand up well on it's own? No, it would not. Because--ta daaaa--there would be a lack of proper character development! But that's because this is the third act in a classic three act story arc. That's how the filmmakers decided to do it. You just don't introduce whole new, fully rounded characters in the third act. They could have made it a whole new story, introduced the new characters with fully developed lives as though the series was going to go on for another ten movies. BUT they decided to bring closure to the story lines of Wolverine, Jean, Storm, Xavier, Rogue, Cyclops, and Magneto--the most important characters to the story arc. I personally think it was a wise decision, because I like stories with a beginning, middle, and an end. We can pick up with the lives of the others in later films.But as the third act and conclusion of the story arc, it was fantastic (Fat nerds all around me were shedding tears at the end). I thought the clarity of the plot provided by the screenwriters and Ratner's clear visualization of that story was refreshing and wonderfully free of bloat (unlike that piece of crap King Kong).And, I'd like to add that those who complain that the movie makers did not make proper use of the comic book story lines should just keep it in their nerdly pants. The films are the films, the comics are the comics. One need not replicate the other. To paraphrase what Cyclops said in the first filmyou want them to run around in yellow and blue tights as well?",X-Men - The Last Stand
199,CountJonnie,"Great movie, no cliché!!!!",8,23 July 2006,"I loved part 1 and 2 already, for being more serious and mature than movies such as the great Spiderman and the awful Hulk and Daredevil (however I DID enjoy all of them).X-Men has a good and bad side. There are too many superheroes. This results in getting to see many of your heroes, but some of them don't get enough screen time. This does NOT make the movie less fun to watch.I can tell the directing is good, the effects are great and subtle, the storyline is terrific and is a good conclusion to part 2 and the action was wonderful.But what I liked the most was that there were no clichés. Spiderman and Daredevil are loaded with clichés such as 'no heroes get killed', 'no blood & gore', 'family values', 'speaches', 'hero gets girl', etc.In X-Men 3 however, without the gore, people GET killed. People DO dislike each other (Cyclops & Wolverine). No speech before and after the fight. Just a great fight. Etc....I liked X-Men 3 just as I liked Spider-man 2. Only with Spiderman 2 I kept saying: ""Please get it on with."" / ""Hurry up.""",X-Men - The Last Stand
200,the amorphousmachine,The big disappointing comic-book movie for 2006!,5,19 February 2008,"(MASSIVE SPOILERS) Okay, it's taken me well over a year to finally write a comment on 'X-Men: The Last Stand', or 'X3', or 'X-Men 3', or whatever you want to call it. I call it crap! First bad sign that this film was going to suck was the change of director. Now, one could argue that 'Superman Returns' was equally bad but that film had a little poetry, and one could also argue that 'Spider-man 3' had the same director for all three, but...wellthey'd have a point.. Anywho, I was worried prior to 'X-Men 3' release because of the director change. I was thinking the Batman franchise for some reason. I believed in Ratner ever so slightly, and I was hoping for the best. And let's face it; the trailer was pretty good! However, 'X-Men 3' was a massive disappointment, and excruciatingly bad in parts, particularly Vinnie Jones's utterance of ""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"". By the time that line was uttered, the film had completely lost me. I'm not even going to bother explaining the plot, but the way they handled the death of Cyclops was atrocious. So, that really annoyed me! His character was treated with utter disdain, that it only seemed to serve the purpose of giving Wolverine an angle to hit on Jean Grey. The whole Dark Phoenix thing was really annoying, as well as the plot revolving around the cure. Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor X (Patrick Stewart) needed more screen time, but I found it particularly ridiculous that the X-Men's biggest villain has his base of operations in a forest. A forest? Not Asteroid M, a forest! Plus, add to the fact that all Magneto's henchmen and women were emos with mutant powers! OK, moving on! Well, I guess I'll go with my main grievances with this film. Firstly, the promise of the Sentinels playing a part in this film was reduced to a danger room exercise. Secondly, Angel! By far one of my favourite characters had only one purpose in this movie, and that was to stop being an angry teen, and forgive his father by saving him. It's almost like he didn't even join the X-Men. He just rocked up in time to save his dad, and then left the other X-men to battle Magneto, while we all waited for Dark Phoenix to do something. Beast was okay, and he had a reasonably smooth transition. Iceman kind of worked, and it was good to see him actually become Iceman! My third main annoyance with this film was the fixation on Wolverine, but also on Hugh Jackman. He just walked through this movie without even getting his claws dirty. I think Hugh was far too busy thinking about his performance in 'The Prestige', cause he was really really good in that film, but in 'X-Men 3' he seemed bored and uninspired and had completely lost his edge that he had in the first two films. One of the things I remember saying after seeing the movie was how bad Hugh Jackman was in it! Comic book films seem to drop the ball with the third one, and unfortunately, 'X-Men: The Last Stand' is no exception to the rule. Sure, it's not as bad as 'Ghost Rider', 'FF: Rise of the Silver Surfer' or other comic book films. However, when the series kicks off so well under the guidance of Singer, the disappointment for this instalment is quite massive, and I won't be rushing to see a fourth one.**½ out of *****!",X-Men - The Last Stand
201,shanfloyd,"Smart, politically inspired script, awesome action... definitely a huge summer blockbuster.",8,29 May 2006,"In Ratner's hands, X3 becomes more story-centered, with diverse ideas and sub-plots. Character development was given least importance. The basic plot leaves the straight Magneto vs Xavier or Human vs Mutant simplicity. It becomes a complex tale of rationality and existence. Some major characters are dealt with surprising change and some new characters are introduced. The story gives rise to enough questions and though-provoking insights. In short, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is not just another comic-book movie, it's an original film with interesting philosophy, where only the premise is a comic book.Ratner took some revolutionary decisions when it comes to dealing with characters like Jean Grey, Xavier, Mystique, Cyclops and Magneto. Among the newly introduced characters, Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde was given the best handling, especially in the last action sequence. For the other characters, Anna Paquin's Rogue was definitely under-used. Rebecca Romijn's (Mystique) only memorable part was lying naked on the floor. Regulars like Logan, Storm, Iceman etc are in usual bloom and carry the story. Yet, for the first time the story perhaps avoids focusing on one character. One may argue that this film is mostly about Jean (or her alter-ego Phoenix, rather) but no, that's a misconception. This film is solely about the Cure and its effects.The action sequences are quite enjoyable, often with smart comic moments. The use of visual effects is also perfect. One major flaw in this film is perhaps the absurd extent of Phoenix's capabilities as shown. Somehow they felt suddenly just too much. And it was a major part of the film's plot. But let's not be bothered about that, because X Men 3 has got all the elements of a successful summer blockbuster.",X-Men - The Last Stand

But if you like X Man, but you want good movies, this one has some things to improve. First at all, should have a better script. Only by the FX this movie has some interest. Also, the characters has some deep, but is not enough. I want a confrontation, not a story about hopes, peace within the persons, and others things like that. As a fan, I could give a better story. And maybe all of you also. This movie deserves a chance. I'm waiting the next one. For the next one, maybe the use of Spiderman, or other Marvel characters could be a good choice.",X-Men - The Last Stand
203,luke-a-mcgowan,A fantastic conclusion to a great trilogy,9,13 April 2016,"1. I am yet to hear a criticism of X-Men: The Last Stand that I deem legitimate. Criticisms of Brett Ratner's personality are as irrelevant as they are circumstantial. Criticisms of how he adapted the Phoenix saga are also irrelevant – films should be judged on their merits, rather than complaining about things lost from the source material. There has been no fundamental misunderstanding of the character like in Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, because Ratner and his actors are continuing acclaimed work from X2, with no one undergoing a schizophrenic personality change. As for complaints about Ratner's film depowering and killing off major characters, good! Not every comic book film should be Captain America and the Deux Ex Machina Soldier. 2. The stakes are high in The Last Stand, as they should be for a film with such a title. The death of Scott and the depowering of Mystique ramp the stakes up for Jean's powers and the mutant cure respectively. Having the Phoenix kill the man Jean loves alienates her from the audience instantly, whilst losing Mystique ensures that the cure does not become some MacGuffin threat. The death of Professor Xavier creates a void in the middle of the film, a sense of helplessness in the face of Jean's power and leaving the X-Men leaderless. 3. For a film that rushed production, Ratner's film does a great job paying attention to two great stories (mutant cure and Phoenix) that have surprisingly little to do with each other. Each feels fully realised and has a resolution. Subplots for Hank McCoy as the Secretary for Mutant Affairs, Rogue seeking out the cure for herself and Warren Worthington saving his father take up little screen time but contribute significantly to the film and the resolution of those characters. 4. There is a lot more conflict within the team this time, whether it is through love triangles, the cure or what to do with Jean. Patrick Stewart gets his least serene and most impressive moment in a scene where he refuses to justify himself to Wolverine regarding the Phoenix.5. Ian McKellen stands tall and proud as Magneto, retaining his dignity but essentially becoming a firebrand leader. Whilst in the past, Magneto has been inflammatory as to restrictions, when he sees the cure weaponised he sees this as a declaration of war. Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine – his using flame wreckage to light his cigar is almost Jack Sparrow levels of irreverence, but throughout the film he finds responsibility thrust upon him and begins to take it on. Aaron Stanford is great as Pyro, and the great Anthony Heald is wasted in a single scene part. R. Lee Ermey has a cameo and that should make everyone happy.6. Whilst the movie could certainly have gone without Psylocke, Arclight and Kid Omega, I don't agree that the movie is overstuffed with characters. There's no character who vanishes without explanation, and everyone who comes away has achieved something or grown as a person.7. The dialogue is still intelligent and sticks to the themes – Magneto's conference sounds like a terrorist leader, Hank McCoy's resignation scene doesn't pander to people not up to date on politics, and there's some great lines of dialogue like Scott telling Wolverine that not everyone heals as quickly as he does. 8. There are still some problems with the film, I won't pretend that there aren't. The timeline is all over the place – why did Mystique take so long to come forward? The battle takes place in the afternoon but all of a sudden it is night-time. I also didn't care for was Magneto's final groan ""what have I done?"" – it makes no sense for his character because he's already seen Jean kill his best friend.9. The action sequences are extremely entertaining, especially the final battle and a skirmish between Wolverine and Spike on the outskirts of Magneto's camp. The film's final set piece of Wolverine and Jean is an emotional one, and the visual effects do a great job at making Wolverine's pain apparent.10. It is my hope that X-Men: The Last Stand will redeem itself over time in the eyes of fans. Ten or twenty years of Marvel churning out garbage will make people appreciate what they had – a tense, intelligent resolution to a great superhero trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
204,moviewiz-4,The best x-men ever,9,29 May 2006,"The final serial of x-men. It is better, more effects, better characters and plot with the sense of humour.Approaching the cinema i noticed the queue to the counter. Most people would like to see x-men, yes, x-men. It is comic book based movie that storm to the cinema couple of years ago. Although i have seen the first and the second parts, i can say this is the best one. Why? When i was a growing adult, five years back. I played this call x-men game and i am amazed that what these characters can do. And.. five years later i soon discovered that technical effects and movie studio can produce such a great visual effects. Really amazing.The movie. well, it is fun, many characters resemble the one in the game especially juggernaut(he is not big enough) and also colossus. By the way, where is gambit? Maybe the producer can waste dozen of poker card for him just to throw it to the enemy.Good work for the director, special effects team, the story writer and the costume designer. hope there is the 4th x-men with more characters and longer story.

205,badajoz-1,Tired retread of worst of Hollywood,2,10 March 2009,"Can barely remember anything about this awful movie. Lazy - no plot and character development - repetitive - seen it all before - boring - even the cast look glad it is the last outing - lack of originality - comic devotees should be left in peace to read their dime novels while grander themes are given $100 million plus to make real movies.Now the stage in UK gets to see Magneto and Professor X reprising roles of two people who do not know what to do next actually musing around for a couple of hours in 'Waiting for Godot!' They could have slipped in half the stage play in this film and nobody would have noticed, despite the pathetic attempt at inferring a Guantanamo Bay subplot.Come on Hollywood, give us a break from this rubbish, which really is just a CGI fest for 16-27 male morons who think dark monotone comic superheroes are cooler than rubbish nerd movies starring Stiller, Rogen etc!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
206,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"somewhat disappointing, but nevertheless entertaining",3,30 June 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand, or X3, is a film of epic proportions - in special effects and action. In storyline and direction, however, it falls short of its predecessors. Brett Ratner fails to capture the magic withheld by Bryan Singer's X-Men an X2: X-Men United. The cast has some strong performances, and a few poor showings. The writing does not develop the new characters (there are a ton), but doesn't have much to work with in the below average script.A cure for mutations has been found. There are four sides to the war. The government, those who want the cure, those who want to maintain peace (Professor X and the X-Men), and those who want to end this mutant/human war. Violently. This is the Brotherhood, led by Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford).There is a startling revelation of Jean Grey, and a few character deaths, one of which you won't see coming, and an ending that you will either love...or hate. You can stay after the credits to see an extra bit, but if you want mystery, then don't stay.The writing and direction do not develop the characters, in particular the characters of Angel and Callisto. These characters are both very interesting, especially Angel, because Ben Foster and Dania Ramirez respectively portray them very well. They really leave a lot to be desired. Okay, I'm done ripping X3. As usual, Patrick Stewart is in excellent form as Professor X, giving his best performance yet. Hugh Jackman does yet another great job as Wolverine, and has some of the coolest lines in the movie. One minor disappointment was Halle Berry as Storm. Her character is given a lot more lines in this threequel, but she doesn't make the most of it. It's hard to say that about an Oscar winner. One new character that does receive development is Beast, played wonderfully by Kelsey Grammar. Grammar is great as one of my favorite X-Men. Now, the best part about X3 is the incredible action and special effects, which is no surprise coming from Brett Ratner. All of the mutant's powers are in top form, and it's amazing. This is a very entertaining movie with a few goofs that only movie buffs like myself will catch. I recommend it to X-Fans and to any action fan, because it will definitely satisfy that appetite.7/10 --spy",X-Men - The Last Stand
207,Jay_Exiomo,The franchise ends (?) not exactly with a bang,6,24 May 2006,"Like a lot of others, I loved the X-Men as a kid (although my first orientation with 'em mutants weren't the comic books but the weekly animated show by Fox). And like a lot of others, I was disappointed when I learned Gambit wouldn't be in the third installment. But for ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", the movie turned out quite well, although a bit disappointing. You do see the difference with the replacement of ""X-Men"" and ""X-2"" director Bryan Singer with director Brett Ratner and there are some VERY surprising (arguably questionable) twists. But it makes for a great popcorn entertainment and it got me and my friend talking about them mutants once again.PLOT DETAILS FOLLOW. In what could possibly the last installment in the franchise, a young mutant named Leech possesses the ability to nullify the powers of those mutants within a certain proximity around him. With this, Warren Worthington II developed a ""cure"" that could permanently suppress mutant powers. His first subject would be his son, Warren Worthington III a.k.a. Angel (Ben Foster), but the latter backs out of the procedure at the last minute and eventually joins the X-Men.Meanwhile, a grief-stricken Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops (James Marsden) returns to Alkali Lake where Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) supposedly died while trying to save the X-Men in a previous mission. He finds Jean alive, although he is killed by the Phoenix - Jean's alter-ego kept in check by Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) telepathic blocks.Phoenix joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants along with other renegade mutants as Magneto (Ian McKellen) wages a final war against humans and destroy the mutant ""cure."" The X-Men (what's left of them anyway), makes a final stand to fulfill what Professor X has dreamed all along - for humans and mutants to be united. PLOT DETAILS END HERE.As with previous X-Men installments, the film suffers from a slow start as each mutant must be introduced (e.g. their powers, a little of their back-story, some of their traits). It's a Garden of Eden for special effects, similar to what mostly comprises summer films nowadays, yet probably a hell for the screenwriters. The buildup to war fills up the second act almost entirely, and for what it's supposed to accomplish, it does well. Aside from regulars like Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry), there are a couple new mutants getting their chance to whop some butt, and that are fascinating to see on the big screen; including Angel, Kitty Pryde a.k.a. Shadowcat (Ellen Page), and Peter Rasputin a.k.a. Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). On the ""evil"" side, there's Callisto (Dania Ramirez), Multiple Man (Eric Dane), and Juggernaut (Vinnie Marko) who's not actually a mutant in the comic books... but I'll stop there. This results in long expositions, which at 104 minutes may be a tad too long for some, but may be fine for those who know the source material fairly well.The main problem is that a lot of this is sub-par compared with the previous two ""X-Men,"" especially with the second one. The main characters blur among the backdrops of the film's plot. I don't want to reveal lots of details about the film, but two characters who have significant roles in both the comic books and the first two films are now reduced mainly to ""pawns."" Jean Grey herself has little else to do either besides look like a woman in serious need of an exorcist. Jackman and Berry, along with McKellen, are on the forefront of this ""ensemble"" film and they carry on with their characters nicely, especially for Berry who has her character Storm upped a notch.But what really matters is that I enjoyed the film - albeit not entirely. The acting and the special effects were pretty much on par as far as summer movies go, but it's how the material is handled that dampen the overall effect. Ratner has the task of filling in Singer's shoes after the latter left the project for ""Superman Returns"" and the change is evident. It still did have some pretty scenes, and many of the special effects used to show each mutant's powers were spectacular. But where the first two had a smart script that mostly made sense, this one feels bloated, and has far too many mutants and subplots.In the end, ""The Last Stand"" is not a disaster of a film as it's still fun to watch. It's not as emotionally effective or as intelligent as its predecessors, and it just kind of went overboard with how it dealt with some of the characters. It's not a terrible movie, not at all. It just falls a little short of the standard of what ""X-2"" set up three years ago. And it just still has no Gambit. Bah.",X-Men - The Last Stand
208,mardalsfossen01,Slight upgrade to X2,8,1 January 2019,"I watched Origins:Wolverine first, then X-Men, X2 and now The Last Stand.
Origins was awesome, made me want to see more, X-Men was decent, I didn't like X2 too much, it was pretty boring for the most parts and this one was a tad better again.
Overall this whole X-Men universe has so much potential and they put a lot of budget into these movies but it's not as great as it could've been. Still I wouldn't say it's bad or trash or give it 1* like a bunch of disappointed people did.
The production level is just so high, it's still nice to watch even if not everything is as epic as it could've been. Some scenes still were epic and I see why they narrated the story the way they did.

209,Jerique,Third chapter almost always a let-down...,3,10 April 2010,"It's a tad-bit better than Spider-Man 3's try at a third (and final chapter) in a comic-book franchise adaptation. But it's not very enjoyable to watch.Firstly, a large number of comic book fans and TV fans of X-Men will realize that this film characters are wrong in many ways. Wolverine never had a thing for Jean Grey, as far as I'm aware. Iceman and Rogue weren't involved in the comic books nor TV show and for the most part this film is just laced with the idea of ""let's kill off as many of the big names we can."" Magneto has become some insipid idiotic character in this film. He walks around with the presence of being a class 3 mutant but during the climax of the film sits back and doesn't deal out an offense where he should. Jean Grey's role seems nearly pointless and once again, the movie revolves around Wolverine.A great number of people have gone to see X-Men Origins: Wolverine but I must ask: what's the point? We've already seen the past three X-Men movies revolve around him. X-Men was supposed to be about a team battling the odds and battling the dangerous foe Magneto. These films turned all that potential into a romance trilogy with a bunch of lazy unfunny writing and cheesy one-liners that leave us baffled.X-Men was a great adaptation but before long, it became all about Wolverine while trying to trick you with being about Rogue or perhaps Magneto. Not long after, X2 came along and showed us that the writers only care about Logan. With more than a dozen great mutants at their fingertips in X-Men: The Last Stand, they still failed and once again focused on the cheesy love story between Wolverine and Jean Grey.Underneath the excess amounts of love, there's jealous brewing between Kitty/Rogue over the affections of Bobby (Iceman) and Mystique's roles has been reduced, while Pyro seemingly takes over as ""second-in-command."" Nothing against Pyro, but I don't find his character to be as outstanding as Mystique.I also didn't agree with the omitting of Night Crawler. He was a staple character in X2 and the main reason I enjoyed the film as much as I shouldn't have. Beast's addition was overshadowed, as was Angel's, by the too many additions of other mutants. There's simply too many mutants to try to show in this film and with the overwhelming story of Wolverine, it's all crammed up too much.Nonetheless, the special effects are still top-notch, and the make-up was the best of the year, I think. It just tried to do too much with too little time. Much like Spider-Man, not enough development, too many villains/mutants. A big, big let-down.",X-Men - The Last Stand
210,jerekra,Best of the Series.,7,3 March 2009,"I thought the first X men film was OK and the second was slightly above average. X Men: The Last Stand I feel is the best of the series and is a pretty good film.Basically in this film a cure is discovered that can cure mutants. Magneto believes this to be the last straw for humans and decides to start a final war against all of them. More trouble occurs when Jean Grey returns in the evil form of the Phoenix and joins Magnetos side.Once again I feel that there is a lack of some character development. Magneto has a bunch of different mutants join his team. Almost all of them are not given much of a backstory, like Juggernaut for example. Angel is in it, but is given a brief explanation how he got his wings and he does not seem to have anything important to add. So it is nice to see him but I am not sure the purpose for him being there.Wolverine and Jean Grey are the most important in this film once again. It is pretty cool how Jean Grey becomes the Phoenix and is more powerful and evil in this form. It is always interesting how good guys become bad guys. I do not want to give too much away but Cyclops does not do much in this film again and I am sort of glad they added other characters to take screen time away from him.I like how they let Ice Man and Colossus do more in this film. Colossus is my favorite and he gets to do some fighting with the other X Men. Also he gets to execute the Fastball Special with Wolverine a few times. And of course he gets to turn into steel which looks awesome. For the most part the special effects in this film are awesome.Ice Man gets to develop more in this film. Also he gets in an awesome duel with Pyro towards the end of the film.The Beast is a new character added for this film. He is played by Kelsey Grammar, an interesting choice. But I think he was well portrayed and is a pretty good character that was added.This film has the most action of all the X men films. THe final twenty minutes or so are spectacular.A few more complaints. I really did not understand why they had to show a young Angel trying to cut off his wings and leaving a bloody mess. That was upsetting. Also I thought at times Rogue seemed lame especially in a scene where she says that Iceman is only after one thing. For the most part there is some confusion as to whether Iceman cheated on ROgue or if he wants to stay with her.Pretty good film. Has some flaws but also has the most action of any X Men film. Recommend this one more than the other two X Men films.",X-Men - The Last Stand
211,TheHande,All around a strong film...,9,19 July 2007,"I was very concerned that the latest addition to the X-Men movie series would be just a brain dead special-effects extravaganza. I have never been this happy about being wrong.What X-Men 3 offers is not just more impressive special-effects and a few new characters. The movie also has a story, a dramatic story and in many ways an ultimate story. Many things change in this film and it is all for the best. This shows that it's not the comic-book, but something much, much more. And as such the film impresses me to a degree equal with the first film where strong themes and actors come together.While all the characters don't get a whole lot of screen-time, most are established quite well and I was especially taken with Kelsey Grammar's performance.The only criticism that I think this film warrants that it perhaps downplayed Scott's death to a certain degree, or perhaps it just seems insignificant due to events elsewhere in the film. I have never been the Cyclops's biggest fan, but did feel a little sorry over this fact.None the less, a spectacular and strong addition to Marvel's impressive library of Comic Book Movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
212,shadowman123,Flawed but fitting end to one of the best comic-to-big screen adaptations.,7,31 December 2006,"I have just finished watching X-Men: The Last Stand and being a fan of the comics, and TV series since I was a kid I was naturally holding high expectations of this final chapter . The last 2 X-Men movies were great and this should of been the one to top it of. Basically this time the story revolves around some sort of cure that has been found for the mutants making them human again , yet again this does not go down well with mutant fundamentalist Magento in whose eyes history is repeating it-self takes it upon him-self and forms a group known as The Brotherhood (Brother hood of evil mutants in the comics). And once again it is up to good old Professer X and the gang to save the world and also deal with the return of Jean Grey who is not quite her-self. First of X-men waste's no time in going into the action straight away and we are shown by the action that this time they mean business. The SFX were great and there were even a few shockers along the way which kept me going , but however not only that but you get to see a few sides to the characters that you not normally see and it was good to show some development on the likes of Wolverine,Storm , even Rogue . The acting was great from the norm of Hugh Jackmamn , Halle Berry , Patrick Stuart, Ian Mckalen , but however I felt that the stand out performance was Kelsay Grammar who played Hank McCoy/Beast (they got him spot on correct, and even Vinnie Jones was fairly amusing as the Juggernaut . However this movie is not without its fair share of problems , although I felt that there was a lot more emotions in this movie compared to the other 2 I did feel that it was a little too rushed and thusly tried to cram a bit too much in 2 hours . I also felt some of the characters were a little over used i.e. Pyro , Clossalus . Another that also bugged me was the changing of the story line and any comic book fan would tell you that they would tell that and I was tempted to take a few marks of for that but I guess I am just a bit too much of a softy . On the whole The Last Stand has a few problems but if you can over look that trust me it will be worth it . A very fine but not perfect end to what has been one of the best comic-to-movie saga's and I am looking forward to solo Wolverine and Magento projects coming up.X-MEN : THE LAST STAND 9 OUT 10 FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK.",X-Men - The Last Stand
213,Chalice_Of_Evil,Not quite as bad as everyone makes out...,7,15 August 2019,"This film has kind of become known as one people point to as supposed evidence that the third films in trilogies (usually) 'suck'. While there are certainly quite a few flaws, it's not entirely horrible...though the still-early-stages de-ageing effects used on Patrick Stewart's Professor Xavier and Ian McKellen's Erik Lehnsherr in a flashback to them meeting a young Jean Grey are pretty freaky-looking in their unnatural smoothness and orange complexion. Apparently-not-THAT-wise Professor X decided that suppressing a dark force/alternate personality inside young Jean that he calls 'the Phoenix' was the wisest course of action (but all she was doing was levitating water!). We're also introduced to young Warren Worthington III, who has angel wings...and that's about the only noteworthy thing regarding his character. He flies, saves a person near the end and is the reason for a cure to mutation being created (which doesn't sit well with Magneto).Cut to the 'present' and we finally get to see Sentinels via a simulation in the Danger Room, with X-Men we know, such as Wolverine, Storm, Iceman and Rogue, whose power should be one of the BEST, but is presented as the lamest. Literally, the only time we see it is on display is when Colossus grabs her so she takes on his 'organic steel' power and is shielded from flying debris....she doesn't even take the initiative to do it herself!), ones we hardly know (the aforementioned Colossus), and ones who've been recast (Ellen Page plays the *third* Kitty pride, after the character made cameos in the two previous films, curiously de-aging between film 1 and 2, as she was played by two different actresses).Poor Cyclops, who's still mourning, gets the least amount of screentime yet, sharing a brief exchange with Wolverine before going off to blast Alkali Lake with his optic beams that he blames for Jean's fate in the last film. Much to his surprise, Jean resurrects (she's a PHOENIX, see)...and that's about the last we see of him. Meanwhile, Magneto's busy recruiting a bunch of forgettable evil mutants because he's still all about ""Humanity sucks, mutants rule!"". Sadly, Magneto's only interesting ally, Rebecca Romijn's Mystique, is sorely wasted/mistreated here. And...we get Vinnie Jones' Juggernaut in exchange? Unfair trade!The prospect of a mutant curse proves divisive among the X-Men, with Rogue looking at it as a chance for her finally to have physical contact without hurting people, while Storm's opposed. After Jean returns, it's not long before she starts getting all black-eyed and veiny as the Phoenix starts to reemerge. There's a scene midway through the movie that's both visually exciting and ""WTF!""-worthy in its shocking climax. Doubt many people saw this coming. It *should* be super emotional, and Hugh Jackman does his best to treat it as so, but one of the film's flaws is that these 'big' moments don't seem to carry as much weight as they could've/should've.There are questionable actions from various characters, some attempts at humour that often fall flat, and even the film's big end battle isn't all it could've been (though, admittedly, the visuals of Jean unleashing her full Phoenix force are pretty spectacular. The music also adds a lot). For a film that tackles something quite important to the characters that populate the X-Men world, and with stakes so high, it's quite the feat to make this film feel so unsatisfying. Yes, there are quite a few 'bad' parts, but there are also some 'good' parts sprinkled throughout. Although this movie's become somewhat of a 'joke' now, I certainly don't regard it as the worst out of the whole franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
214,rparham,"""Stand"" up for this strong sequel",7,28 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand is a fitting conclusion to the X-Men trilogy of films (although it has yet to be seen whether or not it will expand beyond these three pictures). Even with a directorial change, Brett Ratner subbing in for Bryan Singer, who left to direct Superman Returns, X-Men: The Last Stand is, for the most part, on par with the first two X-Men films, which is both a blessing and a curse. While it is technically well-made, entertaining and engaging, once again, there are too many characters, too many plot lines and not enough screen time to make everything satisfying.Picking up some time after X2, The Last Stand finds things looking up for mutants in the USA: a new President (Josef Summer) has appointed Dr. Hank McCoy aka Beast (Kelsey Grammar) as the Secretary of Mutant Relations and is trying to track down rogue mutant Magneto (Ian McKellan). Meanwhile, all is not well back at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters. Cyclops (James Marsters) is unable to cope with the loss of his wife, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) at the end of X2. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) are attempting to train the younger generation of X-Men, but disagreeing over approach. Into this setting comes the revelation that a ""cure"" has been developed that will suppress the mutant gene in current mutants, allowing them to live as standard humans. Magneto and his followers don't agree with this philosophy at all, and are prepared to do whatever it takes to stop the cure from being distributed.Meanwhile, Jean has been discovered alive and Professor X (Patrick Stewart) reveals that her abilities are so powerful and without limits that he had been forced to suppress a split personality in Jean earlier in life that has now remanifested under the name the Phoenix. When the Phoenix takes control of Jean, she decides to join Magneto's cause and the X-Men must find themselves fighting one of their own, along with Magneto's rather extensive army of mutants.X-Men: The Last Stand is more than up to the task of delivering an action-packed, attractive looking movie. Director Ratner keeps the action moving at brisk pace, the film rarely stopping to catch it's breath (although not completely without it's small moments). The action sequences are well-staged and on par with the first two X-Men films. Where The Last Stand fails to improve on it's predecessors is in it's handling of it's characters. There are just too many X-Men on screen to allow the audience to build much of an attachment or understanding of any of them very well. The majority of screen time is divided between Wolverine, Storm and Magneto, and they are served well enough, but most of the other characters, even such integral ones as Cyclops, Professor X, Jean Grey and Rogue are left feeling underused. Several new mutant characters are introduced in this film, but they are mostly pretty window dressing to the film. Almost no one really grabs you in this film, so when the big moments hit, you are left feeling somewhat under-involved.The film also has an extensive amount of plot, and while nothing is really mis-handled, it feels like a bit too much for one film to hold. There are some good ideas on display in The Last Stand, and credit must be given to screenwriters Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg who manage to keep The Last Stand with it's feet firmly planted in a mostly believable world that bears a strong resemblance to our own. Comic book adaptations that work best, such as all the X-Men films, Superman and Batman Begins, aren't afraid to treat their source material with respect and appropriate seriousness, and The Last Stand is no different. Another strength the film displays is it's willingness to take chances with a franchise property that has performed well for it's home studio. Where other sequels are sometimes unwilling to really push the envelope, X-Men: The Last Stand is, and many of the film's stronger moments evolve from this decision.On the eye-candy front, X-Men: The Last Stand doesn't fail to impress. There are several set-pieces on display here, and they are all fairly strong. This isn't quite as attention-grabbing as a Star Wars movie, but when the big moments come, they have their appropriate force. Acting-wise, everybody is up to form, and none of the leads disappoint. Especially strong in this installment are Ian McKellan and Famke Janssen, and Kelsey Grammar is a welcome addition to the cast as Beast. Vinnie Jones is also notable for some nice one liners as villainous mutant Juggernaut, and Hugh Jackman proves once again that he was the perfect choice to play hard-case loner Wolverine.All in all, X-Men: The Last Stand is just as entertaining as X-Men and X2, with no real drop in quality apparent. Whatever weaknesses it possesses are ones that have been ingrained since the first film, so the filmmakers of The Last Stand are merely following suit. As far as summer blockbusters go, X-Men: The Last Stand is a cut above and worth your time, especially if you liked the first two.",X-Men - The Last Stand
215,general-melchett,Better than most action flicks.,9,16 February 2007,"Man, it's amazing how easily Hollywood can burn up $200 million these days! X-Men: TLS has proved to be another one of those films the folks at Hollywood had to invest so much in. But at least, unlike Terminator 3, the results of a $200m budget really show in this. The special effects are amazing - forget mystery or character in any form, this film should only be watched for the climactic final battle which is one of those scenes that shall be hailed as ""classic"" in years to come. Strong acting also helps matters - Ian McKellen has once again proved to be a well-played card in the gambling game that was making this film. And, special effects aside, there really is enough of a plot and mystery to keep an intelligent audience hooked. They had to chuck in a love story for the romance-loving medium, but this does help the film (and trilogy) reach the emotional conclusion it wanted, and really, the film could not have worked without it. The X-Men are well and truly back in the 21st century, and have ended their trilogy on an explosive, epic note. I really must see the two previous X-Men films. X-Men is close to perfect, but it could have been a bit longer. But seeing as it is one of the action films of the decade, it is good that things didn't drag. 9/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
216,ScottDMenzel,"""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is a good ending to the very popular franchise however with a little more time and effort this movie could have been the best out of all three.",7,26 May 2006,"This time around, the X-Men have a big issue their hands because a scientist has recently discovered a cure for mutants that will turn them back into normal human beings. But the situation only gets worse as Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) rises from the dead and comes back as her alter ego the Dark Phoenix. It isn't long before Phoenix becomes a threat not only the X-Men but the world as well. A decent however problematic final installment of the popular franchise ensues ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is really a mixed bag. There were so many things I liked about the film however there was a lot I didn't like about it as well. With that being said I really loved the first hour and feel it was better than the previous films. It was very dramatic and very intense. I enjoyed every moment of the first hour or so but when one of the main characters die, the movie seems to fall apart. At this point, it becomes solely about action and special effects and that's where I lost some interest in the film.The main problem I had with the movie is that nothing is ever really explained or shown. I can't really go into detail about this without giving the movie away but trust me there are a few things in the film that never get addressed including some casualties. The film also really builds up the Dark Phoenix character but again never really explains who she is and why she has this power.Also this movie features a lot of new characters including Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Beast ( Kelsey Grammar), and Angel (Ben Foster) just to name a few but there is zero character development with these new characters. Who are they? Why are they here? We as the audience don't get any answers to these questions. Also where did Night Crawler disappear to? And why was Rogue almost non-existent during the entire film? I also felt that a lot of the new characters weren't very loyal to the comic book. Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) was an absolute joke as a character and his little stupid one-liners didn't help. In fact all the cheesy one-liners were awful. Also whose idea was it to cast Kesley Grammar as the Beast? That was a total miscast because he seemed very out of place in the film. Beast also seemed a lot smarter in the comic. Lastly, the ending was a bit too much as well, the whole idea that yet another sequel could come out of the franchise really made me mad. I really couldn't help but burst out laughing when it ended.But with all negatives aside, the first hour of this film was terrific. I liked the drama that Brett Ratner introduced in the film and I liked how he allowed the film to actually have a story. The problem is that the film was very unbalanced and it seemed to rely on action and special effects more than anything else in the second half. Just a little character development would have made the film a lot better. Also some introductions of the new characters would have been great as well. I honestly don't know who most of the new characters were in the film. It seemed as though these characters didn't have names and weren't important.In the end, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" probably would have better if the original director, Bryan Singer, stayed on board. The fact that this film is suppose to be the final film of the X-Men saga it wasn't a good time for a new director to take over the series. It was a decent ending to the series however as a whole ""the Last Stand"" was my least favorite film of the bunch. It was very dramatic, intense and action packed, I will give it that. However, the problem seemed to me that Brett Ratner tried to do too much with the final film. He introduced too many new characters and the fact that everything seemed to move along so fast really hurt the film. I think a bit more story later on in the film and a little character development and explanation about things would have made this film the best film in the series but since a new director stepped aboard it was only good instead of being great. With that being said I did like this film however I was kind of disappointed with it in the end. It's a good ending to a popular franchise that with just a little more time and effort could have been great.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is a 7/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
217,Ziya90,"The best one in terms of catching the tone of the comics, unreasonable hate!",8,7 February 2010,"X-Men Last Stand has too much CGI may be and it is not as powerful and brilliant as the first two, but that doesn't mean that Brett Ratner did a bad job! The Last Stand is probably one of the most enjoyable movies ever made. Honestly, the opening scene was a bit disappointing, I worried a bit (if the rest of the movie is like that) because they had tried to get Magneto and Professor X look younger by CGI. However, the movie has a second opening scene which rocks! Then, the movie has a little surprise for you, we see it for the first time, in any X-Men movie. Yes, there are some weak points in The Last Stand, but it does not deserve such a hate and low rating. The second movie was deeper, so more powerful, this third chapter is rather entertainment, pure entertainment, but I cannot see any further flaw. Instead, for example, the tone of the movie is very close to the tone of the comics and the animation which is a success. For example, while watching the scene which Cyclops goes to find Jean, it feels like I was watching the animation. Beast was a disappointment, he is too calm, too small and too thin in comparison with the original character, so he does not seem a threat to anyone. Moreover, it would have been better, if they had not gotten him wear suit. He is a doctor, not a politician. Some moments are showy that I don't like. For example, the introduction of the abilities of the new characters. However, as said, there is not any further problem in the movie. There are a lot of scenes that I watched tons of times and still do! The scene which Mystique appears first, a brilliant scene, stylish, like the first movie. The convoy scene was great, we see Magneto's power by an amazing scene. The second visit to Jean was great too. Very enjoyable and a scene that recalls the animation. And it ends by a petrifying event. By the way, there is a brilliant shot while Wolverine Juggernaut fight, I just love that. The forest scenes are also entertaining and stylish. As for the bridge scene, again amazing, but Ratner falls into the trap, he shows cliché moments like the tourist who takes photos. And CGI in all those scenes are not cheesy at all. I have mentioned a lot of entertaining and amazing scenes with good CGI, but still it has not finished yet. It is weird that most audiences don't like super hero movies with a lot of action and fun. It seems like that. Because, why people love Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk but hate The Last Stand? Iron Man was entertaining, but there was much humor than action. The very long last part of X-Men 3 is amazing! This is a non stop action, fantasy movie also. In the last part, The only minor problem was that many mutants could fly which is exaggerating. I don't like Vinnie Jones, he is not appropriate for the character and the character was very different than this one (like The Beast), but the Juggernaut scene, the camera shots were amazing too. There is another surprise related to Iceman by the way, I like this character very much, even if he is a teen in contrast with the original character and the screen time of him is unsatisfying in X-Men movies. And the final parts makes you say that's it! Brett Ratner's best work!",X-Men - The Last Stand
218,kooleshwar,Another entertaining sequel with lots of dazzle but no substance.,5,16 June 2006,"One more sequel, one more trip to the theater knowing it wont even be as good as the last one, more lowering of expectations (this is no 3 remember),more writing about ordinary sequels (despite the lowered expectations), more hoping that this is not the end of the original action movie.This is the emergence of a disturbing trend in Hollywood movies, make sequel (or prequel) to a well established franchisee (comic or movie), pump it up with mind boggling special effects, satisfy a number of people from a wide range of audiences (harcore fans, special effect buffs, feminists, women, teens etc etc)and you have another movie that may not shatter any records or tempt critics but will guarantee that the studio coffers are filled.Also alarming is that there are hardly any new action movies coming out that are not based on comics, video games or even rides. One one side you feel that its great that a vast pool of potential is now being put to use, but on the other side its alarming that there is nobody that is able to deliver a completely new action movie to Hollywood.This movie follows the formula to the fullest.They have succeeded in getting most of the cast (ones that were most popular at least) from the earlier two movies and as expected they have delivered as much as possible on the acting front. In fact all the cast including the side cast has been good and that has helped this mediocre movie to come across as convincing.However it is clear that almost everyone has wanted a bigger more central role in this film and that means that we have an entire story revolving around a few X-men (way to much of Famke and Halle). Luckily this also means more of Sir Ian who is the only one who has played his role with the same panache as he played it in the original.There are hardly any new interesting mutants or characters added to this film and I'm sure that most hardcore fans will be disappointed with this film. The two characters with most potential were The Juggernaut and The beast who were I'm sure sacrificed to the contracts of the bigger stars.Way to much focus is put on Famke Jensons character which is completely bores you by the end of the film.This movie however raises more questions than it answers and has at least a dozen plot holes and I've not even read the comics.The most promising part of the film was the cure for mutancy but that was wasted and most of the focus was shifted to famkes character (who predictably can destroy the world hell we even have the hyper clichéd ""WHAT HAVE I DONE"" god please spare me!!!!!).Again we have a movie that in the ending is about love, why the hell cant we have simpler motives that have spurned the greatest action movies such as survival, duty maybe even sacrifice.This film does have its memorable moments such as the moving of the bridge and my favourite scene with Juggernaut and Kitty. Also it is peppered with great one liners and a couple of good action sequences.Also the short length ensures that before you are about the start cribbing the movie is over.In all a so ordinary sequel that can be watched with highly lowered expectations, which is peppered with flashes of brilliance, mind boggling special effects and great one liners.+s great special effects, a couple of memorable scenes, great one liners, short length, good acting especially from Sir Ian.-s dozen plot holes, tooooooo much focus on some characters, not enough side plots or stories, boring, clichéd and humdrum ending, doesn't even meet lowered expectations.total 5/10 (in absolute terms more of 4)",X-Men - The Last Stand
219,gritfrombray-1,Singer should have directed this.....,9,1 March 2007,"Frowned when I saw Brian Singer wasn't directing this. The movie just did not hold my attention like the first two excellent installments. The Mutants introduced into this were horribly underused. Nightcrawler mysteriously disappeared and was not even mentioned!? Ian and Patrick did not have enough scenes in this either. The whole Mutant cure story was rubbish. Relying on a special effects show is a poor way to try to save a movie. What happens to Professor X is ridiculous. Jean Grey's story was a bit boring. After seeing Halle Berry in this, I realise Storm was a horribly underused character in the first two films. It will be interesting to see if they decide to release an Xmen 4... I'd still love it! But a little more organisation and better thought out story would be an idea. I really think fans should have input into these movies. There is always going to be a big following when it comes to Marvel.",X-Men - The Last Stand
220,stuka24,This film is so bad it sucks.,1,6 June 2006,"Worse than its predecessors, it achieves quick oblivion. Incapable of transmitting any feelings, it's basically a catalog of clichés, with the drama of a high school play.Basically, it's yet another instance of the extremely old US philosophy of ""nobody's above the law"". One character, invariably evil, selfish and a bit seductive, thinks he's better than the rest of humanity. He/ she embodies ""Struggle for the fittest"". In less than two hours, he's dead or in jail and unrepentant. The ""tolerant"" selfless view prevails, and you go home to your Darwinian job and life, even thinking you've learnt something useful.Like ""Charlie's angels 3"", there are separate duels to make things last even longer (Iceman and Pyro, Storm and ""Callisto"" the Latin woman who moves fast). It has the aesthetics of a 50's corny film, like those of Liz Taylor in Rome or the like :). The ""political message"" is so diluted and SO politically correct that it has less power of rebellion than a Che Guevara T-shirt. Scenes that should provoke some emotion end up being laughable, like the ""Angel"" flying away from the skyscraper and his manipulative father. Let alone their timely ""reconciliation"" Others, that should be beautiful, like Phoenix's love scene with Pyro, leave us as cold as the icy weather Storm creates. This film is not alone in its mediocrity: it's a proved product, so I guess studios will hammer on with this ""genre"" of films acted by computers and with enough ""romance"" and ""emotion"" to make any intelligent teen throw up. There are a couple of new characters, and also a few sudden deaths, but even those elicit less empathy than a diapers commercial. The ""rebellion"" as well as the ""mutants who want to be cured"" look like people on welfare more than a mighty army ready to ""take the world"". Famke is nice, and red hair suits her. And the way she walks! Pity she's given no decent lines nor character development. Rebecca Romijn is a classic beauty, so much it can withstand all this blue :)!Like most US blockbusters, packs a few jokes, two of them being actually good (the rest are sad). As any good franchise, the ""open endings"" leave room for about a dozen more episodes and related products. Stay until the credits are gone if you want to use your brain a bit (it'll be bored by 1 hour + of inactivity :) ). This is a film for dumb teenagers, so it's tirelessly marketed for them. The fact that this film grossed more than 200 million makes me have doubts about the humanity's future. And it having been shown at CannesI suppose any French critic armed with psychoanalysis can tear it apart in less time than you can eat one popcorn. I agree with ""M. Miller"" from Amazon that it's intriguing that Jean/Phoenix basically doesn't speak, given her central role. And with Andrew ""Radaar"": there are just way too many characters. Using his words, but with my own ideas: This film is a franchise in instalments.The best review I read is, by far, ""stu157 from United Kingdom"" in IMDb. Selections: ""The previous films had intelligence and emotion, compared to explosions and annoyances.""""The final battle is also inexplicable, with both sides not really sure what they should be doing"". ""what is (the problem)? The script. It's as if the writers truly want this to be the last film, killing off characters early to make way for new ones"".",X-Men - The Last Stand

This is a great conclusion to the trilogy. It has new mutants and the old ones. amazing special effects. But there is one little problem, its to short. It should have been at least 2 and a half hours long. This time around it is more emotion and more action. Also the addition of Kitty(the mutant who can go through walls), Juggernaut and angel make the movie feel fresh.Everyone who likes a good comic book movie or has seen x-men and X2 must see this now.6/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
222,kyrat,"interesting idea, hampered by poor dialogue",7,3 June 2006,"I know there's 1200+ other comments probably saying the same thing. Some of the in a much more coherent intelligent way...but still wanted to add my 2 cents.... I haven't read the comics so I can't comment on the deviations from those.However, just from the experience of watching the other two films, I was disappointed.The dialogue was painfully cliché and cheesy. (Does every tense standoff with a female mutant have to end with the sneer ""bitch""? Does every momentous death of a loved one have to end with sinking to your knees and screaming ""NOOOOOOOO"" into the heavens?) How trite is the ""no fury like a woman scorned"" line? (or even including that scene brining Mystique down to nothing but petty revenge).So many new mutants barely referred to - would have been nice to see some of them fleshed out since this is supposed to be an ensemble cast (esp. as you keep killing off the main ones). All the ""bad"" mutants had to be all gothed out with dark hair, tattoos and black clothes as de rigeur for membership? (Why didn't they just dress the ""good"" mutants in white for a complete lack of subtlety?)Small details/consistency issues seem to have been overlooked as they did there ""oh look what we can do with Special FX. For one example: While uprooting the GG Bridge was kind of cool, how did it suddenly turn into night? And if all the people fled their cars (exc. the family stuck in their gasguzzling SUV) why were all the cars headlights on at the end?Some of the fights were interesting (Fire v. Ice) but as others have said the different mutant powers could have been used in an interesting way for a more interesting fight (at least while dodging the un-mutating bullet). I still think it was worth watching. There were some good moments:The deaths of major characters was sad, but it was also nice to see a film not afraid to kill major characters.... and it IS the last film. And to think about Magneto having to struggle through life as a non-mutant is interesting.As always Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan were superb and I would watch any film just for them. Hugh Jackman was good, but I didn't feel his character was as central or was expanded on in any way like the first two films.The general idea of the ""cure"" which some mutants might actually want, but more would find offensive since it implies there is something wrong with them was interesting. And it was obvioius that this was (as many scientific advances) going to be turned into a weapon by the government.Since the mutant issue has often stood in as a metaphor for gayness (or other things that are considered ""deviant"" by some in our society) - it is hard to support the idea of the ""cure"" because we are supposed to agree that it is not a sickness that needs a cure. On the other hand I think they did a good job of showing why some, like Rogue would want to give up such amazing powers (you could empathize what it would be like to never touch a loved one).So worth watching, but kind of a sad conclusion to a good series.",X-Men - The Last Stand
223,freaky_dave,"Almost as enjoyable as the second film, though there is no time for character development.",7,26 May 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed X-Men the Last Stand. It was a fun film that moved at a break neck pace, and even though it was rather short for a comic book movie, it was never boring.A millionaire has discovered a cure for the mutant gene. We have Charles Xavier's group on one side and Magneto's group on the other. Magneto wants to destroy the mutant cure, and Xavier is trying to come to an agreeable conclusion that would help mutants and humans alike. On top of this all we have the return of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) as her alter ego The Phoenix, and she's not so nice this time around. In fact she's damn powerful and scary as well, and has an even bigger role to play then she had in the second film.Most of the same characters return from X2 with the addition of many others on both sides for mutants, including Ben Foster as the Angel, Kelsey Grammar as The Beast, Vinnie Jones as the Juggernaut, and Dania Ramirez as Calysto. Mystique returns as well, but she doesn't have the same screen time as she did in the first two films. That's a shame because I enjoyed her character, but what time she does get was still fun.We also have some more surprises in this latest installment as some mutants die that you would never suspect, but I'm not about to give that information away and spoil the film. Lets just say you'll have to see the film and accept what happens. Some people might not like it too much, but I was genuinely surprised with some of the ones that were killed.Brett Ratner has development a fast paced action film that moves much like a comic book would. There isn't much character development, but the movie is really too short to go into details about each mutant. Lets just say that X-Men 3 The Last Stand is a compelling adventure that never becomes boring for even a second. I liked it almost as much as the second film but not quite. It's still better than the first film which was another film that had it moments, but just not enough of them.",X-Men - The Last Stand
224,MickeyTheConstant,Not as bad as people say,7,24 October 2020,This movie is not as bad as people make out. Yes compared to some of the others it isn't as good but it is entertaining and watchable. The cast give their all. The set pieces are fine. Kelsey Grammar as the Beast is great. My main issues are Vinnie Jones as the Juggernaut. Terrible acting and miscast. I also think that the Phoenix story is quite weakly portrayed. I also think that Xavier comes across as rude at times abd there are a few deaths that just really are unexplained and I can only assume are for shock factor. I think Magneto is really confused in this and many aspects go against his character. Even when doing bad things in previous movies he has a reason and remains kind of likeable. The worst moment in this is his attitude towards mystique (won't give away what happens). He just would not act like that. Later on in the movie she helps him again which is unthinkable after how he treated her. Just a few gripes but still a fun movie.,X-Men - The Last Stand
225,Gunn,A Good Ending for the Trilogy with some faults!,9,6 May 2009,"I have to preface this with a reminder that I knew nothing of the X-Men prior to the Trilogy. I liked the movie but with some reservations. I agree with those who maintained that character development of the new X-Men was insufficiently lacking. As for some other supposed glitches mentioned, I found nothing seriously affecting the film. I agree that the film moved too fast and that a few more scenes would have filled some holes rather than drag it down. Still, I enjoyed the film and felt a little sad that this was the end. The deaths of key characters was disturbing but likely necessary. New characters including: Beast (Kelsey Grammar), Angel (Ben Foster), Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Multiple Man (Eric Dane), Leech (Cameron Bright), Phat and Little Phat, Flea, Arclight, Lizard Man, Psylocke, Kid Omega and of course the disturbing Phoenix (Famke Jansen) are just lightly touched upon with little to no back-story. I would not have minded an extra 90 minutes added to fill in the blanks. Hopefully there will be more X-Men films, either prequels, sequels or sidebar stories as in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"".",X-Men - The Last Stand
226,nethy-nho,Not epic enough end,7,8 June 2019,"The new plot about the cure is very interesting, and give a lot of discussions about if this is right or wrong. But I think that the problem is the Dark Phoenix, is not so interesting your evolution, is not explicated so clearly your origins, some characters are forgotten, but have a huge action scene in the end.",X-Men - The Last Stand
227,carologletree,A Hugely Disappointing Third Installment that Made Many Huge Mistakes,5,22 July 2017,"Like the ""Karate Kid"" and ""Back To The Future"" franchises, the ""X-Men"" series was a series that really dropped the ball with its third installment. This film has many problems, not the least of which is it's treatment of the characters and the source material.One problem is that the film strays from the somewhat political themes of the first two movies and is more like your typical shoot-'em-up summer blockbuster. Replacing Bryan Singer with Brett Ratner didn't prove to be a good idea.While Professor Charles Xavier's death was admittedly treated like a big deal, the other two deaths were not very well executed. Cyclops' death happened off-screen after the character had barely even been in the movie at all and Jean Grey's death felt very anti-climactic.The movie feels very scatterbrained. There are FAR too many story lines and new characters introduced in this movie, none of which were explored very well. It failed to make everything cohesive. The overall plot felt rather rushed and, in addition, butchered one of the most beloved story lines from the comics.The film does have redeeming qualities that make it watchable. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen all hand in really good performances as usual. For the time that he got, Kelsey Grammar was great as The Beast.Some of the action scenes are fun to watch, and the special effects are as good as ever.It's a shame that Bryan Singer decided to direct ""Superman Returns,"" because Brett Ratner took the ""X-Men"" series in the wrong direction with this mediocre, overstuffed, and immensely disappointing movie.RATING: C",X-Men - The Last Stand
228,CrassActionHero,One of The Most Disorganized Movies I Have Ever Seen,1,9 December 2006,"X-Men:The Last Stand(2006) ********BIGTIME SPOILERS AHEAD********Review: The Last Stand. Perhaps it is indeed. I was not thrilled that this could be the final installment. I did not pay attention to anything about this movie till release. I was expecting a fitting ending to the awesome franchise. This is not what I expected at all. Let me tell you in this review why The Last Stand is a major letdown.The movie starts with the X-Men in the danger room training. Cool visuals are here and we see the first peek at a sentinel. Cool. However, after that good opening, things get a little sour. Cyclops is a mess after Jean's ""death"". Then somehow Jean returns. The Phoenix. The Phoenix is very disappointing. I was expecting fire. I was expecting a new look. I was expecting the Phoenix to do something too! Towards the end of this, Jean just stands in one place for what seems like DAYS before she annihilates Alcatraz.More drawbacks, The Last Stand avoids character development like the plague. One sequence, Magneto and the only two remaining followers left, break out a few new mutants. We meet Juggernaut and Multiple Man. This comes off as disappointing as Naut and Multiple join Magneto without question. Will you join us? Okay. That's it?! Lame.The whereabouts of Nightcrawler are unknown. After a spectacular debut in X2, he is gone. No explanation to what happened. Just gone. How disappointing.Cyclops is in about ten minutes of this movie. Does anybody pay attention to the comics? Cyclops is the appointed leader of the X-Men. Why is he being so ignored? Cyclops is an underrated favorite and worse yet, gets killed off without a trace. If you blink, you will miss the scene. It's that bad. Cyclops gets no hero's death, he gets disposed of like yesterday's trash. Blasphemy! The debut of Angel was lame. He decides to keep his powers and that's that. Nothing else. The plot is the only thing here that is good. The way the humans developed the ""cure"" is original. We also meet Beast. Unfortunately, like I wrote earlier, this movie avoids character development. Beast is already a member of the X-Men just like that. We did not even see him in X2 and he's a X-Man? We see some mutants lose their powers too. I won't tell you who, but the one that do made me violently angry. This movie suffers from being rushed. Imagine a marathon runner running as fast as he can, he that trips and lands on the ground, gets up and continues running only to stumble again and lands on his face and breaks his nose and gets back up and continues running to only fall once more and suffers a broken jaw. That's what this movie is like. This movie is WAY to rushed and gets worse and more painful the faster it gets.The Last Stand has too many characters, too little running time, too rushed, chaotic, and turns into an absolute mess. After a good first movie and a excellent sequel, we get what could indeed be the last stand. Just why did this have to be dreadful? A good conclusion would have been nice. Then again, this could not be the last. If another X-Men movie comes around, I'll be surprised if it's any good after this.The Last Word: You think the Titanic was a disaster? This is much worse.",X-Men - The Last Stand
229,The_Orenda,Very much beside myself as an X-Man fan.,8,16 June 2006,"I love the X-Men, I grew up with them and have suffered through most of their story lines throughout the unforgiving nineties. So imagine my surprise at the unfolding storyline that is The Last Stand. If you were a fan of the X-Men, or loved the previous X-movies, you must watch this. I am no longer surprised at the hows or whys this movie made over $120 million in its opening weekend. The writers understood that there are far too many mutants and side-stories to count and keep track of. They cut to the bare-bones stuff and pulled no punches in the storyline. If you love the X-Men, this is must-watch stuff.Seeing his son suffer through his mutation, Warren II goes on a quest to find a cure for mutants. After several years, he succeeds but everyone is not so cheerful at this change. Meanwhile, Cyclops, while wallowing at the loss of his love from the last film, uncovers a secret so terrifying, everyone can feel it.All I can truly say about all the actors and actresses is that they did best they could in a film where there is so much to look at and marvel. I believed Ratner did the series justice and they inevitably had to follow the script the way they did. Kelsey Grammar did as good a job as the character of the Beast let him be. Even got his ""Stars and Garters"" in. Fastball special? It's in here. As are Sentinels, Wolverine's quips, a male Marrow and the Juggernaut! X-Men III is an excellent piece of work, if not a little melodramatic. But oh well, I'm still floored by the power of the Dark Phoenix! Even Carrie would run the other way!",X-Men - The Last Stand
230,gcsman,Third time's not the charm,6,15 April 2018,"First let's get some good things said about this movie -- because there are a few. Best for my money is that we get a first good look at Shadowcat (Kitty Pryde, played by Ellen Page) and her abilities, after just cameo appearances in the first two X-Men films.. She's a delight. Her extended scene at Worthington Labs running right through walls (""phasing"" as it's called in the actual comics) while being chased by the thuggish Juggernaut, who smashes through them, is a highlight of the film, including the way she cleverly turns the tables on him. Another very nice scene is Storm's (Halle Berry) eulogy for Professor X (Patrick Stewart) on the sunlit schoolgrounds while surrounded by all the mutant pupils. It's nicely scripted, and it works. It was also rather fun to have Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar) around in one of the bigger roles, and he gives it some real stature.Going beyond that, it's hard to know where to start. Bryan Singer, the canny director for the first two X-films, had the right touch for this unique franchise in the superhero genre, but the shift to Brett Ratner turned out to be a big step down. (1) Far and away the worst is what was done to Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). As we all expected after the end of the superb X2, she is resurrected as the ultra-powerful Phoenix -- but when using her power, instead of being surrounded by the beautiful ""bird of fire"" CGI effect that we got a nice glimpse of in X2, here Jean turns into something like a sunburned witch -- no firebird at all. WTF?? Whose idea was that?? and for someone who was supposedly going to be the centerpiece of the plot, she spends a lot of time offscreen, as if the (male) writers and director just couldn't think of much to do with her. Instead, lots of screen time spent is spent with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who became the face of the franchise after his breakout success in the first X-Men. Not necessarily a bad thing, but mostly he's just going through the motions.(2) Trite, boring dialog. Magneto (Ian McKellen), who had quite a presence in X1 and X2 and conveyed a real sense of menace, is reduced to stock villainous rants that he was probably embarrassed to deliver. This sort of lazy scripting affects almost everyone's parts but it reaches bottom with him. What's almost as bad is that two of the mainstay characters, Storm and Xavier, seemingly out of nowhere are harder-edged, almost antiheros in what they do. That may be fine for Wolverine but not for them. There are plenty of villains here to go around without conscripting characters who ought to be heros.(3) And the ambience -- what had a clear, upbeat, attractive feel in the first two films is here turned into flat, ugly settings and tone. Most of the time it's just not very fun to look at. What a waste.(4) Plot and character are sacrificed for rather mindless smash-'em-up action. There's too much of it, it's not well thought out, and it's a mark of lazy moviemaking.Lastly, though this is just a minor annoyance compared with the major issues in this movie, for the third time in a row we see the Professor shuffled off to the sidelines for most of the movie. In X-Men, he's sent into a coma when Cerebro is sabotaged. In X2, he's mind-controlled into a fantasy world by Stryker's mutant son. And here in X3, he's seemingly killed off by Jean herself before any of the main action gets going. Again, this is lazy scripting -- there's so much more the Professor could do in a more thoughtfully worked out story.On the IMdB user ratings I see that women rate this one higher than men (7.1 vs 6.7), and in all age groups. There are plenty of votes so I think it's statistically significant. I'm not sure why -- for X1 and X2 the male/female ratings were quite similar.The rather poor effort of X3 coming after the successes of its two predecessors, sadly brought the X-Men franchise to a temporary halt till it was rebooted several years later with a new historical/origins approach in X-Men First Class (2011). That one had its issues too, but it got the franchise back on track. Now they're ready to try the Phoenix storyline again with Dark Phoenix in 2019. Fingers crossed. I see at least that they'll use the 'firebird' effect that we already saw from the young Jean at the climax of X-Men Apocalypse (2016).",X-Men - The Last Stand
231,arthera09,better than i expected on repeated viewing,7,13 January 2008,"The first time I saw this I was not thrilled with it and may have only given it a 6 maybe even a 5. But on a second viewing I really enjoyed it. The special effects were awesome. The acting was what we should expect from a comic book movie. The cast was for the most part perfect and no complaints there. The problems I had mostly to do with the writing. The introduction of the new members of the brotherhood was really dumb and then they become instant go to guys. The other thing is that a lot of the villains were not fleshed out. I would have loved to seen just little scenes where some of the lesser known mutants got to at least fight a little bit. Or at least make some of the villains have some sort of power instead of just getting their butts kicked at the end. The adding of the power of being able to sense a mutants powers was stupid and did not help at all. The movie was still really enjoyable to watch. Ellen Page being in it did not hurt at all either. I did like how the writers did not feel bad about killing off any of the main characters. The last scene was cool and I hope they leave it at that. I do wish they did more with Colassas. There were plenty of things that I would have done differently just from my stand point, but overall I was pleased. It was fun and it did feel as if there was some sort of ending even it was open ended. I want to see an iceman spin off just because he had some much potential in the comic.",X-Men - The Last Stand
232,BreanneB,"Ben Foster, made this movie excellent and the best of all three!",10,5 August 2006,"10 out of 10 stars. This movie is made the best X-Men movie by Ben Foster as the new mutant Angel, a.k.a. Warren Worthington III. The acting was great, especially Ben's. The costumes were awesome, especially Ben's wings. I thought it was amazing that they could make them so big and make everything look so realistic.The mutants are in great danger in this one when Worthington Labs comes up with a cure to make mutants regular humans. In order for them to stay as they are they must escape and destroy this lab before it's too late. However, unfortunately several tragic events leading up to it occur.I also thought the following things were great: production, directing, script, music, plot, etc.",X-Men - The Last Stand
233,Tehmeh,My second take on X3.,6,30 May 2006,"I saw it at a theater when it was released. I remember making up excuses for it, anything to make it more appealing. After all, X2 was my favorite superhero film (and still is) at the time and I really wanted X3 to be great for me. I did review it earlier, but only now can I see the whole picture after all these years (and repeat viewings. yes, I own the film).It never bothered me that characters don't appear or act exactly like in the comics. The most important thing was the ""feel"". You know, like ""go cyclops!"", anything that made me root for those guys and make them seem as they were real. That said, I enjoyed both X-men and X2. After X2, I was so hooked I was waiting for this one so much that I think I haven't waited for any other movie.It was...It was alright. I did notice all the things people are complaining about. A lot of wasted potential, some bad dialogue (yet some good too), the film was too short and felt a bit rushed, a few irritating scenes...but it was OK as a popcorn flick. For me, that's bad. I don't want my X-men movies to be rushed popcorn flicks that render themselves useless, cheap and even damaging to the franchise itself over time.The movie tries to be emotional, and at times succeeds. Yes, I felt something for Cyclops and Professor X. On the other hand, Cyclops was treated like a nobody in this movie and his fate didn't actually have any impact on anything. Same with Professor X. And when you try to force the emotional impact with Wolverine crying, I might have a problem. Certainly a fanboy problem only, but still a problem. Many characters and things are just put there (Juggernaut, Multiple Man, Callisto) without establishing anything that well, forced and crammed, treated cheaply, and this is what you get. An OK popcorn flick.I wanted to see how Phoenix would be handled. It was my favorite storyline when I grew up with the comics. It was very disappointing. I don't have a problem with the ""origins"" of Phoenix in this story. It's just like many things: she's just put there, waiting for her big scene and that's it. Janssen isn't a bad actor and certainly portrays a confused all-powerful woman well, but oh my, such a waste. A huge waste.How about the action? Eye candy, mostly well done. FX are very good, and although the action scenes lack certain character (for example: compare Wolverine's bland claw fighting to anything in X2) they are well made. The humor is there and one-liners too, although sometimes the movie is tacky and tries too hard. There are ways to dispense some comic relief in an otherwise dark-mooded film, but again - it isn't as funny when it really tries to be nor as dark as it pretends to be.The movie is too short, things are rushed (though the pacing manages to work adequately) and it has an effect on many things. The characters aren't allowed to react or breathe, same with the story. It just rolls along and stuff happens, and you feel the waste of potential drama and certain depth. Even if the stuff that happens isn't boring - I'll give it that - that's pretty much all this movie really succeeds at. It's not boring. That's it. All the other aspects and possibilities are a bit wasted.It may sound like I really hate this movie. I don't. As I said, It's OK. Which is very disappointing for me. Time for me to list some good stuff. McKellen and Stewart are joy to watch as always. I liked Angel's very small role and the certain symbolism in it. I liked that the movie tried to be dramatic. I certainly loved ""Frasier"" (as this stupid form won't let me spell his last name correctly for whatever reason) as Beast and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. There are good things in this movie, even though most of them are casting choices and just some particular scenes. So I give it a 6. My nerdrage would demand a 3 or 4, but I'm trying to be sensible. Sadly, X3 is the movie that had the most at stake, basically finishing a trilogy. It is the movie that wasted the potential of Phoenix and killed off beloved characters. I'm certainly not saying that killing characters is bad and shouldn't happen, but in a disappointing movie like this, much of the impact is wasted. Even now, when ""Days of future Past"" is around the corner, Bryan Singer is ""fixing"" some things X3 gave us with the help of a story that includes time travel. X3 suffers from its disappointing aftermath just as much as it suffers from its flaws. It's seen as something that has to be fixed, forgotten or ignored. This is of course a problem for the fans and those creating sequels/prequels and not a problem in the movie itself, but you get the point.Singer, thanks for the first films and for building up this one, love the great work. Ratner, you didn't totally suck, but don't ever do this again, no matter what the franchise. Stop it. Don't do it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
234,dhaufrect,X-Men: The Last Stand stands alone.,7,25 June 2006,"""X-Men: The Last Stand"" stands alone in film computer animated technology. Few films feature the technology above substance, however,this movie does so quite successfully. Ian McKelen gives a convincing performance as Magneto, a changeable evil doer. Hugh Jackson plays Logan, Magneto's arch enemy and savior of the ""force"" in Star Wars terms. Halle Berry is Ororo Munro or storm who is the Marvel character with intense eyes and magnificent beauty. She gives another adequate performance in this, one of her lessor films. Josef Sommer plays the United States President as he has in prior works. He adds another consistent role to his successful list. Patrick Stewart plays Professor Charles Xavier in a very intense way that literally burns his character into the cinema. He too is convincing. Aaron Stanford is John Allerdyce or Pyro. His youth and energy are dynamic. Shawn Ashmore is Bobby Drake or Iceman with equal dynamism. However, the true star and the only one worth mentioning in this movie is the technical support provided by the computer animation which allows us to appreciate the story in a way that we could not only a very few years ago.",X-Men - The Last Stand
235,joestank15,Great comic book movie minus Berry.,7,26 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand - The third and (possibly) final part to the X-Men series. A mutant ""cure"" is found, and then everything goes to hell. Magneto (the always wonderful Ian McKellen) gathers an army to destroy the source: a mutant boy named Leech. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his band of peaceful mutants hope to stop Magneto and blah blah blah. You get the picture. The story's much cooler in execution than on paper.Okay. The great things. Characters lose their powers. Characters die. And goodness knows there are a lot of them. Storm, Beast ,Wolverine (me fav), Collosus, Shadowcat, Iceman, Magneto, Pyro, Cyclops, Juggernaut (who almost steals the show with his one-liners) and best of all: Jean Gray (Famke Jannsen). I haven't even read half the list off, but you get the picture. Needless to say, with so many protagonists, some people's screen time is shunted over, but I don't really give a crap. If you've ever read the original comics, the fightscene pages were twice as spastic and crammed as this movie was.Kelsey Grammar and Hugh Jackman are wonderful as Beast and Wolverine. No wonder the latter's getting his own spin-off (I personally hope he's going to fight the Hulk). She's changed actresses three times over but ShadowCat (Ellen Page) finally gets to kick some ass. Jannsen is F***ing SCARY as Jean Gray/ Phoenix. This plot line in particular is well done.There's no cheesy ""coming out"" sequence like in #2. The action sequences were a blast.People were so afraid that Brett Ratner was going to screw up the movie. In my opinion he did better than Bryan Singer. There weren't so many stupid moments that caused me to shake my head. This was hard-hitting. Wolverine got to kill people. Favorite characters got to die. This was serious, and it really uped the ante knowing that no one was safe from termination. Well, everyone but Hugh Jackman, cause he rocks so damn much.Halle Berry can kick the bucket for all I care. She can use lightning but she's just not cut out for comic book movies. And can she STICK with an accent/hairstyle/place in the story? Jean Grey may change into Phoenix but Berry is the real re-inventor around here. I mean, now she can FLY and spin faster than a twister on crack? C'mon. Lets have some continuity here.A great comic book movie except for Halle Berry, X-Men:: The Last Stand gets an A- Now lets move onto that Wolverine movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
236,atzimo,Best of the three,10,28 May 2006,"After the very good first movie and the completely forgettable sequel I wasn't expecting much from X-Men: The Last Stand. In fact I was just hoping to see some good action and visual effects. After the first few minutes I realised I was in for a surprise.The story is very dark, sometimes quite close to a horror movie. What's cool about this movie is that it has a feel of a Twilight Zone episode. There is closure, maybe not what fans wanted, but it signifies the end of the series.The visual effects are incredible, very organic looking. In fact you don't notice them, they're that good. I think they are the best visual effects to date. This may sound pompous but it is true. When I saw King Kong I could tell I was was watching animated graphics. In X-Men 3 the visual effects are integrated flawlessly into the real elements. Perfection.Do not miss out on this movie. It is an exiting adventure, the best Marvel movie to date.",X-Men - The Last Stand
237,saarvardi,"Too much talk, not enough action...",7,20 May 2006,"I had the delight of watching X-Men 3: The Last Stand during a special press screening that was held in Tel-Aviv, Israel, 12 days before the US premiere. Although much cannot be said about the film without giving away any potential spoilers (and there are many of those to be spread around), there are certain things that could be said that will help clarify the fog revolving the film's premise.The most important thing that could be said is that this is indeed the last X-Men film that will be released in theaters. The film ties up the various plot strings that were thrown at audiences during the first two films, and closes up the personal arcs for most main characters. It picks up more or less where the last film left us; As we have seen at the end of X2, the evil Mystique has infiltrated the US government, human vs. mutant conflict ensues, whilst meanwhile back at the X-Men headquarters, we find Wolverine and Cyclops still pretty much shaken up by the loss of Jean Grey. Darkness continues to grow as we find out at the beginning of the film that Jean Grey is very much alive, but the ultimate sacrifice she had made at the end of part 2 in order to save her fellow mutants has turned her into a very different and dark character. Meanwhile, the Magneto-Xavier dispute about how the mutants should live their lives amongst mundanes receives a surprise twist, when we are informed that the humans have developed the ultimate anti-mutant weapon: a vaccine with the ability to ""cure"" mutant powers. The now ex-prisoner Magneto, threatened by the thought of mutants being wiped off the face of the planet with the help of the vaccine, gathers an army of mutants to fight off the human's new threat. Our favorite heroines, led by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry, who gets substantial screen time this time around), must make the last stand amidst the chaos, and find the way to struggle for a peaceful solution, even when everything around them seems to be falling apart.More than anything, X-3 is a fascinating character study, although many characters we met during the first two films are absent, or suffer from very little development. Instead of minimalist performances by Anna Paquin's Rogue or James Marsden's Cyclops, we are now introduced to new on screen characters such as Dr. Hank McCoy (a.k.a. Beast), played by the always wonderful Kelsey Grammar (from television's Fraizer), or the walk-through-walls Kitty Pryde (a.k.a. Shadowcat). Unfortunately, many of these personal arcs take their time to unfold and slow the story. The whole film feels like a major build-up, leaving long minutes of dialog and story which postpone the action. When this does come, it explodes on screen with all it's glory, although I did miss the ""Wow!"" factor I got from watching the f/x on previous X-Men films. Despite the feeling of finality to the series, I wasn't completely swept away, mostly because the film took so much time reaching it's climax, that by the time it got there I was feeling a definite fatigue. Had the action sequences been more spread out during the film, and the plot more fast-paced, this could have been a satisfying and inspiring summer 2006 outing. Instead, we are met with a decent comic book film that has its moments, but lacked the depths and emotions director Brian Singer could have brought with him to the set.",X-Men - The Last Stand
238,Barky44,"Not too bad, but not quite right, either",7,14 June 2006,"I went in to this movie with incredibly low expectations. www.aintitcoolnews.com was merciless with bad spin and reviews for this film, and I tend to believe them.Fortunately, it wasn't as horrible as they were saying. I found it entertaining. The storyline was interesting, the characters were kept interesting (albeit some had unfortunate early exits). The effects and stunts were fun.The big problem with this film was the polishing. Basically, it wasn't polished at all. And there's nothing like a good polish to make the silver shine. A few of the elements that could have used some fine tuning:-- The look of The Beast. A bit too silly for my taste. -- The character of The Phoenix. She had her menacing moments, but mostly she just ""hung out"" and waiting for things to happen. It was like the writers couldn't figure out what to do with her. -- The stunts, especially Storm's flying. Clearly this was wire work, and clearly could have used some polish. Storm flies, she doesn't just hover or bounce around. -- Too many characters spoils the broth. There's simply too many mutants in this film, it's like a cook throwing in the entire spice rack because he doesn't really know how to cook.None of these things are fatal to the film, they are just things that kept it from being a great movie.It's a shame, really. The first two X-Men films were really top-notch, it's a shame the studios couldn't stay committed to make the third one top notch as well.Of course, it does have Ian McKellan. You can't go wrong with Ian McKellan.7 out of 10, for lack of polish.Barky",X-Men - The Last Stand
239,bob_bear,Z-Men...The last bore? I do hope so!,3,6 February 2011,"The post credits additional scenes are tripe and only serve to make a mockery of the whole project.Vinnie Jones is awful. But then he has plenty of company. Halle Berry's god-awful, corn on the cob performance/dialog deserving special recognition.I didn't so much hate this film as to be bored and frustrated by it. Other comic book transitions were fun, engaging e.g. Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Constantine...these appear to have had an intelligence behind them. This film has none of it...it is just a pile of brainless, corny poo.No explanation as to how the bald child held the ""cure"". No sympathy for the lovelorn Wolverine. No belief in Jean's wig that might have done for a glamorous transvestite but not a major motion picture. And as for the ""Thunderbirds"" airplane taking them forever to get anywhere??? What a load of crapola! Oh and the sight of Ian McKellen in that helmet??? Somebody should have told him what an idiot he looked. Talk about the oldest X-swinger in town!!!! An utter disappointment. 3 out of 10",X-Men - The Last Stand
240,extravaluejotter,The End?,7,29 May 2006,"Anyone who's watched this film knows that the door has been left open for another film. Personally, I'm desperate to know what becomes of Eric/Magneto after the titanic events of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"".Magneto has been one of the stand-out characters in the X-Men series of movies, partly because of his portrayal by the talented actor Sir Ian McKellen and partly because of his 'back-story'. Traumatised by his experience of the Holocaust as a Jew and stigmatised because his mutant super-powers, Magneto is a very human villain. He is capable of warmth and empathy at one moment and cold-blooded ruthlessness the next. As the end titles of ""X3"" rolled, I sat in my seat and wondered 'What is Magneto going to do now?' I don't want to spoil the film for anyone who hasn't seen it, so let's just say that the script crams in a lot of personal turmoil and upheaval for most of the central characters, along with some amazing special effects. The script rattles along with the brevity of a TV production, compressing a quite a few character-driven plot lines into the main story. Yes, it's a bit too brief in places but there are no boring longeurs or pointless expositions. Everything in this film is building momentum toward the epic climax, only slowed by the rather choppy back-and-forth nature of the storyline.My criticisms amount to Magneto's mutant army being composed mainly of Goths (Goths just WANT you to think that they're dispossessed) and WHERE WAS ALAN CUMMING? I know that we got Kelsey Grammar in a blue fur suit instead, but after his introduction in ""X2"" I was hoping that Alan Cumming would be back as the NightCrawler.If I had to rate the 3 films I'd say 'X2, X1, X3'. ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is a good film but it suffers from creating so many loose ends, then trying to tidy them all up before the fat lady sings. Having said that, if there's another X-Men movie I WOULD like to know the result of Eric Lensherr's chess game...",X-Men - The Last Stand
241,Vampenguin,Great addition to a great franchise,8,31 May 2006,"Do not worry, this is a 100% spoiler free review...which is much harder than you'd think.I'm a big fan of the X-Men in their various incarnations, be it the various cartoons, video games, comic books or, obviously, films. Though this doesn't quite live up to the first film, I think it easily surpasses #2, and I'm completely baffled by the people who've been saying it's the worst in the series.I'll admit that I was a bit worried at first. The opening seemed really forced and the actors didn't seem as enthusiastic as they have been in the past films. However my mind was quickly changed after a huge shocker right off the bat. As promised , this review is spoiler free...but wow. Those of you who've seen the movie know what I'm talking about.As I mentioned, the actors didn't seem as into their parts as they were in the previous installments. Once the film got on track however, this was mostly rectified. The only problem character-wise that lasted throughout the film was Wolverine. Until now, Hugh Jackman seemed born to play the role, and he pulled it off perfectly in the first two. Always on edge, blunt, sarcastic and almost feral. Here however, he seems much to sensitive. Perhaps this is more to blame on the writing, I suppose, but one scene in particular stands out that was totally out of character for him. Once again, spoiler free. Famke Janssen was dead-on as Phoenix, and made the character very cool.The plot was handled great. I was a little afraid that a plot about a cure for ""mutancy"" would turn into a preachy mess, and although it does start out that way a balance is quickly found. The ending is pretty awesome as well, but if you don't want to groan Id avoid the scene after the credits.The effects were incredible, as can be expected from any film with this kind of budget. Everyone bad mouths CGI, but damn does it look awesome when used well.The new characters were great for the most part. I really liked the major characters of Magneto's Brotherhood: Juggernaut, Calisto and Spyke being the stand out new members. Pyro was as cool as ever, though I'd like to have seen a bit more of him. I was a little disappointed in the lack of an Omega Red cameo...there were rumors going around, but no luck.After it's all said and done, this is a great addition to a great series. It cant live up to #1, but it easily beats out X-2.8.5/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
242,C22Man,Underdeveloped,3,2 June 2016,"After the success of the previous two X-Men films, Bryan Singer jumped ship in a failed attempt to reboot the Superman series with the torpid Superman Returns. This left the third X-Men film in an awkward position, where a multitude of directors where considered and a fixed deadline meant it would have to be rushed to completion. Brett Ratner was a very odd choice for director, given his pure entertainment films appear to be at odds with Singer's more layered work. When it's all said and done, the film clearly suffers because of indecision. It feels like there was very little time devoted to the majority of characters and that the story was nowhere near as detailed as it could have been. Instead of an appropriate climax, the original trilogy simply ends on a bland note. Story: A cure which can turn mutants human has been discovered. With Charles Xavier's school weary of the cure, the government consider using it as a weapon and Magneto forms a brotherhood with the aim of destroying any notion of a cure. At the same time Jean Grey returns and her destructive second personality that Xavier had held back has been unleashed. The basic idea of this plot is a fantastic one, creating all kinds of conflict if the mutants could become 'normal'. The issue is that the film only touches upon the surface of that idea. Then we have the issues regarding Jean Grey. Though the film makes it clear that she has a second persona, we're given no information as to why she is wreaking havoc and her part in the story seems all too convenient.Heroes: Hugh Jackman is still enjoyable as Wolverine, once again bringing roughness and intensity to the role. The character takes the centre stage throughout and proves to be an engaging lead. Halle Berry also gets more to do as Storm, but ends up as boring as ever. Berry is a weak actress and her dialogue carries none of the weight needed. Kelsey Grammar is very enjoyable as Beast, fitting the characters intellectual mind and looking effective under a lot of make-up. Patrick Stewart is still a commanding presence as Xavier and it's a shame his part is cut so short.Villains: Magneto is once again the perfect conflicted villain. His actions are cruel and persistent, yet we understand why he is going to such lengths to protect his kind. Ian McKellen is excellent again and he really brings a calm control to the role. Famke Janssen is decent as a more sinister Jean, but struggles to deliver an effective performance because of the characters uncertain motivation. Support: The likes of Shawn Ashmore and Ellen Page as Iceman and Kitty provide some solid support as their characters are fleshed out more. Sadly the vast majority of the team is wasted. Rogue only ever shows up to complain about something. The likes of Mystique, Pyro, Colossus and Angel are given next to nothing to do or say. Worst of all is that Cyclops is once again completely misused, appearing for all of five minutes before being killed off and barely getting mentioned again.Action: The action sequences are relatively strong. We get plenty of scenes that display various mutants showcasing their powers and they are always fun to watch, with the effects looking impressive too. The final confrontation actually serves as a suitable climax and it's always enjoyable to see the X-Men fighting together, while it has the right amount of gravitas and heft to work as an end battle. Music: John Powell's score is a typical superhero one, but it fits the film fine. It is hard to say that it provides memorable themes, but it knows when to be in the background for certain scenes and it does have lavish moments that push the action further.Production: Visually the film is impressive. It has the same icy look carried over from the previous two films and despite Ratner's limited directing style he knows how to create some stimulating shots. The writing is where most of the issues lie. As stated, the smart ideas that are behind the plot of the film are never properly fleshed out and that is so disappointing because we could have easily had intelligence to go with the action. There's also a lot of clichéd moments spread throughout that feel forced and some of the dialogue can be particularly painful (some of the worst coming from Juggernaut). With such a vast array of characters it was always going to be had to flesh everyone out, but the failure to do anything of note with or give true motivations the likes of Storm and Jean Grey is unacceptable. The film would have benefited greatly from a longer running time in order to make some of the characters clearer.Conclusion: While I don't think The Last Stand is the train wreck that many make it out to be, it is a rather bland and disappointing effort. Most of that comes because of how good the film could have been. The plot was a very interesting one and many of these characters are familiar faces who we care about. The problem is that the story was never looked into enough and there are simply far too many characters thrown into the mix. Ratner clearly doesn't have the subtlety and understanding of the series that Singer did. He makes the action look great, but he loses focus when it comes to the deeper subjects. It's always nice to see Jackman, McKellen, Stewart and co in these roles, but if nothing of note is going to be done with them then it becomes an underwhelming experience.",X-Men - The Last Stand
243,thepriceofpayne,X-Men: The Last one you may Watch,6,31 July 2018,"Despite great returning performances, and welcomed new performances from Kelsey Grammer and Ellen Page. X-Men: The Last Stand fails in a thinly written script, butchering the classic Phoenix Saga Arch, and strange direction from Brett Ratner. With a strange performance from Famke Jansen which isn't bad, it's just underwhelming. The Last Stamd will always be the weakest of the original trilogy, despite some good moments. Ending the classic X-Men films on an odd note.",X-Men - The Last Stand
244,w00f,Do they even care?,5,27 May 2006,"This installment was, without a doubt, the weakest in the series. The story is entirely predictable. Researchers have developed a drug that ""cures"" mutation by suppressing the X-gene. Magneto's mutants oppose it, as do the X-Men, but the X-Men want to be non-violent about it, whereas Magneto and company want to destroy humanity over it. Nothing new there. Magneto is the bad guy, aptly played as always by Ian McKellen. We also learn a bit more about the back-story on Jean Grey. She has a dark side, which bears a more-than-passing resemblance to Samara from The Ring.Long-time X-Men fans may get excited about the Dark Phoenix stories at this point. Don't. While the name is the same, the story bears no resemblance to that height of X-Men storyline achievement from years ago. There's no time for such things here. It's just a movie.So, as you might expect, the mutants fight, Jean Grey becomes Magneto's newest and most powerful secret weapon. San Francisco serves as the backdrop for most of the movie. No Nightcrawler in this one, which disappointed me a bit. We do get Juggernaut, who is apparently Australian and has an IQ of about 63. Then again, Magneto seems to be losing his edge a bit this time around and does some dumb things... like taking on an insane, uber-powerful version of Jean Grey in the first place. Come to think of it, all of the characters seem a bit less bright this time around. Maybe it was the writers? The best example of ""we just don't care anymore"" comes at the height of the film's big battle scene. The research facility producing the anti-X drug is located on Alcatraz, and Juggernaut doesn't swim. To get to the island, Magneto picks up a big chunk of the Golden Gate Bridge and flies it to the island. He does this in the middle of broad daylight... but when the bridge slams into the island, it's suddenly the middle of the night! Yes, that's right, Magneto is SO powerful that not only has he moved the GG Bridge, he's changed the rotation of the earth, or something. It's a pretty glaring bit of discontinuity, and why it was left in the movie that way is a puzzler. I suspect its because its more dramatic to have a bridge flying through the air in daylight but the explosions of battle look better against darkness. No doubt the director, Brett Ratner (who has generally directed a string of really bad movies, BTW) figured that if there was enough action going on, nobody would notice this amateurish and jarring, in my opinion, sleight-of-lens.At the climax of all this, Jean Grey/Phoenix have the last great confrontation. Wolverine's regenerative powers are pushed to their limit as he struggles to reach Grey through a field of disintegrative power. When he gets there, he tells her how much he loves her... and then kills her in order to ""save"" her. Now, the X-Men have already gotten their hands on the source of the anti-X drug, which is a bald-headed 13 year old mutant whose power is that he can reverse mutations. So... why doesn't he just, say, knock her unconscious and then lock her in a room with the power-negating mutant boy? Why kill her? Yes, killing her is more dramatic... but completely unnecessary within the story. See? Dumb mutants.I've also got to say that Halle Berry was really phoning it in this time around. Every time she delivered a line, I cringed a little bit. Her performance was rather stiff, and Storm came off far more one dimensional in this installment than in the last couple. So did Hugh Jackman, come to think of it. I suspect it had to do with the direction they received. Overall, there really wasn't much of a spark this time around. The explosions were quite brilliant, though.On the plus side, there's a mutant (I don't know who she's supposed to be) who looks like Prince's long-lost sister. The audience had a laugh over it when she showed up on screen.It does seem like there's a good chance that this will be the last movie in this franchise. Jean Grey dies (again), Cyclops dies, Rogue takes the cure and gives up her powers so she can be touchy-feely with Iceman, and Mystique gets de-mutated early in the film. It could well be the end of the line.Then again, while we see Magneto lose his powers when Beast (aptly played by Kelsey Grammar) jabs him with syringes containing the cure, we also see him exercise just a tiny, tiny bit of power at the very end of the movie. And while Charles Xavier gets disintegrated by the Phoenix, he shows up in a new body after the credits have rolled, so he's not really dead. The door has been left open  if just a crack  for a fourth installment.Speaking of Beast, what exactly is his mutant power? I understand that he's furry and dark blue, but aside from being an apparently capable diplomat... what is it that he actually does? I hope they don't do it. After seeing this one, I think the X-Men movies have run their course.I give this movie a big ""Eh."" Great visual effects, but that's about all there is to it. It's fun enough to be worth seeing if you're willing to shell out the price of admission for what amounts to a big-budget B movie that takes itself a little too seriously. If you're not itching to see it, though, I'd recommend against it. Wait for the DVD. It just isn't very good.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The movie's plot is confusing in a few areas, but I love some of the plot. The acting is amazing and all of the main actors return with new members. Vinnie Jones plays Juggernaut and he does not even have a lot of screen time and the way they did his character is just sad. Eric Dane is good as Multiple Man in the screen time he has. Ellen Page as Kitty Pride / Shadowcat and she was really amazing for this part and she would play the part in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"".Hugh Jackman does a good job as Wolverine and he is great. Famke Janssen as Jean Grey / Phoenix is really amazing and I felt that she should have won an Oscar for this film, but did not and that is just sad.The music by John Powell is really amazing and I think she does a really great job and it is the best musical score from him that I have heard, along with his musical score for Shrek and both Agent Cody Banks films.The visual effects and action scenes are really amazing in this film and my favorite action sequence is at the end, but when Wolverine killed Jean Grey, it almost had me crying first time I saw this film, but I love this film. The scene where Jean Grey / Phoenix kills Professor X really wanted me to cry, but I just felt emotion through the entire sequence.Overall, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND does a few things right, but it is just outweighed by flaws, but I would also say that I would be lying if I said that it was not enjoyable.6 out of 10.This is the first few X-MEN films and I will return to the X-MEN film series, soon with the other X-MEN films in the X-MEN film series.",X-Men - The Last Stand
246,chandean-69762,X-Men: The Last Stand 2006 Review,4,21 January 2021,"This trilogy made great groundwork .. stepped it up .. and then took two steps back.
The Last Stand try's way too hard to be a spectacle when it's just not. What was a solid story thus far felt like it was all thrown away just for this film. Characters are reduced down, and made me care about them less like Jean Grey, Rogue, and even sadly Cyclops. Rivalry's and friendships feel like they're put to the side. And even some characters are left out like Nightcrawler .. where did he even go? The Juggernaut, even this awful looking / performed version of the character, was underutilized in my opinion and should've gotten a bigger part in the film. Even Angel / Archangel is only introduced to be used as a macguffin in the finale, such wasted potential.
The only thing I can really give this film credit for is the action scenes, all the action scenes (with exception of the horrendous finale), looked badass. One that specifically pops into my head is the scene where Magneto is walking down the street flipping police cars like it's nothing.
I honestly wasn't too happy about this film, it's not awful by any means, but it's definitely not good.",X-Men - The Last Stand

250,cashbacher,A mutant child is the prize,10,8 February 2019,"The premise of this final episode of the X-Men featuring Charles Xavier, Scott Sommers and Jean Grey is that a pharmaceutical company has developed a vaccine that will ""cure"" mutants of their powers. For a few of them, it is a godsend, but for the vast majority, it is a cure for what should not be considered a disease.
As is usually the case, Magneto takes the side of opposition and he attracts many mutants to his side. He considers it a war against Homo Sapiens and the X-Men and Xavier stand in opposition. Compounding everything is the return of Jean Grey, now more the Phoenix than the Marvel Girl. There are some initial skirmishes, but it comes down to a titanic battle between the forces of Magneto against a unit of U. S. soldiers and a few of the X-Men.
The special effects are of course tremendous, for without them no modern superhero movie could be even close to entertaining. There are some casualties, but the ending hints that we may have not seen the last of Magneto.

I don't think Singer will add anything to Superman we haven't seen before and Brett Ratner can't keep up with the expectations set on the former two X-Men Movies.Didn't help the plot tried to grab more than it could chew on. Too many story lines and too little time to develop them all. Main characters die and lose their power without adding drama or urgency. Other characters are introduced without a backstory. The one that has some backstory (Angel) is almost a cameo. With this movie, one of my fears from the comic book came true: There were so many mutants at one point I lost track of them. But, Jackman and McKellen carry the movie as they did in the other two. Fortunately.Add also the poor decision of giving up more story development for bombast. This movie mainly goes for apocalyptic, and totally unrealistic fighting scenes between the good guys and the bad guys, as if trying to show off the big budget the movie had for special effects.Yet still, it manages to entertain, so it's not a lost case. The problem is, with Ratner the focus is on entertainment, when Singer focus is on delivering a message first.

After a certain buzz with Brett Ratner taking the director's helm after Bryan Singer didn't come back.

254,samseescinema,The X-Men just aren't as fun as they used to be,6,26 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 2.5 out of 4As the X-Men series enters its final chapter, it reminds me a little of the series finale for a long-running serial drama on primetime network television. Main characters have to be buried and memorialized at tired funerals, unalterable twists put to a plot never to be picked up again, and a volley of answers laid into the patchwork of secrets and questions the previous episodes presented. But as in all series finales, there are too many answers that must be handled with directorial TLC and not enough time to fit them all in. So, often answers are plopped in front of us or sloppily dealt with, leaving the taste of Matrix Revolutions in our mouths. But this isn't the main fault line cracking up The Last Stand; the X-Men just aren't as fun as they used to be. The formula hasn't much changed since the last time mutants populated your box office, but it seems the talky-talk side of the X-Men story has worn thin. The previous two talked quite enough, grinding the film to a halt to inject a dose of story when necessary; but then the film was smart enough to ramp back up the excitement and continue with its Juggernaut blast of superhero action. The X-Men puppeteers should have by now realized we don't come to these pictures for their intellectual draw. There's no thickening of emotional binds we have to the mutants with each iteration of the X-Men tale. But Director Brett Ratner and his drove of technical assistants trudge on through a screenplay fattened by an overstretched storyline that draws such transparent parallels to racism, generalization, and most of the recent political issues that call for picketers. And Screenwriters Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg continue X-Men's tradition of chunky character development, with generous dips into a sour sauce of conventional storytelling. The X-Men movies have never been adept at handling story, but more than make up for it with tremendous set-pieces of comic book action. Does anyone remember the opening sequence in X2 with Nightcrawler? That scene alone was worth price of admission. There's nothing to match that excitement here, and we're left with many solemn discussions on the future of Mutanity (like humanity, see?).The story itself continues the tug-of-war struggle between Dr. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) as they fight to harness the power of the mutant population. Here they're fighting for control of Leech (Cameron Bright), a mutant whose power is to rob fellow mutants of their supernatural abilities, turning them back into ho-hum humans. The government has harnessed Leech's power and formed a vaccine to ""cure"" the mutant race. Dr. Xavier and Magneto have different opinions on the subject, and now fight on different sides of an inevitable war between Mutants and Humans. Spicing up things is Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), whose powerful dual personality, Phoenix, has become unstoppable in a mood swingy, pre-menstrual sort of way. There are new characters, like Beast (Kelsey Grammar), representing the Mutant race in the White House, Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), which is pretty self-explanatory, Kitty (Ellen Page), who can walk through walls and Angel (Ben Foster), who's sprouted feathery, white wings. The filmmakers have gotten progressively more whimsical with their mutants, springing dozens of other characters with fascinating abilities. But only in the final climactic scenes do their powers get put to use. For all its explosive excitement and impressive CGI images, this final battlefield sequence is the only true action scene in the entire film. The rest of the film's action leads up to this ending, refusing to participate in any of the set-piece thrills the previous two films contained. This results in a pitiful downplay of some more intriguing characters, especially the potentially-iconic Angel. Although The Last Stand plunks down as many answers as its 104 minute running length allows, if you stay through the end credits, you'll be treated to the most tantalizing of cliffhangers. At the midnight screening last night, as the cliffhanger moment was revealed, people shouted ""What are they doing?! It's over!"" My friend leaned out and said, ""They're making money, people. They're making money."" -www.samseescinema.com",X-Men - The Last Stand
255,kylehodgdon,I liked This A Lot,9,11 November 2009,"Of the three (four including Wolverine) X-men movies, I enjoyed this one the most. I thought it was a fitting conclusion to the trilogy. When the original X-men came out I hated it because it was not true to the comic book story. But an old friend of mine gave me some advice: ""Just take it as a story from a different point of view."" Once I began doing that for the Marvel movies I really have enjoyed most all of them. There were a lot of things that happened that I was certainly not expecting (Cyclops dying in the very beginning, Professor Xavior being destroyed, Mystique and Magneto being depowered).With the exception of Juggernaut, all of the mutants look great I think they did a great job with Beast. Sure it would have been cool to see The Phoenix all fiery, but again, this is from a different viewpoint from the comics, so I can accept a different version of her. I'm glad that Colossus and Kitty Pride were given feature roles in this film, as they are two of my favorite X-men. This movie came out during the time that the Astonishing X-Men comic was in full force and even though this movie was not trying to take directly from the stories of that comic, it did look like the film borrowed snippets of ideas from time to time. Everything looked very cool in this movie and it is definitely a awesome movie, especially for someone who is a superhero fan.",X-Men - The Last Stand
256,KeremUlucay,COULD BE BETTER,7,9 July 2019,"X-Men: The Last Stand had more potential. If Bryan Singer continued for this film, it would be better. Even though, it has more and better action and fight sequences than previous films. Also it has some really really cool lines.I really enjoyed first part of the movie. But the rest of it wasn't great because they couldn't tell Phoenix's story. I like Famke Janssen on that role but the character hasn't written so well. Also some new characters are shallow like Angel and Juggernaut. But I liked Beast so much.On the other hand, it was shocking to see Xavier's death, Mystique's and Magneto's loss of their powers. But post credit scene confused me after these scenes.Finally, maybe the best thing this movie have is the relationship of Logan and Jean. And I really liked the way Logan killed her. But third X-Men movie could be more, because the idea of the story is amazing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
257,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn! review,6,23 May 2014,"After the first X-Men movie and X2, the things were looking really good for the X-Men franchise, and then along came X-Men: The Last Stand. This drastic change in quality between movies is mostly attributed to Bryan Singer, the director of the first two movies, deciding to direct Superman Returns instead of this one, and being replaced by Brett Ratner. Since then, Bryan Singer has officially stated he regrets his decision. Considering how Superman Returns isn't a much better movie than X-Men: The Last Stand, it's a shame things went this way. Instead of a satisfying third X-Men movie, the world got a X-Men movie that felt like it was directed by Michael Bay.There are two main plot lines in X-Men: The Last Stand. The first one is about a cure for mutations that changes mutants to humans. The mutant community is divided by this cure – some of them want to change to humans, while the others strictly oppose this cure and want to destroy it by all means. At the same time, the X-men discover that Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) isn't dead, but Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) warns them she maybe isn't the same old Jean Grey they used to know. This turns out to be true when Jean Grey's alter ego, Phoenix, takes control of her body.While the first two X-Men movies are classics of the superhero genre, X-Men: The Last Stand is simply a very bad movie. It had almost twice the amount of its predecessor's budget ($210 million) and it still seemed like a cheaper movie. The special effects are bad, but so is everything else. The dialogue is worse than ever, the plot is uninteresting, and the freshly introduced mutants are awful. The X-Men franchise is mainly about its characters – misunderstood individuals feared by the general public – and their moral dilemmas; the strong characters and character developments are the main things that made the first two movies so good. Both of those aspects are lacking in X-Men: The Last Stand. New characters like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and Angel (Ben Foster) are one-dimensional and forgettable caricatures, and the character of Dr. Henry 'Hank' McCoy aka Beast (Kelsey Grammar), while somewhat interesting, was a only of shadow of what he could have been.If you can get past the ludicrous writing, the silly acting and the simple characters, and just want to see mindless action scenes and mutants beating each other up, than X-Men: The Last Stand could just be the movie for you. However, if you strive to watch something above the generic Michael Bay tropes, you should definitely stay away from this movie. While there is some charm to dumb popcorn action movies, X-Men: The Last Stand is still an insult to the whole franchise, and doesn't deserve to have the words 'X-Men' in its title. Unfortunately, things for the X-Men franchise didn't get much better with X-Men Origins: The Wolverine.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",X-Men - The Last Stand
258,MrBiddle,Einstein was no mutant.,7,24 May 2006,"As I have expected, this by no means surpasses X-Men United, it's previous one, nor the original film. Yet it pays off certain plot points, such as the fully unleashed Phoenix, and the final revolt led by Magneto. Ratner does a reasonably good job, although this could have done better with the writers that Bryan Singer have used in X2. It has an intensity when the Phoenix is being dealt with, certaind deaths take place in X3. But on top of this, Professor Xavier maintains his higher sense of morales, in one sequence, Kitty Pryde even compares his ideals with that of a theory of Einstein... well, Einstein wasn't a mutant, replied Xavier. Watch Magneto levitate the most gargantuan object he has ever manipulated, see Shadowcat fight bravely against Juggernaut in a compassionate mission to rescue the mutant boy with the cure. Who's hiding, dickhead? And later, see Rogue make a decision of her own, a character highly underused in this film, but a key player if only; in respect the movie's main plot line.And it ends with Wolverine's flesh being subject to destruction in the movie's final sequence. All in all, it is watchable but does not pack a wallop as Singer's X-2; X-MEN UNITED has. But think of it as a sociological drama, with a few scenes of action, some frights that you can enjoy courtesy of Brett Ratner and company.7/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
259,MovieZoo,"X-Men, Y me?",2,26 May 2006,"It is not my intention to offend X-Men fans who liked this movie. But this movie should be the ""X""-it sign for the producers if they have any self respect. In my opinion they had no respect for the X-Men fan, but they may have tricked many into believing they did. Throughout much, if not most, of the movie I could not help thinking this movie was styled from bad B-movies from the 50s. I almost half expected The Blob to enter into it or the Swamp Thing even. Why? Continuity and dialogue. It...was...so...stiff...and...weak. The actors didn't have a chance to act. The scenes were too short and fast. AND OMG! The score was so damn awful. Who said it was a good idea to overplay the horns and percussion for even the slowest and least dramatic moments?Back to the actors. They did what they could but what they really needed was that guy from the last airing of American Idol who thought he was another Clay Aiken! LOL, This movie sucked so bad. I don't even want to get into what should have been involved, dramatic twists. Instead, it was as if someone said, ""Hey let's have a twist here!"" and then dropped it like a hot potato.Go away Rattner! You bother me. Someone please get that Singer guy, PLEASE!I gave it a 2 out of 10 Because I liked the 2 previous movies so much and I figure they deserve at least one point for the heck of it. Make sense? - more than this movie!",X-Men - The Last Stand
260,colonel_green,A fine conclusion.,8,19 June 2006,"Many fans of the cinematic X-Men were against ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" before it was even released. This was, in large part, due to the non-involvement of original director Bryan Singer, and his replacement by studio director Brett Ratner. While Ratner is not a creative talent of Singer's skill, it's my opinion that most of the flaws in this production predate Ratner's involvement, as they mostly pertain to the scripting phase, conducted under the direction of studio executives and Matthew Vaughn. In any event, the flaws detract, but do not cripple the film.Fans will always speculate about Singer's potential storyline, and, almost unanimously, will conclude it would have been superior. Leave that to other fans; the plotting of this film works quite well, although those who say the movie could have used another half-hour are quite accurate in saying so. The mutant cure plot and the Dark Phoenix story compliment each other suitably, and it all comes together for a terrific finale, including the finest superhero brawl ever filmed.Arguably, the production's big flaw predates Ratner by two films: Halle Berry as Storm, who continues to prove anemic and a sour note. Berry's amplified role in X3 only serves to cast further light on this. Luckily, stalwarts like Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart are on hand, as well as newcomers like Kelsey Grammar (who's the real McCoy, if I am to be allowed the pun) and Ellen Page (the third Shadowcat in as many films, but irresistible in the part). Famke Janssen has a tough role as the reimagined Phoenix, but, again, any problems with her most be accorded to the writers.In sum, I think the X-franchise is in good standing. If nothing else, the stage is ripe for spin-offs focussing on Wolverine, a younger Magneto, and the younger X-Men like Shadowcat and Iceman. It's not as good as X2, but a commendable effort nonetheless.",X-Men - The Last Stand
261,AirBourne_Bds,Oh My Stars & Garters: An alternate Universe?,8,24 May 2006,"Scott Summers? Charles Xavier?? What has Marvel come to in doing such murder??? DC is not that big a threat movie-wise yet...Comics-wise, DC is making big strides, but on the silver screen, Marvel still pops claws! This film is supposed to tie all three together, yet there were two intimations that the big boys of Mutantdom will host an X4... Both clues were at the end of the movie - Charles' spirit seems to be literally living on and Magneto appears to be taking extra doses of One-A-Day With Iron, LOL! If I picked at the non-comic elements of this movie, I would take as much time as the Original and Uncanny X-Men took to develop! Original X-Men were about late 60's and the Uncanny mutant heroes were from the mid-70's...The scenes with Logan and Hank McCoy were too short and too tame, they never really cut loose - but it was funny when Logan asked Hank why fight if he's a diplomat and Hank was seeking to retort with a spiffy salvo and lost it in the midst of punctuating himself with a bite, kick or cuff! The Angel is also another reason X4 cannot be far behind as he was here too short, and no redux of Nightcrawler? Bamf!!! Storm was played up better here and I was still shocked at how Cyclops was made dust by Jean, it was as if she was a neo-Proteous (son of Moira MacTaggart, he was one sick and powerful puppy in the comics, oops! I did it again...)??The Morlocks that Callisto (white in the comics and black in the film, aw shaddup already) was in charge of was sidelined and Madrox The Multiple Man was villainised when he really started as a Hero...But, as difficult as it was, if you treat the tale as a great sci-fi allegory against discrimination in any form and it had very well-executed SFX then you did get quite a bit of bang for the buck - if you read the comics like me? Take along a salt shaker, but if you are new? ""Snikt!"" those adamantiums and get ready for a fastball special!",X-Men - The Last Stand
262,Chiron1987,"A Weak, Insipid Ending To a Fine Cinematic Saga",2,29 May 2006,"This review contains massive spoilers and only mild ranting.X-Men: The Last Stand limped in, weakened and ailing, as the conclusion to Bryan Singer's filmic saga featuring Marvel Comics' venerable X-Men. I will not go into the specifics of how The Last Stand betrayed its characters' comic book origins, or will I speak of Fox Studios' flawed, fast-tracked, rushed, and sloppy attempt to spite Bryan Singer for leaving (temporarily) to direct this summer's ""Superman Returns."" No, that will not affect the normal movie-going public's opinion of this film.Instead I will just say that this really is a film to avoid, and was a disrespectful follow-up to what Bryan Singer and Co. tried to build in the first two films of this series.The Last Stand suffered from pacing problems and odd, frenetic editing. Much of the film is dialogue, and not particularly well-written dialogue. What action we do get is sporadic and anti-climatic. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, an awe-inspiring character of the last two films, is reduced to a whimpering simp in The Last Stand, who stands around whining, complaining, and avoiding doing anything until at the end of the movie when he realizes that he will not get his way. Halle Berry, who complained about Storm's lack of anything to do in the first films, once again has little to do in this one but talk and complain. Professor X, our stalwart leader, is made a villain, and Sir Ian McKellan's Magneto is turned into a total psychopath. All in all, most of our returning characters have been transformed into pale imitations of themselves, self-parodying their once fine performances into a bad episode of Seinfeld. I almost expected Wolverine, Storm, Professor X, and Magneto to all be sitting around at Monk's Coffee Shop bitching about their miserable lives.The film is not without its good points, though. Kelsey Grammar's Dr. Henry ""Hank"" McCoy, the anthropoid Beast, is terrific, and his action sequences, albeit brief, are exciting and filled with more ape-fighting action that all of ""King Kong."" Yet, he has little screen time, and ultimately, little to do. Ben Foster's Warren Worthington III/Angel is nothing more than scenery. He has two scenes, which will good, give little else to the film.As for the plot: it's ham-fisted, trite, and downright boring. There is a cure for mutantcy, and Magneto wants to rally mutants against it. How does he go about it? By fighting other mutants. Really smart plan for Mr. Lensherr, isn't' it? And as for the ""Phoenix"" saga played out with Famke Janssen's Jean Grey? They didn't even attempt to follow the original comic book story, or build something the least bit original or entertaining. Basically, in the film's big climax, Jean just stands there for twenty minutes doing nothing until Wolverine comes forward, kills a ""Class 5"" mutant with his claws, and then cries over her body.The Last Stand ends with major, beloved characters dead, one cured (hint: it's Rogue), and not much else. Oh, and if you stay past the credits, you'll discover a nice scene that really does little to save this horrible excuse for a movie.The only thing I could think as I walked out into the Texas summer sunlight was ""God, I hope Superman Returns is good."" It's something I will continue to pray until the thirtieth of June.Not recommended.",X-Men - The Last Stand
263,hoxjennifer,"""When you cage the beast, the beast gets angry""",8,30 June 2014,"X-Men: The Last Stand is a bit of a misleading title, for starters. After this film, there are more x-men sequels that have been created since 2006. Overall, this sequel is a redeeming piece from the last movie. I commented on my last review of X2 that there were too many plot lines to follow, and that having so many side stories detracted from the main plot. This storyline in this movie cuts right to the point with a bit of an exploration of Jean Grey's dual personality character - but again, this doesn't detract from the plot, it enriches it.Special effects are absolutely fantastic. Famke Janssen puts on a stellar performance as the dark and savage Phoenix. And I was happy to see that that Beast was introduced into the team - pretty much all his quirks from the TV series were well represented. Acting in general is consistent from the first two films. X-Men: The Last Stand is definitely not the last movie, but it has certainly been a redemption from the previous film. I have high hopes for the next one on my list!",X-Men - The Last Stand
264,Adorable,X Not for Extraordinary,6,2 June 2006,"Often derided as a cheap shot at bandwagon tactics, the major studios' predilection towards churning out comic-inspired releases has at least given audiences the acceptable X Men series.Unlike quickly-assembles disappointments in the vein of Catwoman, Daredevil and Spiderman 2, the three X's thus far have been successful in maintaining plausible levels of entertainment value for the movie-going masses while avoiding outright ridicule, as unfortunately has come to pass with some of the others mentioned above.Although X2 and its sequel, the new Last Stand, have fallen short of their original compatriot, the first X Men title, they both largely live up to their promises, and in fact the latest installment surpasses its predecessor in production finesse and wealth of characters.This attribute certainly serves as X3's primary advantage, in that the movie dishes out mutants like there's no tomorrow. Although subsequently they each suffer from lack of individual exposure and development, heroes and villains alike go about their souped-up antics with wild abandon befitting a carefree summer outing.In addition, the humans are no longer mere puppets at the whim of superior beings, as even Magneto himself notes when saying: ""finally, they've learned"". Yes, unlike the two previous chapters, X3 boasts ""normal"" humans both capable in their handling of the mutant issue and generally free of nefariously devious ulterior motives. Thus, gone are the conspiratorial undertones found in the other X forays, paving the way for more head-on, straight-faced action than formerly the norm.Sadly, though, much like X2, this one also lacks the first movie's superb setup of the X universe, as it does the witty one-liners, particularly from Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, who by now has become rather flaccid and quite a departure from his vicious self of six years ago.No matter, for with excellent cameos from a whole slew of mutants to spruce things up the overall winding down effect noticeable in the franchise seems less formidable. Callisto (voluptuous Dania Ramirez who you may remember from Spike Lee joints 25th Hour and She Hate Me), Angel (Ben Foster, the villain in Hostage) and beautiful Kea Wong as brief but delectable Jubliee all contribute volumes to X3's content, making it more the comprehensive compendium of characters devotees no doubt have been eager to see for years now.As a last stand for the series, we could have hoped for much more but also for much, much worse, as when it comes to mainstream action storytelling, mediocrity rears its ugly head with the variety of wild abandon you'd expect from marmots on speed. Therefore X3 amounting to little more than a showing in force of as many members of the X Men pantheon as possible is no bad thing.At X3's core lies a parable close once more to the moralistic allegories we have previously found in the original X film: a cure has been found for the mutant ""disease"" by benevolent human scientists, yet the question remains as to who'd want to be cured and why in the first place.Deeming this a threat, a resurgent Magneto (Ian McKellen) assembles around his attractive self an army of ticked-off mutants bent on pre-empting human advancements. These include several regulars, like Rebecca Romjin's Mystique, but also memorable newcomer Juggernaut (big screen pseudo-hooligan Vinnie Jones) and fire-tastic Pyro (Aaron Standford).Standing up to this massing threat and for all things pro-choice, Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) rallies his own forces back at Mutant Academy, this time to encompass a more eclectic roster, albeit one allowing each member the bare minimum of screen time. Even stalwarts Wolverine, Storm (Halle Barry), Cyclops (Scott Summers) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) either exit prematurely or are displaced immediately after putting in their two cents, and not all even get a shot at flexing their respective mutant muscles.Only Famke Janssen's bifocal rendition of Dr. Jean Grey/Phoenix really receives significant stretches of limelight, but one must resent the writers' decision to make her nigh on invincible yet ultimately a none-event, a plot device of somewhat inexplicable futility.Fortunately such false build-ups do not typify the movie as an entire product. It bypasses the flatlining so common in action serials which have outlived their usefulness, mostly thanks to competent action directing and effects that aren't always overwhelming, even when Jean Grey's comeback gets so powerful she's easily despised, much as was the case with Keanu Reeves' Neo by the final Matrix movie.Another player in this tangled plot of genetic hyperbole who comes close to being a well-rounded persona is Kelsey Grammar's Beast, a.k.a. Dr. Hank McCoy. Not merely another academic in the X Men universe's endless array of college-educated mutants parading around the world with titles attached, Beast sheds more light on a real-life aspect of mutant existence, serving as a diplomat and the government's newly-appointed secretary of mutant affairs (a nod to Native-American social standing and political situation, presumably). When he finally parts with bureaucracy and dons the mantle of bestial mutation in the fight against Magneto's cadres, the result comes across as quite gratifying.There's little doubt Last Stand won't be entered into historical records as the most cerebral actioner ever, yet its own X marks an improvement over the 2003 precursor and also a step-up for director Bret Ratner, who's done us a tad prouder with X3 and may at long last be rid of the buddy-cop comedy stigma haunting him since the Rush Hour days. In that, Last Stand buttresses projects like After the Sunset, which has already tagged Ratner as a more serious action director.Definitely an improvement for series aficionados and general viewers over the sophomore release, X3 doesn't match high standards set by franchise progenitor X Men but nonetheless caters to those craving an action-dominated distraction with just the most modest splashes story and a hefty dose of entertaining characters.Rating: * * *",X-Men - The Last Stand
265,MairegChernet,Not bad. Just mediocre.,7,25 January 2009,"In the third installment, Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) takes over the saga. And I actually found it somewhat entertaining but at the same time disappointing. I don't know if it was the multitude of villains that made me like it or the CGi filled action scenes, or maybe the fact that Logan's claws seem to have gotten longer. I don't know.Alas, the film lags behind the other X-Men movies due to many flaws. One is that the X-men are united no more. (as they were in the previous two films) and worst of all we see Jean entering ""the dark side."" This just made the film tasteless. Two, not only were the sequences bizarre but Ratner and crew did not dedicate enough time to character and plot development, as opposed to action-filled and explosive scenes.Was X-Men 3 entertaining? Sure. Was it filled with lots of action? Of course. Did it have multiples of villains and good guys? Most definitely. But was it made up of a concrete plot, a steady character build up and edge-of-your-seat moments? Not really. I wouldn't bet on that.Once again we witness that sequels are worse than the original. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't as expected. 6.8/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
266,TheSeaLion,A guilty pleasure that is a mess of a film,2,5 March 2014,"In the year 2000, director Bryan Singer brought the Marvel superhero team the X-Men to the big screen with his film ""X-Men"". Later, in 2003, Singer worked as the director of the sequel, ""X2: X-Men United"", in my opinion the best Marvel film and one of the best superhero films to date. When the third chapter to the X-Men film trilogy was in the works, negotiations made Singer decide to sign on to the Superman reboot, ""Superman Returns"", and it does show. Was this film as good as the first two X-Men movies? No. Is it what you would normally expect from a third film in a trilogy of movies. Probably.I first saw this movie with a friend when it came out in 2006 and did not think much of it. A few years later, I rented the movie and re- watched it with a mostly positive look on it. As time passed, I realized while I liked the movie, it was at best a guilty pleasure and at worse a mess of a final movie for a trilogy. It is quite sad as there was actually some good substance in the movie, but it gets bogged down with pointless characters, multiple story lines, and having more of an interest in showing action sequences than telling a good story.Taking place once again in the ""not too distant future"", a businessman (Michael Murphy) has created a cure that will rid mutants of their powers. The mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen) begins to recruit other mutants to fight against the cure. At the same time, an emotionally damaged Cyclops (James Marsden) begins to hear Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and returns to Alkali Lake where he finds her alive and well. It is revealed that Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) had to mentally block out part of Jean's brain to keep her powers in check and her alternate side is now the one in power.This film suffers the most from having too many characters being introduced and subplots going on at the same time. In the opening of the movie, a flashback is present of the mutant Angel (Ben Foster/Cayden Boyd) whose only importance to the movie is that his father is the businessman who created the cure and is in a total of about six scenes. From the previous films, Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) are upgraded from just doing cameos to being on the team for the sole purpose of having more X-Men to fight. Kitty, along with Beast (Kelsey Grammar) are the only two new characters that actually have something to do in the movie rather than just be there to add people to the epic final battle.The most surprising and refreshing aspect of the film was the plot line about the cure for the mutants. The film never goes explicitly into whether it is right or wrong and is just letting the characters decide for themselves. All of the characters that is except for Storm (Halle Berry) who is supporting of other mutants choices in other films but is suddenly very opinionated and reacts harshly towards it.While there is some substance to the movie, it is covered up by all of the pointless characters, plot lines that do not add up to much, and action scenes. The acting for the most part was good and the preexisting characters were still interesting, but the story and the new characters weighed it all down. The mutant's powers were used whenever they could be and not when it would be appropriate, with the exception being at the end and when they are at Jean's home in the middle of the movie. The film is not as bad as people make it out to be, but at its best it is a guilty pleasure.",X-Men - The Last Stand
267,evan_harvey,Very average,4,25 May 2006,"The first two films were great. They were also written by the same people. Bringing in a new director and new writers was a bad move. This film suffers most from bad writing. I think the script-writers tried to cover too much ground with not enough skill. It seemed like they just stuffed bits in to make up the story without giving any of it enough substance. The story-line was quite good, quite dark, but the way it was delivered is what is most disappointing. I liked the first 2 films. This one was only okay, not great as it should have been. It is the worst of the 3, but is rescued slightly by the dark story-line that was spot on for where the third installment should have gone.The special effects were fine, but then most films have the same quality these days, so its a non-issue.The director wasn't very good. The actors have proved that they are far better than they were in this film, so perhaps Brett Ratner was out of his depth. Some of the scenes were sub-standardly blocked. Still, that's not the worst thing about the film.Wolverine's character was much tamer than he has been. There was absolutely no mention of the sub-plot involving his past, which was still unresolved. Storm had more lines, but her character came across as annoying rather than more 'developed'. Her look, while updated, was also out of character. She was never a 'lead' character, and should have stayed that way.This film deviated quite considerably from the direction of the first 2 films in quality and the characters.Mystique and Scott Summers were both wasted characters in this movie, not because of what happened to them, but the way it happened. Their parts were far to small considering their impact in the other films. Scott especially should have been used much more, even if the end result stayed the same. The film should have documented his downward spiral.Jean Grey turned interesting, but is never more than that. She offers a few surprises, but is mostly wasted as a character.Wait till the credits have finished rolling for the lead into the next film, which is in line with the X-Men comics. It'll be interesting to see where it goes. However, if it isn't better than this one, they shouldn't bother.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Now this is a question we must all ask ourselves. Why? Because, we are mutants."" --- Professor Charles Xavier.The above quote sums up ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" well, considering that it is the supposed final installment in one of the greatest superhero sagas ever put onto screen and the director of the first two films, Bryan Singer, turned the director's chair over to Brett Ratner--yes, Brett Ratner, the director of numerous music videos and the ""Rush Hour"" series. Ratner gained a vast amount of power with the studio's decision to hire him and what he did with that power mattered greatly to every fan of this franchise. Well, did he use it for the greater good or did he use it for destructive ends? In all actuality, Ratner did both of these things. On one hand, he made a fun, exciting, and engaging film with many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. On the other hand, there is a lack of a conclusion to this film, making this a disappointing final installment. It would seem that someone forgot to tell the screenwriters that this was ""The Last Stand""not just another sequel. Or maybe this was their plan all along--call this the final movie so everyone rushes out to see it and then release yet another sequel a few years down the road. Let's hope that is the caseotherwise, the ""X-Men"" franchise has let me and many others down.The world's population is split in half when a cure for the Mutant X gene is discovered. Should the cure be turned into weapons that could force mutants to give up their powers or should the cure be on an optional basis only? On top of that, Jean Grey (Janssen), who was thought to be dead, has returned and has gained far more power than any other mutant could ever wish to have. She is now the Phoenix, a ""Level Five"" mutant who could destroy the world in a matter of seconds if she so desires. Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) and the other X-Men seek to help Jean control this dark, evil side of her powers, but Magneto (McKellen) wants to harvest her power to help his Brotherhood of Mutants. Jean, unable to control her alternate self, the Phoenix, cannot escape the upcoming war, which will be raged between man and mutantand between mutant and mutant. Can Professor X, Wolverine (Jackman), Storm (Berry), and the other X-Men stop Magneto, fight the war, and rescue Jean before Magneto gains ultimate power? Whose side will you stand on? When Brett Ratner was named the director of the final installment in the ""X-Men"" series, fans were up in arms and it seemed as though everyone was expecting Ratner to fail? Fortunately, he didn't. In fact, the only thing he didn't do correctly was choosing to work with this script. Very few expected the change in screenwriters to affect the movie so highly. Unfortunately, it did. The screenwriters here handle most of the film well enough, but, when they falter, they fail miserably. So many ends are left unconnected. Characters that we have grown to love (or hate) vanish and are never seen again, leaving their fates up to interpretation. Many of the characters we loved from the first two films are given a limited amount of screen time in favor of new, pointless characters. In all honestly characters such as Angel (Ben Foster) and Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) are completely useless and wasted on dull parts. They could have easily been cut out completely and it seems as though they were merely added for the sake of telling the fanboys that these comic book characters would be in the film. Had this been another sequel, I would have enjoyed this movie far more and, if another film is made, my opinions of this film will improve greatly. As it is the final movie, at this point in time, I find myself slightly disappointed. I wanted more of a conclusion to this amazing franchise and that was something ""The Last Stand"" lacked.Do not get me wrong. I enjoyed ""X-Men: The Last Stand"". It is an action-packed, electrifying film that isn't afraid to kill off main characters or completely change everything we know about them. It held my attention constantly and, if another film is made, I would probably say that this is a great movie. As the end of a trilogy, I must say that it doesn't quite cut it. It's a notch below the previous two installments, in terms of emotional resonance and characterization, as well. Still, when this movie ended, I had had a good time and, when watching the three films back-to-back, I couldn't notice any real drastic decrease in quality. They all work together nicely. I simply hope that this is not, as the title suggests, the last stand for the X-Men and that we will be seeing another film in a few years' time--a film that concludes the series far better than this. Bring on the next ""X-Men"" film, because I am ready.Final Thoughts: As just a sequel, it is great. As a conclusion of a series, it is just good.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)",X-Men - The Last Stand
270,jacklmauro,X-cruciating,1,4 June 2011,"I made the mistake of getting this on DVD, which haunts me. That said - reader, I beg you: trust me. This is soulless hack work, as only a talentless twit like Brett Ratner could produce. That I knew and loved the books is beside the point; I can appreciate that a film must take liberties. I can appreciate as well that Bryan Singer, a few flaws notwithstanding, knew how to find the heart in these tales. It is ironic that a horror from the first two movies - Berry's utterly absurd portrayal of storm - is here nearly a nostalgic comfort. Because all of this is a mess. We are expected to believe lots of things far more unreal than mutant abilities, such as Magneto turning his back on Mystique because the 'cure' reverts her to human form. OUT OF CHARACTER, and rather stupid for the brilliant Erik, who knew the lady's resourcefulness. Or Magneto idiotically egging on the deranged Phoenix as though he had no idea of what she could do, as he and Charles visit Jean. Or Jean's mad impulse to turn Scott to dust, when, in movie and books, her love for Scott saves her from Phoenix insanity. Or that Wolverine's healing power is just so bad-ass, it enables him to near the galactic killing force Jean becomes (and no nonsense about her 'letting' this happen, please- the character is a zombie). Or - oh, hell, it's everywhere and everything. Worst of all, though, is the lifelessness of it. A few actors try, but can't get past the dead atmosphere. On the plus side, the girl playing Kitty looks right, and you have to love Multiple Man who has, I think, one line, when Magneto (whom he does not know) recruits him: ""Sounds good to me!"" That's it for the plus side.",X-Men - The Last Stand
271,mwcrunner,Kind of a disappointment for an X-Men movie,4,27 May 2016,"This is the least popular of the X-Men trilogy. A lot of characters do die in this like Charles Xavier, Cyclops and Jean Grey aka the Phoenix. We also like it better when Jean Grey is with Cyclops instead of Wolverine cause what Wolverine and Jean Grey were having was an affair that Cyclops shouldn't know about. We also get to see some new villains in this like Multiple Man and Juggernaut. Now Juggernaut is not exactly how he appears in the comics in this movie cause Juggernaut is very big and is big as the Hulk. If there were a newer X-Men movie with him in it he would be a CGI character just like Hulk is in the Avengers. One part I found funny in this movie though is when Wolverine kicks this guy who has a healing factor like him in the crotch cause that was his only weakness. lol. Also Iceman is cool but still this isn't a very good movie. Also after the credits are over we find out that Charles Xavier has survived in another body. Still this movie doesn't make the cut. Of course I've seen worse then this.",X-Men - The Last Stand
272,Sparrowmaniac,Lame real Lame,6,27 May 2006,"The Xmen trilogy has deteriorated ever since its inception. X-Men was good, real good. X2 was also good with some parts of humor. X3 is real disappointing. It is filled with odd blocks of unexplained parts. Like how Scot dies ?? And whats so important with Angel ? And what was the history of the child ?? All these questions pop up and they are left unexplained. this will lead you to believe that the director would have sense to finish off the trilogy covering all ends, obviously he doesn't. I will not comment on the story, since the plot on IMDb tells it all, but really this movie stinks. Out of the blue Jean Grey appears all good and fine. I mean how come one could live for more than six months under water even if that person is a mutant ?? I am quite surprised to see this movie getting a 7.9. Really shocking. Saw DaVinci Code the same day and really loved that. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are superb. Especially Hugh Jackman, from start to finish he sets the tone of the movie. He sets the tone of the entire trilogy, come to think of it, cos he is the principle character in all of them. Ian McKellen is also brilliant, Rebecca Romijin Stamos in her small role is also charismatic as ever. Anne Pacquin is wasted, in her small miserable role. Halle Berry was also pretty decent. This movie features loads of new mutants but we miss a few of the old ones. Plus the movie goes on to feature a few mutants who never feature in the comics. May be Stan lee is thinking of adding new characters in his series. Gambon, who was thought to make an appearance in this movie earlier has been cut off, it would have been nice to see his charismatic dark side. Toad, Nightcrawler, all are missing.This movie just turns out to be yet another lame action flick. I would certainly not recommend anyone watching it. A pathetic effort to end the wonderful story.A poorly deserved 6/10...",X-Men - The Last Stand
273,Movieguy_blogs_com,"This movie was good, but a little disappointing",8,24 May 2006,"In 'X-Men: The Last Stand' a 'cure' has been developed to inhibit the x-gene that causes mutations in Homo sapiens. This, in essence has the ability to turn Homo superiors (mutants) into Homo sapiens. The development in this inhibitor all hinges on extracting it from the mutant Leech (Cameron Bright). While some mutants are encouraged by the 'cure', most are not. Magneto (Ian McKellen) is dead set on destroying it by any means necessary. Right or wrong, the X-men have to stop him before he unleashes his army.This movie was good, but a little disappointing. I like that we get a glimpse of the Sentinels. They take some artistic license with the comic plot line, which is to be expected, but they did a lot of things I did not like. There are casualties (I am not going to say who) that make no sense and some of the character portrayals were also disappointing.Most did really well. I really liked Storm (Halle Berry), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), and Beast (Kelsey Grammar). I did not like Rouge (Anna Paquin), Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Callisto (Dania Ramirez), and Phoenix (Famke Janssen). This film has been promoting the emergence of the Phoenix, yet she really does not do anything.",X-Men - The Last Stand
274,twpain,Ok but it is entertaining,6,7 June 2020,The movie itself surely isn't the greatest. The ever expanding brotherhood doesn't work very well with this film. Juggernauts performance is really disappointing comparing him to the comics. There is a lot of cheesy dialogue and some of the characters feel out of place. Although this is a pretty problematic film it's still has some good entertainment with fast paced action sequences and some not bad acting although it comes across as cheesy.,X-Men - The Last Stand
275,Sfpsycho415,Don't believe the Ratner haters! X3 might be the best mutant-fest yet!----8/10,8,31 May 2006,"While most people will have you believe that X3 is crap compared based on the fact the Brett Ratner isn't as universally praised as Bryan Singer (director of the first two X movies and The Usual Suspects), i can tell you the Ratner's kinetic and fast-paced style makes ""The Last Stand"" a little different but just as good as the other X-Men films. I had heard of all the reasons TLS was getting negative buzz. Let's go through a few of them and i'll tell you what i think (if you care):-Too many mutants, not enough depth- I thought all the mutants was a good thing. Many appearances and they all got some action. The only real thing you need to know about the characters is who's side their on and what their power is. If everyone of them had a backstory, the film would clock in at about 5 and half hours.-Bad acting, writing, and directing- This movie has the same actors who give the same great performances they always did, especially the great team of Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart. The writing is smart and funny like always. The action is done well, especially the huge final battle.You have a destroyed Golden Gate Bridge, flying and flaming cars, needle shooting grenade launchers, and a huge swinging blue furball. Some dramatic scenes hit all the emotional targets. There were some cheesy moments, but it's a comic book movie.-Some characters die- So? That makes it exciting. You don't know who is gonna drop next.-Lame ending- Are you serious? The ending with Magneto is the best ending of the year, signifying that all is not back to ""normal"". And stay tuned after the credits, for one of the best epilogues ever.Sorry, i'm not seeing what people are complaining about. If Bryan Singer directed this movie the exact same way there would be no complaints. Brett Ratner knows how to make entertaining movies (Rush Hour, Red Dragon) and people need to get off his back. (By the way Brett, i'll pretend like After the Sunset never existed.)Catch the movie in theaters, forget what you heard, and enjoy for yourself. 8/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
276,manicman84,not only solidly crafted but also wise,7,16 August 2006,"Since I haven't seen the previous two installments and am not a great buff of a X-men series, I have a lay view on the film and cannot say whether the pic works as a comic adaptation. However, I must admit that it certainly works as a movie. Existential dilemmas this film deals with are very interesting. The main theme is otherness and social reception of otherness. Can this otherness be called disease? Does society need mutants? What to do with them - 'cure' or not? These questions may provoke heated discussions after the screening. Furthermore, the film focuses more on breathtaking action sequences aided by professionally made special effects than on creating atmosphere, which seems to be a good idea as my attention was riveted throughout the flick. Brett Ratner's film is incredibly intense and fast-paced so you really shouldn't be bored. What also appeals to me is ingenuity which mainly covers the use of superpowers. The biggest shortcoming of the film is its episodic character. Director applies too many threads and most of them is underdeveloped and seems only just mentioned. Ratner should have resigned from some of them and developed thoroughly the crucial ones like Pheonix struggle for being herself. Some character's potential also regrettably remains unused. To sum up, I recommend X-Men: The Last Stand because it's a piece of solid, wise entertainment.",X-Men - The Last Stand
277,sinncross,X-treme is not thy name...,6,27 July 2006,"What is believed to be the final X-Men appearance, X-Men: The Last Stand, brings the best of the first two incarnations, adds some politics, loses some characters, and becomes the best in the trilogy. However, it is by no means, an awesome movie.The Last Stand kicks off soon after the events of X-Men 2. The most important thing to know is that Jean Grey is dead. At this stage, a 'cure' for mutants has been discovered. It suppresses the mutant DNA, and effectively allows all mutants to become normal. However, Magneto will have none of that, and he, along with the Brotherhood, will do anything to stop this cure. The X-Men need to stop Magneto, however, the sudden appearance of a new mutant, adds to the boiling point tension.The story is straight forward, and it is played out simply. Following in the footsteps of the recent hit, V for Vendetta, The Last Stand uses politics as a story-median, and while it sounds strange for this to happen, it is perhaps the best story decision. Being a more mutant-acceptable country, the USA president has nothing against mutants, but he still fears the power they possess. It all becomes very interesting, yet the mutants themselves are a let down.Firstly, Wolverine isn't as focused on, like the previous, but he's still the main protagonist. He is an effective character; likewise Storm, Magneto and Xavier, yet the rest are all rather limitless. Angel, Cyclops and Rogue are all used to further the story, but do absolutely nothing of relevance with their powers. The much hyped Juggernaut is a great addition, and his battle with Wolverine is great, but beyond that, he doesn't do anything that you would expect of a villain. This is easily the problem of X-Men: The Last Stand. There are too many mutants, that not enough time is given to individuals, except Wolverine, to allow them to grow, or even seem cool.However, that is just nitpicking on my part, because as a whole, X-Men: The Last Stand, is a very good movie. It's fast, fun, entertaining, though lacking the focus of the first two. It's not at all brilliant, but still entertaining.",X-Men - The Last Stand
278,paulo20,A mess,1,25 January 2009,"Hard to fathom how this scored a 7. It's also hard to say which is worse, SPIDER-MAN 3 or this turkey. I'll call it about even. Both feature shoddy plots and poor characterizations with dubious motivations.The most egregious example in X-MEN 3 is the Jean/Grey Phoenix character. Jean Grey died in the 2nd movie and is reincarnated here as the Phoenix? Why? Because it happens in the comics, I guess. But what's missing from the comics is the story behind it all. I'll admit, I missed the first 20 minutes of this movie so I missed the actual resurrection but I somehow doubt I missed enough that it would have made any sense in this movie. Killing Cyclops and the Professor sure didn't make any sense. In short, the idea of the Phoenix is poorly realized here (for starters, the Phoenix-Force manifested itself as a bird of fire, not some sort of bug-eyed vampire queen). The filmmakers simply have no idea what to do with it. At the end, the solution is for Wolverine to stab her. Yay. (As a brief aside, Wolverine, it seems, is the only one who can approach the Phoenix because, while she is able to disintegrate everyone else, she can't do the same to Wolverine because he can instantly heal any damage done to him? How does this work exactly? Where does he get the biological material to patch up such terrible injuries? Is it magic?) Other characters hardly register. The new characters are just there, though admittedly there isn't enough time to develop their characters. But the established characters hardly fare any better.I'd like to comment about the look of the film. The effects are nice but I'm finding less and less reason to give a movie good marks because of them. Good effects should be a given. Of course, so should a good story but I would suggest maybe it's not as easy to craft a good story as it is good effects.Anyway, the characters all wear fancy leather uniforms in these movies because, supposedly, ""spandex"" would look stupid on film. But the movie outfits look stupid in their own right, with a few arguable exceptions, and lack the pizazz of the comics. Magneto looks sillier than most, certainly a ways sillier than his comic book counterpart, and would look silliest of all if it weren't for the film's Juggernaut character. I mean, were they serious about this? Did they really think this is an improvement over the comic depiction? I'm beginning to believe that it's not the comic book costumes that look silly, it's the filmmakers' inability to bring them properly to life. So we end up with these ugly ""leather"" uniforms. Blah. Meanwhile, Wolverine's hair looks atrocious. Storm's hair is actually an improvement over the banged wig but it's still not a style that works for the character. Lastly, I was never much of a fan of the casting in any of these films. Magneto, for instance, was never a wrinkled, joweled old man in the comics.Anyway, to sum up, the movie lacks in just about every area except special effects but so what? I can only hope this really was the ""Last Stand.""",X-Men - The Last Stand
279,TexasRedge,Xremely good ....... the best of the 3 movies,8,27 February 2007,The first X-Men movie was just okay (so-so)The second X-Men movie was really-really goodBut the third X-Men movie was the best of the series.These movie kept getting better with each new one that they made. Usually it works the other way around. X3 was great. I was however surprised when some of the main characters were killed off early in the movie. ::::::::spoiler alert:::::::::: Dr. Jean Grey has been resurrected from the dead and now she has the personality of the Pheonix spirit that has taken over her personality. In other words she becomes evil. and Megneto and his band of outlaw the Mutants rally around her and create chaos. and its up to the last remaining/surviving X-Men to stop her. this movie is way better than either of its prequels ... this movie is great.

280,Gambitt,"An entertaining chapter, but clearly the weakest",5,29 May 2006,"What if a ""cure"" was developed that could permanently remove mutant defects and enhancements? What if we could all fix perceived flaws and differences through modern medicine? And what if a fresh director took over the reigns of the X-men franchise? In X-men: The Last Stand, we at least get an answer to the last question.It's nice to let a new director tackle the franchise, but Rattner clearly cannot create the same polished product that Singer could. The most important part, the plot, is not outright bad. It presents some interesting questions but doesn't delve any deeper into further discussion.But its presentation, execution, and resolution are unorganized and overly broad. The movie tries to net in many new characters, including four new core X-men; and yet, most of the dialog remains focused on mainstays Wolverine and Storm. The obvious result is a lack of characterization that makes it hard to identify with the newer characters. It's important that the makers shift towards these newer, younger characters; I assume they will play more critical roles in upcoming X-men movies as the traditional actors move on to other projects.The movie also suffers from too many ""earth-shattering"" events. In X-men 2, one major character was killed off. In X-men 3, three major characters were killed off and three others had their powers ""nullified."" So in X-men 4 (and there WILL be an X-men 4), the writers will have to think of a way to undo this mess, reviving and re-energizing characters in precisely the manner that robbed comic books of their credibility through 20 years of silly explanations involving aliens, robots, magic, clones, demons and other absurd plot devices. In short, the franchise cannot sustain this rate of radical upheaval.""The Last Stand"" DOES have plenty of action. This was actually one of my only complaints with the first two; the action was lacking and seemed a bit mundane at times. I'm glad that Rattner exploits the action potential of the X-men, but several scenes couldn't help coming off as excessive while others were outright corny or low-rent. There were of course disappointments and lost opportunities, but I concede that they can't please everyone.Finally, the movie had noticeably poor editing and pacing. The movie frequently felt choppy, and some scenes seemed out of place or contributed nothing. The characters had some poor lines, and many were completely mischaracterized or had their integrity butchered in order to advance a few silly side-plots.I realize my opinion is swayed by my comic-book background and I grant the movie makers their creative leeway. But we comic book fans are VERY protective of our superheroes. We do NOT want our comic-based movies to be reduced to Hollywood drivel as in the past. Certain creative masterminds have worked very hard to earn respect for superhero movies among mainstream audiences. And maybe that is why comic-book fans are spooked by ""The Last Stand"": it is without a doubt one step closer to the inane senselessness of the reviled ""Batman and Robin."" ""The Last Stand"" shows hints towards losing the balance and self-restraint against the over-excessive bizarreness in comic books, much like the Phoenix power itself.",X-Men - The Last Stand
281,Soysoy,210'000'000 dollars and they stick to the 100mn format? What a waste!,6,23 November 2006,"In a way it was a pleasant surprise as I was honestly expecting far worse than this. The movie is somewhat coherent and the direction is competent (the biggest surprise). Even Berry seems to act this time... she must have been taking lessons. *LOL*OK there are many Hollywood clichés (the graveyard scene being the worst) but what do you expect from a blockbuster? Thrills. And thrills are present in fair amounts. Rather enjoyable if you're not expecting some life-altering experience. I particularly liked the ""Magneto vs Trucks"" sequence, and the bridge re-location is funny.Now what have they done with it. It's obvious that many scenes were left out, or shortened beyond all reason. For some reason the producers decided to stick with the 100mn format and when you've spent such an insane budget, I think it's kinda dumb. Even more so since there are so many new characters, and they insisted in fitting in some sub-plots that are extremely under-developed (Angel, Rogue/Iceman relationship, Mystique's transformation..), better have left it out entirely if you ask me, or give us a full 120/130 minutes movie with a better development of these elements.Also just like in ""Revenge of the Sith"", we have a key character ""turning to the dark side"" for no believable reasons. Phoenix is supposed to be ""all joy and rage"", yes we get it that she's dangerous and all-powerful, but it's never clear why she quietly follows - and OBEYS - Magneto! What are her motivations to follow Magneto's agenda instead of having her own? Sounds rather contrived.Besides, has anyone noticed that funnily, the Phoenix presented is not the one in the comics (a star-eater endangering the whole solar system, or even the universe) but is more or less exactly ""bad"" Willow from Buffy the Vampire slayer, season 6, including the eyes color shifts, the veins on the face and the ""love as taming"" ending device? *LOL* There is some good material in here, too bad they messed with it. It's just a walk through more or less good scenes, not a movie with a flow. At least, it doesn't look like a video-clip like most action movies recently. Maybe they're holding an extended version for cynical commercial reasons...",X-Men - The Last Stand
282,the_Poppuns,It turned out pretty good.,7,26 May 2006,"I liked Bryan Singer before I knew he'd be doing the X-men movies and I really enjoyed what he did with them, especially X2. I think he's a great director. Brett Ratner not so much. And when I heard he'd be taking over for X3 I thought that was pretty bad news. Well he did okay. I mean there are definitely style differences but all in all he got the job done.I like the X-men. I never really read comic books. But I watched the Saturday morning cartoons from the 90s. This movie I actually thought was more like those cartoons than the first two films. This was basically an action movie. The dialogue was sort of stilted because it was just meant to get the most basic of information in between action scenes. That's fine. Everything doesn't have to be Shakespeare. I know where all the complaints come in and I'm going to address those with massive spoilers.The deaths. A lot of complaints have been going around about the deaths in this movie and what the cure did and didn't do but I don't understand why. What was done in this film creates no irreparable damage. Is Scott dead? I don't know I never saw a body. Xavier was kinda dead but not really. Jean Grey might be dead but is the Phoenix? Magneto wasn't entirely cured, which Rogue may not have been either. The scene with Beast and the cure kid, forgot who he was, showed that the minute he got away from him his Beastness came back. Well maybe that means that the cure doesn't last for very long. So whether you like what happened in this movie or not X4 could just reset the whole thing.There were some things in the movie I didn't get at first, but then when you think about it for a minute it does make sense.One example is why Jean looked like a corpse but then I realized she sort of was one. And the Sentinels only being heads in the Danger Room seemed to bother some but I mean they can always come back later. I think the problem is the title of this movie. It's making everyone think it's the last movie when once you see it it really doesn't seem that way. So if you think of everything that happens in this as something in the middle of a series it won't seem as serious as the events of the ""last"" X-men movie.Other than that I thought the movie was pretty good, the acting wasn't that great and I'm going to guess that it had to do with the change in direction. It was a short movie and it was entertaining but it's no character study. The action sequences are pretty cool. I don't even know why Wolverine starts with Magneto. But I really like the scene with him and Jean at the end. I thought the Juggernaut/Kitty Pride thing was cute. Um, Storm will the eyeballs and the spinning reminded me of Linda Blair a little bit. Beast I liked a lot. I never would have picked Kelsey Grammar for the role but he was perfect. The story itself was fine. I had no problem with it. Once you have the idea of a cure I think things pretty much had to go the way they did. The same thing could be said for Jean Grey and everything that she did. It really makes sense when you think about it. But their president might be a little worse than ours. I think most people who like the first two movies should like it, but maybe fans of the comic books will be able to find too much fault with it to enjoy it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
283,eamon-hennedy,Surprisingly x-cellent.,8,3 November 2007,"Having had the director of the first, highly terrific installments replaced by a man whose biggest hits include Jackie Chan/Chris Tucker comedies, it would be easy to get cold feet over whether or not the third installment of the X Men series could hold sway and keep the quality control over one and two in place. I am pleased to report that it does, but it isn't without its faults though. First of all the obvious has to go out of the way, Ratner does a terrific job as director. Although I would have liked to have seen Bryan Singer come back, although to be fair it would have deprived us of a terrific comeback for the Man of Steel, Ratner does do a better job than his 'rent a hack' reputation would have prepared your for. He stages the action sequences terrifically well and the film rattles along at a great pace (from my recollection I think the film runs under two hours, a rarity for a lot of today's blockbusters). If there are two flaws I can point out at with him, it would be that he does lack some of the visual prowess of Singer, who would do some innovative, almost comic book like tricks with the camera and being a director who specializes in somewhat more conventional action pictures, he seems more interested in blowing things up quite spectacularly than mixing in the subtext, something X Men's one and two did so well, although there are hints that Magneto is being compared to the terrorist threat that is present in the real world (a news report of Magneto on a home video reading from a statement seems influenced from similar videos made by Bin Laden).As always the performances from everyone are superb, added gravitas coming from Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart as always and Hugh Jackman, as always, is great fun as Wolverine, mixing tongue in cheek humour, sarcasm, bitterness and a softness that marks him out as a superb talent. Halle Berry gets more to do as Storm, although she is somewhat overtaken on screen by the three leading men whilst Famke Janssen is mesmerizing as the darker, more psychotic Jean Grey. It's this plot line that really impresses, possibly more so than the mutant cure strand of the story that is really the main thrust of the plot. Whilst the latter wields some of the cod-political and ethical dilemmas that are the bread and butter of the series, whilst also furthering the action sequences culminating in a quite spectacular conclusion on Alcatraz, it is the Phoenix story that audiences and fans will find their hearts in more. Originally set to be the main story when Singer was developing the script, it takes a back seat to the cure strand, but it does hold the attention throughout. Janssen is terrific when playing it in a psychotic manner, anyone who has seen Goldeneye or her terrific turn in Nip/Tuck will testify, but mixing it in with a the broken personality of Jean gives the film more pathos than is really hinted at and impacts greatly on one of the most devastating scenes in the film which sees a long standing character killed off.Other characters and performers are not quite so lucky. Rogue, despite a great angle being taken with the mutant cure story line through her character, is effectively written out halfway through the film before resurfacing two minutes before the credits roll. Likewise Mystique and Cyclops, wasting the talents of Marsden, whose never had much to do anyway, and Stamos, who along with Ian McKellan with films one and two, has always ran away with the show. It all builds to a satisfyingly action packed and emotional climax, the film overall is great fun and terrific. It may lack the subtleties and sub-text that Singer brought to it before, but in my estimation it could have been worse and to my surprise it ended up being a lot better than I thought it would be.",X-Men - The Last Stand
284,Joejoesan,Where is Bryan Singer when you need him?,7,16 May 2006,"X-Men 3: The Last Stand is indeed the last chapter in the X-Men saga. That's pretty much the conclusion when you've seen the film. I guess we must be glad that there will be no part 4, because director Brett Ratner came pretty close to destroying the whole X-Men movie franchise. I guess everybody knows the story of The Last Stand. Jean Grey comes back from the dead and turns evil. In the meantime scientists have found a way to destroy the X-gene that turns humans into mutants. In other words: mutants can be cured. Let us begin with the good news. The action scenes in The Last Stand are great. Storm and Beast get a lot of screen time (and Halle looks gorgeous!) and there's one great scene in the middle of the movie in which an important character dies. Wow! The man doesn't just die. He gets crucified! And we're not talking extra's here, it's freaking ******! The bad news then. The music is awful. Looks like it was taken from a bad direct-to-DVD horrorflick. The dialogs are bad. The Dark Phoenix doesn't do a lot until the finale of the movie. And all the people that we learned to love (and hate) make an unworthy exit. Didn't Rattner have more respect for our X-Men heroes? Bryan Singer succeeded in turning the X-Men story into more than just an action movie. How we miss his sense of the characters and vision on this universe. The finale was okay though and the whole experience was - let's say - entertaining. So I give this a 7 out of 10.January 2013 - Been watching the extended fanedit by ADigitalman. This actually works a lot better although all the main criticism remains: the music is so wrong. Bryan Singer would have turned this one into an great epic movie. Unfortunately he did Superman. What a shame. Still looking forward to Days of Future Past though!",X-Men - The Last Stand
285,walken_on_sunshine,X-Men: The Last Stand:The Doc's Review,8,30 May 2006,"X-men 3 is the most fast paced and most fun of the trilogy.The storyline is very political and involves a lot of metaphors including racism,homosexuality,dictatorship,democracy,and prejudice.The separate story lines for each character were great however Archangel is a very brief but important character.Beast,Leech,Juggernaut,Spyke,Multiple Man,Archangel,and many others are among the new mutants featured in the third installment.The Phoenix storyline was by far the best one and had a lot of great build up and at times reminded me of an exorcism.X-Men 3 is as far away from the crap o meter as Sin City because both are intensely faithful adaptations of my favorite comics.X-Men 3 is also packed with amazing special effects that blow your mind.I was waiting for the all out mutant war and it did not disappoint it was absolutely amazing.The costumes,lighting,sound are all as good as it gets as the X-Men franchise proves it doesn't need Brian Singer in order to be successful.X-Men 3 is a must see if you liked the first two you'll love this.It is X-Fan heaven.",X-Men - The Last Stand
286,badgrrlkane,Why? Why didn't they just stick with the original storyline.They changed so much.,4,29 May 2006,"The movie is okay why the first rocked! And since it's supposed to be the final X-Men film,I guess they felt they had to throw in as much storyline as they could & in the process they added Hollywood storyline instead of keeping it true to the comic storyline. I mean killing Cyclops, & Professor X? Last, I saw their still around. And then curing Magneto & Mystique of their powers? Last time I read a comic they were still mutants. Then making Leech a boy instead of a green mutant & totally ignoring the fact that he is a Morlock & not mentioning Callisto as the leader of the Morlocks, it just sucks! Cool they used Angel & Colossus & Kitty Pride?Shadowcat but Juggernanunt was a joke, as he didn't look like the Juggernaunt from the comics or the cartoon & then when he walks by Charles Xavier & there's no recognition as for freakin sake it's his half-brother???!@!!! Boo,Brett Ratner stick to making Chris Tucker & Jackie Chan movies. I wasn't impressed. And then to totally ruin the whole Phoenix/Jean Grey/ Dark Phoenix storyline. It's like making a movie about the Bible & then changing the story to fit Hollywoods needs. Not as impressive as I hoped. Too bad fans of the X-Men comics who don't know the storyline will think this is how it all went down. ** out of *****",X-Men - The Last Stand
287,TEAQUIEMORO,Very Sad,10,1 June 2006,"When I heard about X-Men 3 I thought this may not be good because I saw 1 and 2,it was not that interesting to me.But I heard that they said Professer Xavier was going to die in this movie and I was surprised.So I went to see it and I was amazed of all that hard work and let me tell you that was the best X-Men part that I have seen.All was non-stop action and seeing more and better character in each part,but this was the best.And the seen that surprised us all was the death of Xavier,and Cyclops.And all the gangs of the brotherhood of mutants and what will happen to Mystique in the next part and to Magnet's power.And ever since I saw this I know there is going to be more parts to the X-Men.And to tell you something is see the end of X-Men after all the credits,there will be a big surprise when you'll watch it,and to find out you got to get the tickets before they will ran out of.Then you will never know what happens,and once again go see the next X-Men,it will answer all your questions and mine,can't wait to see it on the big screen again.",X-Men - The Last Stand
288,jantoniou,"Spectacular, but thin and horribly rushed",6,11 June 2006,"Sorry, Ratner, not nearly as good as the first two. You couldn't spit-shine Singer's tap shoes.That's the short review if you need it.Ratner, best known for the entire ""Rush Hour"" series, has about as much respect for the X-Men comics as an African bushman would. That is to say--none.Don't get me wrong--Ratner's a capable director here. He capably manages a huge (HUGE) cast of leads and extras. Spectacular action sequences abound. These are not the problem. These are the symptoms of the problem.The problem is he doesn't care about the material. The skeleton of the plot is actually quite good--mutants can suddenly be ""cured"" by another mutant who neutralizes mutant powers. Get near freak boy and, bam, your power is gone. They plug the keg tap into his DNA to make a new drug which will likewise neutralize mutant powers. Pretty cool.OK so naturally Magneto freaks and decides to start a war. OK, cool, so far I'm on board. Things are shaping up nicely.While the setup isn't bad, X3 bounces around like a pinball for the next 2 acts. Dozens of new mutants are thrown at you and none are developed as real characters. Ratner decides 'thin is in' and just throws a bunch of very good but unfulfilling action sequences at you. Unfulfilling because you don't really care about the good guys or even find a bad guy to like. The best sequence is when Jean Grey--nee Dark Phoenix--does her thing. Pretty darn good and amazing. In comparison the final climactic sequence is rather poor and very very hard to believe.Singer, by contrast, was downright leisurely in character development. He always brought you around to either loving--or hating--the character and for a good reason. He respected the X-Men and made two great ""X"" movies.With the ""Rush Hour"" series Ratner had two built-in characters already--Tucker and Chan. No development was necessary. Write a basic story, plot, let Tucker wise-crack for 90 minutes and let Chan do his chop socky while butchering his Ls and Rs and we're good to go.With X3, Ratner clearly feels he has the same: ""built-in"" characters (ie. those from the comics, who will have a huge back story). But it doesn't work that way. With the exception of Storm, Wolverine, Magneto, and Xavier there are no ""built-in"" characters in this movie. Rather, there's just a parade of mutants across the screen. And even the best developed characters feel thinly worked in this movie, Wolverine--a super Jackman--perhaps being the exception.I want to like this movie, since I love the X-men series, but if this the end it's not ending on a high note. Yes, the action is excellent but I'm always wary of recommending any movie based solely on how well they've generated action sequences. It still has to have meaty characters and story.",X-Men - The Last Stand
289,lee_a_scott,Not as bad as you've read!,7,7 October 2006,"As soon as Bryan Singer jumped ship from X3, many critics seemed to start sharpening their claws, and I have read many less than flattering reviews of this film. What I cannot figure out, though, is why? It really is perfectly enjoyable, with surprises, good new additions (Beast is spot on) and well-executed set pieces. Is it as good as the first two films? Well, maybe not. Does Brett Ratner have a great track record? Well, maybe not. But is this, however, a terrible film? Not by a long shot. It is a bit muddled, which is hardly surprising with the merry-go-round of directors attached and the script seemingly based around who the biggest stars were at the time, but I think it is a worthwhile addition to the franchise and hope that Marvel decide to go for an X4.",X-Men - The Last Stand
290,crowrobot,"While it definitely needs some improvement, ""The Last Stand"" is a fitting and enjoyable end to the ""X-Men"" film series.",8,4 June 2006,"The amount of trouble, ill will, and internet fanboy ranting that has followed the production of the 3rd X-Men movie could probably fill an entire book. Director Brett Ratner ('Rush Hour') has been cast as a villain right from the start, but I'm glad to say 'X-Men: The Last Stand' is not the disaster anticipated by the aforementioned internet ranting. That being said, it definitely needs some improvement, but it's not a bad film.Right from the start, Ratner makes it clear he's putting his stamp on the franchise. The final X-Men movie lacks the precision and nuance that Singer brought to the series, and some of the ""drama"" in 'Last Stand' has the subtlety of a kick to the groin, notably the whole ""nothing's wrong with us"" gay subtext. This doesn't destroy the film, but I wish Ratner hadn't rushed so much to get the film cracking. And boy, does it get cracking.When the movie finally kicks into overdrive, the results are magnificent. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) stabs people, Beast (a magnificent Kelsey Grammar) flips around like a monkey, Storm (Halle Berry) fries people with lightning bolts, and Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) smashes through walls. This is what I paid for. One problem, though: There are simply too many characters. A *lot* of new characters are introduced in this movie, and too many of them get not enough to do. My mind boggles at what the movie could do with characters like Angel (Ben Foster), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), and Multiple Man (Eric Dane). Instead, we get far too much of lame people like Callisto (Dania Ramirez), and her brood of punk mutants. Huh? What's up with these guys? They're lamer than Toad from the first movie! Despite these complaints, 'The Last Stand' is still darn enjoyable, and it makes up for its lack of subtlety in drama with its lack of subtlety in ACTION.",X-Men - The Last Stand
291,cwrdlylyn,X-MEN - THE LAST STAND : All The Action I've Been Waiting For Packaged Really Well!...,10,2 June 2006,"X-MEN : THE LAST STAND I have waited and waited since childhood for them to make X-MEN into a film franchise. As a kid, I collected the comic books, the collecting cards (with complete collections still perfectly organized in binders might I add), and the action figures... pretty much anything X-MEN I could get my hands on. I literally used to fall asleep trying to figure out what celebrity should play which character in a movie and hoping that one day I would get to see the story told on the big screen. Just a few years ago my dream came true (starring the man I always wanted for Professor X)... but only now has an X-MEN film fully captured what I was looking for on the big screen.On many levels, X2:X-MEN UNITED is the best film of the series. It creates a more socially important theme and utilizes it in telling the story with an emotional weight far deeper then those found in the original X-MEN and in the recent THE LAST STAND. However, X-MEN:THE LAST STAND offers up the one element that I always wanted to see more of on the big screen... mutants in an actual battle.While the first two films delved more deeply into the social element of X-MEN, they never fully captured the cinematic possibilities of having the mutants battle it out against one another in an all out war of their powers. Finally, I got what I was looking for in the thrilling final third of X-MEN:THE LAST STAND.X-MEN:THE LAST STAND acts as one big build-up to a climactic battle of mutants... however, it's filled with so many nods to the comic book, so much spectacle, tons of action, and quality performances that it still holds it's audience captivated. I will admit that the narrative of X2 far exceeds anything we see here, but call me a sucker for action scenes b/c nonetheless I was won over by THE LAST STAND. In the years since X2 ended, a cure has been developed that will supposedly rid mutants of their power. At first, the cure is offered up voluntarily to mutants looking to live a ""normal"" life. However, the simple existence of this cure shakes the balance of mutant-hood everywhere. Some secretly desire the cure, some are offended by the mere idea of it, and others believe it is nothing more than the first step in mutant extermination. Magneto (played by Ian McKellen) is the leader of those who believe it is the beginning of an extermination, and with the help of his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants he plans to attack and destroy all humans who look to stand in the way of mutant development.Meanwhile, he is aided by the help of a reborn Jean Grey (played by Famke Jansen)... now known as the Dark Pheonix. The Dark Pheonix is awoken from her slumber beneath the lake as the most powerful mutant on earth. Her powers are so strong they can't even be controlled by Professor X (played by Patrick Stewart) or the Pheonix herself. Along with her powers comes an evil nature completely unlike the Jean Grey the X-Men once knew, and now the Pheonix has sided with Magneto's Brotherhood against the X-Men.To tell the truth, the movie has so much plot going for it that it could have justified a running time far longer then the 1 hour and 40 minute running time it currently has. In addition to the above mentioned points, there is the introduction of Beast (played by Kelsey Grammar in an unconventional role), the introduction of Angel (played by Ben Foster, in a truly underused role), and many other mutants. With a longer running time, this film could have explored the cultural ramifications of mutants and the effects that has on their lives much more deeply... and perhaps that would have given the film even more of a resonance. As is the film works wonderfully as popcorn entertainment with just enough intelligence.What makes it better than the other films for me is the excitement of it all. Though I admired and enjoyed the other films and their focus on character over action... the X-MEN franchise needed a big jolt of action to show the potential these characters have. One of the best aspects of the film is the fact that the character of Storm (played very-well by Halle Berry) has finally been given ample screen time. Not only do we get to see her fly and actually fight hard, but we also get to see the character finally become the leader she always should have been. To add strength to the action scenes, Brett Ratner (who I will admit does not bring as much to the table as Bryan Singer did) manages to keep some focus on the relationships and dynamics between the X-Men and he keeps the film grounded somewhat even as it goes further and further into realms of implausibility.My overall opinion on the film is hard to put into a brief review. It was an experience where I got to watch something similar to what I've always pictured in my mind since childhood... and so clearly it kept my fully absorbed and invested the whole time. Sure, some of the plot developments (some of which are truly shocking) weren't my ideal choices in terms of the future of the series... and there were certainly plot holes and moments where I would be thinking ""why don't they just do this"". But bottom line, I loved the film.... A-...",X-Men - The Last Stand

You can bend the rules of comics, but you must not break them. Brett Rattner does not respect the X-Men Comics and so I hate it. I was not expecting much after I heard of the chaos, but even my low expectations were too high. If you do not know the comics, this movie might be by far better for you, but if you happen to like them, you are going to hate the movie.In contrast to X-Men 1 + 2 the actors are appearing exhausted and did not seem to have much motivation to make the movie. The movie uses brute force to touch my feelings, but it does not succeed at all. I always felt like cheated and the movie was surreal, because it was so far away from the comic novels.

This film doesn't go further in the investigation of Logans (Wolverine) past because instead it focuses on the bigger picture: the conflict between mankind and mutants. There has been a cure discovered and which causes the Brotherhood to react by wanting to destroy the cure and the source of the cure, but will the X-Men allow this to happen? Also the character focus shifts on Jean Grey who lets out her more ""wild"" side which is so cool. Many plot twists are seen in this film which are so cool. While the Bortherhood react quite badly to the cure the X-Men, whilst not happy with there being a cure since mutation is not a disease, try and stop the destruction the baddies intend to cause. There is a fresh feel to this film and I think it's been due to the fact there was a new director directing this film, Brett Ratner. I think it may be the best out of the franchise so far, not sure, but it's great anyway.",X-Men - The Last Stand
298,TimBoHannon,And X-Men Jumps the Shark,1,27 August 2009,"EXTREME SPOILERS FOLLOW! CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED! ""We are betraying the very principles upon which the Federation was founded,"" states Jean-Luc Picard in ""Star Trek: Insurrection, ""It's an attack upon its very soul."" That same statement applies to ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" ""Insurrection"" is based on the moral dilemma quoted above. Too bad ""The Last Stand"" features no conflict so compelling. Worse, it is not the characters who betray the X-Men concept, but the writers themselves.The protracted, somewhat convoluted ending, of ""X2"" has resulted in the most peaceful co-existence between humans and mutants to date. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar), a furry, blue mutant who can float in the air, presides over a new department in the President's (Josef Summer) cabinet. Magneto (Ian McKellen) has fled with his two associates and Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is flourishing. On the bad end, Cyclops (James Marsden) cannot recover from the death of his girlfriend and the day both Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto dread has arrived. Pharmaceutical leader Warren Worthington (Michael Murphy) has invented a permanent cure for mutations. This is not Kryptonite to Superman. Kryptonite works only at close range, and no mutant can boast Superman's invincibility.The supernatural abilities of otherwise normal people comprise the foundation of the entire X-Men world. Remove a skyscraper's foundation and it falls upon itself. These circumstances can be compelling if they are never more than a threat, but making it a mass-production weapon is like detonating charges inside the skyscraper's foundation. If there is another fictional series in which fans sit still for that, I will be surprised. Introducing the weapon on a minor mutant would not have been as bad, but making Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) the first victim deprives the audience of one of its favorites.""X2"" ended by setting up the Dark Phoenix story arc. Her inclusion is as serious a misstep as the cure weapon. Killing Cyclops in the first 10 meters of the sprint is bad enough, but the problem lies in the entire concept. Superman cannot be defeated without kryptonite, but it still takes work for him to defeat even the simplest foe. Defined as a ""Class 5,"" Phoenix (Famke Janssen) can defeat an army literally without moving a single muscle. It takes more than computer effects and mass destruction to entertain a mature audience. The NFL would not be popular if the quarterback could stand completely still and throw a touchdown pass every play. It would be incredibly boring. When a character can win with no effort, it ceases to be entertaining. The visuals are hardly special, either, despite the fact that ""The Last Stand"" cost more to make than the first two X-Men movies combined. The Phoenix destruction effects are similar to the Sandman effects in ""Spider-Man 3,"" but far inferior.Finally, killing Professor Xavier is an unforgivable sin. The manner in which he dies is nearly as disturbing. If he died saving the planet, or attaining a permanent peace, it would not be as bad. He dies in failure. From the popularity standpoint alone, that is like killing Q in the James Bond movies, Alfred in Batman, or Luke Skywalker or Yoda in Star Wars. What is the X-Men's home called? It is called Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Not Wolverine's school, nor Storm's, nor Iceman's. Professor X is credited second and first, respectively, in ""X-Men and ""X2."" Even though he is not a lone hero like Bond or Spider-Man, Xavier is the wheel around which all the other characters turn. The X-Men start disbanding after his death. From the importance standpoint, it is like killing James Bond himself and then giving his mission to 008. The writers try to undo their action by giving him a new body after the credits, but that just adds insult to injury. Xavier has been the same for over 40 years, and two rogue writers do not have the right to change him or be licentious with his life.Wolverine's healing factor is much different than before. In ""X-Men,"" it took several seconds for him to get back up after being ejected through a car windshield. Here, the Phoenix blasts him so badly that we can see parts of his skeleton. Losing flesh that quickly should be fatal even for him, but it takes about second for him to fully regenerate. The climactic action contains some neat ideas and sleek execution. However, the long awaited battle between Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) is about as unimaginative and juvenile as I've ever seen. I had better ideas when I was 12. Roger Ebert wrote in this review of ""X2"" that he imagined them standing in hot water. They should have consulted him before using the simplest concept that came to mind.""X-Men: The Last Stand"" suffered from a shortened production schedule, and it shows up in the lack of polish in the dialogue, the substandard nature of many action scenes, and the shallowness of some character development. Still, its enormous problems cannot be blamed on circumstance. I realize that the character of the Phoenix and the concept of the cure come from the comics, but not every idea in their hundreds of issues makes a good story. Even with that considered, killing Professor X and giving him a new body after the credits is the worst of many ways that ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" jumps the shark.",X-Men - The Last Stand

300,KillerLord,All out destructive and wonderful!,9,14 June 2009,"Finally, an X-Men movie without the Cerebro! Yes, this time, the director changed hands and he probably wondered to himself as to what he should do in this one. Brett Ratner definitely shows us that he can completely exploit the powers of the mutants to create an epic action movie. And boy oh boy, is Brett Ratner completely ruthless. He just does not care who dies in this one. For a change, we have a director who says that power in abundance is a power waiting to be heavily misused as history has always shown us. And this is what happens.Jean Grey returns in this installment but she is not the same anymore. She is now revealed to have dual form, the other one being Phoenix whose psychic powers can even rival those of Xavier and the worst part is that she does not have the one thing that power demands - control. And in a roll of fury, she destroys Xavier! So, Ratner destroys the most cool, composed character in the movie - Xavier. And now, when you begin to wonder that this should be something that Magneto is happy about, he is not. Ratner brings out a wonderful respect that Magneto always had for Xavier despite the bitter differences in their approach towards mutant rights and similar issues.The movie's central plot is about a certain drug that is developed using a gifted mutant. The drug is able to convert a mutant into a normal human being without all those wonderful powers. And needless to say, Magneto does not like it one bit and thus builds an army with the aim to destroy the lab where the drug is being developed and synthesized.And just like Ratner adopts a destructive path, I will in some sense destroy this movie in the comment by telling the all out destruction that Ratner does indeed cause in this movie. He ends the life of Cyclops. Mystique loses all her powers! The character who already died in X-2 dies again. And the two main masters of all mutants - both die! So, there is a hell lot of destruction in this movie. Lots of humans and mutants die! And I thought about it for sometime and realized that with so much power scattered around the world, the amount of destruction we saw in the previous two movies was quite less. So, I guess I am with Brett Ratner is his approach that if there is so much extraordinary power scattered all across the planet and the people who are possessing it are being abused, there is only one thing that is going to happen - heavy destruction.And heavy destruction is the one thing that this movie shows - an all out classic action. And the shades Ratner brings to the movie are amazing. A must-watch.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I am a huge X-Men fan and was reading earlier buzz about this film's shortcomings from other critics. I was very surprised at this film's quality. This film was very good especially for a third installment. I would venture to say this film was my favorite of the three, narrowly beating out X-Men United. I felt there would be a lot of confusion in tying in Magneto and Dark Phoenix but the story was very coherent. I also felt like Halle did a little better in this installment, considering better powers and better writing. The action scenes were great, especially in Jean's house. I was pleased to see them stay faithful to certain scenes in the Dark Phoenix Saga comic. The other ""bit-part"" mutants were not as annoying as I'd anticipated, as some of them actually were very impressive. I was very impressed with this film's ""shockers"" and unpredictability. Some things I definitely did not see coming. While not the perfect experience everyone hopes for, it was still well-made and should satisfy the X-Men fan base.

302,pootc,Not the finale we all wanted,6,11 June 2006,"Watching X- Men: The Last Stand there is certainly a sense of finality to it all, unfortunately though, it's just not the finale we all wanted. Brett Ratner did a great job - direction wise and the third act really heats up. The problem lies in the other two. There are some very cool scenes, and moments and this is the most epic and darkest of all three but something is missing in this instalment, it felt numb, void of any real emotion or consequential characters.It felt as if not all the pieces were there, characters just seemed to drop in and out all the time and even the deaths of the characters, especially the first one were all kind of humdrum. Basically, the film never really took off until the end and that was it's biggest letdown, it grew tired too early and did it's best to redeem in it's finale.Ian McKellen as usual excels as Magneto and as expected, finally snaps while Halle Berry does what she does well, nobody really cares about Storm. She's a secondary character at best and yet, in this she basically runs the show in X3. Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, although sorry to say it, he's lost his edge and just falls in line like the rest.Overall, the X-Men trilogy is suffice. This instalment didn't really hurt it, but then again it didn't do it any favours. Each instalment is decent in its own right, even good (I believe X-Men 2 edges them both) but if this does turn out to be the last stand then this series will never achieve greatness because so far we've had three above average movies - nothing more, nothing less.",X-Men - The Last Stand

305,powerfull_jedi,The weakest of the 3,6,30 May 2006,"Somehow I knew this movie would fail, the constant delays, the director shifts and cramming as many characters as possible. But after seeing the movie, I could finally see why it fails on absolutely every level. The movie takes place after the events of the previous X-men movie, where General Stryker and his goons were defeated by the X-men, but in the process Jean Grey sacrificed herself so the team could survive the tidal wave at Alkalai Lake. Now months later, a new cure has been discovered that could remove all the powers from mutants and Magneto's building an army to stop them,and top of that Jean Grey as returned from the dead but something hidden inside her has been unleashed, something terrifying and dangerous. The Last Stand fails to tell a good story(this one in particular full of plot holes such as no explanation for finding the mutant Leech, no explanation for Beast's absence from the team and Nightcrawler as well, no clue on how or not they had tested the cure), fails to connect with the characters, Wolverine is now an encoraging and warm teacher and his regenaration powers vary depending on the key scene of the movie, Xavier wells at him for no reason, Cyclops is just overly angsty and Magneto's still is old self, way too many characters that you never get properly introduced to. Angel really doesn't do anything in the movie. Despite being saddening, neither Xavier's and Cyclops presumed deaths are relevant to the story. The ""cure"" plot itself was utterly pointless, since we later find out it's only temporary(how didn't the researchers find this out, before going into major testing). Sloppy editing can be traced when it abruptly changes from daylight to night in just a few seconds. Bad effects don't help. A dissapoiting end to a great series.",X-Men - The Last Stand
306,mrspasm,Cosplay: The Last Party,1,14 September 2009,"X-Men: The Last Film is the last X-Men so far. It features more characters than ever before and all our old favourites such as Wolfer, Thundera, The Caper Wonder, Ice, Bust Face, Grape, Lee, Bowie, X, Mephisto, Cyclaps, Jean Reno, and of course Staples. Big bad guy Mr Magenta has assembled a horde of badness and is launching a final terrific attack against man. Only the X-Men can save the day but they know they will not all survive. As X's wife Abigail says: 'It's time, to make, yo stand!' This film has more excitements than all the other 2 films stuck agether. There are massive battle scenes to be seen, people punch each other with bridges, loads of people are killed, and there is lots of funny and good graphics. To celebrate the release of this film I was invited to a cosyplay party- a party where fans of a film or show all dress up as their favourite character. It turned into a huge event and people came dressed mostly as X-Menners but also as things from other things. I knew every chump in the galaxy would go as Wolfy, and all the women would go as Lara Craft, so I thought I would be special and go as a Tetris block- the L-Shape to be precise. I spent the night sliding into tight spaces and frequently getting stuck because the fit was so perfect. The firemen had to be called out several times but I wasn't bothered as I was racking up a huge imaginary score. There were people dressed up as Mario, Luigi, Giuseppe; some dressed up as Neon from The Matrix; some dressed up as Gunnels from Lord Of The Rings while others dressed up as Pat Butcher and Cilla Black. At the end of the night the whole thing descended into a terrible sight- think a cross between Society and Eyes Wide Shut. I managed to escape, but my bricks were ruined. Next time I go to one of these parties I will come prepared. I will go as Arnie and let off some Steam, dammit! Best Scene: When X has his head chopped off and rather than put it to waste, Wolverbean chucks it into a horde of bad guys knocking them into a pit of lava shouting 'Get ready for a surprise!'",X-Men - The Last Stand
307,ryanskywalker-87402,'In chess the pawns go first',6,1 March 2017,"Despite its myriad detractors, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is a robust superhero film that, while clearly suffering in comparison to its majestic predecessor, packs an entertaining wallop. Large-scale and bearing an exhilarating finale, this third chapter in the newly refreshed X-Men franchise rates as a polished and well-assembled comic book film.Therein, however, may lie the biggest issue with ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" While the Bryan Singer's ""X2"" was a sophisticated, operatic action film, Brett Ratner's ""...Last Stand"" is like an operetta culled straight from comic book pages. Broad and quippy, the film does not trust itself to regain the passionate, cinematic bombast of its immediate predecessor. It would rather be a more direct analog to its comic book source. Still, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is better than much of its paneled brethren.Attempting to intertwine two stories, the film weaves together parts of the famed ""Dark Phoenix"" saga with a b-story involving a cure for mutancy. Fans of the source material decried the plot for selling short the story of the world's most powerful mutant, and, while this criticism may be valid, the film does the best it can focusing on the dual stories. When it works, the plot compels, bearing broad themes of acceptance of one's own self and abilities.Even though it must maneuver through some admittedly misguided character beats, the cast is generally up to snuff. Hugh Jackman is given less to do here, but the addition of the charismatic Kelsey Grammar is welcome. The film's aesthetic combines steely blues and natural tones, making for a film that is mostly rich looking. There is a satisfying visual scope that makes the film feel big, enhancing its epic qualities. The film moves quickly, building to a satisfying and bone-jarring climax.What ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" comes down to is a tension between a script that lacks the shape and sharpness of a great superhero film and a cast and action beats befitting a great superhero film. In the end, the superficialities of the cast and epically entertaining stand- offs win out. Ratner's ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" may not have the heart and soul of its predecessors, but it has the flash and spectacle that makes forgiving it for what it lacks very easy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
308,jcallows,Weakest of the three but better than Fantastic Four,7,30 May 2006,"If you loved the first two X-Men films, you will not like this one. I walked into the theater not expecting much, knowing a new director had taken over. And I still walked out a little disappointed. I don't understand the high marks this film got. The special effects were great for sure but there was something missing. A story? A good script? Character development maybe? Anyway, with all the amazing special effects and a short running time, I still felt the movie dragged. There wasn't much suspense or mystery or emotional attachment to the characters, except to the ones that already had been developed in the previous films. There wasn't much reason for me to continue watching. Nothing new was added. When the film ended-- and it ended abruptly-- I was left with an empty feeling and wanted to say ""what the...?"" And what happened to the film score? It's non-existent! Too bad the series had to end this way. But at least we still have the first two films to enjoy.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I was almost certain that third can't be better than first or second one. How wrong was I.Storyline was very very interesting, first surprise. Second surprise was that effects were really enjoyable, kind of original style, no Matrix-copies or such. Third one... well lets just say that everything was enjoyable, interesting, not too stupid, had great moments and such.Even tough there were so much action and effects it wasn't boring, not just blow ups and kicks. In such a short movie it's so hard to get everything fit in without some mess. Somehow they did.I truly think this is best one of the series.

310,benjamin_lappin,The Notion of Prequels and Sequels In Hollywood Productions Suffers Its Greatest Setback,3,12 July 2006,"Going to this film with the notion it would be as tragic as it turned out to be, wasn't even being considered as I lined up to purchase my cinema ticket. The previous X-Men films rank along side the likes of the Spiderman films and Batman Begins, in terms of being effective multi-layered superhero/comic book adaptations without merely relying on the gratuitous action sequences. Alas this instalment ranks alongside the likes of Episode I as a severe disappointment.Where in the prior two thirds of this ""trilogy"" action was balanced with well thought out plot and character developmen,t cleverly utilising the original graphic novels, and while the notion of a cure is encapsulating, and indeed, plausible for the first minute segment, all is sacrificed into turning Wolverine into a ""last action hero"".Character development boils down to singular monosyllabical sentences of ripened clichés, as, all but, in turn the X-Men reveal their own personal appraisals of the ""cure"" situation, and that is all. Rogues relationship begun to blossom throughout the second trilogy, yet she chooses a strange path not befitting to her character, and we only have one single statement of intent as justification for such an act. Beast, whilst voiced amiably by Kelsey Grammar, enters from utter obscurity, as the mutants the audience grew attached and form links with in two are jettisoned for quick fix characters whose whole purpose for existence in the film is to provide ""different moves"".The love triangle is what bothered me more than all the films inept moments combined, as Scotts demise is hurried and non-sensical (i.e. Anakin - Episode III) leaving Wolverine as the sole proprietor of deeply emotive feelings directed toward Jean ala Phoenix. Cyclops was presented as a mere shadow of himself and utterly untrue to the graphic novels, however this surprisingly is the least of my concerns, seeing as the prior two have been loose adaptions, it is merely the manner in which everything is achieved in this film through gritted teeth. It forces what you do not wish to see down your throat, as you as an audience member, are forced to watch as piece by piece the trilogy defragments into dust and oblivion.While picking out specific moments in the film both positive or negative is somewhat taxing, the impression left on the viewer in the aftermath is what is noticed, and this indescribable feeling of disgust, resentment and regret consumes you whenever you try recalling the shambolic ending to a promising saga. It's enough to make you want to watch The Fantastic Four. Yes. X-Men 3 was really that bad.",X-Men - The Last Stand
311,LagerLagerLagerShouting,The Mix Still Isn't Right.,5,30 April 2008,"Although pretty enjoyable, this third instalment in the X-Men series suffers a similar fate to the first film, that of a rushed, underdeveloped flick with far too many characters to focus on and too many changes of pace. The second one was a lot longer and gave the characters a bit more time to develop, but was let down by an overloading of plot. This time the plot is toned down but the characters are two-dimensional and the dialogue is pretty poor in places. They can't seem to get the mix right. This is perhaps due in this case to original and sequel director Bryan Singer leaving production at the last minute to direct Superman Returns. He shouldn't have bothered, that film was bad. Anyway Brett Ratner provides a capable hand, but is let down by plot inconsistencies, cliché dialogue and too much jumping about, although the film, like the first two, does remain harmlessly entertaining.5/10",X-Men - The Last Stand

You can't blame Rather because he didn't make this project in a bubble. Multiple producers and reps from Marvel had a sat and input on it. Just like any other comic book project. The studio knew what the movie was months before it's release. So they are as much to blame if not more since they have all the power. It's just like the Fantastic Four reboot. They could have pushed the release date if they wanted to, but they thought they a quality project. I'm glad Dark Phoenix got pushed back. Hopefully, it's creator's saw room for improvement and did so. It may be last for a few major actors in the franchise, I hope they go out on a positive note.",X-Men - The Last Stand
314,Akira-36,Going back to the drawing board,6,13 June 2006,"The loss of director Bryan Singer affected X3 immensely. The great build-up and characterisations of X2 did not bear any fruits, as X3 lacks quality, consistency and coherent narration.Throughout the movie Brett Ratner's direction is sporadic, with high-octaned battle sequences and low in-betweens. It is clear from the start that he is uncomfortable or rather inexperienced in directing a fantasy/comics-based movie, as he couldn't decide if X3 should be a Prison Break drama, a Rush Hour comedy or an X-Men movie.The introductions of Angel and Jean Grey/Phoenix feel abrupt, while too much time is given to Iceman, Rogue and Kitty Pride love triangle. The wonderful Nightcrawler has completely disappeared from the movie, whilst the highly potential characters of Beast and Colossus are not given enough development time that merits their characters' importance on the comics.Furthermore, killing Cyclops and Professor X makes the latter half of the movie unbalanced and insubstantial. Professor X IS the core of the X-Men and the main reason the story even exists. By removing both vital characters, and undermining Storm's powerful persona, the leadership of the X-Men is then left to Wolverine. Wolvering is not and will never be a leader material. His personality is such that he is a cool darkhorse, an outsider or a vagabond. He is neither a teacher nor a leader, and it is the wrong direction to take the movie.The screenwriter also made the wrong choice of additional villains, although Juggernaut was fun to watch. Finally, the last stand at the Alcatraz Lab island feels more of a skirmish than a full blown war. Bring out the Sentinels in X4 and get rid of Brett Ratner, if there will ever be another sequel.",X-Men - The Last Stand

317,andrewnmiller,A once great franchise takes a serious nosedive.,7,30 April 2018,"Following the financial and critical success of X-men 2, Bryan Singer was keen on doing a third film that would conclude Jean Gray's transformation into the Dark Phoenix, unfortunately Fox CEO Tom Rothman would have none of it, given his hatred for comic book movies, Rothman sought to take over a year to hammer out a deal for Singer to direct the third movie while trying to micromanage the film as much as he could leading to a lot of stalling at Fox. Meanwhile, WB president Alan Horn was tempting Singer with the opportunity to work on Superman Returns for them which Singer agreed to and jumped ship on X-men 3 to go direct that movie instead which left Rothman shambling to find another director and eventually settling on Brett Ratner to direct and all the while rushing the production of the movie to meet its May 2006 release date.Now, I never saw X-men 3 in theaters in the summer of '06 given my disinterest in comic book movies at that time and given the backlash it revived upon its release from the fans, I stayed well away from it. However, in preparation for seeing Logan last year, I sat down to watch The Last Stand and after finishing the movie, I certainly didn't think it was as bad as some of the fans had made it out to because I definitely enjoyed aspects of it like the acting and the visual effects. However, I thought the story and characters left a lot to be desired. The movie opens with Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr meeting a young Jean Gray and invite her to join Xavier's school after being impressed with her powers. We then cut to 10 years later where a young boy named Warren Worthington is discovered to be a mutant and attempts to cut his wings off. We then cut to the present day where Worthington Labs has developed a vaccination that kills the X-gene and offers it to any mutant that wants it. While the cure appeals to some like Rouge, other mutants are alarmed by it which gives Magneto a reason to reform his Brotherhood of Mutants and oppose the cure. At the same time, Scott Summers is morning the loss of his fiancé, Jean Gray and travels to Alkali Lake where he sees Gray alive, but as they embrace, she kills him. Detecting trouble, Professor X spends Strom and Wolverine to investigate. Once they arrive, they find a lifeless Jean but no Scott. When the three return to the X-Mansion, Xavier explains that when gave her life to save the team, she unintentionally freed an alternative personality known as the Dark Phoenix which Professor X had helped her suppressed but, once the personality reasserts itself, Jean goes psychotic. Now, The X-men must stop Magneto and his Brotherhood from waging their war all while confronting and stopping The Dark Phoenix from unleashing her true power upon the world. Given that Bryan Singer was off making Superman Returns, the directing duties fall on Brett Ratner and while he is a decent director, the tone feels off-putting as the movie feels more like a generic summer action movie with superheroes in it rather than a smart, thought-provoking comic book movie that the first two were not to mention Ratner comes off as incompetent and uninspired, feeling more like a hired gun Rothman used just to make the movie as opposed to someone like Singer who actually cared about the story and characters. Meanwhile, screenwriters Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg, as well as Ratner, easily ignore or fail to address the many irritating plot threads in their own movie with one of the most blatant flaws being Xavier's death and while he certainly didn't deserve to get killed off, he absolutely brought it on himself. In spite of an incredibly weak dispute with Wolverine and hard-hitting yet flimsy allegations from Magneto, Charles never accepts any responsibility for his mistakes with Jean nor does he ever deal with any challenges and thus still imploring his pitiful protectiveness to a Jean Gray who is beyond saving at this point in the movie, he passes away with helpless determination and with no honor simply because he can't avoid his own arrogance and while his passing is heartbreaking, it would been so much better if Kinberg and Penn had made Professor X see the error of his ways. If Xavier's death wasn't stupid enough, his memorial and the following scenes are even worse. The memorial scene is short and mediocre while the very next scene has Hank McCoy suggesting that they close the school, an alternative Strom quickly dismisses. In the context of the moment, the viewer is supposed to feel enriched by this scene but instead feels deprived of what could be a powerful scene of the X-men mourning their fallen mentor and we are never able to truly feel the impact of Xavier's passing or to revel in his death but instead are just told that life will go on. Of course, if that wasn't moronic enough, even after watching Dark Phoenix kill his friend right in front of him, Magneto still carries out his plan even though Charles's death should have provoked him to at least rethink his whole agenda and while he doesn't take Charles's passing lightly, it still doesn't make any sense why he just decides to carry on with destroying the mutant cure nor does it make any sense why Juggernaut and Multiple Man just join Magneto's cause without even brothering to ask who he is or what his motivations are. Not to mention X-men 3 has some of the most incompetent writing I've ever seen in a superhero movie since Batman and Robin and it just makes me wonder how infinitely better the script could have been had Chris Claremont written it. As for the whole Dark Phoenix story arc, it's a complete and utter joke. Rather than have an alien consciousness process Jean, the writers, Ratner, and possibly Rothman decided to have it be a split personality in order to keep the tone of the movie more realistic which doesn't work at all as Gray returns with the powers of an insane demon rather than an invincible deity as well as it coming across as a severe misunderstanding of who Jean Gray is as a character. While her return is welcome, Jean is completely underused here and has absolutely no character and does nothing but stand around and to add insult to injury, she kills Cyclops approximately 10 minutes into the damn movie without any build-up. Now, I get that the movie isn't going to follow the comics note for note, but something that shouldn't have changed here is Jean's love for Scott and how it is though that that she is able to overpower the Phoenix Force and take her own life while in the movie, Jean just flat out kills Scott without giving it a second thought while when Wolverine tries to kill Jean in the comics, his love for her is what stops him from doing it yet in the film, the viewer is expected to be emotionally invested in the scene but given how Jean and Logan shared so little time together during all three X-men films and had no chemistry, it's impossible to feel anything for these two and even less then Wolverine does kill Jean which makes for a weak finale that lacks any strong emotional punches or moments. Thanks for that, Kinberg, Penn, and Ratner.Not only does the film feel the need to butcher one of the best X-men stories ever written but it also feels the need to throw so much into its 2 hour running time in order to try and please the fans but in doing that, the story and characters suffer as a vast majority of them aren't on screen long enough for the viewer to get to know or care about them. Much like what happened with Batman V Superman, Spiderman 3 and Amazing Spiderman 2, X-Men 3 becomes an overstuffed movie with too many subplots going on and not enough focus on the story at hand.  Rather than provide each hero and villain with at least some development or motivation, something Singer paid a lot of attention to on the first two films as did The Russo Brothers on Captain American: Civil War, Ratner and the writers feel the need to add in as many new mutants as possible without even trying to develop them as characters or their motivations as many of them are just in the movie for fan service rather than have any kind of importance to the overall story. Nightcrawler, one of the most intriguing characters in the film series, is absent from the movie with absolutely no explanation as to why he isn't there. Really, Kinberg and Penn, was an explanation for why Nightcrawler not being on the team anymore too much to provide?! Callisto is your stereotypical ghetto black woman with no personality, Multiple Man is completely useless as a character, Angel was focused on heavily in the marketing for the movie and was made out to be a big player but when he's in the actual movie, he does nothing, has no character and comes off as yet another pointless cameo for X-men fans to drool over. Rouge and Iceman have no development whatsoever here either as Rouge comes across as a wasted character who just wants to take the mutant cure so that Iceman will love her again which makes her out to be a self-pitying and selfish person rather than a fully fleshed out character. Iceman isn't really given much do ether, even if all the development that X-men 2 give him is still there as the writing makes him come across as a self-absorbed jerk who cheats on his girlfriend although he comes come into his own at the end of the move, it's sad to see such a great comic book hero like Iceman be given the treatment of not being able to really grow as a character due to incompetent directing and writing. As for Pyro, he's completely useless too and comes across as an arrogant know-it-all rather than a compelling villain and he doesn't even use his powers effectively, what a wasted opportunity. Mystique is completely wasted as well. Cyclops, who always seemed to get the short end of the stick in all three movies, is killed off ten minutes in with absolutely zero development or emotional impact which is made even more tragic because James Marsden was making Superman Returns at the same time so killing his character of",X-Men - The Last Stand

319,crazyrabbits,Early contender for best film of the summer...,8,28 May 2006,"Well, I just finished watching X-Men 3, and I quite enjoyed it. Even though there were a few problems I had with it, the sum is greater than the whole parts. Let me talk for a minute about what I thought was good and bad:Good parts:-Overall, I thought the acting in this film was great, especially Ian McKellan and Hugh Jackman, who really made you believe that they were conflicted about what they would do in the final battle sequence; I realize that it's not possible (in the case of The Dark Phoenix Saga) to translate a comic book series to the big screen, but I thought that the Phoenix subplot here was very well-done, and didn't go over-the-top, like some comics fans would have liked to seen; I liked the fact that the X-Men were working together AS A TEAM, rather than just all going off and doing their own thing; I quite liked how the Dark Phoenix character was portrayed, and I thought it was pretty damn awesome when she was breaking apart her own house in mid-air, and during the ending sequence when she tries to kill Wolverine; There were many incidents in this film that were direct references to the comics. The scene with Jean telling Scott to take his glasses off, the Danger Room and Sentinel sequence, the bridge scene, Hank reading up-side down, and even Logan stabbing Jean at the end come from the comic books; Incidents from the previous films resolve themselves here, including Rogue's wish to be human, the rivalry between Pyro and Bobby Drake, the acceptance of mutants in society, and Jean's relationship with Logan, which I thought was very well done; The effects in this film especially well done. Notable instances include the scene in the house between Magneto, Phoenix and Xavier, the Danger Room scene, and the ending, when Logan's skin is getting shredded as he makes his way towards Jean. Hell, we even get to see Bobby finally ice up!; and heck, I even thought the score for the film was amazing.Bad parts:A lot of characters got short-shifted in the film. I don't even know where Nightcrawler went. Mystique betrays her own friends when she gets de-powered, Angel (who shows up for all of 5 minutes), Colossus (who only exists to throw Wolverine at people and beat up soldiers), and Rogue show up in what is basically glorified cameos, because they hardly do anything. Cyclops is killed 15 minutes into the film, and numerous other supporting characters (Dr. Rao, Multiple Man, Warren Worthington, Arclight, Quills, and others) have almost no screen time whatsoever. It seems that a lot of mutants were just shoehorned into the plot en masse to get a reaction from viewers when they are killed off; I can't believe for one second that Magneto would just up and abandon Mystique after she lost her powers, after all they've been through together; The whole film just felt kind of rushed. I wish that it had been a half-hour longer, so all of the subplots could resolve themselves. As it stands, the film has a sense of closure, but some little things were unresolved; There were a few technical problems as well, such as the sky over Alcatraz suddenly changing from day to night within ten seconds, and being able to see where the Juggernaut would crash through before he hit the walls in the chase sequence with Kitty Pryde; Exactly what purpose did that Leech kid serve? He's a mutant, so I don't understand why Magneto would be trying to kill him.What many people have to realize is that this film is not adhered to any sort of comic continuity. Yes, it takes incidents from the comics, but it is NOT a direct adaptation of the comic books. I have been reading X-Men for years, and I wasn't offended at all by the changes to the characters.Bottom Line: I give this film an 8 out of 10. Overall, I thought it was a great film, and if the good reviews are any indication, then many of you folks will probably like it as well. Go see it now!",X-Men - The Last Stand
320,LadyLiberty,X-Men Doesn't Live Up to X-Pectations,4,28 May 2006,"In X-Men: The Last Stand, Dr. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) still runs his euphemistically named school. Some older mutants help him by teaching. Among the best and most gifted teachers are Storm (Halle Berry) and the volatile Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden) was once a competent teacher himself. But the death of his love, Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has devastated him.Neither Xavier nor Summers are able to get Grey off of their minds. Thinking his grief has him hearing her voice in his head, Summers runs off to Lake Alkali where Grey died. Xavier, however, fears there's more to Summers' actions than mere grief, and he sends Storm and Wolverine to check things out. By then, Summers has already discovered that Grey has somehow survived, and his joy is such that he doesn't stop to wonder how it is she lives, nor does he take notice of the fact that the woman he finds on the lake shore has changed.Meanwhile, pharmaceutical magnate Warren Worthington, II (Michael Murphy) has discovered a ""cure"" for mutancy. His inspiration for the discovery is his own mutant son, Warren Worthington, III (called Angel, and played by Ben Foster). The President of the United States (Josef Summer) advises that the ""cure"" is available on a voluntary basis for any who want it, and he enlists the aid of his Mutant Affairs Secretary, Dr. Hank McCoy (the Beast, played by Kelsey Grammar) to interact with the mutant community.At the same time, Xavier and his old friend turned enemy Eric Lensherr (better known as the evil Magneto, played by Ian McKellen) both try to talk to the resurrected Grey. Xavier wants to help her deal with her trauma, but Magneto wants to enlist her aid against those he believes would threaten all mutants. Grey, however, isn't inclined to listen to anyone or anything but the newly unleashed emotions in her head.No matter what Dr. McCoy says, there are more than a few mutants who believe the ""cure"" won't be voluntary for long. Among them is Magneto's longtime associate, Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and a mutant we've not seen on screen before, Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones). Their treatment at the hands of government authorities can only make others wonder just how legitimate the offer of a ""cure"" may be, and how voluntary any application will prove. Even if the ""cure"" is voluntary, many more resent the idea that mutancy is anything that requires a cure in the first place.Once again, we need to remember that this is a comic book brought to the big screen. It's not cerebral drama, nor is it witty comedy. It's pure action entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. In this case, though, I'm leaning toward the ""less."" Oh, the acting is fine, particularly on the parts of Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen. And the special effects are, as is to be expected, very, very good. It is, instead, the direction and the script that are lacking.Bryan Singer, who directed the first two X-Men films so ably, chose instead to helm the upcoming Superman Returns. Bret Ratner was tapped to direct The Last Stand in his place. Ratner was simply not up to the job. There was no particularly creative camera work which, in the company of very big effects, can be forgiven. What can't be let slide, are some slow and overtly obvious edits. Edits ought to add to the excitement and suspense; these were so badly managed they actually took significantly away from it.The scriptwriters also made some big mistakes. By packing so many new mutants into a single film, nobody got much screen time and character development suffered horribly. In the previous X-Men films, we enjoyed them in part because we empathized with or envied them. In this movie, we're very much on the sidelines and trying desperately to keep up with a story that hops everywhere because it seems incapable of settling anywhere. In fairness to Ratner, I'm not sure Singer could have managed this mess much better.If you're looking for a lot of special effects, and to incidentally revisit  briefly  some of your favorite X-Men characters, X-Men: The Last Stand won't be a waste of your time and money. But if you think this film will in any way live up to the first two, well, think again. For the record: I thought it was okay, but that's largely because I really, really like good special effects.POLITICAL NOTES: Perhaps the one thing of real interest here is the development of a ""cure"" for those who aren't like most. The implications here are strong. For example, if a ""cure"" for homosexuality is developed, should it be offered? Would parents give it to infants or fetuses in utero? Would adults consider it? And since homosexuality is obviously a part of who any homosexual adult is, would it be ethical to even suggest such a thing let alone strongly encourage it? While the rejection of a child by its own parents is poignant and painful, there's more than family dynamics at stake here. It's the very notion that something not ""average"" or ""normal"" might need to be ""cured."" What's next? Skin color? FAMILY SUITABILITY: X-Men: The Last Stand is rated PG-13 for ""intense sequences of action violence, some sexual content, and language."" I can't see that there's anything in the movie that the average 12 or 13 year-old hasn't seen before, and more than once. The three 14 year-old girls I happened to be all liked it, and they made it a point to tell me that they'd not seen the first two, but had no problem following the storyline. Meanwhile, a friend's 18 year-old son informed me that he thought the movie was ""retarded."" Some reviewers have suggested that X-Men: The Last Stand is aimed at the average 15 year-old. I'm having a difficult time arguing against that.",X-Men - The Last Stand
321,Surecure,A good action flick with less than stellar direction,7,6 January 2007,"I had avoided seeing X-Men 3 for quite some time for the simple fact that I had heard it was a supreme disappointment compared to the second film of the series. I finally caved in and was pleasantly surprised that while it doesn't live up to the previous two films, it still stands on its own as a worthwhile part of the series.From an action point of view, there is plenty of. The action sequences are impressive to watch and the effects work is nothing short of fantastic. There was not a single effect that looked bad or looked like obvious CGI work -- which is a shortfall of even the best of films -- so in that regards it is quite impressive. There is a broadening of the ethical questions that the series poses, this film introducing the idea of a ""cure"" to mutancy and questioning whether there can be moral absolutes.My two biggest complaints are that of direction and the script itself. Brett Ratner has once again failed to show himself as an actor's director. Many scenes looked as if they were filmed simply for being parts of the script that he had to get out of the way in order to move onto the fun stuff. Unfortunately, this approach has the effect of making the actors' performances look stale, unimpressive and -- in some cases -- completely out of character for what has been established in the past. I would venture to guess that he could have drawn out (translation: directed) more honest and better performances from his cast than what he chose to put on screen. This has always been his downfall as a director, a trait he unfortunately brought to what had been to this point a well developed character piece for a comic book movie.The script itself had some very poor choices both in terms of logic and dialog. Some of the major action sequences prove to be very poorly thought out demanding more than a realistic level of suspension of disbelief. The entire finale rests upon moving the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco, yet does not actually take into consideration the reality of the situation in any way. By ignoring why the bridge sits on concrete bases, what is left is a view of the bridge sitting across the water as if its lower supports could float making for the scene to be rather ridiculous. Add to this some extremely poor dialog (most notable an example being Juggernaut's line to Kittie Pryde in the lab complex) and things could be better. And while the moral issues brought forward in this film are excellent, at the same time the writers failed to truly explore the issues more than a fleeting admission of their presence.However, not to make it seem like I didn't enjoy the film, I would say that X-Men 3 is a fun film to watch with many exciting and visually attractive elements. Don't go in expecting X-2 and you will not be disappointed.",X-Men - The Last Stand
322,Roger_Sterling,"A worthy addition, but overall disappointing.",7,15 July 2006,"Does the last stand ruin the trilogy? No. Is it the worst of the trilogy? I think it is. However, ruining the trilogy? No. This is a good X-men movie, but worse than the other 2. Cyclops and Professor X were in this movie for about 10 minutes, and I mean the 2 of them combined. The movie's only saving grace may have been Jean. The movie seems too rushed, but it has a very dramatic climax, especially the last scene with Wolverine and Jean and the fight between the two ex-best friends, Iceman and Pyro. It was nice to see some new mutants, but besides Beast, they played a very small role in the movie. Based on what happened at the end of the movie, I look forward to what X4 should bring.Doesn't ruin the trilogy, but definitely the worst of the 3. 7/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
323,angelynx-2,What was Marvel thinking?!,4,5 June 2006,"This thoughtless, reckless, noisy mess is an insult to the X-Men, their history, and anyone who has ever cared about them. I simply cannot imagine the line of thought that led to tossing aside one of the finest comic book story lines ever written--the deservedly famous Dark Phoenix Saga--in favor of this travesty. It would take me a lot more than 1000 words to go into any detail on just how much is wrong with this movie, not only as an X-Men adventure but even as competent film-making (is it day or night when Magneto performs his biggest stunt of the film? Why can't Rogue and Colossus hold onto their respective accents for more than a word or so per sentence? Why, for heaven's sake why, does Jean/Phoenix spend 90% of the movie JUST STANDING THERE?--except when doing things she would not, EVER, do?),--Man, it's sad to know Marvel has so little respect for one of its most successful and best-loved teams that it will let them be treated this way in public. (Yes, I know this movie made metric tons of woolongs last week. Yes, I know Marvel was thinking ""ka-ching"" and not ""our beloved X-Men deserve the best"". But...can't help but wince when the people you grew up with behave so heartlessly at the first excuse.) (Good things: 1. Kelsey Grammar's entire performance. 2: Ian McKellen's wonderful voice. Bad things: Everything else. I mean everything.)",X-Men - The Last Stand
324,Quentintarantado,"If you ignore the previous movies and the comics, it's disposable.",4,5 April 2008,"Take the two other movies out of the equation. Take the comic book out of one's mind. Let the movie stand on its own. In its brief running time, at least two major characters die, Cyclops (and someone mentions briefly he died, as if as an afterthought they ought to say something about the fact before filming ended) and Prof. Xavier dies (here, at least they do dwell on the consequences and the emotional repercussions). A major war between mutants happen. Wouldn't at least one of these events be enough material for one movie? They are all so lightly treated like, say, one of the X-men lost a puppy. Then we have to move on because the director is contracted to bring it in under two hours. Then in the end it's hinted that a character who's dead isn't really dead. So, you tried to turn on our waterworks for nothing? For these reasons alone, I'd rate the movie a 5. For being mediocre. Okay, now bring in the earlier movies. Among the best comic book movies ever made. Stands pretty high too, even if they weren't comic books. Bring in the COMICS, how dare they reduce Dark Phoenix into a henchwoman? She's a glorified extra! The movie is demoted to a 1.",X-Men - The Last Stand
325,aqua_swing,The most disappointing.,6,27 May 2006,"When comic books turn into movies, there's always an element lost in translation, a storyline that gets touched upon, parts that get torn out or missed, or even completely ignored. It's part of the whole formula that makes it cater to broad audiences that don't read comic books, that always have fans of whatever series is coming to the screen upset that specific parts are left out.And that's where X3 leaves me. When I'd heard that they were visiting the Phoenix story in this film, I wondered how exactly they would be able to fill a whole movie with the story, and not let most people down.The basics of the story are covered, sure, but the character issue is there, that half of the things that would be important had they been signed on for more than three movies are completely and utterly tossed aside.Now, I can live through that. But what I can't live through are the lines given to Halle Berry. She said she wouldn't sign on unless she had more lines, they say. It's funny, because the lines they've given her are almost exactly the kind of terrible one-liner clichés that she'd had throughout Catwoman, and I found myself shaking my fist every time she came to the screen.So terrible, so very terrible.On the other hand, there were some really great parts. Beast (Kelsey Grammar) was fantastic, Logan was great, Shadowcat (now that she has LINES!) was great, and Magneto was also fantastic. The rest of the characters were boring, silly, stupid, and not very much fun to watch.This my friends, is the worst of the three movies. Plot flies by with nary too much weight, story lines don't develop very well, and some of the fight scenes are boring.Sad to think that when I'd told people I'd seen this movie that I was more excited seeing the trailer for Snakes on a Plane, than actually talking about the movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
326,MinorityReporter,X-travagant but lacks the sharpness of the previous films!,5,31 May 2006,"My one line summary pretty much sums up my thoughts about the third film in the X-Men series and while the effects are better than ever before there is something missing. The previous installments had a sharp, witty intelligence to the dialog that made the characters seem extremely well rounded and interesting. The witty dialog didn't seem like one-liners in the first films. They seemed a natural consequence of the characters' relationships with each others but as the characters didn't have the same edge in the third film it came off much more like one-liners. Especially some of Beast's dialog. Not to say that it didn't always work, it did, but it seemed much more synthetic and that really is a shame. In my opinion Brett Radner was the wrong man to direct the movie and Simon Kinberg (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) was definitely the wrong man to write the movie.Some of the characters did work. Wolverine was still pretty interesting but I'm saddened that they didn't follow up on his sub-story from the previous movies. In the previous movies his character was largely about finding out about his mysterious past. This thread was dropped completely in this movie making him much more of a team player which is not really what his character is about. Wolverine is a loner and you don't change that. Hugh Jackman's portrayal is relatively faithful but I still prefer his performance in X2. Halle Berry's character has been enhanced dramatically, something I can't really go into without spoiling the movie, but her character seems hollow somehow and while Berry goes through the motions there really isn't a lot of substance in her character. Kelsey Grammar is very good as Beast and is a satisfactory substitute to Nightcrawler and in this role Grammar proves that he has dramatic talent as well as comedic. The best performance belongs to Ian McKellen who does a lot with his character which was actually quite poorly scripted. Other characters have been reduced dramatically. Cyclops is an excellent example. He is only in the film for about 5 minutes and that is just not enough for a character who was a major character in the previous films. Other examples are Rogue and Mystique. All in all the character development is inadequate and if not for the saving graces of Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman I could have been tempted to say that the acting was below average in a series that has previously been known for excellent performances.The effects are of course stellar. Some of the best effects I have ever seen and it is in the effects that the true saving grace for this film is found. In every scene there is some form of effect and fortunately they are all perfectly done. Storm's powers in particular seem more credible than ever before and her status as a semi-goddess is more justifiable. Fortunately the action is very well choreographed as well allowing for some very interesting and innovative fight sequences easily on par with anything from the previous films in the X-Men saga. The only negative thing that can be said about the fight sequences is that because we don't care for the characters to the same degree as in the previous films its a little harder to get emotionally involved in the fights. However, I do believe that the third X-Men film deserves recognition because of the effects and I'm tempted to say that the effects have become a leading character in this film.Overall X-Men: The Last Stand doesn't seem nearly as polished as the previous films but in terms of entertainment value the film is on a very high level and the only reason I give the film a small 7 instead of a 6 is because of the excellent effects. It is hard not to feel a slight sting of disappointment though but I think I'll get past it and at least the X-Men series has come to a close with a bang that will surely make it one of the most financially successful films of the year.7/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
327,NotMoreMovies,Beautiful finale with only one major flaw.,8,26 May 2006,"Nothing will top the miracle which was Spider Man 2, but this third entry in the X-Men series comes darn close! I agree with another's review I read who said that aside from many parts of this movie being ""rushed,"" it was superbly written, acted, and directed and the emotions are stronger than ever! In a time period where movies are ""at their worst"" it's nice to see something like this come along. This movie deserves to re-spark the waning grosses that have been going on all this year.It's hard for me to give a true review without giving something away or repeating what others have said, but I'll try.The action and dialog come at you non-stop, I had to use the bathroom and couldn't find a lull where I didn't feel I'd miss something important. And I doubt that you will. This movie comes at you full-speed, there's no time to stop and take anything in or ponder certain aspects of the movie before it moves on to something else equally interesting.The plot (although excellent) is also more simple than the first two: some rich guy's son (Angel) is a mutant, so he dedicates some of his resources to develop a ""cure"" for mutants. They develop the cure by producing mutant-blocking antibodies from the blood of a young mutant boy (Leech) who has the inadvertent power of nullifying the mutant powers of any mutant who comes near him (within about 6 feet). Magneto takes this as a personal affront to mutants everywhere, even though they swear that the ""cure"" will only be given to mutants who volunteer for it. However, when this cure is used in self-defense, Magneto seizes this as an opportunity to claim that humans are on the offensive and raises a huge army of angry mutants against the pharmaceutical company that created it.The sub-plot involves the return of Jean Grey. Cyclops discovers her at the lake where she was assumed dead. Several ominous secrets about her are revealed, and her loyalties are tested. But...does she choose sides, or can anyone truly control what she has become, and has secretly always been......? The only other ""problem"" is, like the other 2, it is esoteric, appealing only to fans of the genre or sci-fi fans.However, as compressed as it is, it is DEFINITELY worth your time and money to see this in the theater if you are a fan of the first 2, and if you're not, it's a must rent.I hope I've been helpful, this is a must-see for X-Men fans everywhere, and hopefully we'll get to see a director's cut in the DVD.",X-Men - The Last Stand
328,machngunjoe,I don't what everybody is talking about. part three saved the first two,9,17 August 2007,"Look, the way I feel is that Brian Singer ruined the story with the first two films. Simply put; Bad writing, bad direction, Bad everything except the acting. He's never read an X-men Comic he said so himself in the BTS. Part three was magical. 1st... great musical score to capture the emotion, 2nd... Storms ridiculous hair was fixed so it didn't look like a weave! 3rd... BEAST!!!!!4th...Hugh Jackman Like always, great acting as well as Haily Barry5th...compelling drama married with compelling score.6th... The action scene in the end was EPIC, also the Xavier, Magneto, Jean Grey stand off scene was also EPIC.Everybody needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something and get of Brian Singer like he's some Comic Book God. He doesn't even read comics and he ruined Superman as well. This was a great movie and just forget about the first two movies.

After it was over, I was pretty happy I had gone.X3 was a really intriguing film, even as a second sequel. I'm sure the first two were good as well; although I won't plan on seeing them.

330,shiftyeyeddog,Better Than Expected,6,5 July 2007,"I went in expecting the worst. Brett Ratner has really done nothing to give me any faith in him, and the way this filmed was rushed, not to mention the fact that the writers and original director bolted to do Superman Returns instead, worried me greatly. But in the end, it didn't suck. I'd say it's as least as good as #1. I'm still waiting for them to make that great X-Men film I know can be made. Was this one great? No. The film definitely has its flaws, but it's mostly satisfying. Too many characters are crammed in, giving them all too little development or screen time. They make some MAJOR decisions that affect the ongoing story, but in the end they kinda chicken out and back off and leave lots of doors open. It's pretty much what I expected going in - an okay movie with some really good scenes. I loved seeing this at the midnight show with a crowd of real fans. They were excited, and got all the in-jokes, including one they threw in based on an internet spoof - the crowd went wild! I hope they continue to make more of these. They could easily rotate out entire casts if they get too pricey, as there is a DEEP roster of characters they still have to choose from, and the younger members in this movie were some of the better characters and actors. And get rid of Halle Berry - her hairstyles got better each movie, but her acting sure didn't.",X-Men - The Last Stand
331,sullibrandon,"Worst of the Trilogy, but still Amazing",8,26 May 2006,"Like a lot of fans, when I heard that Bryan Singer had left X3 to direct Superman Returns, and that Brett Ratner was going to replace him, I felt a growing mixture of dread and anticipation as the release date for X3 approached. After viewing a midnight showing of it, I must say that Brett Ratner is no Bryan Singer. Despite, this, however, The Last Stand is rollicking good ride filled with mind blowing special effects, creative and never-boring action, solid character development, and good philosophical gravitas that people have come to expect from the X-Men series.The film opens with a couple of flashbacks, and then we fast forward to the present day, learning that there is this young mutant from whom the government has been able to extract a way to suppress the mutant X gene. This pisses the perennially angry Magneto off, and makes Xavier slightly concerned. Of course, as if this wasn't enough, Jean Grey has come back from the dead, darker and with an evil aura about her that Xavier seems to know a little too much about.The Last Stand thrusts us straight into the action less than 20 minutes into the story, and barely lets up at all from there. There is not a second of wasted space in this movie, and it all works to move the characters and the plot inexorably forward as they approach ""the last stand."" Despite the frenetic thrust into the action, and the constant pummeling of the viewer with said action, each of the characters is explored more in depth.Different villains are introduced, as well as old ones met again. Pyro, Iceman's old menace, has now taken up with Magneto and stands by his side as his almost equally powerful sidekick. Mystique is her usual beautiful deadly self. Juggernaut, an unstoppable force of a man, aligns himself with Magneto because the government imprisoned him. Each of these people's powers work quite well in tandem with Magneto's, and they make for a show-stopping showdown.Brett Ratner shows us he knows how to direct action. The action in this movie beats all the action in the previous movies combined. There are moments of surprise, gasps, and simply ""holy crap!"" Ratner's action is creative and imaginative - he is not simply satisfied with a car blowing up - he has to have Magneto throw the car into the air, and Pyro blasting with it a giant fireball. And the best thing about the action is that once it starts, it never lets up, barely giving us a chance to catch our breath before Ratner takes it away again with another mind-blowing stunt.Now for what makes this movie less than stellar. Though there is plenty of character development, and we do go deeper into the lives of the characters we already know and love - the new ones are introduced with barely a second glance. Juggernaut, Angel, Beast, and the guy who can change into several guys at once - all of them serve only as secondary mutants. What made X2 so amazing was that each new character that was introduced was explored to their fullest potential - the lovable yet creepy Nightcrawler, the dangerously on the edge Pyro, and the sadistically evil Will Striker. The only exception being the woman who fought Wolverine with Adamantium claws. In X3 Pyro is reduced to a mere sidekick - and the only way his character is explored is in his bullying of Bobby. Nightcrawler disappears completely - though this a periodic characteristic of the comics, as well. Mystique, though still intriguingly beautiful, falls slightly flat. We do see more of the love triangle between Jean, Wolverine, and Cyclops; another love triangle develops between Bobby, Rogue, and the girl who can walk through walls. As I mentioned, Storm in particular plays a much larger role.It seems Ratner was more concerned with the good guys than the bad in this one. Glossing over the bad guys in a quick, perfunctory manner, he stays focused on the good guys and their development much much more. Other weaknesses of this film include one of its great strengths: fast, frenetic energy. Though it is refreshing to finally see the long awaited summer blockbuster with no-holds barred action, The Last Stand gives up a little bit too much in terms of character and story. And it is precisely this that prevents The Last Stand from jumping the divide between freakin awesome and truly great.Judged as a stand alone movie, The Last Stand is fantastically well put together - it will undoubtedly become one of the biggest blockbusters of 2006. However, being part of these legendary mutant movies, it must be held up to a higher standard, and, unfortunately, it falls short. Bryan Singer did a job on the first two X-Men films that had people blown away. Brett Ratner's work, though, takes the movie back to its comic book roots, stripping away some of the layers of drama that Singer had stamped on there, and just having some swell ass-kicking fun, with ridiculously amazing visuals. Though this film is not as good as Singer's past two were, it still works, and for that I am willing to give Brett Ratner a thumbs up. He deserves a good amount of congratulations for putting something together so well that so many people thought he would screw up. I know. I was one of them. But he didn't disappoint. I believe he did the best possible job he could, and for that, he gets an 8/10. Because, after all, he's still no Bryan Singer.",X-Men - The Last Stand
332,Jalea,X3: The Live Cartoon,7,6 June 2006,"Special Effects/Plot: Fantastic, extremely well executed. Even some of the most unbelievable parts seemed believable. There are complaints of character and plot development. I would have liked to seen more of what motivated the characters. Although the first two installments aptly explained everyone's motivation, I would have liked to seen more character development. So, I am left trying to read between the lines, which is not so bad, is it? A cure for mutants was discovered by scientists. Ironically, the cure, is a mutant. Of course, for those mutants who do not think that there is anything wrong with them, this presents a problem. And,ultimately results in a showdown. This movie has some surprising moments to say the least. There are at least two jaw dropping moments in this movie.Characters: I thought that casting Kelsey Grammar as the beast was perfect. Ian McKellen (Magneto) is always brilliant as is Hugh Jackman (Wolverine). They steal every scene that they are in. Famke Janssen seems like she is sleep walking, which I am sure is the point. Shawn Ashmore (Iceman) has a moment or two. But the stars of the movie are clearly McKellaen and Jackman. Patrick Stewart (Xavier) has been a favorite Sci Fi actor of mine since Star Trek. The other X-Men franchise characters seem to make cameo appearance. Halle Berry (Storm) was more assertive than usual. One downside is that major X-Men characters had little more than cameo appearances in this movie.I enjoyed the movie, but, left feeling like I ordered Applie Pie a la Mode and was only served ice cream.",X-Men - The Last Stand

How many more different kinds of mutants can they cough up, and how many different stories? Maybe they should seriously consider making this the final X-men movie, as partly hinted by the title. 'Beast' looked ridiculous and laughable, and the ""mutants fighting each other"" schtick is wearing thin. Ah, well. X3 is still quick, fun, and dumb entertainment.

335,gdeangel,Don't bother with this movie,1,9 June 2006,"Here are 10 reasons not to see this film: 1) Pathetic characters. We hear Magneto say, ""they want to cure you"" about 20 times. OK, enough. Jena/Pheonix: I've got a new red outfit... so I'll just stand around and from time to time my face will turn blue. Cyclops: ooopps, was he one of the significant x-men? Storm: I love the school and the professor. Logan: hmmmm... where to direct my angst... let's see... nowhere in this film. Hank: It's not easy being blue.2) Pathetic fight sequence: Storm, did you ever learn how to fight? Maybe that wire harness is holding you back babe.3) Pathetic plot line #1: Son... be normal... but then you can save me because of your unique differences in a completely contrived situation that plays uniquely to your ability.4) Pathtic plot line #2: Everyone should be free, but then there are some people who can't be trusted with their own power... and the ethics of substitution of consciousness... just left hanging.5) Genetic variations manifesting in essentially a social group which wants to be different and doesn't want to be cured. My five year old can get this symbolism.6) Magneto's strategy: I'll get Phoenix on my side... but then let's not get her to actually do anything in the battle! 7) The opening scene has some really great special effects... like seeing Patrick Stewart made up to look 20 years younger. And a fight with the Sentinel... ! 8) Rogue... rogue, you might want to drain off some of Jean's power at some point. Well, don't let me impose on your right to choose to be normal if it might save the world.9) I'd like my ""army"" of about 500 people to get to that island, and I command power over metal... let's see... what is the easiest way to get them across... is there a metal barge somewhere? Actually, I like moving big things, but it would make too much sense just to drop something really big, like say a bridge, on top of the people I want to destroy.10) We have a three film license on the characters here... so let's make sure that we mess things up so much that no competing studio will come in and take over the franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
336,kittiwake-1,Pretty Good,8,28 January 2007,"You know, I never read the X-Men Comics by Marvel. I just can't handle all the pictures and narration being intermingled. I always miss out on part of the storyline or spend my time trying to find the darn thing. But, I did enjoy the animated series when I was younger and so went to see the first and second installments of the most recent X-Men movies at the theater. I enjoyed them very much and was told by several friends that the storyline wasn't quite perfect, but that the stories themselves were OK in their own right. I personally would likely hate the movies if I had read the comics with the fervor that so many have over the years. Luckily, I can say I enjoyed even this, the third installment in the series: likely to become more than a trilogy. Considering that Star Wars by George Lucas should have stopped at the first three (anyone who enjoyed the 4th, 5th and 6th in the series -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- and was a ""real"" fan hated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd installments which surfaced so many years later. I never saw the 2nd or 3rd because the 1st was so horrible.) I'm hoping X-Men writers don't make the same mistake. Some of the CGI that was done was unsettling (they make Charles Xavier and Magneto look like their younger selves at the beginning of this one). And some of the CGI was very impressive. The storyline reminded me very much of the animated series, since -- of course -- The Phoenix was involved. I always had trouble understanding The Phoenix's heartfelt wish to die, since I didn't know all that was behind it. The movie does a very good job of helping the viewer understand what's going on behind the request for help. The cartoon just couldn't get that graphic, I guess. Make sure you watch the little video clips near the credits. Just watch until you get back to the DVD menu. You'll see why there will likely be a 4th movie. My guess is, they will wait for a decent screenplay and people contracting again with them. Money is at the root. Did the third movie do well enough in the box office to warrant a 4th being made? If they improve upon the 3rd, I hope they make it. If they pull a George Lucas, I hope someone will keep a 5th from surfacing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
337,Aomalle27,They learned nothing from X2... what a shame.,2,8 May 2008,"Where X2 managed to greatly outclass the first installment, this final chapter manages to mangle everything and cash in on the CGI craze. Movie making is supposed to be about the craft of fashioning a work of enjoyable, entertaining art with mass appeal. Here, they only cater to the mass appeal of mind numbing silliness of showing as many of the popular X characters as possible, without developing these characters, or melding them into the greater tapestry of an engaging plot. Mutants are being injected with a ""cure"" to their mutations. Magneto doesn't like it. Sides are drawn, and a battle royale ensues. There's several dispatchings of key characters that don't make sense, and the silliness of the plot, and the ""resolution"", make for a terrible movie experience. What was so right with X2, was completely ignored for this film.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I thought this installment had a compelling story and largely handled the telling of it well.I thought it was much better than ""X-2"" which had me scratching my head at its mediocrity and overall lack of action.Kelsey Grammar's Beast was a variation of the Frasier character, a person of class and breeding who can get down and dirty when the situation calls for it. I thought the ""mutant cure being used as a weapon"" was a very interesting slant.",X-Men - The Last Stand
339,eXtreme23,You get what you expect,8,12 June 2006,"In what may possibly be the final X-Men movie of the X-Men trilogy, a ""cure"" for mutancy threatens to alter the course of history. For the first time, mutants have a choice, keep their uniqueness, though it makes them look different or give up their powers and become human. The same cast returns for this trilogy, which won't be the same if they don't. This is the most simple X-Men movie with a simple plot. It's pretty easy to explain to someone who doesn't know about this movie. I did like the first two a lot, but this movie probably in my opinion isn't the best but it delivers a lot of action. I remember reading something a while ago. It has to do with the sexy Halle Berry and if she wanted to do this movie or not. She said her role for ""Storm"" had be bigger,better and sexier. She does have the second lead role in this film and it wouldn't be the same if she wasn't in it. This film wouldn't be the same if the whole cast wasn't in it.Since this may possibly be the last X-Men movie, many wondered if they will all die. This is what I thought, and they don't die. But some of the mutants did get cured including Rouge. Some of the mutants died, including Cyclops, I had no idea that he would die because I never read the comics and I don't remember the cartoons.One of the mutants who I thought should've been in this movie is Gambit. He's well known for his cards. I thought he was going to be in this movie since it was going to be the last one of the trilogy. But I feel that he could've been in this. Another mutant who joined the cast in this movie is The Beast. What I liked about it is that he doesn't fight in the beginning of the movie or in the middle but he does in the main fight at the end of the movie. Rebecca Romijn was looking sexy in this movie even playing Mystique, but in this movie she looses her powers and goes back to normal. I really did like this movie.This movie is action packed and this could be the most fun you'll have this summer. I'd watch this movie again for the fun of it. The cast was great, the movie was off the chain. I would give it a great 8.5/10",X-Men - The Last Stand

341,DragoonKain,Too short,7,27 May 2006,"This movie was too short. While I'm happy it included many new X-Men, a few of which deserved to be in the first two movies, the length of the movie doesn't allow for much character development. The movie is only 100 minutes long, and it really needed to be well over 2 hours. I realise that action movies can't spend too much time on character development, but I really think this movie needed more of it.Cyclops' character, in particular, suffered greatly in this respect. Having been marginalized in the last movie, this movie seemed to not care much about him at all. I don't understand how such a major and important character in the comics can be marginalized so. Don't let Cyclops' portrayal in the movie and cartoons turn you off to him. Trust me he's a much better character in the comics.Nevertheless, the story is good. I could complain about some of the twists and major deviations from the comics. But let's face it. You can't accurately adapt a comic book series that has been running since 1963 with several spinoffs and hundreds of major characters into three movies.The story very loosely mixes the legacy virus story lines with the dark phoenix story. And when I say loosely, I mean it's a completely different story, which, in many ways, is a good thing.One complaint I have about the story is that the Phoenix saga in the comics took years to simmer before eventually boiling over into a massively destructive climax. While I understand you can't have that slow progression of Phoenix's character from good to evil in the movies, I felt this one lost a lot of its effect without the slow buildup. And the lack of Cyclops' presence, who had a major role in the story, hurt it in some ways.But still, if one were to forget about the comics, and view these movies as their own story, it's actually a great trilogy on its own. But this is not the best film in that trilogy, sadly.",X-Men - The Last Stand
342,segratz,Excellent Action and CGI Flick,9,30 May 2006,"I've been anticipating the third film for the X-Men series for quite awhile now. So much so that I was a bit worried about the end result. I tend to get my hopes up way too high for a film. I can say though that I was quite relieved with this installment of the franchise. It delivered what I was looking for most in the film: escapism.The cast is extensive and the mutants plentiful even considering there is a ""cure"" floating around. We see the old favorites like Professor X, Magneto, Mystique, Rogue, Ice Man, Pyro, Storm and, of course, Wolverine. It's a bit obvious the studio is gleaning Hugh Jackman for a flick of his own as the fan-favorite mutant. However, since he's fun to watch I enjoyed his scene- stealing scenes. There are a plethora of new mutants to enjoy and savor - like Kitty Pryde, Multiple Man and Colossus for instance. Dark Phoenix plays an interesting, although tough to swallow, part in the interweaving of the story. For me, Juggernaut steals the show though.So, yes, the movie lacks a bit of character development. If you're looking for long, in-depth and heart-wrenching stories of each mutant than please go read one of the slow-moving Marvel comics out today. If you're looking for well directed action than I highly suggest you see the movie. Ratner shows his chops for directing straight action with some very memorable mutant-on-mutant fighting scenes. I thought they were awesome and so did my fellow movie-goers. I always like to comment on an audience reaction - and this one was very positive.There were some very shocking twists so head out and see X3 soon because someone may ruin the film for you. I also want to add that staying past the credits is very, very, very key. If you didn't do it you missed probably one of the coolest after credits scenes I've ever seen. For my husband, it salvaged the entire film.So X-Men: The Last Stand is not going to please all the fanboys out there. Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons would probably give the film an ""F."" But for the general public, this is the start of the summer movie season and this is the movie to see.",X-Men - The Last Stand
343,Merklin,"So many characters, so little time....",5,27 May 2006,"If x-men : the last stand was a burger, It would be the kind thats packed with too many ingredients and falls to pieces when you pick it up, leaving you with little satisfaction.Okay, so thats not the best comparative metaphor ever , but my point still stands - X men: the last stand crams way too much stuff into its insufficient running time .The film is just an overload of comic book craziness and never gets a chance to breath and revel in the drama or the danger or the tragedy of the plot . The films overstuffing affects the new heroes and villains pretty badly - here we have a group of characters with years and years of comics history behind them and what do they do in their movie debut ? Not much. Juggernaut ,callisto, beast and angel to name a few, turn up, do their little bit and disappear into the crowd again . Its pretty frustrating to watch and shows how overloaded this film is . It not a total failure though. Lack of emotional depth aside, when the Saturday morning cartoon style battles take place, they are fun to watch .Performance wise , Ian mckellan , Patrick stewart and kelsey grammar add great dramatic depth to their roles and i must admit to getting a little geekish thrill at seeing so many mutants on screen at once. X men the last stand is competently handled but is far from the dramatic epic its very clearly supposed to be. Lets hope part 4 will get it right.....",X-Men - The Last Stand
344,yourfavoritecritic,A Juggling Act That Ends in Disappointment,4,11 November 2021,"Released in May of 2006, X-Men 3: The Last Stand finds our heroes in their greatest battle yet, as Magneto and his brotherhood use the creation of a new mutant cure by the human government to wage warfare with the help of an old X-Men ally. The Last Stand features the return of all the actors/actresses from the previous two films and is directed by newcomer to the series, Brett Ratner. With a three-year time gap and change in direction, X-Men 3: The Last Stands amounts to an overall pretty disappointing experience, that is not without a few glimmers of positivity, however.With the return of most of the cast from the previous films, along with some new additions, they all provide meaningful performances that are convincing, even if a couple of the supporting actors are fairly lacklustre. The film also benefits from some great visual effects, both practical and digital, not once did the film feel dated in that regard and it definitely contributed to the immersion as I was wrapped right up in the film. The Last Stand also does a good job conveying a grand scale to the action, as the final battle actually felt like there were stakes. Although that feeling is present in the two predecessors, with X-Men 3 slated to be the final mainline movie in the series at the time, it does do a good job building to a climax that feels like a finale, even if the storylines explored weren't executed all too well.Where X-Men 3 stumbles the most is in its story department, which is unfortunate considering that was an aspect that was consistently good in the previous films. Although The Last Stand has an intriguing enough first act that sets a lot of interesting plot lines up, it fails to deliver at the end. The filmmakers seemed to be a little too ambitious with the number of storylines they tried to cram into the film, as it felt like a juggling act where nothing was ever explored to its fullest potential or had a conclusive arc. Plenty of times plot lines would be dropped by the wayside as another plot needed to be explained which led to a sense that the movie lacked cohesiveness. Had the writers taken a more focused approach on one plot I feel like the film would've faired much better, as, with a runtime of only an hour and forty-four minutes, there is just too much going on.X-Men 3: The Last Stand marks a disappointing end to the original trilogy, even through its cheesy moments the film could have been good had there been more of a focus placed on one storyline rather than trying to manage five. Plenty of moments went unexplained and it lacked the nuances present in the previous two films. It's hard not to compare The Last Stand to the other two X-Men movies as by virtue it is a sequel, and while the film can be viewed as dumb fun that creates a good scale of epicness near the end, it is still clear the film lacked a singular vision. There is still fun to be had with Last Stand, I was never bored, the action sequences are entertaining, it has a good pace and the visual effects are quite good - it's just a shame it couldn't be better. I still do recommend the film as it is not completely bad and after all, it is the third entry in a trilogy so if you have seen and enjoyed the previous films then watching this is a no-brainer. It is just a shame that the film lacks the quality in terms of its story that was present in the predecessors and for that reason, I am giving X-Men 3: The Last Stand a 4/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
345,the_moody_youngest,Amazing!,10,24 December 2006,"This film was so amazing. I loved it to death. I only have watched it twice and it is already my favorite movie. I loved the emotion, the action, the plot, the actors, the characters, and the story was there. The surprise is; I liked it better than X2! I loved X2 but I love this one even more! One of my favorite parts was when Iceman and Pyro were fighting. Call me crazy but I almost cried. It is so hard to see two former best friends battle like that. Pyro looked even hotter in this movie with his blonde hair.My other favorite part was the Golden Gate Bridge scene(it is in the trailer as well) When Magneto and the Brotherhood go across the bridge with Magneto using his power to move the cars. I know this sounds weird but I loved how Pyro looked! He just looked so serene and you could tell he really didn't like being there. I am glad he had a big role in this film, just as big as his in X2. The Jean Grey/Phoenix and Logan scenes were so beautiful and sad. I really hope there is a new X Men film. Keep Pyro and add Gambit! Oh and bring Nightcrawler back.I really recommend this film. It was amazing. The special effects were brilliant! Especially when Pyro and Magneto were threw the flaming cars. AWESOME! If you want action, emotion, great acting, great special effects, and a fun watch, pick out X Men The Last Stand, you will love it. Grade: A+. This movie beats Superman Returns: Superman Returns gets an F!",X-Men - The Last Stand
346,Kryzak,"Not as good as the first two, but not bad",7,15 July 2006,"Definitely not the best X-men movie , but good enough as an action movie.With so much potential embedded in the plot lines (would you choose to become ""normal"" again if there's a cure for the mutant gene? how do you deal with an evil version of a former teammate?), I am quite disappointed that the movie doesn't explore any of the issues in more depth similar to the first two X-men movies. My biggest gripe is the movie run time of 1 hour and 40 minutes. The previous movies were both 2 hours long, and this one *clearly* feels rushed for many of the scenes. The extra 20 minutes that Brett Ratner shaved off this movie could have dramatically improved it.Gripes I had: - Jean Grey really didn't get much story development other than in the very beginning. She just stood there and looked cool most of the movie - Angel had pretty much *nothing* to say in the movie - Lots of disposable characters that were barely introduced and killed off (SPOILER ALERT!) - While I actually liked some of the ""removal"" of main characters, I thought not enough time was spent on making the loss impact more.Otherwise, if you look at this movie as a pure action movie, it's one of the better ones out there. So do check it out. =)",X-Men - The Last Stand
347,headfulofghosts126,How the mighty have fallen...,3,31 May 2006,"I really can't believe what I've just witnessed. Let me preface this review by saying that for a long time I believed both X-Men and X2 were slightly overrated. I guess we all walk into these films with our own ideas of who and what the X-Men are and what they mean to us. I'll admit that my enjoyment of the first two movies was hampered by the fact that I couldn't let go of those ideas.But over time I grew to appreciate very strongly what Bryan Singer had done. It was not the X-Men I had known as a child but it was something equally as complex and entertaining. The world these heroes lived in felt like one that could be right outside my door. I had a deep investment in them and their relationships with one another. You could feel seeds being planted for further adventures. There was a big picture. A grand design. And it should have culminated with the X movie to end all X movies. The point where each story reaches its inevitable climax. I'm not sure three movies would have been enough to tell the story Singer had in mind (I believe his original plans were to shoot X3 and X4 back to back), but I don't think it would have been impossible. But we deserved better than this. X3 does not send the series out with a bang, but with a whimper.The whole thing reeks of a second tier crew picking up the reigns left dangling by their first tier predecessors. Everything from the script to the production design to the direction is lacking. It's not awful, just average. And incredibly inferior to what's come before it. I never pegged myself as a Bryan Singer fan, but he was sorely missed through every frame of this travesty.The single worst part of the film for me was the way it mishandled Magneto and Professor X. They both behaved so completely out of character. Xavier going in and manipulating Jean's mind runs contrary to everything we've ever heard him say in the previous films. And taking a verbal swipe at Logan just seemed off. And Magneto... where to begin? First of all, he would not have abandoned Mystique. I just don't buy it. I also don't buy his ""What have I done?"" moment at the end. But the worst was probably his ""That's why the pawns go first"" comment. Ridiculous. Those were his ""brothers"" he was sending in there to die. Calling them pawns immediately sucks away any sympathy you might have had for him up to that point. The Magneto from the first two films would have been on the front lines with them.And yeah, they biffed the whole Dark Phoenix thing. Big time. That whole storyline should have been dropped and saved for its own film instead of squeezing it in here. There is no phoenix. Just a lame excuse to bring back Jean Grey as a mute zombie who stands behind Magneto.Oy, and Cyclops. You bastards. That's borderline unforgivable. Granted the first two films pushed him in the background but here he was just erased completely. Literally. Guess what? We didn't need anymore of Storm. In fact, the consensus seems to be that Halle Berry sucks. It should have been Cyclops that had to get a handle on his emotions and take charge of the team once Xavier was killed. It should have been him and Logan facing off against Jean in the end. Their proverbial triangle should have become a literal one. One could have been ready to destroy her and one could still have been trying to protect her. Huge opportunity missed. Those three words pretty much sum up the whole film.There's no end to the errors. Why is Rogue in the danger room? What on Earth is she going to do??? Why are the Sentinel's eyes white in the sky and red when they hit the ground? Why is it daytime one second and night the next? Could they have picked a worse actor to play the president? Is this all Ratner's fault? Of course not. I think most blame belongs to Tom Rothman and the screenwriters. But Ratner definitely didn't help. Imagine a scene like Warren cutting off his wings or Mystique losing her powers in Singer's hands.There is no emotional resonance here. It's hard to care about anything we're watching. No one mourns the death of Cyclops. Even seeing his and Jean's tombstones later in the film didn't affect me at all. Watching Magneto fall or realizing Rogue gave up her powers... nothing. Didn't feel a thing. Wolverine is reduced to wallpaper. Set dressing. There is no character arc for him or anyone else.And if you're going to try and be so bold as to kill three beloved characters and neuter three others, have the balls to stick with it. But they don't. By the end of the movie there's an explanation for how to undo everything that's happened. The movie is essentially pointless. There are no lasting consequences for future films. If there is an X4 it would take only the first act to bring these characters right back to where we left them at the end of X2.Speaking of which, THAT was a solid ending. As they stand in front of the president you think ""Holy crap, it's the X-Men!"" But in X3, it doesn't feel that way. It feels instead like these are the leftovers.Fox, you should have waited for Singer. As long as you had to.",X-Men - The Last Stand
348,JamesMitchell451,"Brett Ratner delivers satisfying action, but fails to create a good story",5,13 August 2013,"X-Men 3 sucks. What the hell happened, the first two X-Men movies are some of my favorite action movies ever, so you could imagine how shocked I was at the sheer flaming awfulness of this one. The plot takes place some time after X2, after the announcement of a cure for mutants, The Brotherhood launches an assault against humanity and all that stands between them and the extinction of the human race is the X-Men. The script for this film sucks. There is so much wrong with it that I don't even know where to start. Oh I know, how about the completely stupid handling of Wolverine/Jean Grey romance. In X-men 1 and 2, the relationship between the two characters felt natural, organic, and real. Here, it feels hokey, tacked on, useless, and overall just uninteresting. I would say spoiler alert, but since this movie has been out for almost 7 years I'm not. When Jean wakes up from her coma the first thing she does is basically tell wolverine ""Do me"", doesn't that seem... oh I don't know: dumb? And when they are basically ""Doing it"" all I was doing was looking at my watch. It doesn't help that the dialogue is awful. There is a lot of action in X-Men 3, I would dare say too much. It replaces all of the characterization and overall feel that I fell in love with in X-Men 1 & 2, the star of those movies in my opinion wasn't the action scenes, it was the characters, story, and dialogue. But I will say, the action that is here is well directed and overall pretty impressive. From the fight between Juggernaut and Wolverine, to forest battle, and the climatic battle at the end, there is plenty of eye candy. The special effects here are a mixed bag: The explosions, fire, and ice effects look good. But the make-up for Beast and Mystique, and Wolverines claws look AWFUL. With that huge budget this film had, that was the best that they could do?! The plot here is so uninteresting (Just like almost everything else about the film, apparently) , it's like they sat down and said ""How can we make the audience not give a crap. Oh I know! Lets change all of their personalities, turn them all into total assholes. And you know all that characterization and stuff that the critics loved? Get rid of it. Just replace it with explosions."" ""Brilliant idea! What's your name again?"" ""Simon Kinberg"" Director Brett Ratner has taken all of the things that the audience loved about X-men 1 and 2 and replaced them with nonstop explosions. While there are people who like X-men 3 (Roger Ebert,may he rest in peace) as you can see I'm not one of them. Thankfully, several years later X-Men First Class came to the rescue (And boy, was it awesome). If you have to see X-Men 3, just rent it. There is absolutely no reason to buy this movie, it just sucks.",X-Men - The Last Stand

It has good action, was very fast paced, and overall was very satisfying! MUCH better than Superman Returns, sorry if you have a Superman tattoo on your body! I could justify a fourth film, no more beyond that. Four is VERY much pushing it in a series. If they wait a few years, it can be very much anticipated by the public and will likely be a success.

This kept me enthralled from start to finish and, it seemed, the rest of the audience too as there was hardly a peep from anyone else. Anyone who knows me knows that my biggest pet hate in the world is the idiots who go to the movies and think it's okay to ya-ck and ya-ck as if they were at home. It's the reason I only go to the cinema when I'm desperate to see a movie. Anyway, back to the movie. If anyone can complain about this movie all I can say is that they are not comic book movie fans and shouldn't have bothered in the first place or they are just natural born whiners. This is a great movie, full of heart and emotion, you'll laugh, you'll cry (I did at several points) The casting is, as usual, spot on, Hugh Jackman, as always in any movie he does, completely brilliant and charismatic, Ian MacKellen, awesome as always as is the rest of the cast. Special mention to newbies Kelsey Grammar, totally perfect as Beast, no one else could have pulled it off so brilliantly and also Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, excellent stuff. The storyline was so good, yes, it's the same good guys versus bad guys, but, thought has been put into it and there are some very shocking moments. I can't wait to see this again.

352,ARTaylor,Disrespectful To Fans,4,3 June 2011,"X-Men: The Last Stand is a tragedy of a movie. It managed to overshadow The Phantom Menace as far as disappointing follow-ups to successful movies. The first two intelligently set up a terrific and complex universe. This is anything but.Like far too many bad movies that had potential, the movie suffered because the studio decided to get involved. Singer left the project for Superman, and honestly I think he recognized what was going on and jumped the sinking ship. Ratner gets a bad rap for this, but he came in so late that there was no chance in saving it. For whatever reason, studios seem to think that bigger is always better despite the majority of such movies showing otherwise.The biggest problem is that far too many characters are added. The first had about ten main characters. The second about fifteen. This has about thirty. Having a bunch of cameos is fine, but this movie tries to give time to everyone so that essentially no one has any time. Forget character development, there's so much trying to go on that no one has any real memorable moments. There's a couple of special effects moments, but not character.The worse problem is that the returning cast is given the shaft except for Storm and Wolverine. Wolverine had a good story arc in the first two but X2 finished it. This was the time to move on, but still he is front and center despite not having much to do. Storm was only elevated because Berry couldn't handle being a supporting character anymore, but again she doesn't have much to do. Cyclops is killed early on and no one cares. Xavier is also killed about half way through but there's some half-hearted feelings at his funeral, and it's especially terrible that his good friend Magneto doesn't seem to care for more than two seconds. Whatever dynamics Magneto had in the first two is abandoned as he simply becomes a bad guy. Mystique is depowered and tossed aside without any fanfare. Rogue's character changes completely for no apparent reason other than some semblance of development. Jean turns into the Dark Phoenix but basically stands around while other people do things around her. The love triangle set up in the first two is torn to shreds.Instead we're asked to care about the new characters, most of which are bland and one- dimensional. Juggernaut is his bland Ultimate version rather than dynamic main comic self since he's just a brute rather than Xavier's step-brother. Callisto is basically there for Storm to fight and to stand at Magneto's side. Fan favorite Colossus literally only has one line. Angel is nothing but a plot device. We're asked to accept a second love triangle between Rogue, Iceman, and Kitty but it's forced and unemotional, probably cause Rogue becomes so one- dimensional this time. They try to touch our heartstrings with Leech, but again there's so little of him that audiences just can't care. Beast is usually quite interesting, but for whatever reason you loved his comic and/or animated self is gone here.The action is merely okay, but without character development it's just flashy special effects to distract us. The special effects themselves are good, and it seems the producers had fun coming up with different powers for all the cannon fodder. Since the characters are uninteresting it's hard to get into caring about them in the action. In pretty much every action sequence, there's little rhyme or reason besides showing off powers and special effects. Again, the studio seemed to think that having bigger and louder scenes was better than having intelligence.The love and care from the first two movies is completely absent, almost to the point of disrespecting the characters and fans. The whole film screams money grab as if putting time and care into the third movie would have somehow degraded the box office results. This was certainly the low point in the series. Wolverine was bad but tolerable, and First Class got it back to being interesting. It's a terrible follow up and I sincerely hope that they simply reboot the franchise so we can see Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean, etc. as comic fans truly know and love them.",X-Men - The Last Stand
353,John K.-2,Much better than I had feared it would be,8,26 May 2006,"When I heard, about a year ago, that Halle Berry was demanding a bigger role in X-Men 3 or she wasn't going to appear, I became very worried that the franchise was going to sink into ego-building mediocrity and lose the teamwork aspect which makes the X-Men stand out from other superhero sci-fis. The change of director also didn't bode well.In the end, the film feels like it took the constraints it was given and made the most satisfying film possible in the circumstances. The stars' egos get their run-out largely by cutting down on the number of X-Men who figure as anything other than extras ... and yet, because these extras are familiar from previous films, it doesn't feel like they're sadly underdeveloped. The special effects are also amazing, as ever.There are weaknesses to the film that may result from the new director ... the personality of the central character of the film could have been explored much more fully (and beneficially to the film's message), instead of having lots of facial expressions but few lines; most of the new 'bad' mutants are fairly clichéd baddies; and the sole new 'good' X-Man has his part woefully underdeveloped. So it's not quite as good as X-2, but still a satisfying end to the trilogy.Oh, and I read that a cameraman on a previous film complained that ""he was filming the most beautiful woman in the world but she's ... got white hair"". I was sure he was going to say, ""she's ... covered in blue paint"". Well, both he and I are going to be a little happier after seeing this film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
354,MidnightWarrior,The Last Act,10,26 May 2006,"Or the last episode. I remember reading a quote from Huge Jackman saying that while they were shooting this film, the slate read X3 (the cast had no idea that the studio planned on making this film the last X-men film in the series). However, it was during post production the words, ""the last stand"" were added to the film.Now before seeing the movie, I had no idea why such a title was given to X3. But after seeing it, everything makes sense. Think of all the X-men films as four acts or four stands of a chair.The first stand was completely covered in the first X-men film. Stands two and three were covered in X2 and X2 left open the question, what happens next?In X3: The last stand, this question is finally answered. Some people are complaining that this film lacked character development, plot, story, etc. I disagree.I would only agree with them if this film had been a completely new story. However, such is not the case. Think of X3 as the ending of X2 that you're just seeing a few years later.Everything you need to know about the existing characters is carried over from the previous two films. The newer characters are not given much of an introduction or character development because their back-stories are not important to the current story being told. All we need to know about them is that they are mutants and this is the last X-men series film.Instead of telling you what you'll see in the films, I have elected to tell you what you won't be seeing in the film: any sex scenes between Logan and Storm, any cameo appearance by Gambit, and no sentinel storyline in this film.There isn't much I can say about the film without giving it away. In essence, it picks up right where X2 left off. That and there is a cure being offered to mutants. That's all I'll say regarding the story.The acting in this film was top notch! All the regular cast's acting was great, but Halle Berry's performance as Storm was a real surprise! She was INCREDIBLE! At the conclusion of X3, a creak in the door has been left open for a possible X4 film. But honestly, with all the choices made in this film, I just don't see it as happening. Spin-off's (as are being written), definitely yes. Another film in the X-men series? Doubtful.Seeing as X-men is so profitable for 20th Century, why would they allow their cash cow to be slaughtered? It's mind boggling. And in this film, they made grave decisions. Not controversial ones - grave ones.Dirty studio politics aside, overall, I give the film a 10. It was nice seeing all my favorite characters back in action again. I'm looking forward to seeing some spin off films that include Halle Berry as Storm.",X-Men - The Last Stand
355,deanbean317,Umm....I liked it...a lot!,10,22 December 2008,"I guess not being a fan of the original X-Men comics (I was a Spidey junkie) gives me a different perspective on this movie. Not knowing the back story of each character, or the plot developments of the original comic book franchise allows me to judge this final entry in the series as a movie in it's own rite. I never felt the story to be rushed simply for the sake of inserting more mutants. As far as lack of character developments goes...they're mutants, they have weird cool powers, what more do I need to know? Do I care what Juggernaught's motivation is, do I care that Kitty Pryde was played by three different actresses? (no more than I did when Marty McFly's girlfriend morphed from Claudia Wells to Elizabeth Shue between chapters 1 and 2). The only thing I found disconcerting was Nightcrawler's unexplained absence since he made such an indelible impression in X2. I thought everything else flowed along smashingly. I was genuinely shocked at the deaths of so many main characters, but shocked in a good way in that I was moved and angered. I guess if a movie causes true emotion it must be doing SOMETHING right! As far as the other mutant's being stripped of their powers, was I the only one who noticed Magneto's subtle influence over metal at the end of the film? Doesn't that suggest that, in reality, the effects were short lived therefore NONE of the mutants lost their powers? Ignore the fan-boys and watch this film based on it's own merits, not to be slavishly pinned to the framework of another medium.",X-Men - The Last Stand

But when I left the theater I had some mixed feelings. Of course, there are some nice surprises in the movie, that make ""The last stand"" definitely one of the best movies in the sf/fantasy/comic genre for years to come.At the same time the death of several characters, the lack of introduction for the new characters, made me feel like the makers as well as the actors really had enough of making movies about the X-men. Most likely preparing for the movie about Wolverine....I think X2 is still the best, although there is no lack of action in X3. But I really, really had hoped for more...",X-Men - The Last Stand
357,Deathstryke,A sloppy end to what could have been an awesome trilogy,6,30 May 2006,"X-Men 3:The Last Stand was undoubtedly an entertaining film, but for all its visual marvel and its maelstrom of explosive action sequences, it fails to be brilliant for one reason; there is too much going on.It picks up sometime (we're to assume recently) after the supposed death of psychic Jean Grey. While her friends and colleagues Wolverine and Storm are trying to cope without her, they become gripped by the news that the human government has found a way to suppress the mutant gene and is opening its doors to any mutant who wishes to relinquish their powers and achieve a normal status in society. However, right-wing mutant fundamentalist, Magneto, rejects the so called ""cure"" as an insult and with the help of an army of vengeful mutants, rises up against the humans who, as it turns out, are planing to enforce the cure with or without mutant consent. Meanwhile Scott (aka Cyclops) revisits the dam where he last saw his beloved wife swept away by a wall of water. She mysteriously reappears, not as the Jean he once knew, but as the ferociously powerful goddess, Phoenix...can you see how this creates a problem? As comic book purists have already vehemently pointed out, the Phoenix saga stretches over four episodes! So it makes me wonder how any scriptwriter would believe that they could successfully crush such a huge legacy into a 100 min film, while also trying to accommodate the inevitable Magneto Vs Humans war and still have time to build tangible, three-dimensional characters along the way. How could Ratner hope to do that when his movie is half an hour shorter than the his predecessor's? Between the X-Men, Magneto's goons, the White House officials, the US army and the malevolent Phoenix, the movie becomes a wild battle for screen time. Many of the more prominent and intriguing characters from the first two films taste barely two minutes of the running time before they are either stripped of their powers, or destroyed. It was a most unsavoury feeling for me to see characters who I had become so attached to over the course of the last two films, suddenly being recklessly obliterated. Save for the character of Beast, played excellently by Kelsey Grammar, virtually none of the new mutants introduced actually speak a word. We are told absolutely nothing about them and we must accept that they serve no purpose other than to blast energy bolts, kick people in the face and make things explode. It was a let down, almost an insult to watch this mass mistreatment of so many important characters.The visual effects in this film are amazing, most notably the hair-raising (or should I say ""house-raising"") scene with Phoenix and Xavier in the Grey House, the destruction and flight of the Golden Gate Bridge and the explosive showdown between the X-men and Magneto's forces, which displayed some truly breathtaking scenes.However, when Ratner's not directing action his inferiority to Singer shows through. X3 feels like a much more static and plainer looking film than its predecessors. This is mainly down to Ratner's camera work lacking the polished, dynamic genius of Singer's, who gave the first two films a real comic book feel. Ratner also tends to indulge in the special effects bucket all too much, unlike Singer who used a more subtle approach. There's only so much razzle-dazzle that you can throw at an audience, if yeh don't got the script or the characters...it's gonna fall flat.The actors all do a brilliant job, even if some of the best actors are only on screen for five minutes! Famke Jackson plays the Phoenix with frightening charisma (although she was helped greatly by black contacts and pulsing thread veins). Hugh Jackman seems to fit right at home as the rustic, rippling anti-hero Wolverine. Hally Berry's role as Storm seemed strange. Apparantley after plans to leave she told writers she would stay on only if they extended her role. I can see how she was 'upgraded' to the status of leader, but she still seemed to take the back seat behind Wolverine. On a negative note, I thought the casting of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut was just stupid. I don't remember Juggernaut ever sounding like an cockney boot boy.X3 was indeed a loud, cheesy, epileptic romp that was, for the most part, enjoyable. It's just so unfortunate that it tried to take on too much at once and had to sacrifice so many great characters. If only they hadn't caged themselves with this trilogy idea and had dealt with the Phoenix saga and Magneto's war as two separate films.As a movie on its own, Ratner's X3 is acceptable. However, as the conclusion to a trilogy, it is thoroughly empty and disappointing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
358,phillipstephenso,More mutant fun,10,28 May 2006,"You would think that a world full of superheroes would be just hunky dory with no problems, less crime, plenty of harmless entertainment. But, this film shows that, far from the more the merrier, a world full of mutants simply leads to continual crisis. So, the government perfects a hypodermic needle full of an antidote to the explosion of mutants, which restores mutants to normal human beings. This leads to a rabble rousing mutant to organize a rebellion against the humans. It is interesting to note the different levels of mutants, from one to five, with level five being the most powerful. Famke Janssen, as a level 5 mutant, shows off her considerable powers to make everything break and float in the air. So now Hugh Jackman and five other mutants have to stand against the rebellious mutants, who are trying to storm Alcatraz, which is now the location of the government lab producing the ""cure"" to the explosion of mutants. All hell breaks loose. Shawn Ashmore is charming as the Ice Man who wins the teenage rumble against Aaron Stanford as the Pyro. (Was that a hidden slap to the theory of global warming?) Ben Foster is another charming teenage mutant, who proves to be the lab director's son. Ben sprouts angel wings and flies to rescue his father from the burning lab, in a secret salute to filial devotion and family values. The special effects in this movie are something to behold and hard to describe to normal human beings. I guess it is a mutant thing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
359,filmfan92,Summer's Big Disappointment,5,25 July 2006,"Sure, I have given other summer releases worse reviews (see ""My Super-Ex Girlfriend""), but X3: The Last Stand is truly the summer's biggest disappointment. The first two X-Men films were highly enjoyable thrill rides in the hands of Bryan Singer (Superman Returns). They both set up the Dark Phoenix arc, a chilling tragedy that is the true heart of the X-Men comics. The transforming of kind telepath Jean Grey (Famke Jannesen) into a cold, calculated killer is an emotionally fragile story, and one that falls to pieces in the hands of Bret Ratner. Yes, it's cliché to blame the guy behind the Rush Hour films blew this movie, but he did. Bryan Singer juggled social consciousness with popcorn fun effortlessly. But Ratner switches gracelessly between the two. A plot point about a ""cure"" for the mutant ""disease"" quickly loses all meaning and becomes a metaphor for homosexuality. The action setpieces are constant, yet none of them are truly memorable. The final battle is an overcrowded bore, and the movie rushes the story to a forced conclusion. The rock and redeemer of this movie is the ensemble cast. All the X-Men (and women) fit well into their respective parts, no matter how brief they are. John Powell's score is a sweeping addition to the film as well. Overall, X-Men: The Last Stand is crammed full of plot, but at the same time, running on empty.",X-Men - The Last Stand
360,Armin20,Bad casting,5,4 August 2020,"I read the comics about the phoenix story when I was just a little boy. The brood and the Phoenix were the scarriest thing I thought ever happened then to the X-men. But I was wrong. In 2000 they made a movie and I thought it was a good movie. Well casted and I wanted to see more. In 2003 I got my wish. Then in 2006 they made a movie totally wrong!Why cast Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut. His tiny 'I played soccer a few years as a prof' body and he can't act. Always plays the same types. If I see a movie with him in it, I today am walking away. Since Swordfish his scene 'I know what your thinking...' so bad, nearly ruined the movie for me. Why was did added to the movie? So happy Deadpool 2 came out to let us see how Juggernaut should have been then. That is the Juggernaut! Not a tiny helmet made out of foil tin and that is how you are and look havingSuperhuman strength, stamina, and durability. Invulnerability via mystical force field!There are to many mutants in the movie. There are two things going on here. The Phoenix and a mutant war. I did could not follow it anymore. Wolverine is slicing some guy who keeps regenerating. Who are you mutant guy? Why are you in this movie? Best thing should have been to keep this issues separeted and in different movies. 1 hour 44 min is very short to cover this all.In the comics there is the Hellfire Club and I would like to have seen this explored in in the movie. So we can build to get forward...Giving it a 5 out of 10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
361,anifanmc,A poorly done finish to the trilogy,6,19 December 2007,"Yes, we know all the obvious arguments to sidestep the issue: Ratner was directing, some of the actors were lost, etc. etc. But all these criticisms seem to miss the point: even with the losses incurred from the transition in directors and actors, this movie feels pointlessly pop-shlock in comparison to its predecessors.X3 details a story that appears to be an amalgam from the House of M, Civil War, and Messiah Complex story lines present in the Marvel universe. The owner of a biotech firm has developed a treatment that suppresses the X-gene, spurred mostly by the horror at finding out that his son is a mutant. Professor Xavier concedes that this cure might help out mutants with powers which have made them social outcasts, but his ex-colleague and friend, Eric Lensherr (Magneto) sees this is as nothing else but an attempt at genocide. The two sides brace for an all-out war that has been vaguely alluded to in the previous films, and one which comes to fruition near the end.The plot isn't that bad. What sucks is the surface level detail granted to the dedication of this plot. The movie is very obviously and linearly divided into a beginning, middle and end, with other subplots involving minor characters clumsily woven in for probably nothing more than fan pleasing. Some characters play little to no active role throughout the movie. Archangel, the son of the biotech firm's CEO, has about two minutes of screen time total. Callisto and Psylocke play little more than eye candy tribute and perhaps a chance for Dania Ramirez to show off (which she has already done considerably on Heroes, playing an equally unimportant role). The Juggernaut is just a hulking brute with no back-story, no real emotional role other than cannon fodder, and essentially useless as a villain.What the film fails miserably in doing is providing a reasonable basis for most of its characters. Ororo Monroe (Storm), who played the wise, removed and beautiful leader of the X-Men under Professor X (as was the case in the comics), becomes a maelstrom. Not because she went through a crisis, but because Halle Berry wanted to get herself some extra money and screen time before being committed to the hell of actresses and actors who've long overstayed their welcome. James Marsden's Scott Summers (Cyclops) was in the movie for about four minutes and acted purely as a plot device to bring back Jean Grey - shunted aside like cannon fodder. Of course the real reason why he was discarded is simple - Marsden wanted to switch to Singer's project on Superman Returns, but they didn't do a good job of finding a good way for the character to go out. There are many, many other examples.The movie nevertheless redeems itself slightly in the storyline and back-story of Jean Grey and a somewhat realistic, non-alien explanation for the Phoenix (although it might have been nice to just leave it the way it was). Her character was powerfully built throughout the movie, but it was at the expense of other characters like Hugh Jackman's Logan (Wolverine). The inclusion of Hank McCoy (Beast) was also a masterstroke, as he was an easily exploitable character who had been altogether left out of the earlier films save for some subtle references.X-Men 3 is a disappointment, but not a terrible one. It provides entertainment, but nothing beyond that. The social commentary replete in the first two movies is eschewed for wanton battles which are all-too predictable (come on, Iceman versus Pyro, who didn't see that coming). It uses new minor and flat characters instead of looking for well-worn ones like Emma Frost or the Red Queen. So while the general audiences looking for kicks may be pleased with the film, it fails to please even the most die-hard of fans, ultimately.",X-Men - The Last Stand
362,JanetSnakehole3,One of the worst movies of the year!! What a disappointment!!,3,1 June 2006,"I was looking forward to this movie more than anything, since I'm such a big fan of the whole x men franchise, and once i got out of the movie theater, i was angry, disappointed and i wished i didn't see it.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! I couldn't believe what they did to these characters, such as Cyclops, they kill him within first ten minutes of the movie and they don't even properly show his death. He is one of the most important characters and yet he is gone like he never existed. This movie was so overbloathed with all kinds of characters that the characters who really mattered didn't have room to develop and showcase their emotional and physical development as they should be able at this point, following the first two movies. Jean Grey returns as the Dark Phoenix, and she looks more like a zombie rather than a phoenix goddess. No fire, no nothing, dark phoenix was a complete dud. I was mostly looking forward to the Angel character, and u know what i got, NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. At the end, when Wolverine tries to stop phoenix from killin everyone, was probably the cheesiest and the most boring thing i have ever seen. He stabs her while she levitates and thats it. BOOORINGG!! How cooler would have been if they had storm/phoenix face off, storm with all her lightning and stuff and jean with fire, and just have a wonderful brawl. That would have been a lot cooler, and more appropriate to the story and the characters.END SPOILERS All in all, the movie had some cool effects but the characters where undeveloped, u really don't care about who lives or who dies.

364,matjusm,The saga comes to an end,7,26 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand The film starts off at around where the second one left off, right after the supposed death of Jean Grey. But we soon discover that she has returned in all her glory (and an uncontrollable one at that). Among other things, a pharmaceutical company has developed a way to suppress the mutant X-gene and Magneto won't allow it. He starts gathering an army to make a stand against the humans.All of the X-Men that we've grown to love over the course of the past two films are back in this one, in addition to a whole bunch of new ones. Wolverine is still himself but I feel that they overdid it with his cockiness. Storm is beautiful but there isn't anything that special about her. And there are of course the grand old men, Magneto and Xavier who despite trying, aren't quite as good as they were in the previous installments. As for the newcomers, the one I liked the most was Beast played by Kelsey Grammar.The storyline has got some good ideas in it but those aren't put to the best use. With the film's 104 minute running time, a whole half hour shorter than X2, everything feels rushed. They could have told a much better story if they had taken some time to go deeper into things but instead they got this huge film but then showed us only a little bit of everything but not enough of anything that would satisfy the audience.Some may blame this (and other) shortcomings on director Brett Ratner who took over after Bryan Singer left to do Superman Returns. But I say blame screenwriter Simon Kinberg who has also given us such turkeys as XXX2 and Charlie's Angles 2. As is trademark for him, the dialog is awful and way too cheesy and the storyline has quite a few plot holes and leaps of logic. With the material given, Ratner did a fine job. Not the best possible but still pretty good. The action was there but at times felt somewhat rushed and it simply didn't have the impact that it did in the first two. The special effects were good but nothing special. At times they almost felt a little dull. The cinematography, which according to IMDb was done by both Phillipe Rousselot and Dante Spinotti is OK but doesn't quite reach the levels that Tom Siegel achieved on the first two films. John Powell's soundtrack goes from some nice combos of choir and orchestra to some very boring and generic orchestral.Overall, a pretty good film if it didn't have the excellent X1 and X2 to live up to but since that is taken into consideration, a bit disappointing. Not the best way to end an otherwise great series like this.7/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
365,brodie_kashmir,"Sub-par when judged against the previous two films, but good on it's own",7,10 July 2006,"The X-Men franchise, from comic books to TV-shows to the films, has always been about the struggles of minorities in not just America, but the world. And that essence, that spirit, has never wavered, regardless of who handles the interpretations.In X-Men: The Last Stand, Brett Ratner takes over where former director Bryan Singer (who left to make Superman Returns) left off. The mutant population is continuing to be divided between Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) notion that humans and mutants can cohabitate peacefully and Magneto's (Ian McKellen) camp, which strive for mutant domination. The split is further exacerbated by the discovery of a ""cure"" for the mutant gene by Worthington Labs. The result is an all out civil war between Magneto's army and the X-Men fighting alongside the humans.Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) have all graduated to the ranks of X-Men to join Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) as part of the team. They are joined by new mutants Beast (Kelsey Grammar) and Angel (Ben Foster) in the fight, while Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) sides with Magneto.As I said, X-Men has a spirit, an essence. And that is difficult to destroy. Ratner, despite his best efforts, was unable to accomplish that. But, unfortunately, he took an insightful film series with magnificent allegories of current minority affairs and turned it into a frantic action flick that didn't have anything to say. The third, and shortest film, was an hour and 45 minutes of missed opportunities and unnecessary plot lines.Many characters were useful for one or two minutes, and were some of the most blatant Deus ex machinas I've ever seen on film.But, to the film's credit, the strength of the cast alone propels this film beyond my expectations. With the notable exception of Halle Berry, her off screen whining for a larger role in the new film translated poorly to execution. But one can easily look past her (and subsequently Storm's) inflated ego to appreciate team mentality and comradely that really makes this film work. And it's a testament to that spirit of the franchise I've been talking about, that when working together, good things can happen.I'd be remiss in giving it a low rating, for the faults of Ratner, who was out of his element. But I'd also be remiss in giving it a high rating because I'm a fan boy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
366,galahad58,X-Cellent,9,27 May 2006,"Superhero/comic book character movies. Those two words used to mean a light, action adventure with some off-the-wall special effects. Movies like Batman, Daredevil, Electra, and The Hulk were poor excuses for movies and were made to just show the character in action. A new form of comic book hero exploded onto the screen when the first Blade was made. The script was more mature than people were accustomed to and it set the stage for more depth in screen writing for comic book adaption. Spiderman was the first to break the mold with a superhero and Batman Begins continued the development of a superhero movie to an intelligent, thoughtful adventure with dialog and characters you could care about. In the past, only Richard Donner's Superman made an attempt to rise above the normal comic book/superhero formula. The third X-Men movie continues the maturation of superhero films. The script is well written, the direction is very good and there is actually acting on the screen. None of that paper macho Electra and Daredevil acting we have seen in the last couple of movies. Because this is the third X-Men movie, audiences have bonded with some of the characters. Comic book fans will be more deeply involved with these characters and what happens will effect comic fans more than the movie fans. Main characters die. Yes, I know that does not happen in a superhero film---but main characters die in this movie. Not just one. I do not want to give much away---so I will only say that this is a good movie and a great start to the summer movie season. This is a definite film to watch on the big screen. One final note---there is an important scene after the credits. I do not like when movies do that since 90% (estimated) of the people never see those clips.",X-Men - The Last Stand
367,videodrome1234,Why Mr. Singer....,7,21 May 2014,"The only thing trickier to make than a sequel is a third part. I was probably not the only disappointed one when I heard that Brian Singer left behind the X-man saga for the most famous and maybe even the most boring comic book hero (leaving with the composer, the editor, the cinematographer, the writer and the set director). In his place was first Matthew Vaughn then the even less assuring Brett Ratner. Let me quickly just add that while Singer is a more talented and artsier director, Ratner is a popcorn movie director, who will never win an Oscar even if his film are wildly entertaining. So anyway they had to find a new crew, they dug up Zak Penn X-men 2's co-writer who is responsible for Elektra's story and tacked on Simon Kinberg, whose first film was XXX's second part the two of them quickly sawed together two story lines (The Phoenix and the mutant vaccine stories) then thinking they did their job grabbed their paychecks, and the fate of the film was left up to the director. The previews were convincing and the gossip suggested that the film will be tough. It has been several months since The X-Men stopped William Stryker, but that victory came at a price: they have lost Jean Grey. Scott Summers (Cyclops) is still grieving he goes to the place where Jean Grey sacrificed herself, and she appears. Meanwhile, humans have discovered a cure for the mutation. The X-Men are appalled at this idea. Magneto, decides to organize an army of mutants and wage his war against the humans. Now, The X-Men must stop Magneto again and put an end to the war against the humans, as well as stop Jean Grey's Phoenix powers. The film was a lot harder to digest on many levels. First off you had to swallow the bitter pill of some glaring mistakes, ignored characters, how it was over the top in trying to be epic and in a few scenes the totally silly script. Luckily the film makers decided to take risks too with the 200 million dollar budget and have some balls when it came to the ending of the film. The heroes are not invincible, they were willing to make life ending sacrifices to further the story and this all just made the film more human. It was also a positive that Cyclon stepped forward as a character and didn't stay a footnote like in the first two films. But with such a huge budget I do not understand why the film was so short. They would have had more time to show us the characters, but no It's also interesting to note that though it tries to be sentimental, the drama is somehow lacking despite the many deaths. Ratner killed the style Singer created with the first two films. He massacred the heart of what embodied the x-men sage.

368,NJRocker091188,X-Men The Last Stand.,8,3 June 2007,"X-Men The Last Stand wasn't as great as the second or first one. But it was good. Now I'm not a fan of the comic books. But since I saw the first two and thought they were good I went out to see this one. The story line was kinda week, there wasn't much to it. It was just really a war against the cure but, it was still a good movie. The only big compliant that I have is that Roge took the cure and got rid of her power. But I loved seeing the X-Men and there powers were shown more and it seemed to me that they where stronger. I liked seeing the kids fight. I thought that was cool to see more X-Men then just Logan, and Storm in action all the time. When I saw the second movie I wanted to see Ice-Man fight Pyro. But that didn't happen. And since it happened in this one even though it was a short fight, I was still happy to see that. I do have another complaint, and that is that they killed off Cyclops,The Professor and Mystique I didn't like that because I liked them. But at the end of the credits, there is a quick scene which leads us for a reason to see another movie. Aside from the things I didn't like, this movie was good and there wasn't a reason for anyone to dislike it. Good movie, great effects, good enough to watch more then one time.

Secretly though the government has weaponized the anti bodes to the dismay of Professor X (Stewart) and Beast (Grammar), who is a working in the cabinet of the new administration. They soon learn that the cure comes from a boy mutant (Leach in this) and Magneto knows that he must destroy the cure and the boy before it destroys mutant kind. In the meantime we also have the continuing Phoenix Saga or Dark Phoenix saga with Jean Grey (Janssen). Since the 2nd film we now see that Jean is still alive but her powers are out of control and soon kills Cyclopes (Marsden). We also learn that the Professor has been controlling her powers since child hood but no longer can. Jean escapes and is later confronted at her childhood house buy The X-men and Magneto who has now assembled some new mutants for his Brotherhood, mostly Morlocks. They fight and the professor is killed and Jean goes off with Magneto. With the danger so great the military is now armed with the cure and all plastic materials for equipment. Magneto launches his attack on Alcatraz Island to kill the boy which leads to the final struggle of the movie. Magneto has his power taken away in the battle and Wolverine (Jackman) is forced to kill his one true love Jean.X3 is the weakest of the series, but it's not a bad film at all for comic book fans. I think most will be surprised at the level of violence and killing that happens too many of the main charters throughout the film. As said this was to be the last so they wanted to go out with a bang. The overall story is OK. I wasn't too thrilled about the whole cure thing but it was OK. The introduction of some familiar faces from the comic book is appreciated. Beast was well played by Grammar and the makeup on him was great. He really looked like the character from the comic. Angel has a minor role and was OK, I was always more a fan of Archangel. I thoroughly enjoyed Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, I think she looked great and was excellent in the film. The juggernaut is now a mutant in this but I thought he was somewhat lame in this incarnation. Most of the new mutants especially in the brotherhood I thought were annoying and lame especially quill. Most of the special effects are fine and the makeup jobs were near perfect. There are many small stories within the movie, like Rogue finally decides that she does not want her powers, her triangle with Bobby/Kitty I'll take Kitty thank you) and Angels problems with is father. The action never really dies down so I doubt one would be bored with this one. One thing that was missing from the first 2 films was the danger room and we get to see that here with a look at a possible future where Sentinels rule. But the stories are just not as good as one and two. The DVD extras were mostly poor which was a big let down. Some of the commentary was good, but not great it will explain some things. The packaging was great while the features were not. It was mainly trailers and cut scenes.There are some surprises at the end so look out. Overall 2 is still the best followed by 1 and then this. It's weak in some areas but still a good watch so pick it up. Big 8 out of 10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
370,druss44121-1,"average, and disappointing. why all the love?",5,26 May 2006,"THERE ARE SPOILERS, SO BEWARE! This is not so much a full fledged review like some of my other stuff, but just some thoughts that depict how bad parts of X-3 were.In fact, the more I think about it, the more I really dislike X-3.It was disappointing. No time for characters, lame melodrama, lame deaths with no emotional impact, and action that at times looked waaayyy too CG. I'd give it a C+ or C. This summer has been pretty lame, so far, with Poseidon being the worst.And why DID WOLVERINE KILL Jean??? couldn't he have stuck her with the cure? and at the end... nothing is fixed. what humans and mutants suddenly ""get along"" because of one battle? and they didn't do anything with Wolverine, what about his past, what about the arc for that? people are like... SHUT THE F UP, SURE RATNER CAN'T DO CHARACTERS AND STORY ARCS, BUT HE DOES EVERYTHING ELSE FINE AND I THINK IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE YOU LOSE YOUR CRED. Okay, except, I was really looking forward to this, I like Red Dragon and the Rush Hour movies. But wtf... bad writing, bad directing, even rushed effects. How was this ""good?"" I've never read the comics, but this betrayed the other 2 movies, and that matters. Overall very, very disappointing, and I dislike it the more I think about it. And also, the scene with Golden Gate did go to night too quickly. I found that really funny... the sun is setting, and suddenly, it's night. ONE SINGLE INSERT of the sun setting would have made that make sense, but instead... it was just funny. And the action had no rhythm, a lot of it was just movement on screen. And, I'm the Juggernaut bitch? Comeon.... seriously.Another problem is that I never felt like a war was about to happen... there was never a sense of excitement, or doom, or that beyond the specific images I was seeing something was HAPPENING and going on. That is perhaps the biggest flaw, it never drew me in. The best films make you feel as if you are seeing just part of a world, that beyond what is shown things are happening and the world and characters are changing. The other X-Men films at least somewhat got this down, but The Last Stand... nothing. And that is the sign of a competent but not really talented director. Creating that feeling, along with creating real emotion.... that's what a genuine director can do. Ratner is simply competent; his film isn't unwatchable, but it's got nothing extra to it to make it last. It's almost as if it were directed by a robot.and Magneto, his character was very inconsistent. i didn't for a second buy his betrayal of Mystique, partly because there was no reaction, no sense of loss, it all happened so fast. very, very lame. Ian McKellan can only do so much with a terrible script...And the end of the credits is overrated... it's only about 20 seconds.",X-Men - The Last Stand
371,jon2005,The Last Stand,8,28 June 2006,"When director Bryan Singer left the X-Men franchise to make Superman Returns (2006), he was replaced by Brett Ratner (Red Dragon, Rush Hour), much to fans' dismay. However, the result is easily as enjoyable as the first two in the series, and despite several flaws which were not as destructive as one might think they could be, Ratner has kept the spirit of the franchise to deliver an action filled and twisting conclusion to the trilogy.This time around, humans have developed a mutant cure, and although not compulsory, many mutants want it. Magneto, however, believes this is the first step of the human-mutant war he is always preparing for, and so creates the Brotherhood in order to find the source of the cure (which is on Alcatraz Island) and destroy it. Meanwhile, Jean Grey has returned, this time as the worryingly powerful Phoenix who, torn between her two personalities, is talked into joining Magneto's army, which the X-Men must now help the humans defeat.It sounds very action packed, and it is. It is these scenes that are the most competent and confident, and are the highlight of the series. Finally, we are shown the full potential of all the X-Men's powers in the mutant standoff on Alcatraz, and the X-Men are shown to be the real heroes they are. It is the best climax to a superhero film so far, and is inventive with its display of mutant powers and the humans adapting to Magneto  their weapons are plastic, for example.On to the flaws and, whilst it may sound like I'm damning the film, it turns out that although some of these flaws are large, they didn't affect the overall enjoyment of the film as I thought they might. Firstly, the film is too short and contains too much. Both the Phoenix storyline and the cure storyline could have had a film each, but they are adequately combined, although it is the Phoenix storyline that suffers most from this  we never see enough of the Phoenix and her turmoil, and she is not as involved at the end as one would like. However, the scene at Jean's old house make up for this, and it has to be the most shocking and well-handled scene in the film.Secondly, there are too many characters. Bryan Singer managed to juggle all the characters the most effectively, but The Last Stand doesn't; and this isn't helped by its shorter running time (1hr 45 compared to X2's 2hrs 15). Whilst we focus in on many new characters, the established characters miss out (Cyclops, Rogue, Mystique, even Jean Grey). Worse, the new characters aren't all that effective  Ben Foster's Angel is utterly irrelevant, and Vinnie Jones is an obscene casting choice for Juggernaut. Kelsey Grammar's Beast, though, is absolutely brilliant, perfectly fitting the role that calls for calm judgement and more than a dash of feral ferocity. It is a shame that Rogue is sidelined, as she is the only mutant we already know that feels the cure is a good thing, and more could have been made of her feelings towards it.As said, The Last Stand is actually a very good film, and there is enough going on that the flaws pass by without affecting the overall result. The themes of terrorism, genetic engineering and stem cell research that the film makes links to makes it relevant to today's political world. The acting throughout is fine, the highlights still being Wolverine and Magneto (and so good are they that they are both getting their own spin-off films).A point that struck well in this film was the deeper exploration of Xavier's and Magneto's relationship than the other two films allowed. It is interesting that they both essentially want the same thing, but want it in radically different ways. The moment where Magneto scorns Pyro for disrespecting Xavier was an especially nice touch.Overall, one feels that The Last Stand was not quite as developed as it could have been, and it certainly needed to be longer to better juggle all the characters and sub-plots. But it is still an accomplished film with some stunning action scenes and is a fitting conclusion to the X-Men trilogy, if never quite reaching the peaks of X-Men 2.Rated: 8/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",X-Men - The Last Stand
372,jeuneidiot,"Instead of fresh life, we get Hollywood retread in the 3rd X-men",6,24 March 2007,"So with Singer gone on to Superman, Brett Ratner of Rush Hour (!?!) gets the nod to direct the third installment of the awesome X-men franchise. In my opinion (on a 10 point scale) the first was about 6.5, the second almost an 8 and this a 6. I'm really over Halle Berry, and her need for Storm to have a bigger role didn't help the movie in the slightest. The mythology and character introduction is good, but the story was a little simple. A cure has been developed, Magneto decides to destroy it and a few of the good guys go and help save the day and prevent a few lives. I found the sub-plot of the Phoenix much more interesting and wish more time had been spent on this story. The fight at the end didn't offer much out of the ordinary apart from Juggernaut trying to get the mutant cure.This movie is like day old lemon pound cake. It was great, now it is still good. It might be something you look forward to, but once you get it, it's past its prime. The crumb is dry which negates some of the flavor and sweetness of the cake. The lemon adds a nice hint of flavor, but not enough to overcome the dryness. 6/10http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",X-Men - The Last Stand
373,sg2790,Lots of destruction and explosions....loved it,9,1 June 2006,"Many people have been saying that the last in the x-men trilogy wasn't up to scratch. Although i did feel there was something missing, which i can't put my finger on, it definitely did make my draw drop with the amazing effects and explosions.Perhaps people were disappointed with it because they were expecting to see more emotion from the characters. Even though in this film the characters seem to be more real than they were in the other two. Also it didn't really feel like it was the end of the x-men and didn't really have a happy ending or a very dramatic cliffhanger which did disappoint me.Overall, this film is different from the other two and had a richness to it that the previous ones didn't. I would recommend seeing it primarily just to see amazing special effects and big bangs and not because you want to know what happens to the x-men, it doesn't tell you. But it is a very good ACTION film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
374,DanielRobertRoss,The much maligned X Men film,5,23 May 2016,"The much maligned X-Men: The Last Stand is the unloved film that caused so many screen writing headaches later on, due to the premature idea that this would be the last X-Men film in the series. But did it deserve the reviews that it received on it's initial release, or was it simply fan backlash because of Brian Singer's replacement Brett Ratner?The film has a bizarre throwaway attitude to characters, both mutant and human. Vinnie Jones is rubbish as Juggernaut, uttering that stale meme ""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"" And why give a pre- credits set up to Angel, when Ben Foster is barely in the film? Halle Berry is again, given nothing to do, and Mystique, one of the best characters in the series, is thrown away halfway through. And was it really worth getting Bill Duke in the film for two minutes of screen time, or an off camera R. Lee Ermey shouting at soldiers? I mean, I know that after Full Metal Jacket he's been repeating his ""shouting army guy"" role ever since, but still, it feels like a waste of talent. James Marsden (Cyclops), due to filming commitments with the concurrently shooting Superman Returns, is sidelined quickly too.No, it's not as bad as the reviews would have you believe. The action is impressive, the film's score gives momentum, the special effects are top notch, and even if the aforementioned characters do get sidelined early on, the acting is good. Ian McKellen gives a very strong performance, and Hugh Jackman is dependably good. At the end of the day though, Ratner made a solid, if unspectacular film, whereas Brian Singer would've made an amazing one. Days of Future Past proved that.",X-Men - The Last Stand

376,Devotchka,"Um, different.",7,26 May 2006,"I really did enjoy this movie, but anybody who says that it's way different from the first two isn't kidding. First off, it's much, much darker--too dark for my taste. There aren't any genuine spoilers in my review here, but I do allude to a few things...so the warning's there.Many people seemed way too out of character--not just as compared to the comic books, but as compared to the first two films. Since when was Magneto such a total jerk? (Anyone who's seen the movie already knows exactly what I'm talking about. Poor Mystique.) Sure, he's the villain, but he's not supposed to be evil. He of all people would know that you shouldn't automatically hate someone for his/her religious beliefs or race or even whether or not he/she's a mutant. He took the mutant superiority thing way too far in this film in several ways, and became sort of blindly stupid about a lot of things. Oh, and Wolverine sobbing? Yeah right.The Phoenix was pretty well done, though the explanation of how she became who she was a little far-fetched. (And that brings us to another guy who's out-of-character--Professor Xavier wouldn't do that, would he?) X3 is definitely a thrilling movie with amazing fight scenes, but it had very little in the way of character and plot development. (And what it did do in that area fell in the realm of either the bizarre or the cliché.) Usually I'm not one to say this sort of thing, but this movie should have been a lot longer. Either that or it should have been edited much differently. There are way too many unresolved issues and way too many questions.",X-Men - The Last Stand
377,stu9003,A disappointing end to the trilogy,3,9 July 2006,"They were always going to have trouble following X2, but I never dreamed just how bad this movie could be. The direction, the editing, the acting and the story all fail miserably. Flat out, it's just a poorly made movie that fails on all levels.The movie gets off to a bad start with the sloppily handled death of Cyclops, who apparently gets offed by Phoenix 10 minutes in (although we're never actually shown what happens). Unbelievably, none of the X-Men even seem to care that Cyclops is missing! As soon as they see Jean Grey, all concern for Cyclops is gone. This scene is never satisfactorily resolved. The direction doesn't get any better. Characters appear and then disappear with no mention as to why and what their purpose is in that scene. Angel is a good example. He very briefly shows up at various points in the movie, but they never bother to give him much of a character or a personality or anything like that. As a result, his scenes fail to convey much emotion. Another example is Colossus. He appears in all the fight scenes, but I don't know if he had a single line in the movie. He's just another of the many no-name mutants to appear.The Phoenix storyline just never worked at all. She basically stands around for most of the movie doing not much of anything. When she finally starts to show some life, she more closely resembles a demon from some schlock B-grade horror flick than an actual X-Men character.Characters also say and do things that don't make sense. In addition to the X-Men forgetting about Cyclops, there's a scene where Magneto frees a couple of mutants and they just join his cause with no questions asked. There's nothing wrong with them joining him, but you'd think they'd at least want to know who he was.Overall, the acting was poor. Storm gets a much bigger role this time, but Halle Berry fails to convey any sense of strength, power or conviction in her performance. There's one scene I'm thinking of in particular, right after the Professor dies, where Storm takes charge and declares that the school shall remain open, but she does so with such a lack of conviction that I'm surprised no one said, ""no, seriously, what should we do?"" Hugh Jackman also seems pretty disinterested this time. Gone are the snarling one-liners and that sense of being on the edge that characterized Wolverine in the first two films. This time, Wolverine seems like a tamed animal.The Golden Gate Bridge scene was typical of the movie. They spend no time developing the story or characters, but then spend three or four minutes on some superfluous and unnecessary FX shot just for a ""wow"" effect (it was unnecessary because Magneto could have easily got everyone across to Alcatraz without using the bridge). Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against special effects, but a well-developed story forms the backbone of any good movie, even a special effects extravaganza, and this movie ignores that fact.From a production standpoint, the movie gave the impression of being a rush job. There were glaring errors in continuity and editing. Here's a great example: when Magneto drops the bridge on Alcatraz, it's daylight. Seconds later, all the mutants jump off the bridge and it's nighttime. Doesn't anyone ""proof-view"" this stuff? There's no way an error like that should happen in such a big budget movie. It's just one more example of why this movie sucked. Big time. 3/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
378,mad_mandonna,"Bigger, but not necessarily better",7,21 June 2006,"X men is by far the most compelling superhero franchise out there, as it has so many characters you like at least one of them. This film in terms of enjoyment was probably the stand out for me, however in terms of story and character development, this film was probably the worst of the lot. This films good points would be the incredible fight scenes and breathtaking CGI, however there are far to many characters and there is no where near enough story. What the director has probably done is tried to make it your run of the mill summer blockbuster and take no risks, but why not take a few risks with the X men they're risk takers themselves. Another thing that really could have happened is to make it longer. To be honest I wouldn't mind sitting through another forty five minutes of Xmen, and with the extra length better character development could have taken place. The film isn't all bad (or I wouldn't have given it an 8) they have incorporate storm into the film a lot more, Wolverine isn't the centre of attention, Dark Phoenix is superb and most of the acting (except Vinnie Jones) is rather good for an action movie.

Juggarnaught who is Professor Xaviers half brother who hates all mutants teams up with mutants, his power if from a magical source and he is not a mutant. Thus magneto would not have let him join, plus his powers would not have be nullified by the boy in the lab. The entire story is very very lame, It totally is gone from the comics, it totally has not story to it the only good thing are the effects but a movie with no story can not be saved by special effects.

The writing was pure garbage save for a few subplots (The cure subplot) and Xavier's death, the acting was boring, the pacing was sloppy, the editing was all over the place, the directing was trashy, Vinny Jones was horribly miscast as Juggernaut, and even the ending was botched (they show Erik trying to move a metal chess piece but then it suddenly jump-scares us by cutting to the end credits.).1/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
381,Norway1,Definitely the best of the three!,9,24 May 2006,"I didn't think it could be done but Brett Ratner has made X3 even better than X2 - which says a lot! (I gave X2 9/10)The characters are more like we remember from the comics. Storm flies and messes with the weather a lot more. Wolverine goes Berzerk three times and gets thrown by Colossus twice. There is a Danger Room sequence. We have a lot more mutants. etc. etc etc.At the same time, while it was not a problem for me at all, I can see how perhaps some fans might dislike certain aspects. For example: Storm does have a lot of ""street talk"" rather than her African Goddess style from the comics. Wolverine is very much a part of the team and even acts a bit in a teacher or team leader role at times. Angel and Cyclops are hardly in it. But all of these choices were for the better of the film in my opinion.Some of what made this film really great: 1) Phoenix is incredible! Amazing! Perfect! Absolutely brilliant! And fortunately the whole story really revolves around her, so she gets plenty of screen time. 2) Beast is spot on how most fans will remember him from the comics. 3) The mutants in general are more like the ones from the comics. 4) Juggernaught is cool! I never really liked him from the comics but Vinnie Jones really made the character. 5) Angel's story was very well told in a concise way. 6) Iceman finally gets to be Iceman.There are lots of new mutants and the three or four that we get to know a bit are well fleshed out considering the amount if screen time they get. Plus they have cool powers! The whole Brotherhood (Magneto's team) is very cool!But the thing that makes this film truly great and the best of the series is the story! And we are treated to some astonishing surprises! You will never ever guess to the fate of some of the main characters. Some die, some lose their powers. And believe me it will surprise you.There is so much left in the X-Men series that can be told.

So much enthusiasm for this disorganized mess depresses me, because it means the Brett Ratners of the cinema world are winning the war. It's criminal that this talentless hack was allowed to destroy what was a pretty elegant series of films.Listen, adults: this movie isn't competent to lick the boots of either of the previous X-Men films. There is more of everything you go to movies for in the first five minutes of X2 that in the entirety of this inept pile of missed opportunities.That said, this is not the worst movie I've seen this year, but it's certainly the most disappointing. There is so little substance to the script that even Sir Ian, probably the finest, most mesmerizing actor alive today - a man who can damn near stop time with a single glance - can't hold his character together. Imagine what a pickle the lesser mortals are in here.Considering the remarkable quality of the first two X-Men films, this big, loud Bruckheimer-esq movie is a crying shame, but hardly an unexpected one.

384,forrestwrs,Left An Ugly Taste In My Mouth,4,14 September 2010,"X-Men: The Last Stand left an ugly taste in my mouth by its close. I was so in love with the previous two movies, but then this one failed to do what the first two succeeded so brilliantly at doing. First of all, the characters in Last Stand were not balanced well at all. The way the characters were balanced was what was so impressive about the first film, but that seems to have been, unfortunately, abandoned. I kept wanting more out of these characters, and I wasn't getting that.***Warning: Here There Be Spoilers*** I also want to take a minute to talk about the way the deaths of some of the characters were handled. It wasn't so much that they died but where their deaths were placed in the story. Cyclops is killed off entirely too early, before the audience even has a chance to become acquainted with the pains he has been feeling. Yes, character developments have finally taken a backseat to action and effects in the X-Men movies. But I also disliked entirely what they did to Rogue. By the end of the film, she has given up her powers. I thought one of the most interesting stories of the last two films was Rogue's and the way she had to try to have a relationship with Iceman when she couldn't touch him. But instead of working out this problem, the writers take the easy way out and give her the Cure instead. Rogue was one of my favorite characters, but Last Stand turned her into something I did not like. ***As for the rest of the characters in this movie, I think the writers (Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn) tried too hard to balance too many characters. And they don't. Characters sporadically enter the movie and drop out, we're given no time with any of them, and the film doesn't even try to keep their story lines straight. For instance, there was a very interesting character known as Angel with wings growing out of his back. He appears in the beginning of the film, once briefly in the middle, and once even more briefly at the end. I wanted more time with this character. I wanted to learn something about him. No luck. And there was a lot of that going on.As for the main villains, our ""Class 5"" mutant is entirely too powerful. She can lift a house and rip people apart. She can nearly destroy an entire island. Why was there even that final battle? She could have obliterated all of the opposing mutants like they were nothing. This was a very unnecessary addition to the movie that just left the film with an overabundance of plot holes. And there is no focus to this story. None of the characters are given the attention they deserve, and there were some fairly interesting characters in this film, including Beast.As for the final battle, I was disappointed. There was not a lot of intelligence put into the battle; instead it was full of more explosions than anything else. I didn't think Brett Ratner did the mutants justice with the battle. The one scene that shows that best was the battle between Pyro and Iceman. I was really excited to see this battle. We had seen plenty of evidence of the great power exhibited by both mutants already, and I knew that it would be epic. It wasn't. Ratner did not take this battle *nearly* as far as he could have. It could have been great! But instead, the two mutants just have a brief tug-of-war type fight and then it's over.The screenplay was the biggest problem with The Last Stand, but Brett Ratner did not do his job either. It's sad because I have liked three of Ratner's other movies and I expected good from him here. I had seen him do some great work in the first two Rush Hour movies and Red Dragon, but his direction style is disappointingly dull in The Last Stand. I expected more out of him. I didn't get it.I wasn't even all that impressed with the special effects in this film. I thought they were wonderful in the first two movies, but all special effects after 2003 look entirely too CGI, and The Last Stand is no exception.I was disappointed and disheartened by The Last Stand. I was left wanting more out of the X-Men series rather gaining any satisfaction from it. I want to see an X-Men 4 with Bryan Singer back as a screenwriter and director because I want some great character work done again. X-Men: The Last Stand was not the kind of X-Men movie I wanted.4/10",X-Men - The Last Stand

The people rating this lower than 5 out of 10 need to stop watching movies altogether for one year -- when they came back they would suddenly be appreciating movies a whole lot more.I wonder how many viewers consider how difficult it is to create such an FX laden picture. AND to make the story solid and interesting. AND to develop the characters so that we care about them and their arc. This movie did all of that. AND added humor.Once again 'Picard' is leading the way. I warmed up more to Wolverine's performance in this one as well. Several new characters were introduced without spoiling things and adding new powers of course -- creating a massive amount of CGI expense, yet handled seamlessly.The twist in this movie is a good plot choice, assisting in concluding the trilogy and providing an 'ultimate threat'.I only wish there was a true special edition.

386,nived84,"Oh, c'mon! You know there's gonna be another one!",6,30 May 2006,"After three years since Bryan Singer wowed audiences with X2: X-Men United the X-Men are finally back again on the big screen, but sadly without Singer. Nope, he's gone on to resurrect ""The Man of Steel"" in Superman Returns, which will be unleashed on theaters this June. Filling in for Singer on The Last Stand is Brett Ratner, whose previous films include both Rush Hour movies, The Family Man and Red Dragon. I was skeptical about Ratner being able to live up to the intensity of Singer's films, but I found myself pleasantly surprised when all was said and done. X-Men: The Last Stand looks a lot like the first two films, but with a rock'em and sock'em energy of the 90's X-Men cartoon, and that's not really such a bad thing.The Last Stand is by and large the biggest, loudest and best piece of action to hit theaters this year, just beating out M:I:III, largely due to the film's exciting climatic finale. This episode in the series claims to be the last, but believe me, when a second sequel rakes in over a hundred and twenty million dollars at the box office in it's opening weekend, you can bet there will be at least another entry in the series. This time the X-Men face possible extermination when a possible ""cure"" for the mutant ""problem"" is discovered in a young mutant boy, who is now locked up in a laboratory on Alcatraz Island. Meanwhile Magneto, joined by his new ally, Pyro, try to rally a bunch of mutants to fight back and wipeout the discovered cure. Professor X feels a disturbance in the force and tells Storm and Wolverine to venture up to Alkaline Lake (where the last film ended), where they discover an unconscious Jean Grey. Apparently Jean was able to survive the collapse of the dam and as it turns out there's a dark and powerful force inside Jean's mind that is more destructive than any other mutant on the planet, and it's only a matter of time before her fury, known as ""The Phoenix"", is unleashed upon the world. Dunt, dunt, duh! All the mutants that weve come to love (and hate) are back, including Professor X, Wolverine, Magneto, Cyclops, Storm, Rouge, Pryo, Mystique and Iceman, but they aren't alone, there's a ton of new mutants that fill the screen during The Last Stand, and the X-Men have a few new recruits including Colossus, Kitty Pryde and Henry McCoy aka ""Beast"" or as Wolverine calls him, ""Fuzzball"", played well by a blue and hairy Kelsey Grammar. With all the additional mutants I must say I'm still disappointed that Gambit didn't make it into the picture, but by piling a ton of new mutants into the film is allows for some pretty fun and wildly inventive action sequences, which the film is littered with and in top form from beginning to end. And they finally show us the ""Danger Room"". It's about time, isn't it? Where does X3 stand in terms of the trilogy? Well, it isn't quite as well structured as the first two films, but The Last Stand is by far the most ambitious of the three, so some of it's short comings can be forgiven for trying, and for the most part succeeding, at doing something wider and crazier than the first two films. Just watch the Golden Gate Bridge sequence or the intense final battle at Alcatraz and try and tell me that that wasn't as intense or was less exciting than the climax of X2. The film certainly lives up the first two films, and in some ways even manages to surpass them. X-Men: The Last Stand is the best piece of summer entertainment so far this year and with a Superman and some more Pirates on the way, things are lookin' pretty good! And if this is in fact the last film in the series, although I seriously doubt it, at least it went out with a bang. Stay through the end credits to see an extra scene that'll leave you scratching your head and going ""What the...?""",X-Men - The Last Stand
387,Lursa,What would you be willing to do to fit in?,9,28 May 2006,MAJOR SPOILERS Below...proceed with caution. S P O I L E R S ! Turn back NOW!!We all wrestle with the problem of what would we give up to get what we want. For minorities this is a major issue. How much of who you really are will you sacrifice just to seem like 'everyone else.' I think the movie approaches this topic well. This is not a documentary so the problem is not approached in that manner. The results are satisfying despite that.This incarnation of X-Men is the best of the lot. I have enjoyed the franchise from the beginning and eagerly anticipated this one. It did not disappoint. The younger X-Men really hit their stride in this one. It is a dark piece and a bit heavy-handed at times...but it works. Characters lose their powers. characters die. Lots of characters die. The most shocking was Professor Xavier. Others die and their deaths deeply felt by the others. Rogue decides to give up her powers so she can touch people...especially Bobby. I think I was most disappointed in the casual way Magneto discarded Mystique after she lost her powers saving his life. I enjoyed this movie. Go see it in the theater's to get the full effect then see it again. It demands more than one viewing.,X-Men - The Last Stand
388,moviegeek310,"X3 Disappoints, but is Still Enjoyable",6,26 May 2006,"I want so much to say ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" was completely awesome, and that it rocked my socks, but unfortunately the film disappointed me. Clocking in at only 105 minutes, it seemed very rushed, and confusing at times. Also, the characters- and some awesome new mutants- got barely any screen time, and were not fleshed out at all. It's strange because ""X2"" was 133 minutes and was all about Wolverine/Logan trying to discover who he is, and where he came from. It was a character driven movie, but in this film we find out nothing more about him or any of the mutants.In ""X3"" a cure has been found for mutation and the mutants become divided. Some welcome the cure so they can become ""normal"", and others are angry that they would even think of trying to cure them. The latter is led by Magneto (a brilliant Ian McKellen) who decides to destroy all who oppose mutation. He gathers himself an army, and it's up to Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his small band of heroes to stop Magneto.Some of the acting and dialogue were corny, and a few scenes had the audience- including me- laughing out loud at the sheer stupidity of some scenes. Monkeys at a keyboard, I tell ya. Jeesh. It wasn't all bad, heavens no. There are just some things that severely disappointed me, and will upset any hardcore fans. Kelsey Grammar as Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast is awesome, especially when he battles the baddies. Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, who is also a cool new addition, delivers a line that had the audience roaring with laughter. And of course, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine always steals the movies he's in. Plus Wolverine's claws rock! One other thing I didn't like was the music; it never seemed to fit the scene quite well, like the composer wrote the music before the movie was finished. But of course, the F/X and the action were great. And even though some dialogue was bad, some were hilariously good. New director Brett Ratner (the ""Rush Hour"" films) added some great humor to the film. I do wish Bryan Singer who directed the other two did this one, but he opted to do ""Superman Returns"" instead, which stands to reason.Overall, the first and second ""X-Men"" were a million times better, and this one failed in a way. Though it is still good summer fare, and enjoyable for the most part.I give it 6 out of 10. (I wish I could give it a higher score, I really do.)

389,ToddWebb,It was okay! Not as bad as they say!,7,27 May 2006,"** MINOR spoilers **No, it's not nearly as bad as people claim.I saw this opening night (well, Friday). The theater was packed. There weren't many ooh's and ahhh's as one would hope on opening night. The theater was a bit quiet, marked by only a few chuckles. But I still felt entertained.Mind you, I despised the 2nd X-Men movie. So my expectations were lowered here.I understand the complaints about the introduction of so many new mutants and the number of previous characters who were dismissed. But I really thought they were merely responding to so many fans' complaints from the first 2 movies. All I ever heard was, ""Aww, where's this character?"" and ""What about so-and-so?!"" Well, here in the 3rd movie, you certainly cannot say that! And for me, having never read the comic, I liked the new (new to me anyways) characters.True, the Phoenix didn't have much to do. But there was plenty of other action on the screen to keep me happy. And the characters were not developed at all. True. But that's the price you pay, folks, for having all your precious mutants in one movie! I seriously doubt this is the last X-Men movie. With the way they've introduced so many new characters -- particularly young kids -- and removed older characters, this franchise can live on for a long time. And if you stay until the very end of the credits, you'll see they have certainly left themselves room for a sequel.I was disappointed in some scenes where the special FX lacked. But there were other scenes that truly delivered, so I quickly forgave the shortcomings. My only real complaint -- with all the movies, not just this one -- is that every human is a bad-guy. I suspect, in the real world, people would be hoping-to-God for a mutant child, because everyone want's their child to be special, to stand out, to be unique. And oftentimes the mutants (the X-Men) help the humans. They've talked to the President (X-Men 2) and have protected humans with their powers. Stories like these X-Men movies have plenty of room for interesting dialogue about human nature: prejudice, social class, etc. But they're all about action.Don't expect character development. Enjoy some good fight scenes. Have a chuckle or two. Overall, it's a so-so movie.So for you X-Men super-fans, maybe it sucked. For a guy who loved the first X-Men movie and likes to see action and special effects, it wasn't bad.Hope you enjoy it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
390,joelmulder96,Underappreciated,8,3 May 2021,"Allright, I'll admit, there are some serious issues with this film, both in terms of film form and narrative. The visual effects are pretty bad, even for 2006, and there are some things in the story that just don't make any sense. But still, the vibe of the X-Men that I have grown to love is there, and the political take on the concept of mutants is done really well. It has some cool action sequences, cool mutants showing off their abilities, and a couple of silly one-liners. Plus, there is Elliot Page as Kitty, which is just lovely to have in this X-Men team. Overall, this film has a lot of feel. Is that a subjective verdict? It most certainly is.",X-Men - The Last Stand
391,RandomTask-AP,"Nitpicking aside, the X-Men trilogy goes out with a bang.",6,4 June 2006,"The ""X-Men"" have never been in greater jeopardy. There are forces beyond their control pushing in new directions with no one having an idea of how it will end. A change in leadership has spun the team into perilous uncertainty. Will this beloved world fall into the control of the wrong hands? Now that's enough speculation about the film's production team, what about the movie? The characters caught in the crossfire of mutant and anti-mutant mayhem will have to wait a moment.The real question about the third installment of the ""X-Men"" is how well does Brett Ratner helm one of the favorite superhero franchises in Hollywood. Happily, this is not a changing of the guard akin to Richard Lester getting the ""Superman"" reigns from Richard Donner nor is it like Tim Burton's exit from the ""Batman"" franchise that allowed some studio exec to give Joel Schumacher permission to turn the Dark Knight's escapades into some unholy Vegas lightshow. Although there are spots where the film clearly lacks Singer's touch, Ratner makes ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" into a wild and compelling summer sci-fi ride.Some time has passed since the team of mutants lost Dr Jean Grey (Famke Jenssen) when she sacrificed herself to the crushing waters of a faulty dam in order to save her lover, Scott/Cyclops (James Marsden), and her teammates. Cyclops was crushed by her loss. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Ororo/Storm (Hale Berry) and Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) are continuing to educate and work with young mutants when it is announced that the government, otherwise friendly towards mutants, is working with a major drug company to distribute a ""cure"" for the mutant gene. They get the news from an old friend and government official, mutant scientist Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar) who is also referred to as Beast because of his superhuman athletic gifts and undisguisable fury blue appearance. The manufacturer, Warren Worthington II (played by Michael Murphy), has a falling out with his mutant winged son, Warren III (Ben Foster), when he tries to administer the cure.While debate sparks among the heroes and brings to bear the movie's central question, others do not take the news so lightly. Mutant terrorist, Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen, fresh from ""The DaVinci Code"") is freeing a myriad of loyalists and rallying mutant masses into an army for the Brotherhood of Mutants. This is coupled with the discovery that Jean Grey survived in a sort of telekinetic coma and a split personality has developed from the trauma. Her second personality, referred to as The Phoenix, is disillusioned and violently angry; lashing out at almost anyone. She joins Magneto's group, and the stage is set for the climactic raid on the drug company's militarized headquarters at the renovated Alcatraz Island.Most of the main group are familiar with each other, and the additions play well into the mix. If the preceding paragraph contained too many names to follow, wait until you see the film. There are enough speaking parts to make Robert Altman's head spin. Even being familiar with the comic books, there are too many names and story threads for a single film. However, they all pique our interest, even if most aren't fully explored - ie: Angel & The Phoenix. (Although, I wonder what kind of hero movie Altman - or even original Singer replacement, Matthew Vaughn, - could have made with this milieu of characters and conflicts?) Certainly McKellen and Stewart continue to lend instant gravitas to a story that some would sideline to Saturday morning reruns. Kitty Pride (Ellen Page, the vengeful teen from ""Hard Candy"") is as much the hero as vulnerable kid, but you don't suspect it till the chips are down. The best addition to the cast is Kelsey Grammar's Beast. The prosthetics sell the hero, but with the voice of Frasier underneath them, there is a noble and distinguished quality that projects someone caught at the crux of civil duty, a communal obligation and a conflicting personal desire.The heart of this movie is the cast and the script that never fails to challenge the issues it raises, albeit with super-powered throw-downs. What happens when part of who you are keeps you from mixing with the rest of society? What if someone could just offer you a pill or a shot to take that part of you away? What if the government or an organization began forcing you or people like you to take that treatment? What would your moral obligation be? How far would you be willing to go to fulfill it? While everyone is tossing these about, relationships are forming and breaking with tectonic shifts. Powers are not without their consequences. Major characters not only lose their abilities, but some also lose their lives. This is not a movie that is playing it safe to ensure the franchise. Although the last few minutes leave the sequel door open, everyone involved has come for the sake of the story.Overall, ""The Last Stand"" is on a par with the original, but not the praised operatic second chapter. Ratner has more ability when it comes to letting things rip, than letting things simmer and grow to a boil. Quiet moments should take longer, and some moments come precariously close to camp. He simply doesn't have the same knack for capturing intimacy that Singer does. John Powell's score is appropriately understated and works carefully for every moment, more like Michael Kamen's. However, Ottman's themes really made you hang onto the edge of your seat during ""X2"". (These things are not mentioned to detract from either Ratner or Powell, but rather to praise those who came before and manage your expectations.) It's obvious that Ratner has a great appreciation for the vision of the first two installments, and he honors nearly everything that originally brought fans to the theaters. So, this is a rousing, if mottled, addition to the series. 7 out of 10",X-Men - The Last Stand
392,tripxyde,An X-tremely Magnificent Instant Classic,9,24 May 2006,"This is the final installment to what is now known as the X-MEN Trilogy. Known as the ""Children of the Atom"" and the children of human evolution, MUTANTS have become widespread throughout the globe. But a ""cure"" for being a mutant was unveiled and this puts into motion the war between the radical mutants who seek to overthrow mankind which has shown mutant community the extent of human prejudice, and the X-men, a mutant group who would stand to defend humanity from mutants who would use their powers to threaten the rest of the defenseless human society.When the comics series ""X-men"" was first conceived back in the 1960's by Marvel comics' father, living legend, Stan Lee (which makes an appearance in this film), it was to become one of the most profound comic book sagas, that which is way ahead of its time. Mutants have become a metaphor for the kinds of people who have become victims of prejudice, alienation, and fear. May it be because of race, culture, sex, appearance, religion, or even physical characteristics, whether that characteristic may be a deformity or not. Mutants are feared for what they can do, alienated for what they appear to be, and hated simply for what they are. Not only that; in the U.S., the term ""Mutant"" has been a slang term used to defame and demean those who are different and those who don't fit in with the rest of society.Right now, we live in a world wherein equality must prevail, even though factors like terrorist paranoia and biological threats continues to exist, there must be an undying movement for equality. With the cultural and technological advancements of the new millennium making the world smaller for us all, equality and tolerance must exist, because division and inequality might threaten to destroy us all.One of this film's subplots involves a ""cure"" for being a mutant. In one way or another, the storyline subliminally raises the question; ""Would you resort to change or alter yourself just to fit in to the rest of society, assuming that your uniqueness is never really a deformity or an abnormality?"" Metaphorically, it could be like asking questions such as ""If given a chance, would an Asian try to alter his looks just to look Caucasian or maybe less ethnic? If given a chance, would a homosexual alter his/her sexuality just for the sake of fitting in?"" More or less, it could even make us think of our opinions on plastic surgery or playing god with the advances of technology? The film subliminally opens your mind up from the metaphors and to relevant social issues.After the ending of the trilogy's second episode, entitled ""X-2: X-Men United"", it is inevitable and understandable to those familiar with the X-men series that what will happen next is what is known as the ""Phoenix saga"" which is the storyline wherein Jean Grey is resurrected into the twisted character known as The Dark Phoenix. But it is quite obvious, from the trailers and the publicity of the film, that the main villain in the third installment of the trilogy still is Magneto, and that this third will obviously become the grand finale of Magneto's great war that he wishes to rage and has been talking about ever since the first film. And that the Dark Phoenix storyline is smartly blended along with the Magneto storyline, among other subplots yet to be revealed. But understandably, the film is designed to be a blockbuster big-explosion/big-stunts action bonanza, so understandably, the stunts, the actions, and the special effects would take the front seat in making this film a classic.Looking back months ago, it was hard to imagine a director like Brett Ratner, whose credits include the mediocre ""Red Dragon"" and the popcorn flicks ""Rush Hour"" 1 & 2, to take on what was Bryan Singer's job of breathing life into what is the greatest superhero team saga in comics' history. Thankfully, for all of us, this third X-men movie stays true to the mood, tone, and overall continuity and consistency with the first two films. With the last X-men movie etching itself to be one of the best superhero movies of all time, this sequel never lets down to shine much more and manages to rise into a new level of cinematic high.However, in one way or another, the film may tend to rely on the idea that the viewer has either watched the two other X-men films, and/or is also familiar with the entire X-men mythos; From the characters, to their powers, to their capabilities and convictions. Not unless you are familiar with such information, you should open your ears and hear out each and every important detail of the storyline.The film's superpower action is very inventive, never redundant and is way ahead of falling off the cliché hook. Its script and storyline stretches itself far from being predictable. You may consider yourself familiar with the numerous popular X-men story lines, but even that will still less likely exempt you from the film's jaw-dropping surprises; moments in this film which, I'm sure that you will agree with me when I say, that it happens more than once. In addition, I would advice for you not to leave the theater after the end credits because there is a bonus extra scene. A perfectly satisfying epilogue for this final chapter.X-MEN: The Last Stand is this summer's juggernaut blockbuster sci-fi-action-adventure megamovie! A never miss! It is a comic nerd's wet-dream come true! A definite superhero saga movie to end all superhero sagas. Up to this date, the Holy Grail of superhero team movies; An X-traordinarily Superior X-perience!

393,zurnd,Falls Right in the Middle,7,4 March 2013,"After X2, I was really looking forward to the third installment of the X-Men saga. When the film came out, some were happy with what the third film had to offer, while others were angered to the point of ripping every X-Men comic book in their household. I on the other hand had mixed feelings on X-Men: The Last Stand, overall liking the film, but feeling that it could have been improved in some areas. The new director of the series, Brett Ratner, really tried new things and did something unlike Singer did, but I think Ratner's X-Men 3 falls flat in some spots and really doesn't live up to the previous two installments. It had things I liked and things I disliked, but overall, X-Men: The Last Stand is an average film that would turn a lot of X-fans off the series for quite sometime. Let's talk about the pros. Like the previous two films, X3 really digs in deep with the political matters and mutant protesting. The inclusion of Kelsey Grammar as Hank Mccoy/Beast really makes the mutants more heard in the face of the humans. The humans, as corrupt as they are portrayed in this film, view mutants as sick beings and form a cure to rid them of their mutant abilities. Both the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants oppose of the cure, and while the X-Men continue on their quest for mutant acceptance in society, Magneto's Brotherhood plans to overthrow the humans and take out the source of the cure, which in fact is a mutant named Leech. The tension between the good side and the bad side really shines in this film and you can feel the motivation of each character, especially Magneto, who recruits several hundred mutants into his league to stop the humans from trying to make mutants more like them. Another thing I like is that Professor X, despite all the crap he endures in this film, continues preaching his philosophy and optimistic point of view of each situation. Like he did with Captain Jean-Luc, Patrick Stewart really makes Professor X a kindly father like figure to many of the film's main characters. Also pleasant in the film is the overall themes of corruption and deception. The character of Jean Grey/Phoenix is manipulated by Magneto as she finds that she can no longer find her place among the X-Men. The character of Warren Worthington/Angel is forced to endure the cure against his will, for his father is the one who developed the cure from Leech. As he is almost injected with it, he uses his massive feathered wings to fly out a window and he later joins the X-Men. Another theme of the film is choosing fate. The character of Rogue has to decide whether to take the cure or not, for she wants to be able to touch people and not inflict any pain upon them. And kudos to the filmmakers for adding the Days of Future Past simulation in the Danger Room at the film's opening. It was great to see the mutants' powers put to good use and for Wolverine and Colossus to perform the ""Fastball Special"", Wolverine beheading a Sentinel in the process. Now let's get to the cons. Too many characters are killed off or pushed aside in this film and many characters are not as developed as they should be. I could go on and on about how Cyclops was killed off about 20 minutes into the film, but it has been said dozens of times already and I'm not even going to bother talking about it now. I will say that people hate this because the promotional images for X3 showed Cyclops in full costume walking alongside the other X-Men as if he was a major part of the film and that James Marsden left X3 to play a meager role in Bryan Singer's Superman Returns. Other characters to get the shaft are Rebecca Romijn's Mystique and even Patrick Stewart's Professor X bites the dust almost an hour into the film. It's not that these characters' demises aren't dramatic, for deaths of major characters can work if done right, but each of these characters fall in such fast paced, anti-climatic ways. It doesn't really add that much tension.The wooden acting that was present in the previous two films is also amplified in the third film. Ben Foster's Angel could have been acted out a little better and his character could have been developed a bit more. Anna Paquin's Rogue was a little flat, but then again, her acting was also flat in the previous films. Even Ellen Page (pre-Juno) as Kitty Pryde could have used a little more depth, although it's good to see Kitty Pryde actually play a major part in an X-Men film rather than just have a brief cameo like in the previous films. So X-Men: The Last Stand falls right in the ""okay"" category. It's good for what it is, but not near as good as what X-Men and X2 had to offer. Take it for what it is, or just plain out avoid it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
394,erikgloor,The Best X Yet!,8,30 May 2006,"No one will accuse the makers of the X-Men films of challenging the intellectual capacity of their target audience -- or any audience for that matter.The notion that the subtle process of natural selection could spawn the kinds of mutations in human beings that would yield a sub-sector of the populace with powers that enable them to, for example, walk through walls and shoot lasers from their eyes is, of course, preposterous.But this is comic-book reality and the stories are certainly not about mutations or evolution per se.The stories are about being different. About possessing special talents and sensibilities. And most importantly, what to do with them. Whether one succumbs to the temptation to squander one's special talents or instead takes the time to discover how these talents might best serve society. Sure, the Cold War is over and the cultural pressures to conform are less homogeneous and institutionalized. But what people do about fitting in and what they do with unique power are both fundamental to the human experience and inasmuch as the X-Men stories draw on these, they will always succeed.And let's face it, they're just plain fun. A more colorful and satisfying group of superheroes has yet to be articulated. What people love about Marvel superheroes in comparison to their DC brethren is their humanity. The down-side of being a super-dude is more fully explored. Sure Wonder Woman's got guy issues and Superman's gotta worry about glowing gravel from back home, but these are certainly more symbolic and less tangible heels for Achilles to have.In the present picture, 'X-Men: The Last Stand,' the preternaturally gifted seem to have increased in number and political standing. We discover that mutations can range from the kind that can make you a superhero to the kind that just make you pesky. One new bad-guy can sprout quills like a porcupine and proves dangerous only to those standing a foot away or less.But 'Magneto,' the head of the dissatisfied and violent wing of the mutant populace is on a recruiting drive and seems hell-bent on turning non-mutants into second class citizens before the same is done to himself and his constituency by those he disdainfully refers to as ""home sapiens."" The conflict builds as the government, still heading a vastly non-mutant majority discovers a way to turn mutants into normal people.And then the real wild-card presents itself in the form of a resurrected Dr. Jean Grey, the powerful telepath who perished in the second film. She's back, but her sinister id is in control now and she can't be reasoned with and won't be contained. She has become 'The Phoenix,' a tricked-out, red-headed version of Grey, still played lusciously by the ever-beautiful Famke Janssen, and man, you do not want to mess with her. She'll drop a house on you.With which side will her whirlwind of emotion find allegiance? Magneto and the forces of darkness? OR with Professor Charles Xavier and the other, more enlightened mutants? Adding to this delicious conflict of titans are a few new mutants to replace those who perish or become defanged: 'The Angel,' played by Ben Foster, 'The Beast,' played by Kelsey Grammar, and most entertainingly, 'The Juggernaut,' played by Vinnie Jones. In one of the most engaging scenes in the film, the Juggernaut must chase an X-Man -- in this case, X-girl -- who can walk through walls like a ghost, by crashing through the walls like a human wrecking ball.Still occupying the center of the films, Hugh Jackman's 'Wolverine' serves again as ambassador to the audience and does so flawlessly.In the end, 'X-Men: The Last Stand' does what sequels do best. It builds on the universe already established by its predecessors and does not try to duplicate them with formulaic story-lines. In true serial fashion, characters die, others move on, and new ones are introduced. It is a gorgeous film full of action and adventure and is never dull. It's the kind of movie for which movies were invented. I loved it from start to finish.This movie review by Erik Gloor",X-Men - The Last Stand

I'll tell you what, though, she was meant for the silver screen.On the silver screen, Jean Grey turns into an intergalactic Carrie. She gets really blue in the face, and stuff around the house start breaking. Her eyes get really black, and she starts to look like one of those space vampires from LIFEFORCE (1985, starring Patrick Stewart).But ... and this should apply brakes to the wheel, if Phoenix happened to wander off screen ... say for a makeup session, and the rest of the cast were lounging around talking mutant politics. Only then, my eyes would also wander of screen down to my wristwatch.If I wanted to talk about mutant politics, I'd join Parliament! Aside from Patrick Stewart and Ian MacKellan, I don't think any of the other Marvel characters took their Shakespeare classes... except for Kelsey Grammar maybe. Who better for President's Council? He seems like a reasonable guy.But no matter how blue Beast's fur gets, or how easily the Mack trucks jackknife in half, or how spiny the porcupine gets, I still want to see an Xmen 3 that surpasses the X-men 2. How can XMEN: LAST STAND do the X-men legacy justice when former director Bryan Singer hops off to do the Superman movie? I picture Nightcrawler, jumping through the walls of the White House, and then with a whack to the head, he hits a brick wall.I won't go in depth about WHY I didn't like this movie. I'd rather focus on the positive things in life. Like Famke Janssen as Jean Grey. Did you know, that she was born in the Netherlands? And did you know that she is making a solo PHOENIX movie?Just kidding, but I think it's a good idea. They could hire the guy who directed Silence of the Lambs to run the project.Jimboduck-dot-com",X-Men - The Last Stand
397,GrimmBrother,Special effects will blow you away,6,24 December 2006,"X Men: The Last Stand is unfortunately the third and last in the X Men film series, but nonetheless, it is a brilliant epic filled with action, suspense, romance and adventure.In the third film, a cure has been found for mutants. Many mutants disagree with the cure while others are more than happy to accept it. In the meantime, an old X Men character is resurrected and now possesses a power like no other mutant in the world. This power is potentially dangerous as it can control anything and everything.Magneto takes it upon himself to find the powerful mutant so he and his fellow ""bad guy"" mutants can destroy the cure and humans for good.X Men 3 features state of the art special effects that will blow you away. The emotion that the actors put into their characters comes across very well. There isn't much to complain about, only that it is most unfortunate that 3 extremely important characters are killed while another 2 important mutants are cured. I won't say anymore, you will have to go check out this film for yourself.X Men fans, don't fret. Even though this is the last in the X Men film series this isn't the last we'll see of Wolverine. A spin off, Wolverine, will be released in 2007. It hasn't even started filming yet and only Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine, has signed up for the project.",X-Men - The Last Stand
398,royale_w_cheez44,The Last Stand? My Ass.,4,9 July 2006,"I loved X-Men. It had a brilliant script that combined character development, drama, humor, politics, and action seamlessly. It was the film that basically single-handedly revived the superhero genre and brought us great films like Spiderman, Hellboy, and Batman Begins. X2 was even better, stepping up the action, story, and drama. Bryan Singer, the director of the X-Men and X2 worked miracles, and hiring him for X-Men 3 seemed like a no-brainer.Yet, for some reason, it did not happen. Fox Studios waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. Until Bryan decided to move on to do Superman Returns. Fox could have (and should have) waited for Singer to finish Superman and work on X-Men 3. Since they decided to get the film out fast, they threw together a half-assed script, hired a dependable (but uninspired) director, and pulled all of the stops much to the audience's dismay. What could have been was a fantastic finale to a great trilogy. The finished product was a disappointing and forgettable film that doesn't live up to the first two X-Men movies.To be completely fair, X-Men 3 is not a terrible movie. It has a great introduction with a young mutant boy plucking his wings out. It's really sad to watch, almost like Singer's brilliant Holocaustal intro to X-Men 1. That being said, what Brett Ratner lacks in creativity and dramatic intuition, he makes up in excitement. Yes, he does bring much excitement to the picture, so you can at least count on not being bored. In all honesty, though, X3 was not Ratner's fault. It was the screenwriters'.When I say ""pull all of the stops"", I wasn't kidding. They cram the movie full of mutants that never really do anything and really have no point. Plus, the new villains really do nothing and are really lame. But here is what really ruins the films for me: The writers kill off SO MANY CHARACTERS in a HALF ASSED WAY. They do this only to basically write themselves a loophole so they can find a way out.For God's sake, it's almost like they knew what they were doing was WRONG. Scott dies, but you never see it on screen. Charles, dies, but he is alive in another body at the end. Jean dies, but will most likely come back to life anyway. Rouge, Mystique, and Magneto ALL are injected with a cure for the Mutant X gene, but at the end you are given a clue that maybe it doesn't work. Not only did they insult the intelligence of the general public, but they also contradicted the title: ""THE LAST STAND"". They had in mind that this was in no way the last film. The only way this could have been handled worse is if Logan woke up from a dream at the end of the movie to find out that everything was okay.I wanted to love this film. I really did. And there is some to like. On occasion, Jean's super-disintegration powers look visually amazing. And, like I said, the film is exciting enough to keep one entertained. Plus, Kelsey Grammar makes a pretty good Beast. If only they would have had more time to put this together, then they could have fleshed out Beast and every other character in the film.I think I have said enough about this film. A fantastic series was brought to a painfully unspectacular ending because of the studio's desire to get the film out. The result: a mediocre script and an instantly forgettable movie. If you can see this film with low expectations and can forget how brilliant X-Men and X-Men II were, then you may enjoy this film for what it's worth. Just maybe.",X-Men - The Last Stand
399,highkite,Good for moviegoers but disappointing for comic fanatics!,6,3 June 2006,"There's so much to say about a movie that has the biggest weekend opening in the history of cinema, especially one that has two predecessors and is based on the most popular Marvel comic book franchise. The first impression of X3: The Last Stand is a fairly good one. It starts off strong and creates much suspense, introduces new exciting characters and cleverly backtracks a few of the character's past lives. And although the movie is very fast-paced and incredibly cinematic, that's all the movie really has going for it.Had I walked into the theater being a small fan, or not a fan at all, of the X-Men comic books and TV show, I would have thoroughly been impressed. However, that was my big disadvantage; I already knew everything there is to know about X-men. The movie makes almost no attempt to pay homage to the original comic books. Yes, we have all the same characters and all the superheroes, but that's about it. Strange and shocking twists make the movie almost disappointing to any big X-men fan. And maybe the intention of the writer/director was to make X3 the very last movie, they left almost no room for a continuing storyline. Wouldn't we all be very shocked and disappointed if some crazy money grubbing freak made a Batman movie in which Batman himself dies? I know I'd be disappointed.But having said that, the movie makes up for what seems to be a disjointed plot. We're exposed to endless action and pretty interesting and strong special effects. For me to rate a movie high, it has to achieve something extraordinary. Once I sunk my mind into the movie and forgot that it's based on a comic book, I began to enjoy it. Enjoy? I really liked it! Countless incredibly action-packed scenes followed by surprisingly clever humor was enough for me to be entertained. Of course, seeing my favorite X-men character, Angel, come to life was incredible.The acting in the movie is mediocre at best. Even Sir Ian McKellen seems very stiff and uninspired as the vicious Magneto, while Halle Berry made me wonder why she ever won an Oscar. Hugh Jackman delivers a somewhat raw performance but quickly recovers when his more sentimental scenes are shown. The only performance worth writing about is that of Famke Janssen, who captures Jean (Phoenix) Gray and adds some fire to it. She enthusiastically portrays a creepy anti-hero and yet we still feel sympathetic. As she struggles between two ""worlds"" she brilliantly sways us into different powerful emotions. The rest of the cast is quickly forgotten. Even Kelsey Grammar as Beast fails to convince us. There is almost nothing inspiring about the acting and absolutely no motivation is shown for their actions.Overall, X3: The Last Stand is your typical blockbuster flick. Once you learn to let go of the whole ""it doesn't stay true to the comic books"" ideal, you realize that it's actually quite entertaining. Sometimes though it's hard to get rid of a grudge, and I'd say I'm being generous for giving the movie a 6/10, but I'm a huge fan of anything X-men and was quite impressed with the technical achievements of the movie. I guess when it comes down to it, if you're a regular moviegoer and can handle just about any kind of movie, you'll love it, but if you just cannot stand movies that go in the opposite direction from what the original story should be, then you may find yourself regretting you ever paid 12$ for it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
400,newfiesailor,X men 3,7,9 September 2006,"Last of the series is the weakest. Although there were good action sequences, lots of new mutants and some fine acting, it does not have the same panache as the first 2. Too many things were added just to clue up the series, too many character deaths and the story is not as well developed.I really didn't think that they could mess up this series but they did. Although the special effects were great, it seemed more of an eye candy treat than anything else. That made it an empty shell compared to the first 2 movies. A lot would have to do with the departure of Bryan Singer. Rather than focusing on the story of a few characters as the first 2 did, there were too many characters popping up and as a result, the story was spread too thin.But heck, this movie is not all bad. Juggernaut and Dark Phoenix are great and Magneto's power displays were fantastic. Wolverine, Rogue and Storm were weaker as was the side story of Angel. Mystique is almost non existent. A weak conclusion to a great series. Or have we seen it too many times before?",X-Men - The Last Stand
401,Kevin_Maness,thank goodness it's the last one!,6,8 June 2006,"I saw X-Men 3 the other night, and it doesn't really merit a long comment here, so this will be brief.I went for action and entertainment, and I guess that's what I got. But I find that it's hard to separate a desire for entertainment from a desire for a quality story. I mean, I'm not thoroughly entertained by a massive display of special effects and rapid movement. X-Men 3, therefore, is only partly satisfying. Overall, I think it succumbed to the same flaw that damned all the Batman movies after Tim Burton's original one: too many characters. I guess this would be a challenge for any superhero movie about teams of heroes and villains, but it's especially evident in this third X-Man movie. For me, and I'm no comic book aficionado, the potential of modern comic stories is in the depth of their characters. Frank Miller's Batman, for instance, is not just an all-around good American guy in tights--he's a real, aging, conflicted man who fights crime for a host of sometimes-contradictory reasons. In X-Men 3, all the complexity of the characters is stripped down to a couple of chin-quivering moments for an otherwise under-written and disappointingly lame Rogue, a few seconds of epic indecision for Wolverine, and an almost completely unbelievable flash of remorse by Magneto. I didn't care about any of the major characters, and there were so many nameless and personality-less minor characters that I didn't really care about them either after their first couple special-effects laden stunts.Maybe this kind of ensemble cast demands a comic book format that can unfold over time and across hundreds of pages (say, Grant Morrison's run writing for The New X-Men). Or, maybe it demands a deliberately designed series of movies, written as a series and not a sequence of more-or-less stand-alone sequels. I'm thinking something like the Lord of the Rings trilogy or the the Samurai trilogy, or even the (less successful) Matrix trilogy. The makers of these movie epics realized that their visions could only be realized over the course of several films, and they were wise enough not to try to cram the visions into a single 2-hour blockbuster.I would love to see a comic book movie with that kind of conviction. Can comic book movies, like the comics themselves, rise above the mediocrity imposed by the 120 minute time limit of most mainstream popcorn-crunching movies? We have yet to see it happen, in my opinion, but the best examples made the difficult decision to focus on a very limited cast of characters (the Burton Batman, for instance, cared only about Batman and the Joker--everyone else was peripheral).Big old spoiler coming up here, so don't read if you want to preserve the mystery of the movie (and, comics fans, please don't jump all over me if this is a stupid question for whatever comic-book lover's reason): why did Wolverine have to kill Jean Grey at the end? Why didn't he just de-mutant her, like he did to Magneto? She might have grieved over her lost power, but might that have been better than dying completely? Hmmm...this just wasn't given enough play in the movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
402,wtnally,despite what you may think,9,29 May 2006,"May Contain Spoilers! this was awesome. and out of all of the other people here who say it's bad, i have no idea where they are getting it from. although i HIGHLY prefer the second X-Men better because Bryan Singer is just a awesome director, Brett Ratner did a very great job as well. and i have a very important message to those who do see this, WATCH THE MOVIE EVEN AFTER THE CREDITS!!!!! it is SO important to do so. i did really enjoy this movie i just felt there wasn't as much action as the first and second one's. a lot of critics say Brett Ratner couldn't direct this one because he does movies like the family man, rush hour, rush hour 2 and red dragon which are all good. Bryan Singer did the usual suspects, x-man, x2 and the new superman which are all awesome so some people are going to think Bryan would do a better job, which i am unsure about. Anyways i highly recommend this film to anyone it is very good. 9/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
403,Xex-Arachnid,Great movie,9,31 October 2006,"Not many movies that are based on comics or novels have done a decent job to compliment the story. The X-men series, I will give it's due credit for it being a PG movie and still being able to good. I don't know for sure but I believe that X-Men 3 is the last installment of this series but it went out with a bang, kind of.This time around, there's this mutant cure which Rogue is decided on taking, Cyclops is drowning in depression and Storm is sexy as ever. As many probably know, Jean Grae returns as 'The Phoenix' (her dark half) who nearly destroys everything and everybody and Dear ol' Prof. X paid the price for caring with his own life. Needless to say that since this movie is supposedly the last, there's a lot of twists and turns, bringing in new characters and deleting old characters. I say delete since it is a CGI movie, and a PG movie. (Oh the site of blood in one of these is too ghastly for our already over sexed, drugged and violent American youths-Jesus what would happen?)My problem with the movie is the character's actions or reactions within the story which is suspected of being done to close off the franchise, I mean to keep paying Hugh and Halle...well. Anyway, my problem with the story is concerning how Jean Grae physically survived from the water crashing down her from X-2 by using some sort of telepathic sphere to protect her body-If this was the case then what's with the all the drama-I mean shouldn't that be listed in her resume as well? Second, I don't know about you but to me, Jean's home looked a lot like Pyro's home in X-2 and I know that isn't a typical NY neighborhood. Third, at the end when Jean/Phoenix goes into flip mode, Magneto (already a civilian now) realizes that he had probably made a mistake by saying, ""my god, what have I done"" before getting running with everybody else. The reason being is because he (Magneto) should be fully aware of Jean's capabilities and he was for the most part. The big difference between him and his friend Prof. X was that X-cared, he was the humanist, where's Magneto didn't care, he was to destroy the humans at all cost due to his unswerving belief that they would destroy the mutants and by most ways, he was right. So that goes to say, why at the very end he get's scared at a mensing mutant letting off some fireworks? Wouldn't he be more older, experienced and just cool for that? Fourth, the mutant war: I would imagine that the whole fight would begin on Alcatraz but end there, come on. And Magneto's army is such a small army compared to the other stories, I did have a problem with that.But the good side to the movie is: 1. The Beast-I think the FX team did a great job with making him fleshed out along with his movements. 2. The Latina bad girl with the bad guy mutant sigil tatted on her taters. Over all it's not bad for a movie transferred from a Comic book franchise in fact, this series is the best done for it, and I'll leave it at that.And off that note, I will say that although X-Men is my favorite story from Marvel (thanks to the cartoon from FOX years ago), I am not all deep into it like that and if you're one of those people (like a Trekkie) then prepare to be disappointed, feeling like you'd have to settle for less-it is what it is.",X-Men - The Last Stand
404,jctundis,Easily the worst of the franchise.,5,22 August 2006,"The phrase I've heard repeated, and rings most true, is ""fast food"" movie. This film is more like an MTV music video with gratuitous amounts of action, and an equal amount of characters thrown in for no apparent purpose but to make the audience go ""Oooh - explosions."" Given the rich history of the X-Men, and even the limited history presented in the first two movies, this 3rd installment fails to deliver on any meaningful level. As a casual moviegoer, it is a shallow action film by a lackluster director. As a long standing X-Men fan and reader (25 years) it was a frustrating mess of characters and alterations. Juggernaut is not a mutant, but is presented as one in the film. Callisto is unrecognizable, both in appearance and abilities. Psylocke is a cameo, and non-specific in any way. She has purple hair, therefore she is Psylocke, seems to be the amount of thought put in here.On the plus side, Kelsey puts in an amazing performance as The Beast, and The Angel, while woefully under-used, is quite the achievement. Famke is as beautiful as ever, but her characters potential is wasted on a boring story.One of the most uncomfortable aspects of the movie is Storm's lines. Halle wanted more screen time, but instead of expanding her role as a team leader and a strong female character, we are tortured by a hack script, and Storm acting like a five year old simply repeating other characters lines as affirmation, and to fill up screen time. Simply awful.I give the film a 5 based pretty much on visuals alone.",X-Men - The Last Stand
405,limetalhead,Same problem as the Spider-Man Trilogy,7,11 November 2008,"As we all know, Marvel and 20th Century Fox made huge bank bringing Spider-Man and X-Men to the big screen. You knew based on the success of the first movies in each series and how they ended that there would be sequels. Spider-Man 2 and X2 X-Men United both picked up where the first movies left off and continued with great story lines and character development. However, the third installment in each series in suffered the same problem in much more depressing scripts and trying to bring about an ending. Being that this review is on X-Men The Last Stand I'll discuss that movie only.The first X-Men movie, including the credits ran a total of 1hr, 44min. Anyone who saw the movie will tell you that this was more than sufficient time to establish the main characters and the original plot. X2, including credits ran for 2hr, 13min. This running length made perfect sense as the story showed the development of more characters and help segue into the 3rd movie. X3, including credits ran for 1hr, 44min. Had X3 had the same running time as X2, it wouldn't have seemed like the writers were trying to cram so much story into so little time.Fans on X-Men knew that based on how Jean Grey died in X2 that the Dark Phoenix saga was inevitable. Also, the previews for the movie told about a mutant cure angle being used. However, both angles and others were merely used as part of the plot and not developed enough. The cure was explained as something caused by a mutant and now being marketed by the government to mutants. There was no explanation on how it came to be or how it was discovered. Jean and the Phoenix angle didn't need as much explaining as most X-Men fans knew of its origin. However, her killing Scott, Xavier trying to help her in the lab, Logan trying to help her, Jean returning home and the killing Xavier was way too rushed.As for others, character development was lacking and disappointing for a cure Mystique, Juggernaut and Archangel. After being unwillingly cured, Mystique disappears from the plot except for later on being shown in a video room helping the government. Juggernaut's powers were explained briefly and for the rest of the movie he was basically Magneto's muscle. Archangel was shown as being the son of the president of the company that manufactured the cure. The only parts he had in the plot were escaping when his father tried to cure him, coming to the mansion and saving his father at the end.As for the main story line, it didn't live up to how great the first two movies were. No one expected to see Scott or Xavier die in that fashion. Jean being in a power struggle with the Dark Phoenix was done well but not explored enough. Rogue wanting the cure wasn't a shock but they needed to explore how it would affect her emotional relationship with Bobby before she did. Magneto's war on humans from his outrage over the cure was expected but the recruiting was too rushed and the fight scenes weren't led into well.I'd love to explain more of what disappointed my but I'd rather you see the movie for yourself and form an opinion. As for now, I hope that 20th Century Fox and Marvel would consider doing a new 3rd installment to ease the consciences of those who wanted more.",X-Men - The Last Stand
406,angelicseven,Wolverine fouling up again,9,27 October 2013,"I was surprised and so glad to see Kelsey Grammar in it as Dr. Henry/Beast. What this movie seems to convey is the false notion that evil eventually prevails over good. So even though it looks like good is winning, evil is one step ahead, even of escaping justifiable wrath and surviving still. What is inconsistent is Magneto shouldn't of had any mutant powers remaining after he was injected with 4 or 5 dosages of that which would make him human, regardless if they were mental and not physical superb abilities. I never cared for the Wolverine character even when in the comicbooks. I was glad at least one favorite was kept... Storm. It seemed like when Mystique became human Phoenix took her place with Magneto and eventually it seemed she even replaced Magneto, when we were misled into believing he became human and fled with the others. The most saddest part I hated to see was Phoenix destroying Professor Charles Xavier; it seemed like reliving when Kenobi in Star Wars was killed by Darth Vader with a lightsaber. We see that when Mystique was turned human how she was betrayed & forsaken by Magneto because she was no longer any use to him. She was more beautiful as human than the blue chameleon Magneto thought was beautiful. It would of been good to see Colossus in action against Juggernaut. It is through Jean Grey we see another version of good being turned to the darkside and turning against everything she rightful loved and valued. She wasn't ready to have so much power and became uncontrollable. Even in one RoboCop movie we see how power in the wrong hands doesn't do what it should or was meant for. This is one movie I'm not eager to see again; it nearly falls in line with Watch Once type. You have to watch this movie 3 times in order to gather or see some things that can easily escape you.",X-Men - The Last Stand
407,zach-69,"Great movie, though not my favorite comicbook hero's.",10,24 March 2007,"I've never been a big X-Men fan. The movie's lived up to my expectations, and like alway's, the third film is the darkest. Same with Superman 3 and Spider-Man 3 which will be out on May 4, 2007. Great special effects, great actor's, I don't like the humor. I don't like hero's with a dark sense of humor. Even though Superman and Spider-Man are rival comicbook hero's. That's not true! Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent/Superman was very bright, funny, energetic. I LOVE CHRISTOPHER REEVE! Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man was, as my favorite actress Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane in the movie's puts...... AMAZING! The X-Men are pretty cool. My favorite being Wolverine just because he's practically invincible like The Man of Steel himself. An easter egg (this is not a spoiler.) The X-Men Mansion is the same set used on Smallville which is the story of a young Clark Kent before he becomes DC Comics greatest icon....... SUPERMAN!!!! Also the actor that play's Iceman is the twin brother of Aaron Ashmore who play's Jimy Olsen on Smallville. Great movie, lot's of fun.",X-Men - The Last Stand
408,archer191273,Hah?,10,9 June 2018,I have come to the conclusion that people on this site have taste where the sun doesn't shine. I actually think that this movie is the best in the whole franchise. I guess you'll have to watch it and be the judge yourself. Do yourself a favour and don't go off the stinky reviews on imdb. These morons are self proclaimed movie critics. I have more taste in my johnson.,X-Men - The Last Stand
409,mjk280,"Decent summer flick, bad X-Men movie",5,2 June 2006,"First of all, I agree with 90% of what the harsher reviewers are saying but I still felt the movie was enjoyable. I would not go any farther than using that word but I thought it was satisfying from a typical movie-goer's standpoint. The problem however is that I am a huge X-Men fan and from that perspective I was greatly disappointed.To be honest, I find it hard to believe that the writers, Ratner or whoever is responsible read up THAT much on the X-Men. It seemed like they either a) watched the previous 2 movies ONLY, b) read a very slim portion of the comics or c) picked up one of those X-Men character guide/encyclopedias and felt that that was enough to start creating.Singer's two X-movies were a textbook example of being faithful to the source material but changing things for the sake of cinema and plot that did not disrespect the source material and were also interesting at the same time. They were also RELEVANT.One general beef I have with superhero movies is that they have a habit of resisting to introduce some of the most popular and/or significant characters (i.e., no Venom in Spider-Man). X-Men falls in this category as well. It took 3 movies for Beast to show up and we STILL have not seen Gambit. Instead we get Kitty Pryde and Colossus, the latter of which I have no problem with but they did not use him really at all. Also, Sabretooth isn't dead we all know that so bring him back and a couple more popular villains. I'm also sick of every new X-Man introduced having to be between the ages of 12-18 but that's just me. It just seems like no one has any experience except for the main characters and that doesn't have to be.Now, on to this movie itself as an installment. The deaths were pointless and inexcusable. When Cyclops bit the dust you figured it was because Phoenix was going to go on a cold-hearted rampage since she was not herself. But no, it turned out his death really served no purpose or reasoning just like Xavier's. Did Xavier annoy her that much with his pleading that she had to kill him and not Magneto or anyone else? Phoenix's whole role was waaaay too reminiscent of a young Darth Vader from a terrible film I'd rather not mention here. Plus she had no relevant impact on the film, just killing for shock value's sake (and to give hardcore fans a heart attack).I felt one huge flaw that would've made the others much easier to swallow was that the movie couldn't decide whether to go with the cure plot or the phoenix plot so it ended up with both and with neither being explored hardly at all. Going with one (the cure and what it would mean for mutantkind) or another (X-Men vs. Magneto vying for 'control' of Phoenix) would have served the movie much, much better in my opinion.Lastly we have the characterizations. This is what I hold as evidence that the creative team only had a bare bones knowledge of the X-Men universe. Storm was giving a bigger role which, contrary to what others are saying, I didn't mind and I thought she was decent. Wolverine was just kind of there and didn't really have a personality in my opinion. Rogue was useless yet again save for serving as a plot device in the cure plot that was never realized. She just takes the cure and all of a sudden she's no longer relevant after being on screen for about 10 minutes total. Professor X was a little bit of a jerk but it didn't bother me as much as some. I thought Beast was done quite well actually. Lastly, I had my eyes on Colossus getting more screen time ever since the last movie but got screwed out of that. The last film sets it up perfectly for him to get in on the action this time around but I guess it was ignored. Angel had almost no relevance except to look cool for the trailer, as others have said.As far as the bad guys, Magneto was basically a classic bad guy instead of the yin to Xavier's yang like he should be. He had no real ideology in this movie, just being a bad guy. Pyro's character has not been developed at all since the last movie and he definitely doesn't seem strong enough to be Magneto's supporting character like Mystique was, who by the way go screwed by Magneto which was very uncharacteristic of him. Juggernaut was bad, bad, bad but if you've seen one drawing of him it's obvious his character isn't made for live action so I don't know why they even attempted it. Multiple Man (Madrox) was underused and they could've found many creative ways to use him. The rest just felt like randoms thrown in there with the exception of Callisto who we know nothing about anyways.Reading these reviews also brought something new to my attention that I took for granted: What was the point of it all and how did the events in the movie all of a sudden make everything okay? I think I would have been much more critical had I realized this terrible oversight but again as I said if you don't get too emotional about the source material I think you can at least enjoy it, although I can't blame you if you can't help it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
410,HarryWarden,X-Men. Out with a flush.,2,26 May 2006,"What a depressing experience.The big final showdown of an epic story...and I felt NOTHING. Not one little stir of emotion. This film was exactly what we all feared it was going to be: No tact, no style, no substance. It's just sad that such a wonderful intelligent series had to deteriorate into a hollow studio FX show. Mr Ratner, you certainly lived up to our low expectations.Every frame of this film feels rushed. A slew of characters were killed and cured, and I didn't even bat an eyelash. Ideas are barely explored and none of the characters get any real focus. Aside from Wolvy, Storm, and Magneto, every mutant feels like an obligatory cameo. All the actors, save for Ian McKellen, act out-of-character and hurry through their lines like they just want to get out of the movie.To be fair, this isn't entirely Ratner's fault. It took everybody working together to screw this one up. The script is atrocious. The dialogue is flat out embarrassing - it's almost all composed of badly-timed puns and quips, and some unintentionally hilarious lines (""She was sealed up in a cocoon of energy.""). The mutant cure is barely explored and nothing that was set up in the previous two films ever really amount to anything.There's a sense that Fox controlled everything here and used everyone involved as their puppets to milk the fans of their cash. This is not the X-Men we know and love.I saw this with a packed house at the Mann's Chinese in Hollywood. The theater was full of screaming X-fans and the excitement level was over-the-top. Five minutes into the film, it was dead, as if a giant vacuum had sucked all life from the theater. The ""Snakes on a Plane"" trailer (which was more brilliant than anything here) got a bigger cheer than anything in X3.'Nuff said.",X-Men - The Last Stand
411,DP-4,Ignore the Critics,8,26 May 2006,"After reading the early reviews of ""Last Stand"" I almost did not go see the movie. I am so glad that I ignored the critics on this one. The Last Stand is equal if not better than either of its predecessors. It has a great story line, great effects, funny moments and a ton of action. It also has several moments that caught me totally off guard. If you liked the previous two films SEE THIS FILM ASAP. You will love it.AND STAY TILL THE VERY END AFTER THE CREDITS. There is a reward waiting that ""might"" just mean that we have not seen the last of the X-Men.D.",X-Men - The Last Stand
412,gravity3,Better After the End Credits...,7,26 May 2006,"First - I want to address everyone who's already seen X-MEN: THE LAST STAND. If you left during the end credits (or even earlier, as did some viewers in the show I attended), you missed something that easily raised my vote half a star or so: the last scene of the movie.If you haven't seen THE LAST STAND, make sure you SIT THROUGH THE CREDITS. I'm not going to give anything away, but I think it's worth the extra few minutes. It's interesting that more and more films do have something during, in the middle of, or after the end credits. Since I sit there until the house lights go up or the film runs off the reel, it feels more like a bonus feature, just for a patient moviegoer. But in this case, it's a crucial scene, left quite literally for the very end.Director Brett Ratner has a strong action film background which includes the RUSH HOUR series, and there's some very solid action sequences here. As a kid reading The X-Men comics, it was really the fight scenes that kept me turning the pages. The film media lends itself perhaps even more to that kind of physical storytelling. THE LAST STAND does not disappoint in this area.Personally I think this franchise needed at least one entry that was firmly planted in the action category and THE LAST STAND is it. What I hope is that it doesn't become the rule, and that more character driven sequels are in its future. There are now a wealth of superheroes (and villains) presented to us in this X-Men series, and we could stand to learn a lot more about each of them.This time, however, story wasn't the point, as much as it was a tool to setting up the action. It's almost a Hong Kong martial arts approach; a bridge just to get you to the next fight scene. But with actors like Ian McKellan, those bridges seem much more rewarding. Honestly, he's such a solid Magneto that much of the film owes him a lot for holding things together when the plot gets flimsy. Kudos also to casting Kelsey Grammar as one of my favorite old-time X-Men, Beast. He was spot-on, in my book, and seeing Beast and Angel finally brought into the film story just made it feel complete in a way the other two movies did not.In making movies out of other media like comic books, there's always going to be some fairly severe story compression. In that process, characters are often quite distorted from their original print versions, and I understand anyone who has objections about how Iceman or any of the other characters have been treated in this series with regard to origins, respective ages, and so on. I admit my own disappointment in the handling of Juggernaut, who could have been a plot point, not to mention a deeper character, all on his own. And I've never liked the way Cyclops has been portrayed in any of the films, though I don't believe the problem is with actor James Marsden, but rather how his character has been written.Rather than debate those details and give anything away, I'll just say that film is not the printed word (or the well-drawn comic), and there are always concessions. This is not the most serious or character rich entry into the series, but it's a lot of fun, especially if you want to play ""spot the superhero or villain"". There are certainly more of them here than the other 2 films combined. And many film goers, who are unfamiliar with the comic stories, won't be bothered by any of the omissions or deviations from the comics.So if you're expecting the kind of serious approach present in the recent BATMAN BEGINS, this isn't really in that league. If, however, you're looking for an amped up action entry and like the Marvel characters, this is probably going to be a good night out. Make sure to get there early enough to see the 20th Century Fox fanfare (with the slightly lingering ""X""), and don't leave during the end credits, or you'll miss the end of the movie!",X-Men - The Last Stand
413,jmgiovine,Dull and weaker,5,6 June 2019,"The first half is pretty much solid, but the film slowly falls apart later on with unimaginative and heavily pop-Cornish comic book action, that fails to provide the efficiency and style the previous 2 films accomplished, even when the characters still work as good as they did before.",X-Men - The Last Stand
414,femaleanimefan,"Loved it, but a few minor disappointments",8,1 January 2007,"This film is really good, not my favorite, I don't think any X Men film will beat X2: X Men United. But I really loved it. The action was awesome, the plot was interesting, I liked the Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix idea because that was creative, and I love the actors(Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, Hugh Jackman, Sir Ian McKellen) They all did a marvelous job and I hope to see them in X Men 4(If they make one but I am pretty sure they will) The disappointments were really, of course, disappointing.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! 1) So many important characters died. I didn't like that and I hope they may come back for X4. It was really sad but interesting at the same time but I wish not that many people were killed off or cured.2) Major nitpick, we didn't get to see Pyro's fate. We didn't get to see if he died or if he is still alive. I would really like to know if he is alive or dead. But I am almost 100 per cent sure he is alive, but there is no real proof but I really think he is alive.Overall I thought this movie was well written, I loved the action, I loved the emotion, I love the drama, and I love the movie. I definitely recommend X Men: The Last Stand. It is certainly a winner. Watch it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
415,dacifu,NO!!!!!! no. no. no,1,22 May 2007,"...can somebody please tell me that they are going to do another movie where the explanation to this one would be that it was just a nigthmare. Or maybe somebody will travel back in time and change this stupid flick, please. First to all the previous films weren't that good. They got rogue, Cyclops and everybody else all wrong from the beginning. But let focus on this one:Scott and Charles got killed for some reason, WHY? if you ever read the comic book they are main characters all the way trough. So, there is no reason for their death.Phoenix is NOT a product of Jean Grey double personality. The phoenix is a cosmic entity!!! for FS. And Jean's love for Scott is the only thing able to stop the Phoenix.Mystique, Rogue and Magneto lost their powers, are you kidding me? main characters here. And rogue is all wrong too. She supposed to have Carol Danvers's powers and be involve in a romantic relationship with Gambit, who, by the way, where the hell was he?So, the way i see it the people who made this movie never read a comic book before and they didn't like the story so they make sure to kill every possibility of a sequel. Which in my opinion would be unnecessary. So, do yourself a favour and forget about this movies and stick with the comic books. Now if you have no idea whatsoever about the marvel universe maybe and just maybe you can find this movie OK, but for an x-men fan like myself this in nothing but an insult and a wasted of money and time",X-Men - The Last Stand
416,sackjigler,"Good news, its a good flick",8,26 May 2006,"I've been reading all the reviews as of late for the movie, about how this and that just didn't click and what not, well, I just got out and I have to say it was a good conclusion. I'll be honest that I personally have not been reading the comics since I was a child, so I cannot tell you if the mutants were used well, or enough for that matter. What I can tell you is that the story was set up very well, it did not seemed rushed or like to much was crammed in. It introduced new mutants to the series, but you have to understand, this is likely the last film, so just to get them in was great. No, a lot of them don't have much screen time, but if they did, the movie would have been two titanics long, and that would have sucked. But like I said, the pacing was good, not to slow and not too fast. The special effects were right on the money. Some mutants were cured that I wish hadn't, but that really is my only complaint. The Beast was a great addition to the film and really kicked butt. Juggernaut was fun and I think he definitely got good screen time, as well as Kitty Pryde. Wolverine entered a new level of beating the crap out of people, and Storm became a much better fighter. The movie is entertaining and well worth seeing on the big screen. Ratner did a great job in my mind of matching Synger's work. Go see it and judge for yourself, I think most of you will enjoy it. Plus it had the preview to snakes on a plane before it. Good flick, enjoy. P.S. Do stay til the end of the credits for hope if nothing else.",X-Men - The Last Stand
417,FMACDONALD,"Better Than The Original, Not as good as 2",8,31 May 2006,"I have to admit I was skeptical on X-Men 3. I mean since the beginning I've heard how Bryan Singer (The director of X-Men, and the even better X-Men 2) left the film to go and direct Superman Returns. His original plan was to come back and direct the third (and final?) X-Men film. Marvel Pictures wasn't to thrilled with Singer going off to direct a film about a DC Comics character so they fired Singer and replaced him with Bret Ratner of the Rush Hour films & Red Dragon. Now don't get me wrong the Rush Hour films are good action/comedies and Red Dragon is everything that the terrible Hannibal should have been, but does Ratner have what it takes for an X-Men film? the answer is yes...and no. As a long time fan of the comic book I found myself telling me that I had to keep the comic as far from my head as possible. Which after I did I found X-Men 3 to be a decent action film and a good trilogy as a whole. Needless to say X-Men 3 doesn't fall into the same category as Superman III or Alien 3 (2 films that came after great sequels) but it's no Return Of The Jedi either. The plot get's complicated as the script tries to combine 2 story lines, the first (and the 1 that takes center stage) is the mutant cure story line, in which a lab creates a cure for the mutant gene. The second is one of the most complicated stories from the comic, The Dark Phoenix Saga, which aggravated me that it was a side story. Clocking in at a little over 90 minutes, X-Men 3 felt rushed to get finished, while X-Men 2 was a whopping 2 1/2 hours and told a great story. The bright spots of the third chapter was the new mutants such as Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and the man that stole the show Beast (Kelsey Grammar, who I usually can not stand, yes that Frasier in a ton of make up to make him look Blue & Furry). However there was not nearly enough character development for either of these characters, not like they did with Nightcrawler in X-Men 2. Ian McKellan shines once again as Magneto the X-men's big villain, and just like the fist 2 films X-Men 3 turns into the Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) show. The thing that really made me mad was Halle Berry whined and cried to get more screen time as Storm and still does nothing for the film. As mentioned before if you are a fan of the comic, as I am, then just keep that out of your head for a good 90+ minutes and you'll be fine. X-men 3 is a good ending to the trilogy (as it stands there is no X-Men 4 planned but a Wolverine film planned). Let's just hope it doesn't go the route of Alein 4 after fans of the comic call for Ratner's head. On a scale of 10 I give X-Men 3 an 8.",X-Men - The Last Stand
418,FabioPirovano,Weak Film,6,29 May 2006,"From Mr.Brett Ratner A decent but not excellent film,the same weak direction of ever,and character development,action is really the strong point but is not enough if compared to the previous films. The cinematography is one of worst(unrecognizable Dante Spinotti) never seen before and some CGi effects are not well integrated with the lights language..I really hate this gold,sepia halo... Some part of the story seems cut and paste(As the night fall suddenly in San Francisco) but that's my opinion as focused audience. I'm sure many other people will love this weak -fast food- flick!I don't love this film and I feel a little be angry to be considered dumb from production companies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
419,jeev7882,"disappointing, but exciting",6,13 June 2006,"Billed as the third and final chapter of the X-Men trilogy, The Last Stand is a different kind of movie than the first two. Fans of the comics and fans of the previous films will be united in their disappointment in what really isn't a bad movie. The biggest problem with X3 isn't the plot but the execution and pace. There are two ways to look at the film: (1) this movie should be a good movie on it's own, independent of the previous two (which it is not on any accounts), or (2) this is the third act of one big epic movie (ala Lord of the Rings), and in this way it is very successful.The plot is relatively simple: there is a cure for mutancy, and a debate rages over whether or not such a cure is ethical. Magneto and his brotherhood of mutants find that the source of the cure is a mutant child who is housed in Alcatraz (hence the ripping of the Golden Gate Bridge off it's hinges in the preview). The X-Men aren't really for or against the cure, but they don't believe that destroying the cure and waging a war against the humans is the right answer. During all this Jean Grey comes back as Dark Phoenix and wreaks havoc on those who oppose her. New director Brett Ratner seems scared to touch on any of the serious issues that his predecessor, Bryan Singer, introduced and explored. There's often a beginning and an end, but no middle, no substance. Rogue's role is diminished to answering one question: should she take the cure so she can finally touch and kiss her boyfriend (and anyone else for that matter)? Now that's a deep, serious question to answer. The problems is that the depth of exploration is limited to one speech from Wolverine, and her final decision. In a movie that runs a trim 103 minutes (a whole 30 minutes shorter than the previous film), you would think that a little more time could have been devoted to the characters and the issues that face them. Instead there is a great deal of time spent on things that go boom.That being said, the things that go boom are breathtaking. Not only are the action sequences visually astounding, but so is the rest of the movie. Almsot every second of every scene is infused with an air of mysticism and visual beauty that is rare in movies today. In the gigantic action sequences, Ratner does a great job successfully tugging on our heart strings as many of our beloved mutants either lose their powers or lose their lives. I was on the edge of my seat during the entire last action scene where Magneto rips the Golden Gate Bridge off its very hinges and crashes it down on Alcatraz. In all, X3 is a highly entertaining movie that uses its visuals very effectively, but it falls short on becoming a great movie like X2 because it shies away from aiming from greatness. An X-Fan like myself can't help but be at least a little disappointed. By the way, you should stay for the short (really, really short) clip at the end of the credits. It's well worth the wait.",X-Men - The Last Stand
420,TheXeroXone,"Not Terrible, but nowhere near spectacular",6,27 May 2006,"Bryan Singer's X2 may have raised the bar a little too high to reach again, but even so, I definitely expected more than what Brett Ratner had to offer.The movies starts out well enough in the first 10 minutes but when the plot starts to move, it stumbles clumsily for the next hour and then finally limps across the finish line with a whimper instead of a bang. None of the major plot points in this film are explored or used to its fullest potential, with the possible exception of Hank McCoy aka Beast and you wind up feeling just a little emptier than when you began. The deaths of two main characters are underwhelming, much of the discourse of the remaining characters is forced, Angel's involvement is meek and predictable, the social implications of using the cure as a weapon are brushed up against only lightly, and the problems that Magneto creates are eliminated with the dramatic intensity of flipping a light switch.There are some decent scenes in the film that helped make up for a lack of great scenes and other scenes were not as good in the eyes of the comic fans, but were understandably reduced for a mainstream audience. For example, the cosmic origins of the Phoenix and the Juggernaut were re-written from the comics to help ease their translation into the film. Rogue's re-write from the first film also played a part in the decisions the character ultimately, and unsurprisingly, made in the film. Unfortunately the emotional and social impacts of her decision were yet more additions to the list of items that were never really explored.As a stand alone movie, the film doesn't do much better than a standard 90's action flick with lots of special effects and a very basic level of drama. Its not terrible, but its not nearly as spectacular as it could or should have been for a final chapter.",X-Men - The Last Stand
421,Newski_the_Hippie,Bad... Just Bad....,1,26 May 2006,"When you have low expectations, sometimes you are surprised by how well a movie turns out. Or, sometimes, your low expectations keep you from seeing how good a movie is because you are predetermined to hate it.Or sometimes, a movie just sucks.X Men the Last Stand starts out with two flashbacks: One to Jean Grey's childhood, the other to Angel's childhood. Both of these are good scenes. But, with Angel taking up much of the pre-credit sequence, you would probably expect more of his character. But, like most characters, he is introduced, then forgotten, so we can make way for a crappy love story between Wolverine and Jean.Wolverine's lines, of course, are things Scott should be saying. And with a script like this, you can easily switch the two and with the dialog, nobody would notice that they ever belonged to Wolverine in the first place. Because, you see, the script is nothing but a punch of bad punchlines, explanations, that are perfectly interchangeable per character.The Phoenix is well introduced, without having to go into detailed origins from the comics. It's probably done the best way it can be done for the movie. The problem is, Jean never maintains a ""fiery form."" Actually, let's just forget the ending of X-2 anyway, because it seems it was a completely different resurrection altogether. But then, if we start looking back to X-2, it opens up the door to so many mistakes.While I just want to figure out ""How does the X-Jet go invisible?"" Or, even better ""Why did the X Jet go invisible when the Brotherhood new they were there, and did nothing but land anyway."" That hurt. That really did. But not as much as the line ""Get your plastic guns."" Did the writers not think that the audience would catch on that the guns that look like plastic, and are made to fight Magneto, plastic? I have a bit more intelligence then that. And a bit more the screenwriters.The scene moved from scene to scene with a need to be an action movie above all else, leading to predictable plot twists and really bad cliché action movie lines.By the end of the movie, I just didn't care any more. If I had to some up the movie in one word: Pathetic.The worst end of a trilogy I've seen since Star Wars: Episode 3.",X-Men - The Last Stand

423,elfflame,This isn't the movie it should have been,5,18 June 2007,"I wasn't very impressed with X-Men 3. There were good things, and there were things that really ticked me off, but it wasn't as bad as say, Men in Black 2. It just wasn't good. If you're a fan of the series, leave it at two, and save yourself the annoyance.--- Spoilers past this point ---Okay, I was originally drawn into XMen by the Dark Phoenix storyline, so I knew this would be make-or-break for me. And it was a bad sign that my first thought upon seeing Famke on-screen was, ""What did they do to her hair?"" It looked like a dye-job gone horribly wrong. There were a few scenes where it almost worked, but it generally just looked bad. Her best scenes were the moment at the lake before she killed Scott; the scenes at her parent's house; and the final scenes with Wolverine. But there was too much missing. Where was her internal conflict? And where was the Phoenix effect?Now, this is not to say that the change from being a universal force to a top-level mutant bugged me. I understand the need to simplify for movie matters, but if you're going to change something so significant, you need to explore it far more thoroughly than they did. And I understand why Erik/Magneto needed to be part of the plot line. After all, he's been in the other two, so he needs to be in this one. But I don't think he should have been center stage. That should have been Jean's struggle, with Erik moving in the background at most.Oh, and speaking of Erik... Magneto has never been stupid. He's flawed, yes, but highly intelligent. He simply wouldn't discard someone simply because they've changed. In fact, he'd likely take Mystique and do experiments on her to find out exactly what they'd done to her. And, more than likely, discover that it's not a permanent change. Other characters:* Logan was center screen again. Not bad, though he's becoming a one-note character. If they do any further movies, it would get old. I did like the play between him and Jean, especially since they killed Scott so early on in the movie. * Professor X seemed to be sleepwalking through the story, and I get that he was being distracted by Phoenix, but still. And his death, too, seemed a waste. If anything, it should have woken Erik up.* Scott should not have even been in this movie. It seems as though he had one point to being there (waking up Jean), and then they killed him. I would have liked to see the Scott/Jean/Logan triangle played up far much more than it was.* Bobby grew up in this film, which was nice. I particularly liked the appearance of his ice-form finally. And the battle between him and Pyro was perfect. But the Kitty/Bobby/Rogue triangle seemed unnatural to me, particularly with Peter right there. I think it was ridiculous to create a triangle like that, to give Rogue a reason to angst about not being able to touch him. It didn't even need to be there at all for her to do that. It could have been entirely innocent and she still would have done it.* Callisto was cool. I liked the actress, and the Callisto/Storm action actually got to my fangirl heart, even if she wasn't the Callisto from the books. Cause that Callisto would never have put up with Erik's attitude. She would have kicked his butt. :P* Kitty was great. Not perfect, but lots of fun, and not too far off how I actually think of her. I would have liked more interactions with Peter and less with Bobby, though. The race through the building was lots of fun, and even though her bouncing into the wall was expected, it was great to see how quick she recovered to get the boy out.* Peter was cool. But where was his accent?!? I was thrilled to see the fastball special, not once, but twice in the movie. Very nice.* Kelsey Grammar was one of the highlights of this film. His Beast was as good as I was expecting, though I had hoped for more of his quotes during their fighting. But then, he wasn't in much fighting, really, which is a shame. I did love his intro, hanging upside-down from his office ceiling. * Pyro is so not a level three. I did like that he had gloves that allowed him more immediate access to fire, but without them? He'd have nothing. * Juggernaut: Hello? He's Charles's stepbrother. Why didn't they at least have a spark of recognition there? Oh, and while we're at it, his helmet is the source of his power. Hence no mutant ability for the boy to negate. * Warren was only in the movie for two purposes: to give his father a reason to make the ""cure,"" and to rescue his father at the end. At the very least, he should have had an argument with the XMen about letting him go with them, and/or hiding out on the jet.There's probably so much more here I could cover, but I've gone on long enough. All in all? Too much to cover properly in one movie. It had no proper focus. If Singer had still been in charge, and had the budget not been slashed to ribbons, it could have been as great as the other two. As it was, it was just mediocre. If you're not a fan of the comics, you'll likely enjoy it. But it's just not what it could have been.",X-Men - The Last Stand
424,buiredintime,X-men Halle Berry's revenge.,7,26 May 2006,"We'll what can I say for X-men the Last stand, but that it was about what I would expect from a person like Brent Ratner. Brent Ratner to me is one of those directors that knows what it takes to make a summer movie make money, but doesn't have the kahuna's to take it a step farther, and explore his real talent. Everybody hates on Brent but if you have seen movies like Family man and Red dragon it shows that he has a good directing talent, and a good eye for the camera. I guess all the boozing, women and fast cars are more important.Everything about X-men the last stand seems to want to bring you in to the x-men world but for some reason you still feel like that outsider that sees a major accident, and slows down to watch. Don't get me wrong there was some good things in the movie, but the whole phoenix story should have been made as it's own story and movie, and instead on the mutant cure and making Jean Grey more of a side note.I did think the story they used was a pretty good story, and fit into the whole X-men mythology. The whole cure aspect is almost what the Brotherhood of Mutant's has been fighting for decades. That was fine for me and the pacing even though it was short was well done. That's the problem thought the length of the movie should have been longer given characters like Angel and Jagguarnaut and even Jean grey more room to breath. I think the Angel character and even Jaggarnaut are classic fun characters.The major problem of this movie though is that it doesn't fell all there, it feels like it's missing so much. I remember seeing X-men for the first time, and thinking wow besides the fact of a couple small things this feels like X-men it's fun and wow that's really cool. X-men 2 improved and it was like holy crap that's fn awesome, but X-men 3 just doesn't do it it's almost like the cast and crew were rushed, and from I what I read that may not be too far off the point.Now to the summary X-men Halle berry's revenge. Why doesn't it surprise me that when Halle Berry want's here way she get's it. To me personally Storm has never been a good character too me. Just didn't like, her character seemed to fake to me. Not only that but the fact the Halle Berry demanded a bigger part or she would not return is ludicrous to me. Actors and Actresses these day's forget there old days when it use to be fun for them. Hey I like to have money and I feel I should get some recognition for things, but I just can't see myself getting like that. Damn you Halle Berry.Overall finishing up my thought's of X-men the Last stand I will definitely say see it as a popcorn movie and not as a hard core comic fan because if you are that hard core fan then you will want to shoot Brent Ratner for his interpretation of a famous comic series. Other wise see it for what it is a flawed but half way decent action movie.7/10",X-Men - The Last Stand

It's would have been easier to accept if not everything was thrown inside one.Everything go fast.You just don't dispatch important character quick like thisAt the end of the movie you're already thinking . What? It's already the end?Sometime it's a sign of a great movie.The Movie is pretty fun regardless.But it's simply not one of these movie that you talk about 1-2 hours with friend after viewing it eating a good dinner.You will remember 1-2 part They should just have mentioned to us directly that they don't want to continue the movie sequence.THis movie is better if you watch it right after the 2 other.It's might not leave a sensation of emptiness.But when you wait 2-3 years for this.You feel abandoned by the production,X-Men - The Last Stand
426,jiaoniang,it is kind of disappointing,6,31 May 2006,"Maybe the first two movies were OK to watch, or maybe I just liked to finish the trilogy, I spent quite a night in theatre on the third one. However, this movie put disappointment on me.The story goes that human want to 'cure' the mutants with a new medicine. Some mutants, or evil ones, fight back while the good ones protect it. Throughout the movie, it isnot clear if this cure is good or bad. However, along the way dies the good professor and Scott. There is no obvious reason for their death and makes me wonder if their pay was just too little to last 10 min? The rebirth of Jane is also meaningless, as she didn't do anything, positive or negative or help in anyway the plot goes.The series of X-Men has fundamental problems in that, if Mutants can't breed the next generation with same ability, they will soon die out. That makes them not a new species, but really an abnormal of human. From this sense, cure them is the correct words.This third movie didn't explain any good reasons why mutants should be allowed. We've seen so much destruction and killing but not one reason constructive.Hence the ending of the trilogy is plain and pale.",X-Men - The Last Stand
427,adudewhoiscool,"This had so much potential with not only the cure aspect but the Phoenix storyline as well, but it fails miserably",5,19 August 2006,"When I first heard that Bryan Singer was no longer directing the third installment I had my worries. Then I heard they got Brett Ratner, most famous for his ""Rush Hour"" movies, as the replacement and I knew that was the nail to the coffin. This movie is not only the worst of the franchise, but I have not felt this disappointed since ""Alien Vs Predator."" The unveiling of a way to ""cure"" mutants rocks the world. Some mutants see it as a way to be ""normal"" and others see it as deeply offensive and a way for humans to control mutants. This prompts Magneto and his Brotherhood to step up and only the X-Men can stand in their way. Meanwhile, the X-Men face their own crisis. Jean Grey is resurrected, but in a terrifying new form. Despite almost unlimited power, she suffers from a split personality that only Professor Charles Xavier can control. Her darker personality called Phoenix, has emerged and wreaks havoc. What will happen when Cyclops, Xavier, and Wolverine try to come to her aid? The first two were great because characters were given attention to and their likability was there. The biggest problem is that they introduce too many characters, making it impossible to give them enough screen time. Several characters had their moments but were forgotten. I felt that some characters were just there to sell more toys and served no other real purpose. Characters like Juggernaut and Multiple Man joined Magneto's Brotherhood without even questioning who Magneto was. Nightcrawler was mysteriously absent with zero reasons explaining why he was not there. Newcomer Angel (Ben Foster) was given a bigger role in the trailers then the movie itself. This would not be an issue if 30-60 minutes were added to the short 105-minute run time.There were a few characters out of character. Those characters were mainly Professor Charles Xavier, Magneto, and even Wolverine and Rogue. Charles Xavier seemed more like a jerk, ""I don't have to explain myself to you Logan."" Magneto showed more of a selfish/tyrant type personality, who would gladly sacrifice even his greatest of friends for his personal needs, ""Like in Chess, the pawns always go first."" Even Wolverine shows a softer personality. Rogue, who was just learning to come to terms with being a mutant, does something completely opposite of her character, which I will not reveal.The dialog was bad, even for a comic book movie. The dialog was forced and used in a comedic route. There were a couple scenes, most notably used by Juggernaut, ""Do you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut b*tch""(homage to a popular video on the internet) and Kitty Pride, ""Look who's hiding D*ckhead"" which rivaled Joel Schumacher's ""Batman and Robin."" The teenagers, in the audience, loved those lines, but I was not one of them.This was too fast paced with too much action. The problem would have been eliminated with a longer run time. Ratner also did not know how to handle material without killing off or curing a character every 30 minutes. This movie moves so fast that when some mutants die, we have zero emotional output. When a character dies in a film, especially a trilogy, it is suppose to benefit the story; here it was just wasteful.Another flaw was by the time I actually knew Magneto's cause, I started rooting for the Brotherhood, and when the X-Men come to stop them, I was thinking, ""No this is what you want!"" I even questioned why the X-men were supporting the humans' cause in the first place. The only true reason was to have cool action scenes. The first two ""X-men"" movies were exciting because the action scenes served a purpose.I never could stand Halle Berry as Storm. I never believed she was the right choice for Storm. When Bryan Singer was still aboard, she announced that if she did not get more screen time, she would leave. If I were Ratner, I would say, ""We don't need you! There are several actresses that would cost a fraction less!"" Unfortunately, I had to suffer because of Halle Berry's ego.The Phoenix, not the cosmic entity, did nothing for me. I do understand why they changed the Phoenix origin. It would have taken an extra one or two movies just to explain it all and this way it was geared towards the mainstream audience. The Phoenix is one of the most powerful being in the universe, yet she does nothing to show off her true power until the end. She kills a couple of important characters, but other then that she just stood around looking like a zombie from ""Dawn of the Dead"" and not the majestic creature that comic fans expected. ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is not all crap. Kelsey Grammar was a perfect portrayal of Dr. Hank McCoy, aka Beast. The action and the special effects were the best of the franchise. Ratner also plays homage to many comic book issues, which should make the fans happy. Unfortunately, I recommend you seeing this only for the action and special effects!",X-Men - The Last Stand
428,benturkalj,"Actually pretty exciting, if you can get past the comic stuff",7,29 May 2006,"OK, so a lot of reviewers are saying that this was pretty sub-standard. In my own view, I would say that it pretty much succeeds in achieving what it aims to do, and I would definitely watch a sequel to it.Ratner definitely will annoy some comic fans for sure: there are some pretty big deaths that you have to wonder about. I also probably didn't like the way the Phoenix saga was handled here either, but it's not all about comics.In the end, at least for the most part, everything is well done. The dialogs was fine, and probably better then the other films in some ways. The film never dragged, the effects were well done, and the storyline was reasonably well established.It certainly could have been done a lot better, but enjoyed this a great deal more then some of the other blockbusters out recently. This is a worthy sequel, so don't hesitate to check it out.",X-Men - The Last Stand
429,xgray-03873,"Not Really a ""Last Stand"", But More of a ""To Be Continued...""",6,30 May 2017,"For a movie that's called, ""X-Men: The Last Stand""...it really doesn't feel like there was much or a ""last stand"". Just more like a ""to be continued"", in my opinion. And honestly, it's not the worst X-Men movie, but it really isn't among the best of all the X-Men movies. That honor belongs to Days of Future Past, X2: X-Men United, X-Men: First Class, Deadpool and Logan. Seriously, nobody should say that this movie is better than Deadpool or Logan, if they did, then they have a really poor taste in movies, or a problem.But anyways, so far the only good things about this movie are Kelsey Grammar as Hank McCoy/The Beast, Magneto lifting the Golden Gate Bridge, the music score (especially the Dark Phoenix's theme music), and I guess the debate for the cure plot was okay.Now for the bad, the Juggernaut. Dear God.....what were they thinking?! No Nightcrawler in this movie, Prof. X's demise and rebirth, Mystique losing her powers, and of course the elephants in the room....the death of cyclops and the dark phoenix subplot. Seriously, they really should've made that into a movie on its' own instead of trying to tie that together with the ""battle for the cure"" main story plot of this movie. But, this is what happens when the studios just don't stick with only one story-arc to adapt into an X-Men movie all because they had to rush the productions to get that summer blockbuster release in 2007.Overall, X-Men: The Last Stand isn't the worst X-Men movie. It's just not really that great, but ""meh!"" Like I said, I've seen Wolverine Origins and yeah, that is the worst X-Men movie that no one should ever see again.",X-Men - The Last Stand
430,cwx,Everything happens for no reason,3,27 May 2006,"This movie pretends to be a sequel to X2, but ultimately, this film builds on the bones of what came before, rather than on the solid, already established foundation. Characters are dismissed with perfunctory waves of the hand, or ""revealed"" to have always been the exact opposite of everything we were told before, specifically in the case of Jean Grey. The treatment of Jean invokes the worst excesses of comic books (namely, retroactive continuity or the ""retcon,"") while losing whatever emotional pathos was involved in the source material.Most egregious, however, is the finale. The X-Men rush into defend something without really explaining why it's important, and their goals and the stakes they are playing for constantly shift. While you never quite get to the point where the story doesn't make sense, it's safe to say that the motivations never make sense, if only because there are no motivations. There are certainly some good action scenes, but overall it's hard to enjoy this even as mindless action because moronic director Brett Ratner gets so bogged down in the process of pissing on all the plot lines and characters that he inherited from Bryan Singer's vastly superior work.",X-Men - The Last Stand
431,filmtogo,Not good but not bad either,5,6 June 2018,It's the not so good finale to the original X-Men trilog. But besides a convoluted story with way too many mutants getting their little moments - Angel is a joke! - this is not as bad as everyone is saying. It has a very nice idea about not having to be a mutant anymore and instead having the choice if you want to be human or mutant. But of course the film has not time to dig deeper. There is a child who has the power to make mutant powers go away and everyone wants to get to him first. Best addition is Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. Sadly Iceman Shawn Ashmore gets more to do - I really never cared for him so this was actually boring. Then there is the Dark Phoenix story somehow put into all of this too. That's the saddest part. This mega X-Men event becomes a sidestory to once again Magneto who wants to rule the world as superior species.,X-Men - The Last Stand
432,davidhutch007,This is definitely the end of the road for the X-men,6,25 June 2006,"I went in to my theater anticipating a great film, and with this being the finale to the franchise expected it to top the previous two outings. I was mistaken! A cure has been found to cure the mutant gene and of course Magneto is having none of it and so he and the brotherhood of mutants decide to bring chaos to the people. Only the X-men stand in their way.The film visually looks the same as the previous two films, it also has similar characters to the original two films but the missing link here was Bryan Singers absence which pulls the film down slightly. Although Brett Ratner tries to bring us a good film he delivers something that feels rushed and quite out of time.The film has so many characters it is so hard to keep track of them all which makes the viewer care less and less about them which i think is wrong. Angel is in about three scenes what a waste of a great character who had some great potential in this film. Wolverene and Beast are easily the best performers of the piece, each delivering great comedic pieces as well as great action and drama pieces.Patrick Stewert is also on top of his game but again his character is cut down drastically something i did not like. Ian Mckellen gives another good performance as Magneto but the idea of him using the power to move metallic things is again something we've seen time and time again...lets do something new! The worst performance has to go to Vinnie Jones who plays Juggernaut which i had to compare to Bane from Batman & Robin because basically like Bane Juggernaught is put in there just because its a character that has not been seen on screen yet...utterly pointless! The film as i said looks similar to the previous two films which helps with the continuity and also gives great spectacle to the film as well.The direction in many parts is good but in others very weak. The film has been geared more towards putting an action film together more so than a film with a story and the action set around that like we have seen in the previous two films.Overall the film was good as it gave a good end finale to the franchise but i think this definitely should be the end after many characters are finished off in this film even ones you may not expect! ****** out of **********",X-Men - The Last Stand
433,imajestr,What Action? What Acting? What Story?,4,25 September 2006,"I saw this movie a while ago, but I am very surprised it has such a high rating here on IMDb. Let me first say that I loved the first two movies. They were great action movies, and had spectacular pacing and suspense when needed for the story to keep moving. This third installment is a disgrace to the first two movies. I'm not even talking about the story, though it did disappoint me. I'm talking about the fact that there really was no action in this movie. I mean, there was a big fight at the end. That's it. And the choreography was pretty terrible. Choppy scenes of people pretending to get hit in the face, beast just flailing his arms about, and Wolverine gliding around on strings after Colossus (who just stands there otherwise) throws him into the air. Then Wolverine will fall on somebody. That's it. There was an interesting ""chase"" scene I guess you could say, but it wasn't anything special. Other than that, that's the action.The whole movie just felt tacky, save for the one pivotal scene involving Professor X and Jean. (if you've seen, you know what I'm talking about) That scene was really intense, and the rest just felt cheesy.Okay, and I'm going to say it, Halle Barry destroyed this movie. What could have been okay and salvageable plot points and dialogue, she butchers the hell out of. Every line she says is so dry, forced, and badly acted. If you've seen, you know. If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch it again and actually pay attention when she's on screen. You'll want to stab her.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The first movie talked about all the main characters, the second more background on Wolverine and analysis on Nightcrawler, but this one had a lack of description on any of the new characters.Second, the movie didn't do well carrying all the character's. Some character's would go and do something and then you'd forget they where even in the movie at all before they ever got back into the film.But, this is still a great movie and worth watching.

Kelsey Grammar is perfectly cast as Beast, and it's nice to see it (mostly) come to it's resolution. But as true X fan, I can understand why some are angry at the lack of development of certain characters: The movie completely disregards both that Juggernaught is NOT a Mutant, and that he is Professor X's step-brother. And while I respect Ian Mackellan as an actor, I always felt that his portrayal of Magneto was more vengeful and less tortured than that of the comics-that's just my feeling.

I went in there with full expectations and I wasn't a bit disappointed. The character development isn't really necessary in the third installment IMHO.All the characters were emotionally more charged than before. What this movie offers firstly is emotion, which lacked in Singer's 2 previous installments. Secondly, the special and visual effects are jaw dropping. Starting from the scene where Xavier and Eric Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) appear 20 years younger to the battle scene at the end and throughout, I was glued to my seat.""Grow those back!"" Highly recommended.",X-Men - The Last Stand
438,Bifrostedflake,X-men the last straw,1,13 October 2006,"**WARNING CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS** Let me open by saying; I have been a fan of X-men for a while, I read some comics, I was an avid fan of the animated series, I had one or two minor complaints about the first two films, drastic character changes and what have you, but otherwise I throughly enjoyed them.When my friend purchased the movie on DVD for us to watch last night, I was quite looking forward to it, I had seen the promotions and trailers and was fairly excited with the prospect of Angel and phoenix making an appearance. I was unaware that Singer had left the project however this was made abundantly aware about 20 minutes into the film.As a movie fan my complaints would be listed as such: too much action without the occasional light relief break we had from the first two films, inconsistencies from the first two films, a poorly developed script and subplot with a string of off -shoots that were spread too sparsely.As an X-men fan my complaints would be: Professor X died, Cyclops was killed, Mystique was robbed of her powers, Magento was also (although a tiny blink-and-you'll-miss-it hint at the end implied otherwise), Jean Gray was killed by Wolverine in an over blown action sequence that was all about CG and nothing about the film. The plot was originally supposed to be about Phoenix, the phoenix saga, is a saga it could barely be done justice in 3 films, but the whole thing was rushed and mixed together with the 'cure' plot line which was meshed together in a big mess. Death was ultimately implied for Pyro, juggarnaut, phat, spike and several others which i don't care to name.Considering the amount of promotion involving Angel, the character was severely underused, as was phoenix who mostly just stood there and stared for the vast majority of the film. Shadowcat (Kitty Pryde) was a pointless addition to this film also, the previous films had all been about characters, this was a useless addition.Perhaps one of my biggest complaints was Rogue having the cure and her powers taken away from her. This sends the wrong message completely and makes her character seem weak.By the end of the film I felt like crying, because one of my favourite marvel comics had been raped by this director and turned into an all-action no-plot disappointment.I urge any fan of the X-men to not waste either your time or your money on this film. It was a shoddy example of the previous two films.",X-Men - The Last Stand
439,Dream_seeker,A person's second opinion about: X-men: the last stand,5,6 May 2007,"Recently i've gotten the chance to read, ""Astonishing X-men"" joss whedon's vision of the xmen and the cure that comes with it...i've also taken the opportunity to read the dark phoenix saga written by Chris Claremont and and try to put two of them together in a way that the movie did...unfortunately, the results ended badly and thats' why i'm giving my second opinion of X-men: the last stand.The last review i made of this movie i really lashed out at it without giving a reasonable view of this movie. Truth be told, I REALLY didn't like this movie on the basis of a convoluted story arc that tried REALLY hard to be put together by the screenplay writers. Much like spider-man 3 tried to do they, ""Tried"" to merge different stories to make a much interesting and maybe action-packed movie but failed on the idea that maybe it was a bad idea and just stick try and true with the original story at hand and it made me wish for Joss whedon's view cause for the action and character depth. But let me point some of the good before the bad just to be fair, for those that like this movie i can say this movie was a good, ""popcorn flick"" as far as the action/adventure is concern. The fight scenes were fast and intense and the music made the pace just as good; I enjoyed how fast and cool they made this work out in their favor. However now for the bad, Brett Ratner's vision isn't up to par with such directors like Singer or long term comic writers like Claremont or bendis; his focus was more intent on two characters...storm (Halie berry) and wolverine (Hugh Jackman) which for some way storm DID get a longer part which I'm not complaining but when its at the cost of some those other characters that deserved their time as well in one form it was being selfish on the director's part.Other X-men vets did make an appearance like the Beast (Kelsey grammar) who did pretty damn good for taking the time to dress like a, ""Blue fur ball"" and then there's angel (Ben foster) who's very talented as well as athletic so i can see why they chose him for this role but you only see at least 15 mins of his character before he walks off or disappears into the crowd of the less important co-stars...word to the directors, if you are going to put a character on a poster claiming that he will be in most of all the scenes of the movie....MAKE IT SO! if this was the case you might as well had him come into the room and say, ""hi guys, i'm angel"" and walk away and never see him again which i felt it was really unfair to most of the fans who were expecting him to be part of the fight and climax for the long run. Now lets move to the story...as much as it was full of action which I thought was hot, the story was not! Technically in a nutshell, taken place a month after X2 Jene gray sacrificed herself to save her teammates knowing that there was a deeper power lurking that saved her and it was about to show itself; meanwhile doctors Kavita rao and warren Worthington Sr. created a ""cure"" that can solve the mutant ""problem"" most will take it and others will oppose against it...like magneto who believed a war is brewing against homo sapiens (Humans) and mutants which is happening. IN the middle Scott summers is grieving...everyone somewhat forgot about Jeane...Phoenix has risen some X-men characters die and phoenix don't do crap except stand in the background as a poster child or reminder to join magneto's crew which i found really insulting giving she's is powerful than magneto and the whole mutant-kind combined.which leads to a whole new set of problems, the direction, as much as it was fun to watch the story and direction was all over the place...lack of character depth of new characters and understanding of old ones puts this movie on a downward spiral; it got caught up in its own action that it forgot the purpose to what the dark phoenix saga was about...i mean a comic fan would ask, ""where's the hellfire club?"" and ""shouldn't Emma frost be introduced to this?"" which was never asked thus leading this movie into a confusing twist of just action nothing more...nothing less. Jugganaunt was cool, and the line at the climax did make me clap but that's all it was an enjoyable feast. Honestly, after reading both comics i saw Whedon's vision and wanted THAT version into this movie if it was going to stick to the ""Cure"". But if they were going the route of the Dark Phoenix they should of added the elements that the comic portrayed like the hellfire club and ms. frost instead of setting off meaningless deaths that should of never happened.All in all, I give it a ""5"" cause even though this movie was fun, and going into the movie leaving your mind behind is a good way to enjoy this movie; most movie goers go into this movie hoping of a good story to go behind it; this movie was confused in its own world and too hyped up for its own good making this movie a confused mess; i didn't know where the story was going and why characters didn't stay to fight it was unfair to most true comic fans to see something like this made in a way that didn't set the bar of the comic itself instead it just made it a roller coaster ride of adventure with no development whatsoever thus is why i don't like this movie cause it lost that feeling of what the other two movies tried to do.",X-Men - The Last Stand
440,bardia-moose,Disappointing.,3,23 September 2014,"If you have seen the first two X-Men movies, then you know that X-Men 3 feels different. Of course with a new director changes are to be expected, but how much can be different till we can't tolerate them anymore. The first half of this movie was very good, but I started to check my phone a lot after the midpoint. The film wasn't flowing uniformly, but in all types of directions mixed with questionable pacing. Another thing that kept distracting me was the awful CGI, which surprised me because of how well done the CGI was in this film predecessor. The last two X-Men films had really good and enthralling stories which to me felt absent in X3. The acting was still very good, especially from Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, but the chemistry between the characters was poor and made me feel, dare I say, quite bored. Also, the film's third act feels very rushed in wrapping up the character's journey and the film itself. Now let us move on to the good things about this film. As always the score is fantastic and is, in my opinion, one of the best superhero themes in film. As mentioned above, the individual acting is good but the collective chemistry is off. Overall I wouldn't recommend watching this movie unless you are a big X-Men fan, which is not a bright idea as you might feel even more disappointed than the rest of us.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Brett Ratner is merely a director, a hired gun who supervises. as a result, ""X-Men: The Last Satnd"" is enjoyable, but never reaches the heights of brilliance achieved by it's predecessors. In terms of story, characterization, effects and dialogue, this just isn't up there with ""X-Men"" or ""X2"".A side note (SPOILER): For those of us who's only complaint with the brilliant ""X2"" was that Cyclops was sadly underused, seeing him unceremoniously and ignobly killed off - by Jean Grey, no less - is downright painful, and not really necessary. Watching Wolverine and Cyclops having to work together to defeat the woman they both love would have been far more compelling. Cyclops/Summers/Marsden deserves better.",X-Men - The Last Stand

443,ozymandiaskingofkings,too much yet not enough...,6,11 July 2006,"This sendoff for the x-men suffers without Bryan Singer at the helm, lacking the strong narrative and ambiguous subtext of its predecessors and instead going purely for action. although spectacular, the film tries to cram in too much story in to not enough film, unsure whether it should be concentrating on the development of the ""Mutant Cure"", Magneto's revolutionary machinations or the rebirth of Jean Grey as the evil and destructive Dark Phoenix (the most interesting storyline, yet the one that feels most tacked on). Thats without taking into account the subplots introduced such as the father-son conflict between Angel and his father, or the iceman/rogue/shadowcat love triangle, or indeed the storm/wolverine/phoenix triangle.The other main problem is that the film attempts to include all the X-Men that the previous films didn't such as: Angel, Colossus, Juggernaut, Callisto, Shadowcat, Beast as well as developing existing X-men, something which both sidelines several characters (such as rogue and iceman) while introducing 1d characters such as the redundant angel. The exception to this rule is furry intellectual beast, a fan favourite excellently played by Kelsey Grammar who you wish you'd have seen more of.The film is not without its good points though. acting is on the whole excellent, with the exception of a woefully miscast Vinnie Jones as a cock-er-ney Juggernaut, a comic relief butchery of a classic villain. Famke Jansen is amazingly sexy as the previously boring Jean Grey and Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan once again bring gravity and charisma to the film. The dark tone of the film is also to be congratulated with several x-men meeting surprising and poignant deaths, including one fairly redundant character and, one major character.Overall, the films refusal to be optimistic lifts it above the average popcorn flick, although it pails in comparison with Singer's previous installments.3.8/5",X-Men - The Last Stand

Bryan Singer is replaced by Brett Ratner. He has done a great job. Amazing special effects, a wonderful cast and some good new actors make this film a great and well done job.When a new ""cure"" for mutants is found, Magneto and his mutants decide to make a war against the X-Men, led by Professor Xavier. In Xavier's team there are new mutants, like Shadowcat, Angel ,Beast and Colossus. In Magneto's, there are some of them too: Callisto, Juggernaut and Multiple Man.The new actors and actresses in the film are really good: Ellen Page(Shadowcat), Dania Ramirez(Calisto), Daniel Cudmore(Colossus), Ben Foster(Angel) and Kelsey Grammar(Beast). The rest of the original cast is also great: Halle Berry(Storm), Hugh Jackman(Wolverine), Famke Janssen(Phoenix), Anna Paquin(Rogue), Ian McKellen(Magneto), Patrick Stewart(Charles Xavier),Rebeca Romijn(Mystique)...I think Brett Ratner did a great job and he can be proud.

445,firefox2k,Mutants can be mortals too,3,27 May 2006,"I, like everyone who was a great fan of the first 2 movies, was very nervous when noting the change of director for this movie. When this happen it is usually a sign of disaster. This time, it was NOT the directors fault, it was the writers fault in the horrible completion of the trilogy. They had absolutely NO IDEAL how they wanted to end this. As my definitive movie review continues, I will rate the movie as a movie and try to explain the movie as related to the comic book. The movie was OK, I will give it a C, and I am being VERY nice about that rating. The beginning was good, and the original baseline plot for the movie was good as well, then things get really out of hand. Too many mutants doing too many things, and not enough focus on ONE plot. During the middle of the movie it jumps around and you feel like they rushed it, in which they did. According to official time the movie was only 1 hour and 44 minutes long. Exactly the same time as the first x-men movie, which was excellent, however they needed to focus the story and should have made it at least a 2 and a half hours, to tell one story correctly. Now, as a movie translation based upon from the books, It gets an F. I purchased x-men number one, and numerous spin-off x-men comics. The movie takes ""The Phoenix Saga"" and mixes it with ""The Coming of Apocalypse"". Those who know and love the comic know what I speak of. The Phoenix Saga is arguably the best-written saga ever for a comic book series.

And ""great"" is what fans would expect from the epic series.I think the main problem was the fact that it was only 104 minutes. These were not enough time to evolve the characters and the situations. Everything seemed in a hurry and it's of a great mystery to me why an epic movie such as this was cut so short. It feels rushed. If the director was given the ""go ahead"" from Hollywood to make the movie at just 120 minutes, I think that it would fair way better with critics and fans. It just needed more time.Other than that, it's a good flick, enjoyous and full of action.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The movie entertains for the 2 hours like it's supposed to, but don't think about remembering what happened in the movie after you walk out the doors.First of all....The special effects were awesome, the people who did that did a great job, you'd feel like it's a good movie because they just wow you. Hopefully more movies get good special effects like that.The acting was pretty good I guess.....It is semi-famous people acting. At certain times you felt the emotion they were trying to feel, and at other times they didn't, I guess everyone can't be a good actor. I loved the Juggernaught The directing is basically the only down side of this movie. You see, nothing really happened in this movie...It was just cool special effect scenes. I forgot 99% of what happened in the movie because of how it was directed. They threw in some funny jokes too which was good.Overall, this was a COOL movie, not a GOOD movie a COOL movie if that makes any sense.",X-Men - The Last Stand
448,james.p.taylor,"Ratner closes the current run, not great though.",7,25 May 2006,"A cure, a way to suppress the mutant gene that gives the new race its super powers has been found and is being offered to anyone who wants it. Magneto sees this, because of his childhood experiences, as a genocide aimed at wiping out the mutant race. He decides to take the fight to the Homo sapiens and destroy the mutant who is the source of this cure.First off I think the film was okay. If anything it was too short, and that isn't something I find myself saying too often these days. An extra 15 minutes wouldn't have been too much of a stretch.Ratner isn't a great director. Unfortunately he's following on from a director who got this franchise off the ground with two fantastic films that built on characters as well as having some nice pieces of action. Ratner uses the people to link bits of action together and the film is weaker for it. A lot of the story relies on you the viewer knowing the past two films quite well to fill in the blanks. Ratner has what seems to be a check-list of things to put it: Love triangle? Check. Super villain? Check. Hero's fighting amongst themselves? Check. Big action? Check. In jokes? Yep.The characters may be a weakness, but the action is where the strength lies. The action sequences start within the first hour and there are some casualties, thinning the ranks from early on. The real eye-popping fight happens near the end when Magneto and his army of angry mutants turn up at the lab where the cure is being held to destroy the place. Cue burning cars being used as weapons.As a summer blockbuster this is a really good movie. As the 'last' instalment of the current X-men franchise it doesn't do a good job. Go and see the film, enjoy it.And wait until after the credits for a bit of hope for the future of the series.",X-Men - The Last Stand
449,Frequency270,Damion Crowley's Reviews from The Darkness: X-men 3,8,26 May 2006,"X-men 3: The Last Stand is a fantastic spectacle, an utterly worthy sequel to the first two movies. It will awe you with imagery, amuse you with character interaction, and tickle your intellectual and philosophical bones without over-burdening them.For the new arrivals, the X-men movies are a series of movies featuring a group of super-powered beings (called 'mutants') who have to deal with the prejudice of humans against them. Additionaly there are a group of super-villains who are intent on becoming the master race and eliminating the humans.The principal thread of this movie is that a ""cure"" has been discovered for mutants. The primary antagonist, Magneto, is ready to crush those who would create the cure and establish political and social dominance over the humans. As a parallel to this story, Jean Grey who died in the previous movie is seemingly reincarnated as the Phoenix, a telepath/telekinetic with overwhelming power. The Phoenix becomes entangled in the struggle between the good mutants, the bad mutants and the humans.This movie knows its special effects and how to execute them. There is barely a dubious moment in the entire movie. You get a true sense of the awe inspiring power that these characters have.On the more humanistic level, you get to see how many react to being a mutant and to the news that they may be able to fix themselves. Of note are Anna Paquin and Ben Foster (who was sorely under utilized) on opposite ends of the spectrum. There is much more, but seeing it for yourself is the best way to experience this emotional impact.The script and plot are, for the comic vet, old ground; but, by movie standards this is quite fresh. Plus the dynamic presentation of a story that has been presented statically for so long is quite the rush. Most of the actors, from the principles to the tertiary, did excellent work. So good, in fact, I would feel shallow pointing out my one real disappointing character in the movie. Notable debuts (at least in this franchise) are Ben Foster, Kelsey Grammerand Dania Ramirez.Overall, an excellent movie, that I recommend rushing out and seeing as soon as possible",X-Men - The Last Stand
450,dpoll390,This movie had such an opportunity...,5,27 May 2006,"This movie had a great opportunity to be a dark, sorrowful movie that would have left fans and audiences stunned. But no, because Singer left and Ratner took over, you can just tell the difference in directing styles. Plus the screenplay was terrible. David Hayter should have never left as screenwriter, that also did a number on the film. This movie has a lot of death in it. And for a movie with so much death, there were just too many ""trying-to-be-funny"" moments. Maybe trying to lighten the mood and make the mood not too serious or something. But who knows what Ratner was thinking. The movies previous to this were incredible and really had a serious, personal turmoil edge to it. This film focused on the turmoil of all mutants, and honestly, there are far to many of them to think about to feel bad for any of the ones that died. Even the important ones. I tried to feel bad. I wanted to feel bad. But I couldn't feel bad because of the terrible surroundings of the movie. Had all this death occurred in one or two, forget it, everyone would be stunned. Not here. Also the movie was all packed into a short 1 hr. 40 mins. If it'd been longer, maybe it would have been better.The positives are that the action sequences really are very cool. The final fight was great and one of the best scenes in any of the three movies. Storm has a more prominent role in this one. And again the main focus is on Wolverine.I think (POSSIBLE SPOILER) that many of the characters were not fittingly thrown out of this movie (ie Cyclops Xavior Mystique especially...) but you'll see what happens and get to decide for yourself. You didn't get into the characters as much as you did the first two installments, this film had the opportunity to be a dark, gloomy, action thriller that left audiences stunned, but wound up an unsatisfying, unfinished, and ultimately a disappointing wannabe film.4.5/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
451,Dead_Mann,"Absolutely Terrible, Total $h!t",5,12 August 2006,"like i said this movie is terrible, one of the worst of the year, and i cannot get why it has such a high rating.................................its predictable, horribly made, it probably could have been good if it was made by Bryan Singer like all the other x-men movies, but instead this total dumb @$$, who hasn't made one good movie in his pathetic, useless career, the acting is absolutely terrible, especially Berry, the only good thing about this movie is the effects and action, which is the only thing people pay attention to anymore, so as long as their is tons of action, blood, guts,good effects, its a master piece, if the rating ever goes over 6.5-7.0 i will trash my computer if you want tons of stupid action, full of cheesy tag lines, that i guess are supposed to be funny, go ahead and watch this movie, i don't even feel right calling it a movie",X-Men - The Last Stand
452,pip-7,Truly X-ceptional,9,27 May 2006,"I've always have been a fan of the X-Men stuff (though not a fanatical comic collector but rather a big kid who was and still is an avid fan of the cartoon show) because of the diversity of its characters, mature storytelling and the sophisticated themes of discrimination and relationships between humans and mutants. I've also recently collected the first two chapters of the X-Men DVD movies (both directed by Bryan Singer) and really enjoyed seeing how Bryan tackles them by implementing some new and clever ideas and taking necessary liberties while maintaining the spirit of the comic books. Now that Bryan's gone to help out the Superman franchise, it's up to Brett Ratner and some of his new crew to complete the final act of the symphony, which definitely seems a little frightening a first, since it usually has a higher chance of changing the mood and the quality of the show entirely. Even recently mixed receptions strengthen its case, so I honestly don't know if X3 would worth a ticket price, so I just hope in with my mom and just try to enjoy.Believe it or not, X-Men 3: The Last Stand, no matter what many critics say, turns out to be a really awesome movie! From the prologue that takes place 20 years ago to a grand climatic battle, the movie succeeds in fulfilling the promises of the first two while extending the trilogy's capability to the fullest. Though Brett could have polished the flow of the story (the sub-plots seem incoherent and cluttered), he really nails it by creating many of the most memorable and emotional pivotal scenes that even the great Bryan can't seem to muster. And if you think all of the emotions have been replaced by special effects and explosions, the critics must have been blind. Indeed, some of the characters DO SHOW THEM IN IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCES, even if it's mildly executed! SFX does not only make eye-candy visuals, instead, it helps to strengthen the emotions they express through their powers while at the same time creates metaphors to allow viewers to make their own interpretations.As for acting, like its mood and setting, so far it remains consistent to the previous ones. Expected some fine performances from Patrick Stewart, Halle Barry Kelsay Grammar and the ever magnificent Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto Rules!) but eventually, Hugh Jackman steals the show with some of his finest portrayal of the lone wolf Logan/Wolverine. Sure, we all wish every mutant got a crucial role in the movie but hey, sometimes you can't do everything to make it workable (if you are a filmmaker, what'd you have felt?).Despite its inevitable shortcomings and its lack of Bryan's brilliant input, X3 still proves to be a satisfying conclusion to the series, making way for more possible spin-offs such as Wolverine and Magneto and even possibly X4. Don't be tempted by the critical consensus by the major critics (they are so dead wrong); sometimes it's best to listen to your heart and decide.",X-Men - The Last Stand
453,trvolk,Dump Halle Barry Already,6,4 June 2006,"I was a fan of the DC universe, and my exposure to X-Men was limited to whatever issues my friends had. Given that, I do not know how central Storm is to the X-Men oeuvre, but for the movies, her prime has long passed. Xavier was alright, but I am hoping that with his death and kicking Storm upstairs as headmistress will allow any further movies to breath without the oppressive star power of the actors.As for the X3 story, with her overwhelming power why did Magneto hold back Jean for the final attack? True, unleashing her earlier would have cut out 5 to 7 minutes of the battle scene, but since that time was devoted to killing off unnamed mutants anyway, the main characters could have had a more spectacular and, more importantly, an actual tactical clash.Although this film has some major flaws, at least the producers left the field open for the next film to rethink the X-Men as a movie vehicle. With Ian McKellan playing such a strong Magneto, the basis is here for three more strong movies, if not more, but the good guys need to be reworked from the bottom up without consideration for actors' egos.",X-Men - The Last Stand
454,xindi005,"Definitely not a Matirx 3, but not the X'men's best",7,9 October 2006,"First of all, X3 wasn't a bad movie. In references to being titled an action movie, it hits the mark and really keeps you at your seat. The bonus scene at the end(and no, I won't say what it is) does get you to think that there may be an X4...who knows really. However, as a person who has grown beyond the need for useless violence in movies, it doesn't hit the mark.I just rented this movie to see if I could make a spot for it in my heart to perhaps buy it in the future(and to see the bonus scene, since I left without catching it). I went to the theaters to see this film with all of the expected anticipations that any fan of a cool franchise would have. I had hoped that the rumors about the director not knowing what he was doing, about the rumors that Singer(who I really think should have done this film--watch it and you will understand why) had taken his best writers with him to do the awesome comic book film, SUPERMAN RETURNS, and that this film was done mostly to make Ms. Berry happy, wouldn't be true. For the most part, some of them were true. The story did nothing more than shaft my hopes in the aft sections; it was baseless. Many characters were introduced without really putting a reason why they were there in the first place. The dark Phoenix was in this film and let me tell you, they really should have thought this one through. Instead of a tried and true character that we were all expecting to see, they delivered an angry child that really didn't come off as being that threatening. Also, if done correctly, this should have been the main focus of the film instead of the real plot that sounded more like a 1940's film plot than a believable story. Furthermore, killing off the two main characters in less than an hour in a way that really seemed more of an insult to their reason for being there, just made things worse.True, this is a very exciting film. If you forget the others as many did with the first BATMAN film franchise in reference to the last of that franchise, it really is. And don't worry, this one is not anything like THAT monstrosity of a comic book film. It really is good, but it's not an X-men film. Like another franchise that forgot about its roots(ironically, Patrick Stewart was a part of that as well), this one unintentionally sets itself apart from the other two in a way that shouldn't happen ( it is a TRILOGY).I'm still debating on whether to buy this movie at twenty dollars or wait until it drops in price and maybe not feel as guilty in getting something I don't completely love. I'm an advent collector of anything, especially action films, so we will see.",X-Men - The Last Stand
455,edzelr,A Fitting end,8,26 May 2006,"I have seen x-men 3 and i gotta tell you it's really good yet it's different from the previous two. But what makes this third and last film special is that all bets are off which means anything goes. I think there's no need for more exposition or character development in the film because it has previously been told on the first and second.The climactic battle is far the best battle scene in the X-Men trilogy although my little problem is the introduction scene, I believe that Brett should followed Charles Xavier's narration then the titles and the exposition of Jean Grey's character and to the danger room. but still, anything goes.He brilliantly followed the formula of a last chapter of a trilogy in which scenes are repeated in the first X-Men where Rogue runs away and scenes which are mostly Deja Vu plus anyone in the main character can die.I may have spoiled this review but i wouldn't tell you the whole story so i suggest that you see X-Men in it's last and fulfilling chapter.",X-Men - The Last Stand
456,TJ1380,Not as good as the first two,7,26 May 2006,"First of all, I would like to say that I was a huge fan of the first two ""X-Men"" movies. Although they could have very well have been big, loud, dumb action movies with none of the sophisticated and intelligent themes of the comics, director Bryan Singer took them and turned them into intelligent sci-fi allegories for intolerance and acceptance. While the main plot of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is interesting and makes for some good philosophical debates, it makes the mistake of focusing far more on comic book-style action rather than the intelligent sci-fi of the first two films in addition to biting off far more than it can chew.The main plot deals with the invention of a serum that permanently suppresses the x-gene in mutants, thereby making them human. This is advertised by its inventors as a cure for the mutant situation, which naturally raises the ire of both the X-Men and the much more militant Magneto. While some mutants welcome the ""cure"" as a way to rid themselves of mutations that are more of a curse, others see it as just another way for humans to control and eventually exterminate mutants. One character states that being a mutant cannot be cured, which creates an interesting parallel to some real-life ""problems"" such as homosexuality and the belief that they are diseases that need to be cured or controlled. This is some fascinating stuff, and as long as the movie sticks to this premise and the extreme reactions it invokes in the characters the movie manages to be smarter than your typical summer fare.The film also deals with another fascinating subplot. Jean Grey, who was apparently killed at the end of ""X2,"" has risen from the dead and now is more powerful than any other mutant on Earth. She has manifested a new very destructive personality that calls itself Phoenix, and she is apparently powerful enough to be an even bigger threat to both humans and mutants than Magneto or the cure could ever be. She doesn't hold back with her powers whenever she's in Phoenix mode, and she is downright frightening whenever she uses them. A movie about the Phoenix becoming the ultimate in human evolution and therefore the biggest threat to the human race would've been a great way to end this franchise (it had its own lengthy storyline years ago in the ""X-Men"" comics), but here it becomes nothing more than a subplot that appears pretty much when the director decides when we should see more people being blasted into subatomic particles. With as frightening and as powerful as Jean becomes here, one could easily argue that the Phoenix subplot deserves its own movie.Like I said, this movie seemed to bite off far more than it could chew, and not just in the way it handles two concepts that each need their own movie to be fully explored. There are just too many interesting characters that don't get the screen time and development that they deserve. I would've loved to see the continuation of the Cyclops/Jean Grey/Wolverine love triangle in the form of the two men trying to reach Jean while at the same time being at odds because they're both in love with her. I would've loved to see more of the scientist that creates the mutant serum and how he simply wants to cure his mutant son's ""disease."" For that matter, I would've loved to see more of the son, who is reduced to nothing more than a cool visual. I would've loved to see more of the Iceman/Rogue/Kitty love triangle, and how it might influence Rogue's decision to seek out the cure. None of this is explored very fully, so we are sadly left with a bunch of missed opportunities.It may sound that I'm doing nothing but trashing on this movie, but the truth is that, despite its obvious flaws, there's still a lot to like. The acting is as good as it was in the previous two installments, with Ian McKellen being the obvious stand-out. Magneto is clearly the villain of this movie, but he's a villain that the audience can actually get behind thanks to McKellen's commanding performance. He can be downright nasty, but he also comes off as very wise and even respectful to his enemies (one line that he has in regards to Professor Xavier carries a lot of weight, especially when one takes into account the friendship that the two men once had). Other standouts include Hugh Jackman (who now seems to be playing Wolverine as someone who has grown from being a somewhat volatile loner to a team player to a potential leader of the X-Men), and Kelsey Grammar as Dr. Hank McCoy (or The Beast, as he is known to fans of the comic), who provides plenty of charm and wit even underneath layers of blue fur. Finally, the action scenes and special effects are possibly the best of the trilogy; the completely insane battle between the X-Men and just about everyone else that makes up most of the film's third act is almost reason enough to see the movie.In the end, this is definitely more of a typical summer blockbuster than the first two ""X-Men"" films, but I don't think 20th Century Fox realizes that the reason why so many people like those films is because they're not typical summer blockbusters. They are actually very smart and sophisticated, which is exactly what good sci-fi should be. ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is definitely a good comic book-style action movie, but it doesn't have the sophistication and subtlety of the previous two films.",X-Men - The Last Stand
457,wrudd,Can't believe Ratner did this!!!,1,30 May 2006,"Jean Grey kills Scott Summers?? Does Ratner know any thing about the X-men comic? Why did they let some one who doesn't know the characters direct this? So would he have had Superman kill Lois Lane? How about Scarlet blow Rett's brains out? Then she kills Professor X? I can't understand what the thinking is here? If he had Lord of the Rings he would have had Frodo kill Sam and Gandalf. As for the rest of the movie it did not make much more sense. Why did they have the boy completely unguarded? There were a couple hundred guards but none with the boy. Why didn't the army think to have sniper rifles to target the main mutants? I really really felt let down. I just don't understand why they would destroy a franchise like this. Maybe Ratner can have James Bond kill M and Q, then receive a pardon from the PM just as the president seems to have pardoned the mutants. What a terrible, terrible, waste of time, money, and opportunity. I hope Ratner retires with his millions and never directs again!!!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
458,garynorton,"""Copy-cat"" Director mimics the Singer Style, but lacks the substance",7,25 May 2006,"Not the epic finish many of us would have wanted, but not the unmitigated disaster so many thought it would be coming from Brett Ratner.The film has some nice touches, with better set pieces and superior effects work to previous instalments. The emotional involvement and character consistency seems a little uneven and spoils the feeling of satisfaction I had been feeling. This is where Singer would have nailed the movie showing his superior understanding of the comics universe and its players.Good points? the ""20 years ago"" retrospective of the two leading protagonists Professor X and Magneto,an amazing use of digital technology to make them both look younger; the battle over Jean Greys split personality; one of the X-mens death's; the overall special effects and the confrontational climax at Alcatraz.The middling? The film probably tries to cover too many ""bigger"" issues and relationship stuff with too short a running time and a broad strokes approach to the emotions.The confrontation at Alcatraz.The bad points are the ""now you see them- now you don't"" approach to some of the established mutants such as Cyclops,Mystique and Rogue. For a film that barely gets past the 90 minute mark, there could have been a more patient introduction to newer characters and a better send-off for the old; some of the dialogue falls flat and there are one too many smart Alec one liner ""quips""- mostly Wolverines. It belittles the serious nature of the character.Due to the running time, the films editing leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps Brett Ratner had poorly constructed key story elements/writing and a general lack of time that even a longer running version would have made little difference too. No doubt there will be a Directors Cut and we can see for ourselves. I do not feel the need to blame Ratner for this, as the Studio was the one pushing for the release-despite the production losing not one, but two, directors! You would have thought they had learnt their lesson on the 1st film.One major niggle was a continuity error as the Brotherhood of Mutants arrived on Alcatraz and prepared to do battle. The afternoon sunshine suddenly cut to total darkness! Weird! So long as you try to remember the characterisations from the previous films and overlook some of the issues mentioned, then the film is a very enjoyable, effects-laden romp.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Really!!!! the movie didn't do them justice at all. Both of them were infinitely more powerful than the movie showed. That goes for professor X to. Well to be honest, the only three in the movie that was described close to the original, was Bobby, that fire guy, and Magneto. The script writers should be ashamed. We who went to the cinema should get our money back. This was perhaps the worst movie ever, based on a super hero comic book. Thats all I have to say now.

460,redsoxmb545-1,An Amazing Movie...despite some minor flaws,9,30 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand (directed by Brett Ratner) was supposedly (as the title implies) the last movie in the X-Men series. However, it has been confirmed that there will be an X-Men 4 and maybe even an X-Men 5. Anyway let's get to the actual review. In this movie, the government has found a 'cure' for the mutants which instantaneously turns them human. As in the first two X-Men movies, Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) have opposing views to the situation. Magneto believes in a violent revolution against the humans. Meanwhile, Proffesor X wants to reason with the government and wishes for tolerance between mutants and humans. Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who apparently died in X2 is resurrected. But now, she has more power than even she can control and is a threat to herself and everyone around her. She is now known as the Dark Phoenix. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman at his best), Storm (Halle Berry), and the rest of the Professor's crew must make a stand against Magneto and his powerful army. This movie is very entertaining. The mutant action is very thrilling and very fun to watch. The state-of-the-art special effects create mind blowing visuals. The fantastic visuals are the best during an incredible sequence involving the Golden Gate Bridge. However, I think the movie was a little too short considering how much more could have been done. There were so many new (like the cult favorite Juggernaut) (and old) characters with stories that could have been and should have been further developed. The whole movie seemed it was a little rushed to the ultimate battle at the end. That being said, it was still a very good movie and has a few shocking and heartbreaking moments that are quite unexpected. All in all despite some minor flaws, this is a great movie and is absurdly entertaining. I highly recommend it to almost any audience.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Hugh Jackman, in a recent interview, stated that you wouldn't notice the 'seamless' transition to the new director...I noticed. The movie (firmly) held your hand through the entire script, treating you as a young child. Saying that, if you have young teenagers I would recommend this movie..this is who the movie seems to be geared towards.The bright spots of the movie were Mr. Jackman himself, and surprisingly (or perhaps not, considering who the movie is geared toward) the young actors in the movie, which I thought did an excellent job and were well-cast for their roles.I wouldn't say this is the worst movie I've ever seen (Have you seen Warriors of the Wasteland?

Otherwise, Brett Ratner has a lot to account for in this completely underwhelming film. The dialog does nothing for characterization or plot. The story is too cumbersome to fit into less than two hours (to anyone that knows the story lines the film is based off of, it's easy to see how this should have been two or three separate movies). The actors do the best they can with the material they're given, but when your lines consist of ""You know what you need to do, now do it, or don't,"" it's pretty much a still birth of a film, guaranteed.Characterization?

464,Lord_Crypto,"Thank you, Brett Ratner!",8,26 July 2007,"I was very nervous going to see this film. I was a huge fan of the Bryan Singer X-men films and I was uncertain how Ratner would do with the third installment. He ended up creating a great film that may not be as good as Singer's two movies but nonetheless, it is still a great film.Acting is top notch in this film, as it has been through all the movies. The cast in the previous films all shine. Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, and even Halle Berry. The most notable role is filled by Famke Janssen who brings out her best performance yet. She really has a lot of intensity with her character in this film and it is a joy to watch her on screen. There are some notable additions as well to the film. Vinnie Jones does surprisingly well as a humorous and ""tough-as-nails"" style Juggernaut and Kelsey Grammar portrays a terrific Beast. I was skeptical of him but he proved me wrong. All in all, the cast of this film is top notch.The cast may be good, but I feel there are some problems with the characters themselves. One is Cyclops. He is portrayed as such a wimp in this film and it sickens me. The one major line he has is, ""Some of us don't heal as fast as you Wolverine."" I mean, what a wimp! He is suppose to be one of the true leaders of this team and he gets swept aside in this movie like nothing. I was really disappointed with him. Another character is Angel. I am not really disappointed with his character but I think he is underused in this film. Ben Foster does a terrific job playing that character and he should have been used more. I love how they started the movie off with him though.There are so many great things about this film. We finally see Colossus in action. We see the true power and capabilities of Iceman. The true leadership qualities of the character Storm. And of course, the major role that Pyro serves as a villain and his powers. There may be many good things coming from a lot of characters, but it seems like the film tries to fit in too many new characters. We get no real back-stories or history of these characters. We are simply introduced to them and watch them in the film. We learn nothing really about them and that is a problem I have with the film and it is difficult to do with so many characters. The movie should have been longer. It was only 100 or so minutes. It could have been over a good 2 hours and then the time could have been taken to learn more about these characters.The story of the film is very good. Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn wrote a great story although I think they may have been trying a bit too hard in this film. It seems like they may have been trying to create a pure entertainment or pure comic style X-men film which does not really work for me. Although I love the concept behind the ""Mutant Cure"" and the entire storyline. The action in this film is top notch. As a pure entertainment film, it gets 10 stars. The special effects are amazing, the fight scenes are terrific, and there is some funny humor in the movie as well.X-men 3 puts a good close to the movie franchise. I just hope the series does not go down the toilet after this film like so many other franchises. X-men 3 is a true X-men film that fits the style created by Bryan Singer in the first 2 films.",X-Men - The Last Stand
465,SelvarajanK,X-citement Short Lived,7,23 June 2006,"X-citment was the word that i was looking out in this movie and a X-Men fan will not no disappointed (at least to an extent) out of the hall. The film opens in a nice manner builds up beautifully and a emotional ending. There is something for every one in the movie. But the only disappointment is the scarcity of the stock. I mean the story had every bit to make it a 3hr saga, but i don't know why the final episode is so short that you are left with a feeling that literally every character looks like they are making a guest appearance. Brett Ratner has done a good job with almost all the character, but still the rush to finish the movie could have been avoided. May be its blessing as well cause the movie is short and right on the money you don't feel lost or start comparing the earlier episodes with this one. The special effects is beautiful as usual, even though the characters are short lived they are well crafted to fit in the right proportion. Hugh Jackman had a big role to play and he does it with ease, his actions is well crafted specially the one in the jungle. Halle Berry looks pretty and i like her style of walk in the movie. Ian McKellen is beyond word as he does the job with so ease that you can't even think of some one else playing this character. Juggernaut, Angel and the Boy who is the cure has been used more than little in the movie, while they had lot of potential to be used more. I liked the Mystique in the movie (specially after the cure ;-) The final fight with Famke Janssen as Phoenix and Magneto and others were excellent and nicely choreographed. I enjoyed X-III very much only disappointment was the length of the movie and scarcity of the action sequences. Hope they reconsider the title ""The Last Stand"" cause i think we need few more in this series. To me this movies is X-citement short lived (lenght of the movie)",X-Men - The Last Stand
466,saxon-7,A so-so ending to the trilogy,5,25 November 2006,"The third installment and perhaps the last of the X-Men series dosn't expand much on the story, where X-Men introduced the main characters (Xavier, Magneto, Storm etc.) and X-Men 2 further developed many of the characters (mainly Wolverine and Cyclops) and introduced a few new, Last Stand is quite weak, it does introduce a few new cool ones and re-introduces Jean Grey but it just dosn't develop the others further, in fact it concerns itself more with being an action flick rather than anything else which is sad considering that the Marvel universe is very diverse.This episode or in fact the whole trilogy dosn't deliver what the comics or the universe promises and this is in no way due to poor performances or effects. Ian McKellen in particular does a magnificent job as does Famke Janssen.Last Stand does have it moments, Grey's super-status and resulting inner struggle, Wolverine's single-minded lust (maybe not the right word there) to find/rescue Grey, Xavier and Magneto's relationship and history, Rogue's desire to be able to touch other people without hurting them, but somehow this dosn't come off as more than minor sub-plots and is relegated to a backseat on a bus position by the producers/Director's desire to make a full blown action party out of this great story/universe, which it indeed is or could have been if handled in the right way, perhaps much of the problem lies in the fact that in X-Men they tried to introduce too many characters and then didn't develop them or few of them much further in the sequels so when Grey dies in X-Men 2 and Cyclops goes the same way you don't care much unless you know them from the comics.I was considering buying this series on DVD after having seen X-Men 2 but much relied on Last Stand to further develop and better the series but sadly I was putting too much fate in the producers/Directors and I don't feel they delivered what this universe has to offer.I give Last Stand a 5 out of 10 due to the characters and as a Trilogy X-Men gets a 6 again due to the characters and a slightly better overall feel (in a great way due to X-Men 2).",X-Men - The Last Stand
467,Gorgorgorgoroth,Very weak and corny,3,22 July 2016,"This movie makes the first two X-Men movies look like masterpieces and I'm not saying the first two X-Men movies were bad, they were above average films.When I first saw Beast, I actually laughed out loud. He looked RIDICULOUS! I couldn't take this movie seriously. Beast just looked goofy.Some scenes tried to be funny, like when Ellen Page's character trapped Juggernaut in the floor, he said ""Do you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"" It comes off really corny. The humor was childish.When the mutants were fighting the soldiers next to the bridge, most of the mutants weren't even using their powers. They were just fighting like normal humans. Wtf? And the soldiers' plastic guns were laughable. They looked so fake! At the end of the film, Phoenix tries to kill everyone and Wolverine is trying to get to her and when he does, he says to Phoenix ""I love you"" and Phoenix goes all soft on him and then Wolverine stabs and kills her.So in this film, Cyclops dies, Professor X dies, and Jean dies but the ending tries to be all happy and people were smiling. What the Hell?! And Marie left and didn't help at all because she saw Bobbie and Ellen Page's character ice skating with each other and got all jealous. But as soon as the movie is about to end, Marie decides to show up right before the credits and did nothing to help out her allies.And what was up with that Asian guy who grew small spikes out of his face and shoulders? That superpower was lame as fvck! It was nothing special.God, this movie had poor writing and horrible direction.",X-Men - The Last Stand
468,sublimital_death,Who ever came up with killing off all the good guys is an idiot!!,3,8 October 2006,"At the beginning of the movie Cyclops is killed by Jean Grey, for no reason as far as I can tell. Then they kill of Professor X by her as well. the movie drags on while you watch waiting thinking that Cyclops is going to pop out somewhere cuz he can't be dead. The shock of Professor X killed is enough to make you want to take the movie out of the DVD player!! Then at the end you at least hope that Jean Grey will come out of this trance that she is in and make an attempt to be a good guy, but nope, she dam near kills everyone until Wolverine kills her. leaving us with a 90 minute piece of crap that killed any chance for another movie as far as I can tell. Who wins in this one? I have no idea, Why are all the good guys getting killed off with out even a fight!?! This movie is junk!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
469,arginnon,Almost as good as X-Men. Almost.,6,4 May 2012,"I'm not a huge X-Men fan, I didn't read the comics, but I've seen all of the films now. This is definitely not the best one, but a rather fun movie to check out. Magneto is cool, Wolverine is bad-ass and Vinnie Jones makes a hilarious Juggernaut. The movie is worth watching only for his awesome line: ""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"" It's just legendary.The plot revolves around a cure what was invented to rid mutants of their abilities. Magneto doesn't want that, so he forms an army of mutants to destroy the source of the cure. The X- Men need to stop him, but I'm not gonna tell you if they succeed or not.I saw some familiar faces in the film, like Dania Ramirez, Ellen Page, Shohreh Aghdashloo and of course Stan Lee at the beginning. I didn't expect to see them, so it was a good surprise.The special effects, costumes were really good in the film, the story was a little weak and the acting was fairly average too. It had some good fight scenes, cool new abilities and Wolverine, who is Marvel's Batman.The film is worth checking out, if you're down to comic book adaptations.",X-Men - The Last Stand
470,kingderella,The first two X-Men movies got the balance just right. The third entry? Not so much.,5,25 February 2010,"Warning: major spoilers! Another warning: comic book geek speaking!Producing a good X-Men movie must be extremely difficult. The filmmakers ideally would have to appeal to both casual audiences and fan-boys, juggle an extensive cast, deal with the inherent pulpiness of the source material, work in dramatic character moments and heady concepts alike, and excel at action scenes and special effects. The first two X-Men movies were pretty much perfect, getting the balance just right. The third entry? Not so much.On the surface, the ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" at least feels coherent with the previous entries, so director Brett Ratner deserves some credit for getting the tone right.I also liked the idea of combining the ""Dark Phoenix Saga"", arguably the most iconic X-Men story ever written, with ""Gifted"", a modern classic. The biggest problem with ""Dark Phoenix Saga"" is that it doesn't really resonate with the X-Men's central themes of oppression and prejudice; bringing in elements of ""Gifted"" for thematic relevance was a smart move.So much about what I liked. Unfortunately, the filmmakers screwed up about everything else.The whole movie feels rushed. The plot is extremely simple, and the characters don't have enough space to breathe. Important characters are shoved to the background or unceremoniously killed off (Rogue, Cyclops). Other, less developed characters inexplicably take center stage (Storm, Colossus, Shadowcat). Wolverine gets so much screen time it becomes annoying.With both characters and plot taking a backseat, the movie is reduced to an action- and cgi-spectacle. Sadly, the movie doesn't really impress on that front, either. Some scenes are sweet (the opening flashback, Magneto attacking the truck, Juggernaut chasing Kitty), but mostly, the effects are disappointingly mediocre.From a comic geek point of view, I was also bothered by how much the movie diverges from the comics. The previous entries made some significant changes, but it always felt like the source material was highly respected. I didn't get that feeling when they killed off Cyclops, or introduced their versions of Calisto and her entourage.Ultimately, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" just doesn't work on a number of levels, and is a very disappointing conclusion to the trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
471,JonTMarin816,The best in the series...,9,26 May 2006,"To explain X-Men: The Last Stand in a word, it would be incredible. X-Men: The Last Stand starts off where X-Men United left off and we see Jean Grey evolve into the Dark Phoenix. Her presence poses much threat to the super mutants and triggers a war between the good and the evil. Joining the cast is veteran actor Kelsey Grammar as Dr. Hank McCoy, or the Beast, and sultry actress Dania Ramirez playing a supporting role as Callisto.One thing I liked in particular is that Halle Berry's character Storm got a lot more presence in the film. I thought that she was overshadowed in the last two films. This film was a lot more action packed and the story is very complex. My warning to all, pay very close attention to it and you'll reap the benefits after the end credits. :)Great film, go see it! X- Men: The Last Stand ***1/2 out of ****",X-Men - The Last Stand
472,moviefan1725-1,Exactly what I expected...and that ain't good.,5,26 May 2006,"I've never read any of the X-Men comics. Apparently fans of the comics are beside themselves because this movie does not follow something called the ""Dark Phoenix"" storyline. I guess it was something pretty amazing. My entire knowledge of the X-Men comes from the first two movies. Both of which, I loved. With that in mind, I can tell you that X3 basically craps on EVERYTHING established in the first two movies. Major characters from the first two are killed off in favor of new characters who, frankly...stink. Angel is a waste of film and adds nothing new to the movie. Beast talks. And talks. And talks. And at the end of the movie, he hits a few people. Thrilling. Kitty Pride can run through walls. OK. Honestly it was more interesting in X2 when she went through her bed to the floor below. Juggernaut makes the obligatory potty joke and runs though solid objects. None of this is at all interesting. We deal with 3 deaths (sort of) and a couple of other characters losing their mutant powers. One on accident, the other on purpose. So instead of building on that, it just happens and it's done. How about showing how they feel about no longer being mutants? Especially the one that is robbed of it's power. But no. We get A LOT of characters staring at each other. A LOT of Halle Berry making several ""They can't cure us. There's nothing wrong with us."" speeches. And does anyone know if Hugh Jackman was paid for every time he says ""Jean"" in this movie? If he was, he made a pretty good buck. I haven't heard a characters name so much since ""Carol Anne"" was screamed every 2 minutes in Poltergeist III. The movie is incredibly dull until about the last 20 minutes when the good and bad mutants finally have at it. They fight on Alcatraz, and for some reason Magneto feels the need to rip apart the Golden Gate Bridge with his powers, and re-position it so his army can march onto Alcatraz Island. I guess stealing a boat or two would've been too much trouble. It's the movie's signature fx moment, and it's utterly useless. What's really unforgivable with this movie is the way the characters are treated. Like I said, several are killed unceremoniously. Those that are left behind are treading water. The biggest sin of all is they've turned Wolverine into a WIMP!!!! If he's not wandering around like a lovesick puppy, hoping to save the newly reincarnated Jean Grey, he's dispensing fatherly advice to the young students at the mutant school. Sure they show him fighting, but there's no impact to it. It feels thrown in. And if there is any justice in Hollywood, someone will put out a recall for Halle Berry's Oscar. She's just terrible. I had a bad feeling about this movie ever since Bret Ratner was announced as director. He is a competent director, but not a talented one. He can connect the dots. That's it. He has no vision. He's only as good as the script he's handed. He can add nothing to it. Unfortunately for him, the script here is bland. It starts with a good idea (a mutant cure) but never goes anywhere with it. Some mutants want it, some don't, and the bad mutants are going stop humans from making more of it. Jean Grey returns, but really, she does nothing. She stand there, stares, and stuff flies apart. She's a robot. She kills for no reason. Even she doesn't seem to understand why half the time. A friend I saw it with tonight equated it with the first X-Men movie, but he's dead wrong. The original movie had character development, good action, and a vision. X2 is probably the finest superhero movie since Richard Donner's Superman. X3 is not a terrible movie. But it's PAINFULLY mediocre. It brings nothing new to the table. If you wait for video, you're not missing anything. Here's hoping that Bryan Singer's abandoning of the X-Men series in favor of Superman Returns proves worthwhile. I don't think I could handle 2 mediocre superhero movies in one summer.",X-Men - The Last Stand
473,mjscarface,Entertaining? Yes. Flawed? Oh yes.,6,30 May 2006,"First of all I'm not a comic fanboy, just a faithful follower of the movie series. I remember when we first saw Toad and his wicked tongue, when there was that huge mystery of Wolverine's background and when we first saw Magneto working his magic. Therefore my disappointment comes from feeling a little cheated after six years and three films.Singer basically kick-started the comic book film again with X-Men and it was mature, intriguing and funny. Then, X2 capitalised on the plot threads with great enthusiasm. Now, it's up to Brett Ratner...As another reviewer mentioned, you can only criticize Ratner so much. His directorial style is rather bland, for sure, but with a decent script, they can be elevated. Rush Hour was funny, Red Dragon was based on a decent story to being with. X3, however, has some truly awful dialogue and it's handling of popular (even certain unpopular) characters is disgusting.The so-called ""plot"" involves a so-called ""cure"" this time. However, this plot device is thrown away by the end, suggesting that the cure doesn;t even work. So apart from certain deaths, the situation of many mutants seems to return to normal which only proves this is not the last stand were promised and certainly not the epic showdown we expected.There are some juicy set-pieces, I'll tell you now. Once again, they all involve Magneto and his amazing powers which allow his to ""fly"" the Golden Gate bridge to Alcatraz and crush an entire motorcade effortlessly. The action sequences, or fight scenes, are less coherent and the fact that there are only a few X-Men involved at the final battle emphasises that this is not the film it should have been. Characters are killed or rendered useless, otherwise they are simply shoved to the side, to allow for the new generation of anonymous characters to show off. It angers me to see how veteran X-Men are written out-of-character and discarded so easily.So should you see X3? Yes, for the usual mutant shenanigans, but no for seeing you favourite characters become shadows of their former selves.",X-Men - The Last Stand
474,missrljane,Exciting but fails due to poor handling of the characters.,4,7 August 2008,"The third X-Men film is the only consistently exciting film of the series, and it has an intriguing premise  whether mutants need to be cured  that echoes the first film, now instead of a mutant trying to turn humans into mutants, humans have found a way to turn mutants into humans, so it is more interesting than the disappointing X2. But it is by no means a good film, mainly due to poor character handling.It's clumsily written. Plot hints are painfully sledge hammered in while new ideas are dropped in with no explanation  exactly what is a mutant mark or class? The plot is a little holey, particularly at the finale, which happens far too soon, just over an hour in. To give this idea the attention it needs, and to handle returning characters and new characters sufficiently, this needed to be much longer than an hour and a half.That's the big problem. The characters. The Last Stand takes characters with little opinion on the cure as leads, sidelining those who do have opinions, such as Rogue, Mystique or Angel. There are too many new characters, who while occasionally interesting, needed to have been set-up in the previous films or left out. No character parallels play out and too many characters die in this film, considering the sparse death list in the previous films  is it trying to make up for lost time? There are serious character issues here, not least almost everyone suddenly being unlikeable, especially Storm, Magneto, Professor X, Bobby and Jean. Leader of the heroes, Professor X, follows the same character arc as in the first two films, but here it isn't handled as skilfully. Leader of the villains, Magneto, having long given up being a sympathetic villain is utterly repulsive and extremely irritatingly played by Ian McKellen, and despite egging Jean on constantly to kill people, still comes out with the worst-delivered line of the film, ""What have I done?"" Several main characters clog up the plot and would have been better cut, making room for relevant subplots. The pseudo-romance between Bobby and Kitty is a misstep, seemingly only existing to drive Rogue out of the film, despite her being infinitely more interesting and likable than these two kids, likewise, the desperate 'romance' between Wolverine and Jean is still being paraded around, despite there being no explicable or discernible attraction between them. It is tedious that Wolverine is still desperate to get it on with Jean, despite her now being a completely different person. She is insane, has no personality, and would have been better left at the bottom of the lake at the end of the last film. She is a non-entity of a character, reduced to a psychotic weapon. Whenever the camera pans over to her, it is a jarring reminder that she is even in the film, and when she decides to actually be involved in the finale, this leads to the biggest let down of the film. There are better parallels and subplots that could have culminated here, and it is too easy for the big ending.Meanwhile, other main characters such as Cyclops, Mystique and Rogue are heartlessly tossed aside both by their friends and the script, and their interesting subplots axed, when these are the strands that should be carrying the film.Admittedly, new additions Beast and Juggernaut are a lot of fun but however cool six X-Men facing the onslaught of hundreds is, we barely know this small line of underdeveloped, boring characters. And is this really the last stand? Isn't this actually the first stand? It's not even that important.As usual, my biggest gripe is that Rogue doesn't get to shine, when she has the most potential. When Rogue professes interest in getting cured, Storm claims that there is nothing wrong with her. Rogue's response should have been to touch Storm's face, and see if Storm still thought there was nothing wrong with Rogue, now that she was dead.Stick to X-Men, and pretend it had no sequels.",X-Men - The Last Stand
475,SlackerRus2000,Nay-sayers . . . . READ THIS!!!!!,7,31 May 2006,"Many people are upset by the actions taken in this film and I am here to adhere logic to the films decisions -- 1.) Pheonix doesn't have flames and power isn't as great as in comics - first of all the Phoenix saga is very complex in the comic, Bryan Singer really pushed the screenwriter into a corner by ending the second movie with jean being resurrected as the Phoenix. The movie smartly chooses to disregard the complex cosmic explanation and just explains it as a splintering of the mind, cause her power was to great for her to control. For a telepath to suddenly be engulfed in flames would not make sense to the audience and therefore be seen as stupid. 2.) The small parts of mutants and other x-men lore related moments . . i.e. The Danger Room. I felt Brett Ratner wanted the trilogy to end on a high note, giving fans all the things they had been begging for and had been denied. Although the mutants were use sparingly, all of them has some part to play in the plot and subsequently move the story along, it would have been great to see more of them but they were needed in the story and just seeing them on screen was enough to make this X-men Fan happy. The Danger Room sequence with the sentinel was put in there entirely for fan service, Bryan Singer chose to deny this both times to fans dismay . . . at least Brett Ratner didn't. And for those of just wanting to know, check out the Trivia section on the movie page to know that, initially they were going to have Gambit in the film. 3.) The multitude of deaths . . . most were due to disgruntled actors who did not want to continue any franchise installments. 4.) Why couldn't Pheonix blast Wolverine like a rag-doll like she did in the underground X-men lair? I think she was struggling with her consciousness, therefore not at full power, though a few close up face shots to prove this would have been nice. 5.) Pheonix isn't as strong as she is in the comic . . apparently the people who side with this argument had no problem over storm being as weak as she was in the first and second movie, which she thankful is closer to her actually strength in the third film. Most other disagreements have an explanation and are not that important to begin with. Now for the disagreements . . . In the final sequence magneto was a bit brain-dead, although this didn't ruin the film for me like others it was kinda stupid. 1.) Why did he move the entire Golden Gate Bridge? That just allowed for human soldier to come and gang up on him from both sides, in a battle that is not a smart move. 2.) Why didn't he just throw bits of the bridge at the army instead of sending mutants in to die? It would have been easily fixed to show Pheonix struggling with her Jean Gray consciousness over seeing her x-men comrades in gear and ready to fight and Magneto having to talk her down, therefore telling the mutants to charge as a diversion until he could get control of his weapon. 3.) Why did Pheonix just stand there? look to number 2 for what they should have done. 4.) Killing Cyclops, although I'm sure the actor wanted out, is a travesty. They could have easily showed him in an end sequence in the woods wrapped in some sort of telepathic something-or-another, something other than killing the leader of the X-men, although I hear Halle Berry demanded a bigger role for her to do the film.It may sound like I hated this film, but I loved it. I would rated it better than the first, but not as good as the second. The action is better than the first 2 combined, action sequences never seemed one of Bryan Singer's strong points as a director. The emotional weight of the film feels light and comic-booky which I like, but it never reaches the heart-wrenching moments of the 2nd film. This film feels more like fan service than the previous films, and although many characters were never elaborated on it does bother this viewer. Any comic book fan knew who they were and rejoiced over their appearance, and any causal viewer just liked watching their powers. Fun for the whole family.",X-Men - The Last Stand
476,baz_trinity,Average in so many ways,6,3 June 2006,"OK, I saw this movie today in the cinema and it was just plain poor. But I'll begin with the positives.Visually, it was great. Some amazing CGI in there and it just looked fantastic.And now on to the negatives. First of all, the dialog is Appalling. Some absolutely shocking lines in there that bordered on humorous. They should have the script-writer fired and to be told to give up as the lines that were supposed to be epic and dramatic were just plain clichéd at best.The storyline is ridiculous, again, it's as if they put as little thought into the storyline as they did the dialog. It is apparent that both ""baddies"" and ""goodies"" were fighting for the same thing, but of course the ""baddies"" were doing it for all the wrong reasons.The cast was filled with good actors fully capable of the roles they were put into, yet the poorness of the movie made there characters kind of boring and lifeless.However, I will say this, X-Men fans will probably love it. It captures all the magic of comic books and I suppose it does make for a decent sequel if you liked the first two. I just personally think it not only DIDN'T match up to various other superhero movies, but it also didn't live up to its own potential.Just average.",X-Men - The Last Stand
477,jaspermcc,"Stick to partying, Mr Ratner, you're not a film-maker",4,18 May 2006,"There are so many problems with this film, it's impossible to discuss without some spoilers, so I apologise for that. For a start, it's quite boring. I'm not sure how that's possible for an action movie running 104 minutes, but it is. The action scenes aren't terribly exciting, and quite a few of them are a step back or too similar to scenes from 1 or 2. Storm's and Wolverine's fights, for instance, seem all too familiar. Juggernaught running through walls? Wasn't that a Levi's ad? The big finale? Bit dull, really.Mmmm, Cyclops bumped off in the first 10 minutes? I don't remember that in the Dark Phoenix saga. This 'origin' of the Phoenix is slightly daft, too, and makes the name utterly nonsensical. Nor is there any of the evil from Phoenix. Her eyes go dark and her skin grey, but there seems to be little malice in what she does. There's some debris circulating around her, sure, but the deaths of people in this is more a kind of accident than deliberate. Where's the Dark Phoenix who went out and devoured a sun? Wolverine watches Xavier reduced to a flurry of ashes, and instead of taking off after Phoenix and the brotherhood of mutants, he falls to his knees by the Prof's wheelchair, 'consoled' by a sobbing Storm. It'd be funny if it wasn't so bad. Speaking of funny, Xavier's funeral. Oh dear lord who wrote this garbage? There were quite a few pointless wasted characters - Rogue and Angel particularly.I won't say that there weren't a couple of moments that captured some spark, but they were very few and far between, and mostly involved the utterly beautiful Famke Jannsen (I might be showing some bias, I don't know). Halle Berry was utterly wasted, again, Kelsey Grammar was a blue Frasier, really (what was with the 50's glove hands, they stood out a bit?). Everyone's dialogue was bad. The story was bad. The bit with the bridge? What was the point? Sorry about the crummy review, but this really was a crummy film.p.s. Weren't the x-men supposed to be a well trained bunch? Rogue was looking quite chunky to me. Apologies to Miss Paquin.",X-Men - The Last Stand
478,glocksout,Failure of a finale,4,14 August 2006,"This is supposedly the last in the X-Men series before they go on to more focused films like Magneto and Wolverine. The Last Stand is appreciably different than the two previous installments due primarily to it featuring a different director, and secondarily because they continue to introduce more characters from the series. This does make it markedly more difficult to maintain focus. The original X-Men comic books took years to move through the same story arc. This was evident while viewing this film. The story seemed fractured because there were so many sub-plots. It was almost like there was a bunch of different movies cut and put together. The forays into the characters we forgot we were supposed to care about are forgettable, and could easily have been cut. However, it was an entertaining film throughout with great acting and spectacular effects. The battle scenes were bigger than the last two films because the mutants moved from the underground to do battle out in the open. I really don't know what else to say. Now that I'm actually writing this down, the movie wasn't all that great. It was a lot of fun to watch, but it could have been much better. The effects tried to compensate for the weaknesses elsewhere, but even the giant finale battle was sort of aloof. We were sort of detached from what was actually going on, and I felt it was more of an atmosphere of battle than actual action. I think as a package of three films - the X-Men trilogy - everything would be really cool. I enjoyed it, I really liked it, but it is far from being the pinnacle of movie making - even at comic book standards.",X-Men - The Last Stand
479,retroguy02,"Not as intelligent or deep as its predecessors, but X3 is still a fun-filled action-fest",7,5 September 2008,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the first two X-Men films directed by Bryan Singer, especially X2, I was (like many other people) skeptical when a new director was announced, perhaps because of which X3 didn't leave a very bad taste in my mind when it ended, although there were many things that could've worked much, much better than they do. My biggest contention with the film (and I'm sure most people's as well) was that it relentlessly prefers quantity over quality when it comes to characters.Apparently the studio wanted to end the X-Men franchise with this film and make it the bona fide ""last stand"" for the series, so director Brett Ratner crams in as many characters as he can, so that everyone gets to see their favorite character. Unfortunately, except for Beast, all new characters are cardboard-thin. Even worse, certain vital characters  who had been nicely fleshed out by Bryan Singer  are conveniently wasted away to accommodate the new characters in the movie's 100-minute runtime.Cyclops is ridiculously killed off in the movie's first 20 minutes; since his death is off screen, I was hoping throughout the movie that he'd make comeback, but unfortunately he doesn't. Mystique, Magneto and Rogue are stripped of their powers by the mutant cure; Rogue, who's barely used in X3, deliberately takes it (ugh, morals). Jean Grey's Phoenix incarnation, the movie's other main storyline besides the mutant cure, is also killed off by Logan in the end, but (thankfully) in a fairly befitting and appropriate manner. Her death is also not very touching because of her character's misuse; first, she (apparently) kills off Prof X (more on that later), and then she stands for 20 minutes like a statue besides Magneto while he destroys Alcatraz during the climax.As far as wasting characters goes, the ""head"" of the X-Men, Prof X, receives the worst treatment. First, he's disintegrated to fragments by the Phoenix at Jean Grey's home, yet the post-credits scene shows him in a hospital room being tended to by one of his mutant-researching human colleagues. First of all, he shouldn't have been disintegrated in the first place; but once it was done, just killing him off would've been better than this nonsensical ending. Many of the newcomers to the series (Callisto, Arclight, Quill, Multiple Man, what-not) are apparently killed off during the climax, while Juggernaut's fate is left undecided. I was also disappointed by the unexplained absence of the Nightcrawler (one of X2's better characters) in X3.The difference in direction brought forth by the change in directors is also felt. In X2, after Pyro destroys the police cars at Bobby Drake's home, the X-Jet is chased by military jets all the way until it nearly crashes; even Jean wasn't able to stop both the missiles. Yet in X3, after the Phoenix crashes her house down from 10 feet in the air, neighbors don't notice at all and the surviving mutants leave in peace without any aftermath. Similarly, in Singer's films Magneto was put in a plastic prison after he was caught, but after his powers are neutralized during the climax in X3, he's seen playing chess with himself in a park! No police, no aftermath of all the trouble he caused. Note how Singer tried to tie up as many untied knots left behind as possible while Ratner just wants to move on quickly.Since both of X3's story lines are strong enough to hold their own, the movie could've done better if it went with only one of them  either the mutant cure or the Phoenix. Fortunately (in this case), X3 is also the most action-heavy of all X-Men films, and the movie packs healthy doses of thrilling, high-impact action for every cardboard-thin character introduced or vital character wasted away. However, X3's use of the mutants' powers during action sequences can sometimes favor aesthetics over logic; for example, Jean Grey uses her powers during the climax when they would look most impressive, not when they would be most effective. Same goes for Pyro and Magneto's ""flaming cars"" combo during the climax; why not simply burn the entire place? On the other hand, certain characters  Colossus and Kitty Pryde  that were limited to cameos in the previous films take part in full-fledged action sequences here. Kitty is also a substantial supporting character, a major player in the climax, and also a well-used plot mechanism as Bobby's 'other girl' and the reason Rogue wants to get cured. Ellen Page, the third actress to play Kitty, also gets a lot more screen time than any of her counterparts in the previous films and fits right in Kitty's personality  spunky, hot, and short; maybe ""short"" is Page's specific trait, but she turns in a decent performance regardless.Aside, the acting is decent as usual from most of the cast, although Kelsey Grammar plays Hank McCoy / Beast to near-perfection, complete with a Churchill quote humorously wisecracked while trampling people during the climax (and seeing him do that is always fun). On the downside, Multiple Man is narcissistically played to the point of self-parody, the 80-something guy playing the president was a talking corpse, while the Juggernaut was apparently written for comic relief  when he's rescued by Magneto, his first line is something along ""Do it quick, because I need to pee"". Dialogue-wise, X3 is lightest in tone of all X-Men films, and features an assortment of blunt one-liners (in contrast to X2's usually tactful dialogue). But X3 does provide some powerful moments (e.g. Jean's confrontation with Xavier at her house) and dialogue to offset that, and most of the time the humor works well, since the movie doesn't take itself too seriously anyway.X3 is an action-fest type of movie that despite not being very smart or deep is still pretty fun.

My bros, my dad, and I went to see it, and we were a little disappointed by the story. I mean, the whole thing was a little confusing on how Jean came back to life, and at the very end, it got even more confusing. I don't want to spoil what happened at the end, but the cures... who can make a cure for mutanity? Mutants all have different things. It was good, but it needed more. Of course, all the sequels might be good, but they are never as good as the original. So that is why I give it an 8, because minus two for the other movies of it.8/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
482,jhobdell,Reasonably entertaining but...,4,21 April 2008,"Oh good grief! How are the mighty fallen? I feel compelled to comment on this title, having seen it again last night. I've been disappointed by it every time. I think my biggest problem with it has to be around the character of Jean Grey/The Phoenix. At the end of X-Men 2, they hinted very heavily at her realisation as the character of the Marvel comic books and I was expecting/anticipating it right up until the moment she re-appears in the story. I was expecting her to be the ultimate weapon in the X-Men's arsenal, against Magneto's growing army, not a largely innocuous member of Magneto's 'Brotherhood'. As a result, Magneto's army seems pitifully small, the action confined to the USA, when the development of the so-called cure could have been a catalyst to something far more widespread and exciting.There are many things to recommend the film but for the most part I can't get past the continuing focus on two totally undeveloped groups of mutants, the idiocy of not using The Phoenix as more than an obscure figurehead (so much more could have been made of the class 5 mutant idea), and most especially a Famke Janssen who looks positively jaundiced!",X-Men - The Last Stand
483,XFLRWF,"X3:X-hilirating, X-citing- X-Cellent",9,29 May 2006,"Whereas the third installment of the ""X-Men"" series could have been exhausting, exasperating, and expired, it is exhilarating, extraordinary, and just plain excellent. Following in the tradition of its predecessors, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is full of action-packed sequences displaying the fantastic powers of the hero and villain mutants while also promoting the issue of tolerance of people with differences. Taking over the directorial reigns of Bryan Singer, Brett Ratner significantly makes his mark in the series with his own vision of the comic and does not disappoint fans looking for an adrenaline rush. The familiar cast of Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen reprise their roles as the popular mutants and help bring the film into an exciting new chapter.In the years following the last X-Men story, an antidote has been developed in which mutants would have their mutation genes reversed and they would be able to live as normal human beings. Mutant rebellion leader, Magneto (Ian McKellen), sees the vaccine more as a threat against mutants than a cure. Raising up an army, Magneto intends to fight the cure and homo spines to the end. It will be up to Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) X-Men (Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Shawn Ashmore) to stop him and the powerful weapon he possesses in Jean Grey (Famke Janssen).Brett Ratner is no stranger to grand-scale action pictures having overseen such box office hits as the ""Red Dragon"" movies and the ""Rush Hour"" movies. One of the challenges Ratner overcomes is combining an intricate comic book storyline while maintaining the audience's attention with explosive action. Ratner not only manages to portray the mutant rebellion plot but also the underlining story involving Jean Grey and her abilities. With each storyline, he shows the characters' powers so as to draw in the audience with story and effects. Ratner throws everything into this comic book picture: huge explosions, one-on-one showdowns, and a terrific display of mutant powers. Ratner takes many of the mutants' abilities to another level and captures their destructiveness and power with precision.In ""Last Stand,"" audiences are privileged to see further character development in Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Halle Berry's Storm. Jackman shows the loner is still coping with the frustrations of doing things his own way without teammates. But Jackman now shows Wolverine's softening a bit as he settles into the role of a father-figure to the gifted students and an even deeper love for Jean Grey. But when it comes time for battle, Jackman unleashes the ferocity that fans have come to know and expect from the hero. Berry also settles into a more defined leadership role and becomes a new voice of reason and action for the team. Audiences will notice the change in her attitude as she gathers to the troops to fight and becomes even more of a defender for mutant rights. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are always impeccable in their respective roles as Charles Xavier and Magneto. Stewart is the ever-hopeful guardian of the school and his students who only wants to help build a bridge of understanding between humans and mutants. His desire to help and the warmth of his cause is felt whenever he is on screen. This is countered by McKellen's anger and hatred for humans. His urgency to fight and bring down humanity is never forgotten. Whenever McKellen is on screen, his eyes will tell the whole story behind his reasoning and his actions. Among the new characters debuting are Kelsey Grammar as the wise mutant diplomat Hank ""Beast"" McCoy and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut. Grammar's intellectual style brings out Beast's wisdom and character and becomes a great example in the debate of becoming human or staying mutant. Jones' physique and persona is perfect for Juggernaut's pure destructive force.Should ""Last Stand"" prove to be the final chapter of the ""X-Men"" series, it is very well done. Ratner does a great job of tying up the loose ends while also leaving a ray of hope (which fans need to stick around after the credits to find out). Audiences will not be disappointed in display of powers and the action sequences that derive from them. As with any comic book movie, comic fans may dispute the accuracy of the story. However, if one goes for a good fantasy film with imaginative style, this will give you your money's worth.Grade: A-",X-Men - The Last Stand
484,superguapo2000,Introducing ... everyone!,1,3 July 2008,"X-Men: The Last Stand is the simple story of about two-hundred different superheroes (""mutants""), each with his/her own special super-powers. There's a guy who shoots fire, a guy with nails coming out of his head, a really strong guy who lunges at people really hard, and another couple of hundred characters or so to keep track of. Some of these mutants have super-powers that are roughly equivalent to those of Jesus. Jean Grey, for example, can blow up an entire town just by thinking about it, and Magneto can throw cars around by pointing at them.This movie has five plots. One of the plots is that there's now a ""cure"" for mutants that converts them into regular human beings. Naturally, most mutants are upset that their condition is being referred to as a disease, and there's much turmoil and disagreement amid the mutant community as to how to address the so-called cure, which results in several billion dollars worth of property damage.One can't help but notice an attempt at drawing a parallel between the mutant cure in the X-Men's world and the recent claims of a cure for homosexuality in our own non-Marvel(tm) reality. The deep political message is that just because someone is different, it doesn't make him bad, and we shouldn't try to ""cure"" him. The problem with the parallel is that to my knowledge, homosexuals don't really have the power to shoot flames out of their fingers, or make my house explode just by closing their eyes. If they did, I'd definitely be a homophobe. So the analogy doesn't quite work.Come to think of it, none of this movie works. The only saving grace of this flick is blue Fraser and that very sexy naked blue girl who's pretty bad-ass.Who would have thought that blue people would be so cool?",X-Men - The Last Stand
485,Y-Sly,I hate Brett Ratner or how to destroy a movie franchise!,5,26 May 2006,"I read so many negative and positive critics everywhere (mostly here on IMDb) and sorry, but I agree with the negative ones. This movie is bad... very bad. I like the first two episodes and now I feel almost the same thing when I saw Batman Forever after Batman Returns. Okay, the situation is not that bad. ;) In X3 there are a lot of weird things like unimportant and unfinished characters and story. The directing was bad and Brett Ratner is a coward. He MUST kill all mutants and not because those mutants can die too, no... it is because he (and Fox) wants to make a fourth movie with no characters. Good luck for them next time, I will watch the next X-Men movie too, but please, bring back Bryan Singer and apologize him.5/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
486,Ace_of_Sevens,"Pretty good, but not as good as the first two",7,29 May 2006,"When I wrote my review for X2, I commented on how deftly it handled a huge cast of characters. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the sequel. Perhaps a lot of the problem is that it is nearly half an hour shorter. Angel is merely as a plot device. Colossus doesn't seem to even be integral to the story. Even Beast doesn't quite get his due. Kitty gets lots of screen time, but relatively little character development. The bad guys fare worse. Try to name two personality traits of any of Magneto's new goons. I can't do it.The previously established characters don't fare a lot better. Storm gets more screen time, but none of it particularly interesting. There are some bits with other characters, but the main cast is pared down to Professor X, Jean, Wolverine and Magneto, all fine characters, but a drastic reduction from the previous movies.The lack of characterization is noticeable compared to previous movies, though it more lessens the effect than wrecking it. All other aspects of the movie are quite strong, luckily. The effects, while perhaps taking too much of the focus, are top notch and the plot, about a company trying to market a cure for mutants and the political repercussions is quite interesting.I could have done with more character, more running time and less or better set pieces, but it's fairly good and I still look forward to any future output from the franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
487,mt7176,X3! A grand finale or is it?,10,28 May 2006,"In the last couple of years the fan boys have taken over the movie gossip news and if anything doesn't meet with their satisfaction they completely write it off and do all in their powers to bring the film down. Well I'm hear to say to all those fan boys...GET A CLUE and perhaps a life.I thought X3 was going to be terrible from all the news I heard. The film was rushed, the effects were bad, and the new director was a joke. WRONG!!! This film continues right where the second film left off and just as the second film raised the bar set by the first film so does this one and then it successfully brings the film to a satisfying conclusion. In fact the Sunday afternoon crowd I was surrounded by applauded loudly at the end of the film. It was a crowd pleaser for all and not just the fan boys.The reason why I liked the XMen movies is because in order to bring the films to the silver screen the directors and screenwriters of these films weren't afraid to do actual adaptation or refinement to make the world they're portraying more dramatic. They're not afraid to take the source material and separate what translates well into a film and what does not and throw the latter away. As much as I liked the Spider-Man movies they always seem to me like I was watching a video comic-book. Sometimes staying too close to the source material keeps the characters in the film from jumping off the screen.Everything from the acting, sets, direction, effects were all very well done. Also the soundtrack to this film is a Grade A, classic movie score.If you haven't seen this film and you like the X-Men movies or just a good summer film then go see it. You'll be glad you did. Of course you should also stay till the credits end. Its not the biggest payoff in the world but it does make you wonder if this truly was the X-Men's last stand.",X-Men - The Last Stand
488,TheScottman,I feel bad for Stan Lee!,3,27 May 2006,"I love X-Men, the first two were good films, and then this came out. From about twenty minutes into the film I started to shake my head until the end credits. I feel that The X-Men Franchise should be put in a hole deeper than six feet so I won't have to put up with People that just destroy the whole universe of the X-Men.I have to ask these questions, Where is Gambit? and Why has Morph been over looked for the third time? I feel that this franchise passed up Gambit too many times, three strikes and your out, so he should either get his own film or we pretend this movie never happened and Make a real X-Men three. Morph is a huge part of Wolverine's character and they seem to not even care about that. Juggernaut was a big disappointment, they cast the wrong guy for it and then gave him crappy lines, but then again everyone got bad lines. That brings me to my next question. When did Storm become the strongest mutant of all time? I mean really what can she do? Make it rain a little, or no! run for the hills. Halle Berry can't act! She got a big part in this movie and she had bad lines and she delivered them poorly. All I have to say to her is stop crying about not winning an Oscar or anything else, because all you deserve is a pink slip from life.They trashed Wolverine's character, Logan is a loner, he couldn't care less about the X-Men and motivational speeches are not his job their Cyclops', but I'm not even going to get into that. But here's another question for you people that did or will watch this movie, What happened to Nightcrawler?I feel bad for Stan Lee, he was a producer on this disaster, he should have said, maybe this isn't a best idea. Comic book movies just took one huge step backwards.I did like Jamie Madrox Showing up, ""Multiple Man"" or ""the man of a thousand personalities"" is one of my favorite minor mutants, but that's what he was in this. just another minor / useless character. If they used his character right, he could have brought a million more laughs to this film that it really needed. Over all this movie should be thrown away! If you have not seen this movie yet, please don't. I need to cost this movie at least 30 bucks to make myself feel better. If you don't take this warning to heart I'm telling you after you see it, you'll be on your knees crying. I hope that when My friends and I were complaining about this film on the way out we stopped at least five people from seeing this movie. Any money this movie makes I'll blame on the teaser of ""Snakes on a Plane"" in the previews. I hate to say it, but that teaser got a much better reaction then this film and I know it'll be better, because it's gonna have to really try to be a worse movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
489,warrenf_peace,"Good, but typical sequel *spoiler*",7,29 May 2006,"I loved comic books as a child, and I think the X-men movies are the best adaptation from the comics. The acting has always been superb, the direction excellent, and the scripts have been strong. Unlike many superhero movies, X-Men has always taken itself seriously (with just a few campy moments for needed comic relief). This is how I read the tone in the writing as a boy, and the films succeed at so many levels. With much anticipation about the release of X-Men III:The Last Stand, I was preprogrammed to believe this could be the crowning jewel of the series, however, I was a little disappointed in a few things. So, this is a SPOILER next:1. They should have used the 'massive' system by Peter Jackson's company (Lord of the Rings), and had way more mutants - some of the staging was unimpressive. Then again, the production design was great as always.2. Kelsey Grammar and Patrick Stewart are two of the finest actors, so they could have used some more interaction - the script writers should have realized that and let these two riff a bit more.3. Even when a comic book character dies, they should stay dead. Unless the actor's agent holds out for more money on X-Men 4. 4. This film shows the potential for this series in other media - much like The Matrix did with Animatrix, X-Men is a long-term franchise, and could even be spun into a cable or network series. I wonder what number the accountants have set up for that to happen? 5. Famke was kind of uninteresting to me this time around as Jean Grey/Phoenix (was that how her character died in the comic book? I don't recall the details from my youth!). She looked very wooden at times (I guess she was kind of dead already?), and maybe that's how Ratner directed her, but something was missing. Maybe I felt no emotional connection between her and Wolverine (the script? what I ""read into it""? their chemistry)?)Choosing a script is probably the first decision that impacts a film's success as an art, and in the case of this X-Men movie, The Last Stand only gets a 7.5; it's special effects, while excellent in places and well integrated, the live action overlays looked thin at times. The story script would have benefited from some character relationship development. All in all, a competent, but not ground-breaking. Probably a good time to do away with the specific characters, and bring some younger blood in. Although I would like to see Halle and Hugh get together (in the next one?) - if I were Wolverine, I would've been on Storm in about 2 seconds, but those actors are probably past their ""sell by date"" for steamy love scenes.There, I've torn it apart. Now I'm going to buy it for my DVD collection because it is a part of the series. In other words, ""two thumbs up"", ""I loved it"", and ""destined to be a classic"". They better make X-Men 4. If only someone would pay me to write it.....",X-Men - The Last Stand
490,SJinSeaTac,Ratner ruins another franchise,3,31 May 2006,"***NO CRUCIAL Spoilers HERE, BUT THERE ARE SOME*** Why do these major motion picture companies continue to let Brett Ratner direct their films? First Hannibal Lecter and now X-men. Who cares if he has wanted to direct a comic book/X-men film for years? I just hope they won't let him do it again! Why you ask? because all of his films are incomplete thoughts and ideas, or scenes that are so literal you can predict exactly what is going to happen next or throughout the rest of the film. The best example of this is how characters appear in his films just to be there but serve no real purpose. For example, why is Rogue in this film? What is the point? To tell us that everyone's life is their own and they should be able to make their own choices? Excuse me, but even though the plot is paper thin, it gives the audience enough knowledge of this conflict without her even needing to appear in the film. Also, the conflict is never fully established between her or Bobby, or even Kitty for that matter. Is that because she is angry about her powers and inability to get close to others? Maybe, but even if it is, who cares? We get it! The other problem with his films are that the characters appearing will usually only serve one specific purpose to the story, such as in Red Dragon, where we get to see Mary Louise Parker a whole 3 times before the climax of the film, and one of these times she is learning to fire a gun...can you guess what purpose her character served in the end? Same thing in this film: we get new mutants to link the story together because the director and writers couldn't figure how else to do it. Example: Isn't it just a LITTLE too convenient to introduce a character that can sense another mutant's powers and strengths? I mean, really, how many times do we have to hear a location call-out to Magneto because the writers needed to link this mess together (i.e.- ""she's on the far side of the building"", ""she's at her house"", ""she's in a heavily guarded trailer going god knows where!"").The scenes in his films follow no story line and might as well be pasted together in any given order. Example: one of Magneto's cohorts is turned human just to have Magneto turn his back on them because they are no longer a mutant. Is the point of this scene to establish that he is a really bad guy? Or is it a set-up for this character to betray Magneto later, just to have the betrayal result in nothing? Does this betrayal have anything to do with propelling the plot of this film forward? No. Its pointless! The rest of the film is Ratner trying to see how many new mutant powers he can show off without any real purpose except for us to watch the special effects in action. Shock waves, ramming through walls, moving at the speed of light, doppelgangers to confuse us (like we didn't see that one coming)...the list goes on. The effects are really cool and seamless, but who cares? After all this the film goes to the government trying to track down the rebel mutants in a remote forest, resulting in nothing being gained by this betrayal of Magneto's former accomplice, followed by the story moving straight into the climax...why? I assume the only reasoning for this is to once again see the ""new mutants"" in this franchise using their powers.For all of the special effects and the gruesome happenings in this film, it is pretty neat to watch, but after having left the theater, it becomes less impressive almost immediately. Tons of the main characters die, people switch sides, then die, battles ensue 'just because', characters are introduced and then killed for no purpose, and the whole time the camera does nothing to capture any real emotion in which the first two films had expressed so wonderfully.ALSO, all of the fight sequences you will have seen before, so don't expect anything new. You will see fight sequences with no real purpose, and you will see characters go ""places"" and get into fights with no reason, and not even to propel the plot in any way. For example: one of the characters gets into a really bad fight after having gone out to look for another and then comes back and says ""She's with Magneto"". Of course she is with Magneto....he took her 20 minutes ago when you were with her!!!! More violence and special effects do not compensate for a bad story and a bad director who cannot keep anything together enough for anyone who reads books to tear out the pages and put back in any given order.Wait for DVD if you already have not seen it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
491,schaefer.oliver,Too much in too little time,6,1 June 2006,"This was an entertaining movie and no one has to be ashamed about it. But there happened too much in too little time. Being nearly half an hour shorter than the second installment, all of the character development had to take a backseat in favor of the big set pieces and FX sequences. There are a lot of new characters but they are only receiving a third rate treatment. They rush by with such a speed that I don't even remember most of their names which is a pity because some of them have much potential, like Ben Foster's ""Angel"". So this is the rare movie where less running time is the biggest problem. In most cases, whether it's a sequel or a stand alone movie it's just the opposite. The most recent example for an excessive running time is Ron Howard's ""The Da Vinci Code"", which easily could have been trimmed to 125 minutes. Where that one has to much exposition and explanation, this third X-Men movie has way too little. All in all it's a good and entertaining movie with some major flaws.",X-Men - The Last Stand
492,restin_him,Fun but that is about all,5,2 July 2006,"I loved the first two Xmen films. They were done with deep thought and great detail. THis film lacks both of those things in my opinion.We find the Xmen in a time of big change. Jean Grey is supposedly dead, causing Scott to fall into a deep depression and eventual leave his friends to morn for her at her final resting place. Jean isn't dead, has apparently killed Scott and is a little off. A private company has been able to create a mutant ""cure"" and is willing to help all mutants who want it. The government is more friendly but likes the idea of weapons based on this cure. Then Magneto is ticked about this entire cure thing and is forming a big army of miss placed mutants.We soon learn some very interesting things. The company making the cure is holding a mutant child (named Leech)whose power eliminates the power of other mutants. They have been experimenting on the kid to get the stuff isolated. Jean has a split personality, the Jean we all know and an unstoppable all powerful side called Pheonix.As the movie continues Jean losses control over Phoenix and she becomes the worlds most powerful mutant, sought after by Prof X and Magneto. She ends up killing Prof X (supposedly) and joining Magneto. Magneto gets his army together and they attack the company to kill the kid and Storm leads the Xmen to stop him.That paragraph above was about as long as the movie was.This film had no deep story and was not thought out very well.Why is only Magneto upset that they are experimenting on this kid? Do the Xmen not care? Did the company adopt the kid? Is no one fighting to free the poor thing? How come Pheonix does nothing in the film except cause some damage for five minutes at most? Why is the most powerful, self absorbed, pleasure driven being around a stooge for Magneto? HOW THE HECK, does no one think of getting Leech near her to get rid of her powers? Home come Wolverine is the only one who can kill her? Why is the great mutant battle a bunch of guys just running at each other? You have a blockbuster budget and all they give is a dude who hugs ya and then gets like a porcupine? There were great ideas for possibly three great movies here. The Leech kid and saving him, Magneto makes an army of mutants, the Pheonix goes nuts and must be stopped. I think the makers of this film just thought it was all to cool to pick one and so made a very short (it is the shortest of the three) mixed up movie.Again, it was entertaining but it wasn't as deep or well done as the others in any way shape or form.Wait for it to come out on DVD, then see it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
493,sadik35,Great summer movie,10,13 June 2006,"I have been waiting to see this movie for a long time since I'v heard of it but I must admit, I heard about all the news about how some people said it was good and some said bad but Iknew that I would have to make my own alternative. And like most superheroes say being a superhero doesn't mean all the fancy power and suit and everything else, it's a tremendous sacrifice that one must make and when the time has come you will make your choice that will either save or destroy humanity. And I made my choice that this movie was great in every prospect. The action was like new to the word and the drama was ultimately played well by Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen when Jean at the last scene was willing to die and Logan was willing to sacrifice his love(Jean) for the human race. Brett Ratner really knew what he was doing when he signed up for the movie. X-3 didn't show much about the characters but I guess when two movies have already been made you don't need much. The great feature of all superhero movies is that no matter how it is done a sacrifice and choice must be made to determine whether the heroes are just pathetic wannabees or people who care. X-men 3 really portrayed what being a superhero really meant. This movie certainly deserves an Oscar award and a lot more than just one nomination but I guess time will come. I hope there will be a sequence to the X-men trilogy and I hope the same director can be in charge. Because without him, Hugh and Halle and the rest of the actors this movie would have never been made a movie to cherish.",X-Men - The Last Stand
494,Dmsokana,An average movie,6,25 May 2006,"First and foremost this was the worst Xmen of the trilogy. The first one was amazing. The second one was great. The third wasn't bad by any means but it was just average. Its hard to compare this movie to the others because they were so perfect. The movie has actions, most of the cast is back except the night crawler. In this movie there is a cure for the mutants which was very interesting to see who wanted the sure. I did like the movie I just expected a lot more. Well if you seen the first two you have to see this one but its gonna blow you away like the first two. Check it out 6 out of 10 stars",X-Men - The Last Stand
495,antipas2000,There is only one question you should ask yourself: Who will you stand with?,10,4 July 2007,"This was one hell of a movie. It packed in so much in shorter time than it deserved. Fans of all eras of the X men history can relate here. I know I can. It is a pity that I heard a rumour upon its release that this was going to be the last!! Hell, the X men could go on for another three! There are so many mutants out there! So much history. Yes I know that Xavier was obliterated by Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix etc, but they always come back somehow. You cannot keep a good mutant down. What I would like to see is this: X Men Rise of Apocalypse. Now THERE is a movie for you! You could introduce plenty of villains and evils in that one! I love the thought of it coming to pass, if possible. It would be one hell of a roller coaster ride! As many of you know, there is such a game out there - X Men Legends II Rise of Apocalypse. And as you also know, Apocalypse looks like one nasty villain. Cast your minds back to those brief cinematic included in the game. Beast getting thrown through the window, the destruction of the X - mansion, the coming of archangel! I mean come on! Why has that not been produced? The good thing about X Men The Last Stand is that it introduces the first real mutant against mutant ""war"" so to speak. And also introduces the Phoenix (not as powerful or omnipotent as fans know it to be) but still, Phoenix, or ""dark"" phoenix was there. Callisto, Juggernaut, Angel etc, this film has those mutants that we know and that we were looking forward to finally being graced on the big screen. But there should be more. Harry Potter is still churning out the films based on the books. X men has much much more than Potter magic and the rest of the Hogwort garbage. X men is timeless and spans so much history that there is PLENTY for directors, writers and producers to sink there teeth into. I want to see an X Men IV V and VI sooner rather than later. Star Wars did it, X Men can too. Even the Spider-man films I am sure can churn out another two possibly.Bring on more of the X men! 10/10 for X Men The Last Stand. This is one powerful film! Strikes you at your roots, your hearts and everywhere else...",X-Men - The Last Stand
496,kok_warlock,The X-Men Movies are over...,1,27 May 2006,"I have to say, when I initially heard that Brett Ratner was directing this movie, I was a little worried, when time passed and I saw the teaser and following trailer, I was very excited, it looked like Ratner was even going to do a better movie than X2, so I went to see it full of expectations.The movie was beyond a complete waste of time, It was the worst movie I saw in 2006 and by far the worst movie since Catwoman was released in 2004, I simply don't know where to start, but i'm gonna list ONLY THE MAJOR flaws of the movie.1 - Ratner put every single mutant he could find, in the movie, probably as a commercial way to appeal to the largest audience possible, that way, not a single character develops and they are certainly not believable, he misused them and reduced them to the power that they are, like they are nothing more than claws, weather-making and a frost machine, they have almost no personality in this movie, mainly because there is way too many mutants and too little time, which makes all of them quite shallow.2 - Brett Ratner, managed to turn Magneto's complex character in a shallow, two-dimensional cheap opportunistic villain, with no agenda except destruction.3 - Halle Berry as Storm is as bad as she was in the two previous movies, her idea of acting is making comical scary faces with some special effects in the background, fortunately for her, the rest of the cast is so misdirected that her bad acting doesn't stand out as much as it did in X-Men 1 and X2.4 - This movie was supposed to be about Jean Grey/Phoenix, for someone who is supposed to be the main character of the movie, she does next to nothing during the entire movie, a kill here, another there, while playing the 'silent 40yo holding a grudge kid' and something predictable happening next, well, there isn't much to tell, because her part is somewhat short, much like Angel who is also reduced to an extra, even tho his name was splashing in the movie's marketing campaign.5 - A great deal of characters, main characters and beloved other mutants of the comics, who are in the movie as 'extras', are killed like trash, without much meaning to it, just so the film can have bigger effect, which never does.6 - Special Effects, that's all the movie really has to show, but other than what I saw in the trailer and got me excited, there isn't much more in the movie, certainly there are a lot of 'bangs and booms', but the usual, cliché unimpressive type.7 - The story, or should I saw lack of it, in this movie was a joke, during the course of the movie, they simply forget about the story, 'what it was decided about the cure', When Magneto makes his move, enough to say that if you take a closer look, the X-Men are not defending innocent civilians or something like that, the X-Men end it up defending the 'Cure' and fighting Magneto's Brotherhood for the sake of fighting, as shallow as that, the only purpose is to make a big bad-ass action-scene, which really doesn't.Those are only the major flaws of the movies, I simply can't list them all, because honestly there isn't enough space here.When i saw this movie, I was in a big theater, and I could tell most people didn't like it, at the end of the session, people couldn't wait to get out of the theater, a couple guys did some short applause, but nobody joined them, I decided to hang out a while and ask what people thought of the movie, most of them thought it was 'very weak', the best reactor I saw, were a few kids that thought it was 'good, okay', the only reason why this movie isn't a flop is because it is been carried by the success of the two previous movies, much like Matrix 3, Matrix: Revolution, because there isn't much of an audience for this movie, the way it ruined all the mutants in the movie and lack of story, it was terrible, neither fans of the comic books or 20+ people seemed to have enjoyed the movie, and there was a fair amount of blood for kids the only ones who seemed to have enjoyed it, I can see that the studio probably had to lobby very hard to be rated PG-13.Overall this was a terrible movie made by a terrible director, the best comparison is to Joel Schummacher's Batman, Brett Ratner definitely killed the X-Men franchise, luckily there are plenty of characters to create 'spin-off' movies, but for them to make another X-Men movie, you'll probably gonna have to wait at least ten years, like Batman.",X-Men - The Last Stand
497,spiderguy_07,"Good, but disappointing (Where did Bryan Singer go?)",7,27 October 2006,"OK, this movie was good, but why did Bryan Singer leave the project and invite Brett Ratner in? He directed this movie like he didn't have a clue about what he was doing! Let's see, where was Nightcrawler and Gambit? Oh, that's right, NOT IN THE FILM! Nightcrawler just mysteriously disappeared from the X-Men. Gambit is never seen in any of the movies. Why? No one knows.What else...... KILLINGS! Cyclops got killed about 15 minutes into the film by JEAN GREY (The Dark Phoenix)and only had about 7 lines. Next, Professor Xavier gets shattered into pieces by some unknown power by The Phoenix. What was Ratner thinking when he cooked that scene up? Then Wolverine (Played by Hugh Jackman) played a good role but HE KILLED JEAN AT THE END OF THE MOVIE! This is nothing like what's in the comics! What else do we have here.............. TOO MANY CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN WITH NO TIME TO TELL YOU WHO THEY ARE! Psylocke, Spike, Calisto, Juggernaut (BIG DISAPPOINTMENT), Leech, Angel, Beast, and Kitty Pryde. Ratner just brought them in so he could see how fast he could kill some of them off.What was with them turning Mystique into a human? What was with them turning Magneto into a human? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, RATNER?! Hmmmm.... The cure isn't supposed to be the involved with the government, it's supposed to be Apocalypse's way of luring mutants into a trap to become his slaves. Where did Ratner get the idea that it was the government's idea.Some other things are missing...... No Shi'Ar Empire, no Savage Land, no Mr. Sinister, no Apocalypse, no Ahab, no Mojo............... What happened to these guys? What else....... TOO SHORT OF A MOVIE! This movie should have been at least been 150 minutes or more. 104 minutes is just way too short.This was a very good movie to watch, but why did it have to be so disappointing? Where did Bryan Singer go? Why is Brett Ratner a ""great director to do this movie"" all of a sudden? Let's just pray that Bryan Singer comes back with either an X-Men 3 of his own, or an X-Men 4 that cleans up Ratner's mess.",X-Men - The Last Stand
498,Lobo69,Sucked the life out of me and the franchise,1,31 May 2006,"Too say that this movie sucked the life out of me is a huge understatement.I can see why Patrick Stuart showed up for one more paycheck, but he was wise to get the heck out when it was obvious that the creative team responsible for the success of the first two movies had headed for the door.Same I think for the actors who played nightcrawler, cyclops and Mystique, my guess is that they signed on long in advance of Singer's departure, and once the paycheck cleared they did care how much or little screen time they got. I suspect anyone who did not like the new direction the film took after Singer left was simply killed off, or cut from the final edit.And Phoenix with no flames? Even singer had a hint of flames coming up from the lake at the end of X2. It would have been wonderful to see Phoenix flying through space in the form of a bird, a vision I remember clearly from the comics I read as a child. I'm sure Singer would have done at least that part right. In this movie she comes off as a greasy undead with no dialogue. Man what a huge waste of what could have been a great movie moment, gone now forever.I have a feeling this movie will have a huge tumble in its second week in the range of 70%, that might send the single thats needed here.I am giving it a 0 out of 10, wish I could go back in time and forget I ever saw it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
499,john_murdoch2002,"The New X-Men: All of the Powers, None of the Personality",2,26 May 2006,"When Brett Ratner took on X-Men: The Last Stand after Bryan Singer backed out, many fans were in an uproar. Would Ratner have the knowledge to stay loyal to the beloved characters that Stan Lee created? Would he have the depth that it would take to bring these characters to life the way that Singer did by making them so identifiable that non-comic book lovers could understand them as well? The answer to both questions is no.Deep characters have never been a strong point for Ratner (look at the disaster that was The Family Man) and, unfortunate for him, the X-Men comic books are full of interesting characters and deep interpersonal relationships. Ratner sacrifices such qualities in favor of over-the-top special effects that seem forced and fight sequences that are become too boring unless your characters have red electronic bars over their heads that decrease when they're hit.The storyline centers around a genetics facility that has discovered a way to permanently suppress the mutant genes, making all mutants lose their powers. The pacifistic mutants (displayed in Professor Xavier's school) are wary about this new cure, some are excited while some are offended. Then there are the hostile mutants (led by Magneto) that see the cure as a means of genocide. Naturally, Magneto's mutants attack the humans and all special effects hell breaks loose.Then we have a subplot revolving around the return of Jean Grey, who we thought perished in the previous movie and how her powers have now reached a dangerous state, due to a repressed personality only known as the Phoenix. Phoenix doesn't like to be restrained, so what does the Phoenix do? Yes, naturally, she lashes out as we are told in the movie that when you cage a beast, ""the beast gets angry."" So, how does one calm such a beast? The answer is never really brought out because we have no connection to the inner mind of Jean Grey since she has even less lines in this film than Arnold Schwarzenegger had in the first Terminator. Jean is not the only wasted character in this film, look at the new character introduced in the film in Warren Worthington III (known to the loyal fans as Angel or Archangel). His father develops the cure, but before he can give it to him, Warren escapes. And that is the entire story we get around Warren Worthington, even when he goes to Xavier's school, we never see him interacting with the other X-men or even the inner turmoil that goes through a child's mind when he is rejected by a parent.Now, I have been a loyal fan of the comic books for over a decade. I have collected the bio-cards, numerous issues and spin-offs of the series, background history of each character. Watching this movie aggravated me as a fan to see how it treated the characters who have become so beloved to me over the years. Under Brett Ratner's direction, the movie is hollow, lifeless and boring, three things that comic book movie adaptations should never be, especially one with such a rich history that X-men has.",X-Men - The Last Stand
500,couching_tiger_eatin_popcorn,X-Men: The Last Stand,3,25 May 2006,"This movie was disappointing, to say the least. I'm not a fan of Bryan Singer, but I respect him, and I think he did a great job with the X-Men series. I was prepared to deal with his departure from the franchise--but I really wasn't prepared for how bad this movie was.The main reason, is the script. It's absolutely horrible--it numbs you with familiar phrases you'd expect from a campy 50's sci-fi movie(with no redeeming values), makes you cringe with the soap opera dialogues, and leaves you scratching your head over the lack of sense and discontinuity.If there weren't for some of the good CGI scenes, this movie would have no redeeming value in a directorial sense. Ratner doesn't know what to do with the actors, and he has a very vague idea of how to choose shots and scenes. I really miss Singer.My request for Mr. Brett Ratner: Please stick to making your Rush Hour movies--I don't care if you make Rush Hour 4, 5, 6, 10 or 20. But please, just don't ruin other potentially good movies.To me, this is X-Men, badly mutilated. Don't get me started on the misuse of characters--some appear out of nowhere, others disappear without warning. Not only horribly executed, but these were wrong choices for the franchise, in my humble opinion.Overall, poorly planned, poorly executed movie. Sad, as the movie that came immediately before this one in the franchise was one of the best super hero/comic book films I've ever seen. I didn't expect this to match the quality of X2, but man...I'm just going to try to forget that this movie ever came into existence. I hope a repeated viewing of X2 can rub out the bad taste in my mouth.",X-Men - The Last Stand
501,Ithorianjedimaster2,People! This movie SUCKED!,1,19 November 2006,"I loved the X-Men movies, especially the second one, but then, the switch-of-directors WAS THE WORST MISTAKE! Here is the story: The humans have discovered an 'antidote' that eliminates the mutant gene and makes a mutant into a normal person. After hearing this, Magneto gathers his troops in order to destroy the source of the cure and the X-Men are there to stop him.The movie shows off numerous special effects that are only there as a cheap way to drive your senses from how plot less and how fan-disappointing this movie is. Mystique? Hardly makes an appearance. Angel? Appears only 3 short scenes in the movie. Juggernaut? Horribly done and really disappointed the fact that he has a DOME head and is about 7 feet tall, maybe more! Something that I know that fans everywhere have been waiting for is that Pyro-VS.-Iceman battle. Too bad it leaves everyone extremely unsatisfied and angry. The plot? None to speak of. There was a noticeable struggle when the director couldn't decide to make up his mind whether Magneto or Pheonix was the villain and as a result, made a really crappy movie.The only reasons to see this movie is because Wolverine is still as bad ass as he was and . . . what's this? That's the only reason I can think of? There's a problem! The movie promised appearances by the Juggernaut, Beast, and Angel, as well as a enhanced role for Colossus. The director, though, seems to be overwhelmed by the pressure and the promises and delivers the horrifying bad conclusion to the X-Men movies.On a more positive side, many of the actors are back to make their roles a little more popular, even though Cyclops only made a brief appearance since he didn't even want to do the movie in the first place in order to go for the ""Superman Returns"" movie, but he had a contract saying that he had to be in 3 X-Men movies. Clearly, you can tell by the actor's greatly depleted amount of good acting that he just wants his paycheck and then, get the hell out of the studio. Personally, I wouldn't blame him. I would give the same advice to the rest of the cast.Also, the special effects are well done, as well as some of the dialogue, which is somewhat believable, but on the other hand, you can probably tell the actors are clearly bored of the movie and are just going for the money. In the end, I think this movie is highly over-rated and in my opinion, X-Men: The Last Stand thankfully is the last stand.",X-Men - The Last Stand
502,brucewla,Like the rest of them....BORING,2,28 June 2007,"I'm sorry but i just don't understand why so many people think these xmen movies are so great. They aren't; this one in particular, was loud, and boring at the same time. And, it annoys the hell out of me, by the way that all these ""big blockbuster"" movies, for some reason, the sound levels go WAY DOWN when the people are talking, but then, when there's action BOOM volume level 100. Makes it tough to be a good neighbor, when you're up late at night watching TV and don't want to disturb the people in the apartments next to you.Anyway some quasi evil/semi government lab has produced a serum that somehow reverses the mutations of human cells, that make someone a, well, mutant, and are offering it to the public. Apparently the teenage girl mutants that are full of angst and don't want to be ""different' want it, but a whole other big group of mutants are offended, stating they aren't ""diseased,"" and don't want it, and thus of course everyone else is now a ""racist"" and a ""xenophobe."" The boss good mutant, Captain Picard, um, I mean, Patrick Stewart, then gets embroiled once again with the boss of the evil mutants, Gandalf, um, I mean Ian Mckellan, and hilarity ensues.Hally berry, Rebecca Romin, and Famke Jensen are all smoking hot, that's the only reason I'm even giving this turkey 2 stars. Let's hope this is the last chapter, there's so many good Marvel Characters they can make cool movies about (I'm hoping for Iron Man).",X-Men - The Last Stand
503,mrohlee,Much worse than you were afraid it would be,1,26 May 2006,"I started reading the x-men comics back in the 60s up through the middle 90s. I loved the characters. I really liked the 1st X-men movie, and loved the 2nd. This one seems to have been made by people that never read any of the comics, or enjoyed the first 2 movies. I don't know what you would think of it if you weren't familiar with the characters. The special effects were good, but that is becoming routine. SPOILERS it really bothered me that they would kill off Professor X and Cyclops. Anyone who has read comics knows that much can be done without resorting to killing off main characters. That was what made Jean Grey's ""death"" in the 2nd movie so powerful. Okay, so to follow the story she had to come back, that is okay but then to have Magneto turn on Mystique, have Jean kill Cyclops, then have her kill professor X, and a company or two of the US Army, I really don't understand it. They have said this is the last movie, I really hope it is, but then since they have pretty much wrecked the team I don't know what they have left to do. I thought Brett Ratner was going to mess it up, but I thought maybe it would be dull, but I never guessed he could make it in a way that would make me regret seeing it. I really, really wished I had not seen this movie.From the number of people that gave it a ""10"" I guess some people like it but then a lot of people give ""10""s to just about any movie out there so that doesn't mean too much. I hope the movie bombs and Ratner never directs any thing other than music videos for bands I never heard of. That is probably too much to hope for but I do know I will never pay money to see anything he directs again.",X-Men - The Last Stand
504,eddieknocker,Who to blame more? Singer for leaving or Ratner for staying.,5,14 January 2007,"I hope Mister Singer didn't p*ss-off to Superman Returns just for a few more zero's on the cheque. I greatly enjoyed X1 and X2 and put that mainly down to director Singer treating the source material with respect and trying to make a good film and not just a good super-hero film (but not too seriously - I'm talking to you Ang Lee!) So when I heard he'd gone up, up and away and left Mr Brett ""Rush Hour"" Ratner in charge I was filled with foreboding and having seen the film I was right to be so forebode filled (?).It's like a poor photo-copy has been made of the first 2 films. There's not the same attention to detail, the same love for the film making process. But what did we expect. Having read an interview with Ratner he sounds like an absolute star-f***ing idiot that typifies all thats wrong with La-La land. One of the reasons given for him directing was that he doesn't have a distinctive style of his own so wouldn't jar too much with Singer's style. Freakin' great - so we get his washed-out lite version instead.At the risk of contradicting myself it's not that bad a film...just not good - especially in comparison with 1 and 2. Maybe they should have gone another way and - ""Alien"" style - got a director with a strong personal style...we'll never know.",X-Men - The Last Stand
505,jediduck95,"Disappointing, but not terrible",6,29 May 2006,The movie was disappointing but it had some descent qualities. Mckkellan and Stewart were great. The action sequence at the end was pretty good especially with Beast. Ratner rushed through the movie without too much character development except for Jean. That was the extent of his existence in the film. At least the audience got to know Nightcrawler and Ice Man from the second movie and Wolverine from the first one. They could have done more with Juggernaut. Gambit should have at least made a Cameo in this movie. Ever since I was a kid all the kids that I knew who loved X-men were keen on wolverine and Gambit. Even now the people are begging for Gambit in this so-called finale. And Angel could have been cut out of the movie. HE had little purpose in this movie and his scenes were corny. I miss Bryan Singer's team and the way they handled the previous movies. They were written and directed well. The second one was darker and had more emotion. This movie had no real creative direction.The movie plays itself as a TV episode. Nothing is resolved after the movie. Magneto and the other mutants will probably get their powers back and the humans are only slightly aggitated at the mutants. The story should have escalated to the point that humans fully attack the mutants with the use of Sentinals and other machines. That would have made for a more interesting finale. It's not Ratner's fault because Singer set the bar up high. Maybe if the studio would have waited for him to finish Superman we could have had a better 200 million dollar X-Men movie.,X-Men - The Last Stand
506,LemonyShepard,"Good, but what about this...?",8,26 May 2006,"I would give this movie an 8.5 out of 10. This action-packed movie definitely has a better storyline than the first two in the trilogy, and it's filled to the brim with amazingly fun mutants (Juggernaught, Shadowcat, and Beast being the coolest of the cool).Unfortunately, this movie seems to revolve around only Wolverine and Storm (much to the joy of Halley Berry) and a few of the mutants die within the first half hour of the movie.That is another problem: it moves way too fast! New characters are introduced and you hardly recognize them when they come on screen the second time! Anger, for example, got the most publicity before the movie was released. However, he only has about fifteen minutes of screen time. Fans of Rogue, Xavier, Cyclops, Angel, Mystique, and Nightcrawler (not even in the movie) will be disappointed.Another major let-down is that Gambit isn't in this final installment!! *sob* BUT, his absence from the movie is made up with Juggernaught, the coolest evil mutant second only to Magneto.Iceman is also 10x cooler this time around (pardon the pun) as is his arch-rival, Pyro. They eventually duke it out in the final battle, which proves to be the best on-screen battle I've ever seen in any movie.Another crazy part of this movie is Jean Grey's transformation into the Dark Phoenix. Her story is more like a remake of Carrie, but it is the most heart-grasping part of the film. Who dies, who gets ""cured"", and who departs will leave jaws hanging and fans leaving either loving the movie to death or wishing it would burn in Marvel Hell.In short, this movie was a nice installment to the trilogy, with action-packed battles being it's best trait, but it still leaves many questions unanswered. Had this movie been longer (much, much longer) then those loose-ends would've been tied up and the X-Men series would finally be able to rest in peace.(And, yes, flash-movie fans, the Juggernaught does say his now-infamous phrase ""I'm the Juggernaught, bitch!"" in this movie!)",X-Men - The Last Stand
507,ArArArchStanton,"Not the best, but come on, it's not that bad",7,5 June 2006,"It was alright. A little thin, yes you don't have any idea what the phoenix is really doing, but I think you can chalk that up to her character being both confused and out of control. Sure they kill of cyclops, but you didn't actually see him die, and jean doesn't visually remember him dying, so perhaps he's still around. And although wolverine kills the phoenix is an awesome seen, come on, she's the phoenix, she could rise again.The cure story line works, but it does seem to be missing something. I almost wanted to seen a scene where they found the boy, or more about rogues involvement. Perhaps there are extended scenes on the DVD which will help with this.I saw somebody mention that Juggernaugt and Multiple Man join the cause for no particular reason. Yeah that's about right. But again you could chalk that up to the fact that Magneto rescued you. I mean if you were imprisoned and somebody rescued you, would you not help them out regardless? You probably would. How far was wolverine from helping magneto in the first movie? Go back and watch it, he could have been pushed to the dark side given slightly different circumstances.So it's unpolished, this movie, but it's not bad, and it's a must see if you watch comic movies. It's certainly not as bad as Daredevil and Electra, but expect it to be subpar to any of the spidey or x-men flicks. Just go watch it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
508,guillermotorofan,Why? Just why?,4,22 July 2006,"A movie series is like a species. It starts here, evolves, and each time it evolves it should build upon it's previous films. If it keeps evolving, it should keep getting better. Once I was talking with a friend of mine, and I asked him ""Don't you find it ironic that some smart monkeys evolved into some really dumb people?"". The same goes for the X-Men series. Some really smart movies evolved into a truly dumb sequel. Acting:4/10 This time around the acting consists of bad dialog and cheap melodrama. It is unbearable. The terrible script pulls horrible performances out of Oscar worthy talents. Famke Jannesen does surprisingly and especially bad, doing nothing but standing around and giving icy stares. No time is given to develop any characters in this stupid popcorn schlock. Writing: 3/10In the tradition of their film ELEKTRA, Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg produce a shallow, poorly explained script that will definitely kick your IQ down a dozen points. A large part of the blame goes to Brett Ratner. See Below.Directing: 2/10 Why is the script so bad? Because dumb wise-cracks and explosions are the only thing Brett Ratner knows how to do. If we'd had Bryan Singer back we'd at least have some direction and plot. Effects: 7/10I hate to say it, but even the effects are worse this time around. Many are impressive, but too many are horrible and unrealistic. Score: 5/10 As with the rest in this film, it is below the average previously set by Singer and Co. I love John Powell, but Ottman's catchy and adventurous tunes are quite missed.Cinematography: 9/10 The film is well shot.

510,chrisrobbins-2,Best in the series if I do say so myself,8,28 September 2006,Okay I know not very many people liked this X-Men as much as the others such as X-Men 2 but I intend through this comment to bring all of you barbarians to the light and greatness of this wonderful achievement. First of all you have to give this movie a bit of credit because it had to live up to the hype of the first films (especially X2) and it really put pressure on the cast and NEW director. Second Bryan Singer wasn't directing it (because he was off doing the equally as good Superman)and a new director stepped into his shoes to try and finish the trilogy with a huge BANG! And I personally think that Brett Ratner did a terrific job of continuing this series and hit it off with quiet a pretty good job. Third it was a bit rushed and should have slowed down a bit such as in the first 20 minutes Logan aka Wolverine finds Jean Gray aka Phoenix and Magneto was already planning his army of mutants to attack Worthington labs and get a hold of the source of the formula. Now I am going to finish up and I hope you enjoyed this comment on IMDb and I hope you will begin to appreciate X-Men: The Last Stand a bit more.

511,jim-314,More flying debris than character,2,10 July 2006,"What a pity that the ""last stand"" of the once-fine x-men franchise had to be this sorry mess. The movie starts with the promising plot device of a cure for mutants, which nicely extends the metaphor of the mutants' outsider social status. The ""cure"" may be analogous to the ""ex-gay"" movement, or to ethnic cleansing. However, this theme is not developed with any kind of sophistication or complexity, and other promising plot and character points are left unexplored. Nothing is made of the mutant boy who is himself the source of the cure, nothing is made of the winged boy's relationship with his father (the developer of the cure), and nothing is made of the potentially profound conflicts within the young woman who cannot touch her boyfriend without killing him. The young woman and her boyfriend barely even talk to each other here, let alone develop their relationship. The movie devolves into a repetitive series of cgi scenes that are all about flying debris, and only barely about character. The movie is increasingly incoherent and internally inconsistent as it continues, right down to the illogical image of the last shot. Let's hope that image does NOT signal yet another sequel. The movie comes in under 2 hours, but the action is so repetitive, so dreary, and so divorced from character, that it feels much longer. This is a sorely disappointing conclusion to a series that started beautifully. Fans of the first two movies would be advised to skip this altogether.",X-Men - The Last Stand
512,mewmewmint-1,It was okay...,5,1 October 2006,"If I was sitting at home with nothing but this to watch, and it was on TV, I would watch it. This is pretty much how I feel about all dorky action movies. Yet I wouldn't want to be around a person of such immense dorkitude that they would either give this movie a perfect score as if this was the greatest movie in history or the dork who would give this movie a zero based on dorky reasons like comic book inaccuracy. I skimmed some of the 0/10 comments and experienced DORK OVERLOAD!! Some minor gripes of mine (proof of my comic book dorkitude): Colossus is supposed to be from Russia, and yet he doesn't have a Russian accent. Not only that but he only says two words throughout the whole movie!! Unbelievable! It's like they added him in as an afterthought.Juggernaut doesn't really look like Juggernaut. I understand that you can't reasonably find an actor who is ten feet tall with fists bigger than his head, however movie Juggernaut's helmet looks like it is made out of tin foil. His helmet is supposed to protect him from mental attacks, not protect his good looks... WTF? First, you're not that good looking anyways, Juggernaut, and second, no matter how good looking you are, a tin-foil helmet is going to make you look like a retard. Another Juggernaut gripe is that he is not actually a mutant, he got his powers from the Ruby of Cyttorak. In the comics, his powers are much better than most mutants. He is immune to physical damage and has super strength and stamina. In the movie his power is described as, ""Once he gets going, he can't be stopped."" Once he gets going?? That is so stupid!! People who don't know the comics (I.E. the director and writers) are going to think that his power has something to do with him running. Also he is supposed to be Charles Xavier's stepbrother who hates him. Would it really take that much time to give him a little background story?? Movie Juggernaut is just some jerk-off that magneto rescues from a truck.I was surprised in the credits that Jubilee is supposedly in this movie. Yet I never see anything remotely resembling comic book Jubilee. Where is she?? It's a mystery.One more gripe: When magneto is sending his ""pawns"" to battle, how is Spike not among their number? Is magneto so senile that he thinks growing two inch spikes all over your body is some kind of killer mutant power? Not often do you see a power that sucky in a movie like this, not often do you see it glorified so. WOW!! He just has to hug people to kill them, that's AWESOME!!Kelsey Grammar was great as beast, I never would have guessed that was him. He was the perfect choice.I also thought the scene where wolverine was running through the jungle kicking ass was good because it reminded me of some of the wolverine comics.",X-Men - The Last Stand
513,harpreetc,The rise of the Phoenix.,9,26 May 2006,"Been a fan of the Xmen for a while now. Was mighty glad to see Beast make an appearance in this one! The special effects are awesome in this movie - especially in the scenes with Magneto! I cannot say much without giving away most of the movie, but there are many scenes which are just picked up from the Uncanny Xmen comics and they make the movie all the more entertaining to watch if you are a fan. Famke does a good job in this one, considering she is quite a wooden actress... Halle's winning the Oscar seems to have made her role in the movie quite significant, but that doesn't stop her from getting thrashed by the villains in this one as well. *wink* Ian McKellen is Brilliant!! As always! Somehow villains get the best lines and when Ian uses his intonation and accent they seem surreal! The best scenes to look out for - i feel - is the scene where Magneto rescues Mystique and when he uproots the bridge! And of course, the telekinetic/mental battle between the Phoenix and Xavier! A must watch!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
514,BOOGIEMAN-pN,A.K.A. X-Men: The Last Disappointment,2,7 June 2006,"After first and second part which were more or less OK but nothing special, I expected from this part either to rise from mediocrity or to fall deeper in mud. I'm sorry to say, but this movie is covered with mud all the way.Short movie summary (with spoilers): A cure which can turn mutants in normal people has been found, but mutants off course doesn't want to give away their super-natural powers. Magneto gathers bunch of mutated followers in aspiration to get the ""cure"" and probably use it on every mutant who gets on his way. Good mutants,leaded by totally inconclusive/unconvincing Halle Berry as Storm are trying to stop him.What stinks in this movie (again with spoilers) ? First of all Dr. Jean Grey is back in life after she died in previous part. We discover now that she is level 5 mutant, which means that she's one of most powerful chicks on earth. However, we discover that she has multiple personality syndrome. Prof. Xavier had kept her under control in first two parts of movie with some neural blocks, but after the incident, those blocks are vanished and she became Phoenix (mentally, not physically) evil mutant which can't control her incredible powers. In few eruptions of that power she literally disassembles in molecules her (ex) boyfriend Cyclops and already mentioned Prof. Xavier and few more hundreds of US marines - which appears in this movie as Quick Dying Squad special guests role. At the end of the movie, world is saved by none other that Wolverine (who would guess that ?) with touching words ""Jean, I love you !"" and then, when I just expected evil Jean to fell on his wolfish charm and stop to be evil anymore, I heard sound like ""craaaaack"" and realize that he just stab her in stomach with his metal claws, with best intentions of course (as much as somebody who rips your guts can have good intentions for you) I realized there isn't r from romance here - what an Oscar nomination drama ! When I mentioned already this two deceased mutants, there is funny thing at the end of the movie. Camera scrolls and shows their graves ... I wonder what they put in there when Phoenix disassembled them in molecules with all clothes and metal coins in their pockets ? LOL !Second thing thats pretty annoying to me is not only this movie defect, it's rather common mistake of 99% action movies in last 10-15 years. Director of the movie tries to show us that main characters aren't just plain superheros with only wish to destroy their enemies. He tries to show us that they have feelings and plans for future life, something like to open restaurant in Minesota or cocktail bar on Hawaii ... he tries to put some elements of drama in this movie. BIG mistake. Instead of super action movie we have awful melodrama with expensive special effects. Like when you mix vine with water ... too badAll in all, I said most important things that came first to my mind. Story and realization 1/10, special effects 9/10 which give us average rating of 2/10 (Yeah, who cares about special effects anymore ? They are so cheap these days ...)",X-Men - The Last Stand
515,monkeysontoast,"What the heck happened? Oh, that's right...Brett Ratner happened.",6,16 July 2006,"It's no secret that Hugh Jackman drives me absolutely wild (I've actually just been going back and forth between the computer and the television, because Hugh was guesting on, erm, Martha, ), especially as Logan/Wolverine, and in this respect, the movie definitely delivered. . The movie suffered, however, from some cheesy dialogue, the introduction of several new mutants, without any development, or much screen time at all (For instance, although Angel was the whole reason the 'cure' was ever developed, and you'd think he'd then play an important part in the movie...he was barely there, and when he WAS on screen, I think they just wanted to impress everyone with his 'wingspan'...which made me laugh innapropriately the first time), an absolutely ATROCIOUS score (I wished several times throughout the movie that I were deaf), etc etc. While the previous two X-men films displayed a balance of story/character development and action, the story/characters in this one were weak...and the movie was only redeemed by the incredible action sequences during the last half of the film...I'd rate those sequences alone an 8 or 9, but the rest of the movie a 5 or 6, or less.",X-Men - The Last Stand

It was great. **spoilers** don't read if you have not seen the movie.I am broken hearted. I cannot believe that after Mystique took a ""bullet"" for Magneto, Magneto left her. I so much wanted the last seen when Eric was playing chess that Raven Darkholme would come by and sit down and talk with him. I am absolutely crushed that Professor Charles Xaiver was killed by Phoneix. I was surprised that Phoneix killed Scott. I was very surprised that Rogue took the medicine and became normal. I loved this movie, it absolutely produced a lot of emotion in me. It was a fantastic ending to the series, I cannot believe they would make another movie without Professor Charles Xaiver. I am happy Storm will take over the school. I was shocked that Kelsey Grammar did a great job playing the beast. But what sticks out the most was Professor Charles Xaiver being fleshed burnt alive by Phoneix, what a death scene. I am so sorry that he died. It actually hurt to see that scene. I am simply shocked that after Mystique turned normal, Magneto just turned and left. I thought he loved her. I actually loved Magneto until that scene, when he said ""What have I done?"" I was happy that he realized what he did. I hope he misses Mystique for a long time, I thought he loved her. I am certain she loved him. I wonder what will happen to Mystique. I loved this movie.

517,Darkfrog24,What's with the complaining? This wasn't bad at all.,6,14 September 2006,"What's everyone complaining about? That wasn't that bad.I had managed to sneak a bento box into the movie theater, and I sat down quite confident that by the end of the evening, I would have an answer to the age old question: Can one commit honorable seppuku with a pair of mall chopsticks (Y/N)? Also, in the dark, I mistook my entire supply of wasabi for an innocent piece of avocado.To my great relief, that was in fact, my worst experience in the theater that night.It has moments that are overdone and stupid, but not much more than the first two flicks. If there was a moment that was over the top it was Magneto's cavalier attitude to Mystique's ""infection."" She might have been ""one of them,"" but he of all people knew that their enemies would not make that distinction.There are new mutants introduced, but not so many that it becomes confusing. They are all established very well, very quickly, and in due proportion to their importance to the plot. No, the humor isn't exactly the same, but it is still there. This isn't a movie that tries to play it straight and fails. This isn't some random piece of fluff either. Archangel might have been more of a device than a character, but his effect on others is handled perfectly.This is at least a B+ movie, with an A-list cast. The best moment, however, is the absolute last scene. I won't even say it with a spoiler warning; it's just too good.Oh and they got the kid from Stargate to play Leech! I was waiting for him to tell Storm that she needed a new toaster.",X-Men - The Last Stand
518,Kate_Dammit_Run,Disappointing,6,1 June 2006,"I liked the first two movies and had hopes for this one but in the end it was just disappointing. The first two films weren't as good as the Spiderman movies but they were decent comic book actioners. This one just falls flat. Comics fans who have seen the trailer will probably know that there is a Phoenix storyline and a Magneto storyline. They do a better job of unifying them than I would have expected but the lack of ability to decide between the two signifies the muddled nature and poor writing of the film.First the things I liked: -Some advancement in mutant affairs: Unlike the comics they've actually made some advances. Hank McCoy is a cabinet officer and the President seems to be dedicated to achieving harmony between humans and mutants.-Juggernaut and Phoenix as mutants: In the comics both had other explanations for their powers. Making them mutants streamlines the background a bit and actually worked pretty well.-Wolverine: Jackman turns in another good performance.-FX: The special effects are still pretty darn good and there's two impressive scenes involving Magneto and Phoenix.-Kitty Pryde: As a long time Kitty fan it was good to see her character given more screen time, and even a place on the team, in this film.-Jamie Madrox: He had a small role but Eric Dane was good as Multiple Man.-The Cure: They handled the logic of the cure well. Yes, the obvious step is to wepaonize it. Yes, some mutants will want to take it, and the film doesn't take the easy route out of condemning it. An important character from the first two films takes it and it's portrayed as a good thing.-""I'm the Juggernaut Bitch!"": fans of the internet cartoon will laugh as hard as I did at the line.What I didn't like: -Bad writing: The script writer was AWFUL. There were a lot of cheesy lines and some plot problems (The time frame of the film is all messed up, how did Angel get across the country, how did the Golden Gate Bridge stay up).-Pointless characters. They introduce Angel but there's really no reason for him. Cyclops is in two scenes and seems to have no purpose either.-Bad fight scenes: The fight scenes aren't great. There's a scene where Wolverine is taking out some mutant sentries but only one of them seems to have any powers. Similarly in the big final combat only a handful of mutants seem to have powers. There's another scene where Storm, who can fly and throw lightning bolts, decides that the best way to fight some guys is to spin like a top and punch them. Dumb.-Bad use of effects: Even though the effects were impressive sometimes they were stupid. Several people get torn apart in the film. But rather than being the bits of gore that should result from that, they instead turn into neat little grains of sand. There's also a scene where Kitty Pryde is fighting the Juggernaut. She leaves him half embedded in a floor. Such a maneuver should have killed him but instead he merely breaks free.-Little dumb things: There's just tons of little dumb moments in the film, like Wolverine not recognizing Beast, or all the mutants being dressed like Goths. With all the time it took to make this film they should have spent time putting together a good script.",X-Men - The Last Stand
519,mabbott10,Good but Not Great,7,26 May 2006,"After thoroughly enjoying the last episode and the tantalizing hint of the rise of the Dark Phoenix at the end of the film, I was looking forward to this entry. The previews featuring Angel spreading his wings, Wolverine slashing away, and Storm flying through the air like a dervish looked irresistible.Having just watched it however, all I can say is ""Eh"" (with a capital E mind you). The film has a lot going for it and some of the bigger special effects set-pieces are truly awesome in their power. So why do I feel like I just had dinner at a fast food restaurant? Actually, the film is like meeting a really attractive, intelligent person and hitting it off only to walk away from the encounter and realizing you had no emotional response whatsoever (and trouble remembering the person's name). Characters die (some literally evaporate before our eyes), battles are waged and things fly all over the place but, there doesn't seem to be a connection to the heart of the movie; which is definitely there but unattainable. At it's best though, there are some great scenes involving Cyclops, Wolverine and Phoenix but far too often I found myself wondering - wait a second - did that person die and if so, how come nobody on the screen seems to be too torn up about it? In fact, the movie eventually ramps up and moves at such a fast clip that by the end I found myself wondering what happened to Pyro, how come Angel only shows up for such a brief time in the entire film, and what the heck was that post-credit tag-on all about? Again, a good film and worth an hour and forty minutes of the your time if you're looking for a fun action film. X-Men purists beware though - major plot changes have been made to the original Dark Phoenix storyline and I don't think necessarily for the better.All in all, I'm curious to see if the DVD turns up with some missing footage because this film only suffers from what's missing - not what's on the screen.",X-Men - The Last Stand
520,marioonline,director benchmarking,7,20 June 2006,"There are very few occasions for us viewers to compare different movie directors' talents. X men: The last stand is one of those. Benchmarking is a slightly geeky practice that consists of running the same program on different computers to evaluate and compare their performance. In this case, the program deals with X men fighting ordinary human beings that are trying to exploit a new kind of substance taken out of a particular X man. (In the previous installment the drug allowed for total control over an X man who received it, this time the drug apparently eliminates X powers). The computers we're comparing are Bryan Singer and Brett Ratner. This new movie reflects Brett Ratner's basically larger-than-life, hyper-muscled, thick-minded way to direct movies. You get a gazillion different characters (each of them expressing themselves for er...5 milliseconds) doing a gazillion very scenic but ultimately meaningless things (I'm especially referring to the way Magneto gets to the Alcatraz research center). What made the X men movies a bit different from the other superhero movies was the everlasting mind games about being different from the rest (which director Singer was really good at showing in a very discreet but effective way). Now it's all a super power show-off. This is not a bad movie. But! It could have been so much better.",X-Men - The Last Stand
521,nachiketbhagwat,A magnificent conclusion to the trilogy,8,25 February 2017,"X men last stand was finale of the x men trilogy, the first one before the convoluted time lines and never ending X men series. Don't go just on the bad reviews which appear because some fans don't like the story told and create negative environment towards it.I loved this movie. This was finale of X men so it did have bigger stage than first two. The government has found a cure for the mutants. Some mutants want to get the cure, some don't want it and some like Magneto sees this as government declaring war on mutants similar to first 2 movies but with immediate consequence. The main plot is very good. Then there is dark phoenix saga, which is changed from comics but it works. The phoenix is real Jean while the Jean we see in first 2 movies is artificial creation of Professor X. She does kill Xavier in second act, which is very big plot as Xavier is guide of all X men.The characters like Scott and Storm are out of place but the movie does add great characters like the beast and angel. Also the evolution of characters like Pyro, Iceman and rogue is great. The stand out acting is again by Magneto, Professor X, Mystique and Wolverine.The movie has great main plots with some unnecessary plots like death of Cyclops. The action is much better than first 2 movies and it gave decisive finale to X men series which current ""CINEMATIC UNIVERSE"" lacks. If you are fan of first 2 movies, this is a much needed finale.",X-Men - The Last Stand
522,robertrosado,Is that all?,5,29 May 2006,"I'm an X-Men fan. I've been reading the comics and watching the cartoons since childhood, and I wouldn't be surprised if most of the people who have seen this movie have done the same. After the rousing success of ""X2"", I enjoyed it while I was watching it. It was entertaining, and I was never bored. However, when I walked out of the theater, it hit me how many opportunities were wasted. So many great moments, so many interesting characters... None of them utilized to their maximum potential. Warning: This will be a very candid, train-of-thought review.Part of the problem is the screenplay. It's written by the same people who did ""Elektra"". Need I say more? Most of the dialogue is awful (""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch"" What?). I also wish that the writers followed through with what they started. What ever happened to that rather intriguing friendship between Rogue and Logan? What about Angel, who should have had more screen time? What about Colussus, who certainly could have been featured more in the final battle? Was that REALLY the payoff that the Jean Grey/Scott Summer subplot deserved? Where the hell is Gambit?!?! What about more depth to the relationship between Magneto and Professor X? These two characters have years - decades, even - of back story. Where is it? Thankfully, actors like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are around to do what they can. And what about this ""cure"" that we keep hearing about? I was really interested, but there was very little explaining its creation. Nor, was there any struggle between the characters of who was to take the cure, and why. Rogue seemed to be the only one who was not only extremely eager to take it, but the only one who cared about the friggin' thing at all! I know that the final battle was directly related to the cure and all, but there was no dramatic build-up to speak of. Another problem is the running time. I would have gladly sat through a two and a half hour movie if it offered any development of the ideas that the final product had raised. Hell, ""X2"" is one of the best superhero movies because it took its time, and it offered more than mindless action. Also, many of the characters aren't given nearly the time they should. Take Mystique, for example. It's almost as if Rebecca Romijn was in a rush to finish, and they compromised. Who could blame her? And Rogue -whom, I might add, was being set up in the first film to play a major part in the trilogy - does nothing to speak of. And, I do mean nothing.Yet another problem is director is Brett Ratner. I enjoyed ""Rush Hour"" and especially ""Red Dragon"", but this guy seems to have no clue how to properly block, light, and shoot action sequences (or, in this case, any sequence). Also, the pacing in this movie felt really off to me. There was never a chance to breathe. I would also like to know who gave these chuckle heads any permission to kill off some major characters. How could Stan Lee allow this? If the script was good, I might have allowed it. But, this is X-Men we're talking about here. Be careful who you get rid of, or the die-hard fans (like myself) will have a cow. And can someone please tell me why Halle Berry's performance as Storm seems to change with each passing film? In the first one, she was close to how I imagined the character. By now, she is just playing Halle Berry with white hair. Which brings me to another problem with this movie: How have a LONG list of talented actors... LET THEM ACT!!! Hugh Jackman has always been the force holding these films together, and he does his best here. The only two other thespians in this one who gave me glimpses of what could have been were Famke Janssen and McKellen, who is excellent as usual. Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde was a welcome presence.Overall, I'm very disappointed. This movie should not have been rushed in order to avoid competing with ""Superman"". Just look at the results. Now, I'm not going to name names (*ahem*Halle Berry), but... I know that several of the actors don't want to do another one. I'm only praying that the studio gives them enough money. There HAS to be another one, if only to wash away the memory of this...",X-Men - The Last Stand
523,sati_84,Not even visually adequate,5,30 May 2006,"First of all I'm not a fan of the comics or the first 2 films. The first two installments were OK movies, and I didn't have great expectations when I sat down to watch The Last Stand. I wanted to see a coherent story with decent characters and enjoyable action. This movie fails on all three levels (plot, characters and action)The movie opens with a pointless scene. 20 years ago Xavier and Magneto recruited Jean Grey, but we knew that from the previous movie, the scene adds nothing new, while this third movie's main subject, is the Phoenix, which lives in her. At least they could have been throw in some foreshadowing or something, but no...The Phoenix is an entity which is evil, and we don't know what it's capable of besides killing anybody who it comes in contact with. This is the fate of Cyclops, one of the coolest characters in the movies. His death occurs off-screen, and at the time, we have no clue, why Jean killed him. Later, we find out, that Xavier manipulated Jean's mind, and the Phoenix woke up... But we still don't know what it is exactly.And this subplot goes on and on, we hear the name of the Phoenix numerous times, but we never really get to know, who the hell it is and what does it want. These are the obvious signs of weak storytelling.Let's see an another subplot, the subplot of the ""cure"". This is some kind of chemical, which makes mutants ordinary people. The cure is in a 8 year old boy's DNA, and many people are guarding him. This situation allows the writers many possibilities to introduce interesting subplots about mutants, who see themselves as sick ordinary people and they want to be cured, and some other mutants, who want to be mutants even though there is a ""cure"". Yet, we don't see anything like that, just mindless shouting crowds and of course, a villain, who wants to kill or capture the boy and kill everyone who was involved in creating the cure. The emotional, philosophical and moral depth wasn't discovered in the plot. They tried it in Rogue's case, but there's nothing special in her subplot. She decides to embrace the cure and become ""normal"". And that's it. Nothing more. Moral dilemma before the choice? No. Just a weak attempt on Storm's side: she utters a whole sentence along the lines of ""There's no need to heal"". One sentence. Clever writing indeed...My main complaint about this movie is that the characters doesn't do anything. Let's see a few of them: Storm flies into the air a couple of times and inherits Xavier's leading role after his death. But she's not able to do it convincingly.Rogue just wants to be a human being, who can freely touch anybody. And she gets what she wanted. That's it.Colossus is totally pointless, he throws Wolverine twice into the air and that's it. That's freakin' it...Mystique at least pulled off a few jokes. She was funny, and when she got shot with the cure, Magneto left her alone. It was about the only character-development kinda thing in the movie.Magneto tries to get hold of Phoenix (he succeeds), and tries to capture the boy (fails), and nothing more. Oh, he says ""What have I done?"" for no particular reason at the end of the movie. He killed so many people before, and when Phoenix is doing that, all of a sudden he is in shock? Ridiculous...The Phoenix stands on the ground, and creates a great whirlwind, kills a lot of people, just because it looks cool. We don't have the slightest idea what's going on, then Wolverine manages to kill it. And with it, he kills Jean Grey also. Bad luck. We can't feel sorry for him, because we don't know, who Jean Grey was. She was given about 4 minutes of screen time. And in half of it, she wasn't even herself, but Phoenix...I could go on and on, but I won't. The character-development is nonexistent in X-Men 3, and the action is mindless and ridiculous, but at times manages to be entertaining. And there was one character I could care about, and it was Kitty Pride, but she also became a victim of the writers of the movie: she didn't have enough screen time to trimly develop her character.All in all it's not a bad movie, but not good either. Watch it if you want to see the special effects extravaganza at the end, which involves the flying Golden Gate Bridge (ridiculous, but nonetheless entertaining), many explosions, flying and burning cars, flying people, and Storm performing electroshock on an evil mutant. The only decent action sequence was when Juggernaut was chasing Kitty Pride. At least some clever ideas instead of ""blow the whole world around the fighting characters, because it looks cool"" attitude.X-Men: The Last Stand is a good watch with friends in the theatre, but don't expect anything groundbreaking or remarkable.5/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
524,Imhotep77,It's not perfect but much better than expected,7,13 June 2006,"I went into the movie with substantially lowered expectations after hearing so much negative sentiments. And boy, was I shocked to find how rousing and emotional the movie turns out to be. Granted, I agree with many that the movie should've been longer to better develop the background and relationships between the characters; better dialogs written; some effects need to be cleaned up; continuity problems fixed (like the night and day goof at the final battle? Although I just rewatched the trailer and it shows a scene with the bridge where the sun is going down, maybe by the time they walk across it, night has descended?), etc. However, I think the sum is definitely better than parts, thankfully.I'm not a sappy person (i.e. I find those teary moments in Survivors when they read letters from loved ones repulsively manipulative and pathetic. For crying out loud, they're not POW, they're gone less than a month to play a game!), but I find the emotional scenes stirring. Obviously, each of us react differently, but I felt the enormity of what's at stakes and saddened by the untimely death of certain characters. There is a sense of longing and loneliness at the end of the movie which I find very moving. The action sequences are fantastic and although the outcomes are never in doubt, you do care what might happen.It's best enjoyed if you can sever the connection between the movie and comic book X-universe. If you keep comparing what's in the movie to the comics, you'll never be satisfied and ruin the enjoyment of the movies in and by themselves. I haven't read The Uncanny X-Men since the late 80's but there is simply no way a movie or 3 for that matter, can faithfully interpret a 40-year mythology. Even Marvel created the Ultimate series (X-Men, Spider-man) which is different from the established myth. All in all, the movie succeeds in spite of Brett Ratner's hackney direction.",X-Men - The Last Stand
525,kevin_parks,Below expectations,3,26 May 2006,"(my rating is based purely in comparison to the first 2 Xmen films) Someone on here eluded to this, and he/she was bang on. They attempted to pile 10 pounds of movie on a plate that should have only held 1. One thing I hate about movies sometimes is when they have the potential to be GREAT films, but because the writer/director is trying to do too much, they leave out a lot of what makes a great film a great film.Case in point: Batman Begins. BB was so wonderfully crafted, that it didn't miss a single beat as far as story-telling and action.X3 seemed ALL over the place. Scenes that could have been EXCELLENT were rushed. Stories that could have been dug FAR deeper were rushed. Character development was almost non-existent. I can't go into details because I don't want to ruin the film for anyone... however I must say this: The problem with this movie was there were TOO MANY MAIN CHARACTERS AND TOO MANY Plot lines. They also spent too much time.. WAY too much time showcasing special effects. Now, I understand that with a movie where Mutants have special powers.. it's important to show them. But in moderation.In an ideal world, this movie will be recut and extended on DVD. It had the potential to be the best X-Men movie thus far, and turned out to be the worst.",X-Men - The Last Stand
526,Skip_4591,Fantastic Addition to the X-Men Franchise,10,18 June 2006,"This movie is enjoyable in every way. It has great action, good pacing, and I thought the story worked really well.Even though it's only 104 minutes, it seemed to me that this running time was probably the most perfect running time ever for a movie like this.There are also some very interesting elements to it as well and there are many moments in the film that are sure to put a big grin on your face (especially the very last clip before the credits!).There are also a lot of set-ups for a fourth ""X-Men"" movie and the script, while it does have some dud-lines, is pretty consistent and has a few stand-out moments that make up for the duds.The movie is wonderfully shot and the visual effects are outstanding. The characters also are pretty-well developed in my opinion and the new mutants are just so cool. There is even a little twist in one part involving a mutant.My only complaint is that there could've been more to the movie and it could've been a better ""series finale"". But I said before that there are some huge set-ups for a fourth X-Men movie so perhaps I shouldn't be calling this movie a finale. Nah, this is just another addition into the ""X-Men"" franchise and i'm sure there'll be more to come.This is a great film and a more than worthy addition into the current trilogy of X-movies.I give it a 10 out of 10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
527,alexis_240,An average final chapter,7,31 August 2006,"A mutant cure! A great way to end such a successful franchise as X MEN. However with Singer busy planing the return of the man of steel X MEN was left in a not so safe pair of hands. While watching it I felt like standing up and yelling ""can't you just slow down!"" X3 is so rushed, which does hook you, but it does not give the old characters time to neither exit in style nor say much, the most underwritten being Rogue. Her lines can be counted using one's fingers, such a shame. The other characters too, apart from Magneto and Wolverine, don't get much screen time whereas the new characters e.g. angel seem pointless. Why bother to introduce new faces when you haven't dealt properly with the already established ones?. The new characters could have worked if more time was devoted to them. Not just an hour and forty eight minutes. Other than that Mystique has been with Magneto for years and he abandons her just like that after in fact having saved him? This was probably done to save time!As far as the action goes the film could not be more satisfactory but in terms of plot and depth it's not at all equal of the first two movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
528,roblop,And so the trilogy is over...FOR NOW!!!,10,25 May 2006,"Well well well, what do we have here??? Finally a trilogy in which the climax truly has been spellbinding. The actors (as was expected) were truly stunning and the introduction of Kelsey Grammar as ""Beast"" proved successful in so many ways.The story continues smoothly with the help of some great scriptwriting and the characters become very key components of the overall intellectuality of the third installment of the X-Men trilogy.I am going to go out on a limb and state that this was better than its predecessors and is a must see for anyone who evenly remotely enjoyed X-Men 1 and X-Men 2. Well done to everyone involved :-)",X-Men - The Last Stand

Although there was the fair share of problems, overall the film was very well done and regardless of what some of the more hardcore fans might say, very entertaining. The story was well done, and the special effects were very good, and i also liked how the xmen really got into hero mode at the end of the film. For too long, it seemed to me at least, as if the xmen were super powered minorities rather then superheros, which worked well, but i must say, to see them kick it in all out superhero mode, it just seemed like they never really did it in the other 2 films.",X-Men - The Last Stand
530,filmfreak-ochoa23,I'm The Juggernaut Bitch!,6,8 June 2011,"X-Men The Last Stand- 2006 The movie picks up with a Xavier and Magneto visiting a young Jean Grey which contradicts not only First Class which I can understand, but its own movie as well. Magneto states that he hopes that they don't have to visit every mutant to which Xavier replies that Jean is the exception. Later in the movie when everyone is mourning him, Kitty tells Iceman that she got visited by Xavier to which he replies that they all did contradicting the opening scene! Then we move on to a mourning Cyclops after a very lackluster training simulation to which even Wolverine seems bored where he is literally walking. Magneto, Pyro now third in command next to Mystique, and Mystique rescue some mutants to invade Alcatraz to stop the mutant who takes away the powers. This scene and the recruiting scene have some wannabe unlikeable mutants, except Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut who we'll touch upon later, so the recruiting scenes are only fun because of Pyro and Magneto who barely get enough screen time, it's mostly Magneto trying to find the Phoenix. The Phoenix is pretty epic and also Xavier's death is very emotional thanks to a very great score to accompany this scene and the initial reaction of Magneto and the later reaction of Storm and Wolverine. Reason I say initial reaction is because after Xavier's death, Magneto pretty much goes out of character and pulls a ""Oh, well, Xavier's dead, let's go my darling"" not verbatim, but he might as well said that. The scenes with Phoenix were very pointless and although they looked cool when she was getting angry, that's all it was; a cool visual that would be better suited for a tech reel demo or a painting, if you pause these scenes you appreciate them more. Now to touch on the elephant on the room for this movie, I'm sorry but after ""I'm the Juggernaut, Bitch"" how can the Rattner expect us to take this movie seriously when all I'm thinking during the final scene that follows are stupid dubs that will go over everyone since he included that line, he might as well put ""Pimp Smack, Bitch"" when Wolverine was getting torn apart by Phoenix. Also, the Pyro and Iceman battle was extremely anti-climactic when you expect a long awaited battle, the audience gets a Dragon Ball Z battle of the Kame-Hame-Has with Iceman ending with a pun about staying in school, very lame indeed. Overall, seriously after I'm The Juggernaut Bitch, this movie is a disaster, maybe rent it for the nice looking effects, Storm is bad-ass in this movie so that's good, and perfect casting when it came to Beast, too bad he was barely in the movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
531,philipsavory,A pleasant surprise,6,25 May 2006,"Dread filled me when I heard Brett Ratner was making this. But he actually has managed to deliver a decent movie that, admittedly doesn't match the first two but still feels part of the bunch. It's a little too short for my liking and I feel as though an extra 20 mins would have given the film that extra gravitas it was striving for.First off, the film did seem a little rushed, the script could've done with some development, because some characters in principal have something to contribute but are left aside. A prime example of this is Angel, who has very little significance, in fact his Dad gets more screen time.Beast was a welcome addition and Kelsey Grammar did a really good job and I'm also glad that they used make up rather than CG, it really makes a difference. On the other hand Juggernaut was a complete fowl up. Vinnie Jones is miscast and out of his depth, all his lines are terrible and I can't understand why he was chosen.Wolverine is less the focal point this time, which is not so bad it's just that too often he comes across as comic relief because when he isn't wisecracking he's just whining about Jean Grey. Storm features a lot more than before, but Halle Berry is so ineffectual it makes little difference to her character. Cyclops is wasted once again (he really can't catch a break) but as usual Magneto and Professor X are superb.The action was also quite good, perhaps a step up from the others, because Ratner seems more comfortable with it, whereas some of the exposition was a little clunky. I think some fans might bitch about it because it is flawed, but I genuinely enjoyed it because it just about does the job, which is more than I could have hoped for considering I generally don't like any of Ratner's other films and I had low expectations.It's worth a watch if you like X-men, just don't expect it to be amazing that's all.",X-Men - The Last Stand
532,lazarou789,Almost as good as the first 2 installments,6,26 May 2006,"X-men 3 will leave you amazed with its effects, new characters and departure of old beloved ones...To be honest X2 was superior - fewer characters, better storyline and focus on characters (and especially Wolverine's dark past) made it a great movie. X3 is equal to X1, which had the burden of introducing the characters.X3 is a bit of a shallow entertainer - unlike its predecessors. It actually benefits a bit that those movies (X1, X2) where good movies as they setup a more solid premise for this installment. From the new characters - Kelsey Gramer's Beast is great but Angel is like a useless extra on the background of the film.Some flaws are that the departure of the above mentioned ""beloved"" characters (don't worry I won't put spoilers) could have been done with a bit more emotional weight... but then again its a comic book movie...I believe it is a bit unfair to compare it with its predecessors with so much passion and anger other people do... Lets not forget that usually 3rd installments are ill-conceived, shallow films clearly illustrating that the're filmmakers have run out of ideas and that they are made only to make more money using the proved recipes and stars of the previous movies... X3 at least has the complex and rich mythology of the comic books - clearly showing that the filmmakers did not want to re-create the previous films but build on the characters and mythos of X-men...To sum up this movie is highly recommendable by me - entertaining and enjoyable but not unforgettable..",X-Men - The Last Stand
533,eagleknight98,"Good, yet devastating movie!",7,27 May 2006,"i went to the cinema today with a mood for action, graphics, and lots of fun. i got lots of the former.... and non of the latter. i had no idea of what is coming and i was in it for a real real shock! movie's pace was rapid and captivating. there was no abstract or words of wisdom there... may be a sentence or two to quote, but that is it. some jokes were embedded here and there.... but i just couldn't laugh. fights ended quickly.... and things moved fast, in a direction i would have never anticipated.the new director did reasonably well in maintaining emotions and attitude of most characters from part one and two. however, i really didn't like the rapid and blurry movement of the camera in action sequences. there wasn't much of choreographed fights.... and no true duels.the make up was fantastic....everyone looked exactly like the comics especially beast. the cast did well, Logan glittered, as expected, and was the spine for this movie.all in all; this movie was nice, worth watching in the cinema and the DVD is a must have. i believe that it should have been a little longer though to give more weight to the main characters in the finale.",X-Men - The Last Stand
534,Marvelouis,just plain spectacular (A+),8,29 May 2006,"It's not just that this movie, directed by Brett Ratner believe it or not, is more chockablock with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the first two, though that's true. Nor that Ratner depicts more mutant super-powers, though that's true also. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. ""X3"" starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase ""summer movie."" For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. But the writers here seem less interested in the action than the subtext: the effort by a high-handed majority to control and eradicate a minority it finds undesirable. The script examines the other side of that equation as well: the desire to strike back, to return hatred for hatred. Magneto, who believes that the mutants, rather than submit to discrimination or attempt peaceful coexistence, should use their powers to rise up and rule over humans. Not that this is a movie with a lot of touchy-feely talks about brotherhood. It's just that ""X3"" has more on its mind than super-powered butt-kicking. Still, there's no denying that those super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. But ""X3""'s script delivers, skillfully weaving together character, plot and action. This movie and the action is just plain spectacular.",X-Men - The Last Stand
535,finding-something,Disappointing,5,26 May 2006,"Jean Grey goes insane, in a Fruedian/alter ego way as the Pheonix; Pyro and Iceman fight, I've been waiting for this; there is a cure for the x-gene (not without its blatant homosexuality metaphors we've all come to love from this franchise); larger than ever special effects arenas; and some interesting additions to the cast, done most notably by Grammar as Beast and Ellen Page (a real delight actually) as Kitty Pride. Juggernaut wasn't too bad either.So, what goes wrong? Really, everything. After beginning promisingly enough with a 20 years ago introduction to Jean, it quickly begins to spiral into a marathon of senseless deaths and unmotivated actions. All the themes and plot lines prove just barely, and I mean frustratingly so, too much for the director, Brett Ratner, to handle. While in the last two movies we saw into the formative moments of Bobby and Pryo and Rogue and Logan and others, here we really only learn more about Jean Grey, a class five (this evidently means she is ridiculously powerful) mutant. Certainly the whole Pheonix storyline was difficult for Ratner to understand and to include, because for most of the movie Jean Grey just stands there next to Magneto not doing anything but having red hair. In the end, we learn nothing more of newcomers like Kitty Pride and Collusus. The film moves so quickly, at such a dizzying speed, betrayals are glossed over and simply not treated with a maturity in storytelling they deserve. Sunddenly, Logan exhibits this deep and intimate bond with Jean Grey that was only ever dismissed in the earlier films. Wolverine is too consistent a character, too good, too reliable without adequate development. Storm is rather less than inspiring, given terrible lines, emerging as something like the leader of the X-Men by necessary default or accident, certainly not as an ideal choice. This would have been fine, but she never rises above the place-filling. Sad.While some things work, such as Rogue's dilemma concerning whether or not she should take the cure, and my absolutely favorite part where Magneto yells out, ""Charles,"" too many shortcuts and easy outs are taken for this film to be anywhere near satisfying. There are far too many casualties (I've decided one dramatic death done well per film is plenty), a way shmatlzy score, and the climax of the movie is rather rushed and, well, repetitive. I'll say it now, the Iceman/Pyro fight was truly a let down. I had been visualizing this since I saw the second movie three years ago. Clearly, this was a mistake, and I only set myself up for MASSIVE disappointment.I left asking my brother if it would be possible to unwatch it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
536,El_Farmerino_Esq,Conclusion to mutant saga lacks human element.,4,26 October 2006,"The prospects for X-Men 3 were, on the face of it, fairly promising - the same able cast as the first two instalments, bolstered with the (quite frankly, genius) casting of Kelsey Grammar as Hank 'Beast' McCoy. Indeed, the movie starts very well, introducing some genuinely sympathetic characters in the form of Angel and Leech (the early scene of Warren's attempt to hide his mutation is an extraordinarily affecting one for a movie of this kind). Even more impressively, it then goes on to bravely dispense with some of the series' key characters, creating a genuine sense of unpredictability (although, it has to be said, these deaths could have been handled with a hell of a lot more respect). From then on, though, the film gradually descends into what can only be described as a bloated mess.The problem here is too many characters, too little development. After spending two movies (plus the opening of this one) fleshing out the backgrounds of the X-Men we are left with a film that is, for the most part, a series of increasingly OTT fight scenes tacked on to a cheesy paint-by-numbers plot. Perhaps the most important character in the movie, Famke Janssen's Jean Grey, does little more than walk around in a daze, occasionally becoming either angry or horny. Elsewhere, stories are either underdeveloped (see Rogue's sub-plot) or completely unfinished (despite his being one of the few characters in the movie to retain any kind of pathos, Warren/Angel's contribution to the final third is simply a blink-and-you'll-miss-it enactment of one of the biggest superhero clichés of all time). Even such essential characters as Wolverine and Magneto are left with little to do but fight and look cool, while new addition Juggernaut fails to even muster the latter - Vinnie Jones appearing, quite frankly, ridiculous in every scene he intrudes on. Furthermore, comic-book fans will be disappointed to discover that the considerably important relationship between Professor Xavier and Cain Marko/Juggernaut is not merely glossed over but totally unmentioned.Stir in one of the most atrocious and intrusive scores since Batman & Robin and you have a film that is enjoyable bombast at best and, at worst, a lactose-dripping nonsense-festival. In its favour, it has a few great set pieces and some rather impressive special effects. Little recompense, though, for the total lack of involvement and the rather offensive stench of Camembert that it frequently emits.",X-Men - The Last Stand
537,ZachsMind,Hopefully Not The Last Stand,8,7 June 2006,"First off, Kitty Pryde's in this one! She's my favorite since I was a kid, and she finally gets an opportunity to shine that she didn't get in the first two films. In the first two films they teased us by showing Kitty Pryde in cameo appearances. I only wish Bryan Singer had insisted she be more a focus of the films - Kudos to Ratner for doing what Singer didn't. Kitty Pryde IS the X-Men for me, more so than Wolverine or Storm or even Professor X. I was glad to finally get to see her before the trilogy was done. How can a motion picture production company take forty plus years of fictional history and distill it into three films? Best you can do is scour through the source material, try to figure out what makes the material so darn good in the first place, and pull out the highlights, then remix the best parts into a new creation. You won't get it right, but maybe if you're lucky you'll get it close. The X-Men trilogy gets it VERY close. The trick is to try and whet the appetites of newcomers to the source material, as well as appease the people who have come to expect a certain something from the Marvel-owned meme: ""X-Men."" I think this film achieves that admirably.Could it have been better? In terms of dialog and storyline, certainly. What made me shake my head as I watched it was when Magneto takes the San Francisco Bridge and utterly destroys it in order to use it as a transport for his little army in order to get to Alcatraz. Half the people in his army could fly. They coulda just picked up the other half. It was wasteful. They just did it to show off the special effects necessary for destroying a whole bridge and floating it for five minutes on the screen while Ian McKellen hams it up. But hey. It LOOKS great! And Ian McKellen can ham it up like no one can with the possible exception of Peter O'Toole. The special effects in this film are tremendous eye candy, and it's just fun watching a dozen or so amazingly talented actors and actresses chew the scenery and their costumes and the green-screens they faced in order to do more with less. They won't get Oscars for making this believable, but perhaps they should, for it's a tall order. One of the many problems this genre of film making has suffered over the years is the difficulty in making the fantasy of modern vigilantism with extraordinary humans endowed with godlike powers even remotely realistic. This series of films, and The Last Stand in particular, have taken the themes of X-Men and drove them home in a way that's reverent to the source material and perhaps a bit preachy, but not without its bells and whistles and things exploding. Here's hoping the franchise will now branch out after this trilogy, and allow the production company to focus more in the future on solo films for each major character that give each character a chance to be more than the occasional one-liner. Oh, and I don't know about you but I've had enough of Wolverine. As much as I like the character, there's more to X-Men than him.",X-Men - The Last Stand
538,patrokov,Better than the previous two,7,5 July 2006,"Some might think it ironic that each X-men movie is better than the previous, but what it actually shows us is that the X-men are better suited to episodic story telling than to single movies. In this sense, the X-men share more in common with Highlander and Stargate, in that while the movies were decent, the TV series they spawned were infinitely richer and better. It takes a while for a series to get its legs, develop the characters properly, find the right directing, etc. So X-men, now in its third season has jettisoned it's too-slow director (so he could go and make Superman Returns too slow) and is finally finding its legs.This movie is by far the most graphically violent with the sense that real people are dying (not that it's gory). It is also the most mature in its storytelling. It doesn't fall victim to the classic blunder of trying to explain everything while giving us enough explanation for us to willingly suspend our disbelief. (Think Mitacloreans vs. ""the force flows through all living things binding them together."") And finally, pay attention to Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde (the girl who can walk through walls). In one movie, she's already shown far more heart, spunk, and superhero attitude than Anna Paquin's Rogue has in three movies. No offense to Ms Paquin, but since when did Jubilee ever upstage Rogue? Rogue was miscast from the beginning, the choice to make her a child was a mistake, and it shows more than ever in this installment. Just be glad that there's enough other things going on so that you don't miss Rogue too much. And if your favorite character doesn't get enough screen time...don't worry. There will be plenty more X-men episodes--I mean movies--to come.",X-Men - The Last Stand
539,Daff-4,"I am quite harsh usually, but this isn't bad",7,25 May 2006,"I saw this film tonight and went in with low expectations after reading some negative reviews. I actually thought it was marginally better than the first two, and there were even a couple of instances where something surprised me and the predictable, clichéd course was NOT followed. (Though plenty of predictable things happened too, of course).Having said all that, this is a comic book film and so don't expect every detail to make perfect sense (though there weren't any moments or aspects that particularly bothered me, as I often find in these type of films - certainly nothing as silly or laughable as occurred in Spiderman 2, not that that film wasn't enjoyable in its own way).The effects are great, the characters remain true to the first installments in the series, and I honestly cannot see why some people have said it suffers by comparison. Sure, there were a lot of characters to deal with, but the same is true of the other films. Perhaps the only thing I think the original director did better was in his comedic touch. There are only one or two genuinely amusing moments in this film and the rest are just typical average action film one liners.Basically, if you want to see the trilogy story arc conclude (though the possibility of a further film is, naturally, left open) in a relatively sensible, satisfying and entertaining way, it's well worth it.Overall, I give it a 7.9. To put this in perspective, I gave Spiderman 2 a 7.7, The Hulk a 3.0, Star Wars Episode 3 a 5.8, Batman Begins a 7.9 and Sin City an 8.5.PS Be sure to sit through the credits until the very end!",X-Men - The Last Stand
540,super_frog16,utterly disappointed,1,4 June 2006,"I have to say i was extremely disappointed with this movie. The only good thing being the visual effects, and the portrayal of the phoenix, besides that, there's nothing much to watch. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of these 'the movie is nothing like the comic book' type of people, i loved the first two movies. There was just too many things that annoyed me about this movie for me to like it. Firstly, why on earth was James marsden's 'cyclops' killed?! that man is far too underused as it is in the movies for him to have been destroyed so easily and quickly within the first twenty minutes of the film. And i daresay i wasn't the only person in the cinema to think 'nah hes not dead, he'll return in a dramatic explosion and wupp some ass' only to be disappointed in the closing scene overlooking the grave stones. Another thing which i didn't like was prof x being killed. Come on the guys the leader of the x men! He cant just be obliterated! Rogue accepting the 'cure' was another bite in the ass. As a child she was my favourite character, and to see her reduced to being powerless, made no sense to me whatsoever! I mean, did they really plan on reducing the xmen down to just storm and wolverine?! And this is going to sound stupid coming from a teenager here, but the swearing was a little untasteful. The scene of kitty's rescue of 'the cure' was a little over the top. juggernaut yelling 'bitch' and her replying 'dick head' just seemed a little out of place. One last thing before i finish, there were any number of missing xmen during the movie such as nightcrawler, who could have had ample screen time had the directer not felt the need to focus the fight scenes solely upon storm and wolverine. No matter where or who they were fighting, those two characters took a prominent position. Again don't get me wrong, the fight scenes were impressive, but a lot more could have happened and could have been included. All in all i feel like i have been thoroughly let down by the producers and director of this movie, what a complete and utter anti climax. I had been looking forward to this movie from the moment i heard of its go ahead a year ago, and now i am left feeling cheated out of the £4.90 that i had to pay to go and see it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
541,jimhills,Not as good at #2 but very good anyway,9,7 June 2006,"www.kajatm.comX-Men The Last Stand is the third installment of the X-Men series and in my opinion it is one of the few trilogies that actually lives up to the hype. From beginning to end this movie is non stop action and contains a lot of special effects that are pretty cool and pretty creepy at the same time but more on that later. Staring Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellen (Magneto), Famke ""Hot"" Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey/Phoenix), Kelsey Grammar (Beast), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Anna ""Hot"" Paquin (Rogue), Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut), Rebecca ""Hot"" Romijn (Mystique) and Halle ""Too Hot for Words"" Berry (Storm), X-Men The Last Stand should win an award just for casting. When I first heard that Kelsey Grammar was going to be playing Beast I thought to myself, ""Self, Dr. Fraiser Crain can't play Beast"", but and this doesn't happen very often I was wrong. He does an excellent job of portraying the intelligent side of Beast and because of make-up and special effects he does an excellent job of making the audience believe his mutant side. The other new addition that is worth mentioning is Vinnie Jones and honestly I couldn't think of a better person to play a bad ass like Juggernaut. Vinnie Jones is one of my favorite bit actors and has done an excellent job in such movies at Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and Gone in 60 Seconds. If you need someone to play a bad ass, Vinnie Jones is the man for you. The only issue I had with his character is how they made his body look so big. Granted Juggernaut is supposed to be a huge unstoppable force but you could really tell that he was just wearing a body suit. There really are two main story lines going on in X-3. First is the creation of a new medicine that gives mutants the ability to go back to normal humans. Of course this causes a riff in the mutant community. Magneto is leading a group of rebel mutants that will stop at nothing until the cure is eliminated. The X-Men represent the other side of the coin and spend much of the movie trying to stop Magneto. The other storyline is how Dr. Jean Grey survived after being consumed by a ton of water in X2 because of her hidden mutant talent. Because of the extreme stress of this event it causes her to become the Phoenix, a level 5 mutant that has the ability to pretty much kick the crap out of any other mutant. These two story lines of course intersect at the end. ****Warning! Potential Spoilers in the Next Paragraph! The only thing that really upset me about this movie is that I knew the X-Men series of movies is coming to an end. I started to think that after all the characters that were killed off that we'd never see another X-Men movie. But you need to stay until after the credits have ended. There is an additional scene that if my friend Ken did not know about I would have never ended up seeing. This scene pretty much opens up a door for another X-Men movie and God willing that will happen.Now for the special effects in this movie. The scene where Magneto rescues Mystique is just awesome and well worth the price of admission. What they can do with a computer is just amazing. One of the scenes at the end (and no I won't ruin it for you) that involves Wolverine and Dr. Jean Grey is also awesome. However, the scene in the beginning of the movie where Professor X and Magneto go to meet with Jean Grey is just creepy. Since the scene is supposed to happen 20 years before current times they decided to digital enhance both Professor X and Magneto's faces to appear that they were 20 years younger. In reality all it really did was freak me out. Yes they do look younger but at the same time they both look like wax figurines that have come to life. It is so distracting that I found myself concentrating on the way they looked vs. what was going on in the scene. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. Just like Empire Strikes Back, Aliens and Lord of the Ring The Two Towers the second movie in this 3 movie set is still the best. I would recommend this movie to almost anyone except for small children. There is a lot of violence in the movie that is not appropriate for children viewing. If you are fan of the X-Men comic or just movies that are based on comic books I think that you will really enjoy this movie. But then again, what do I know?",X-Men - The Last Stand
542,musica1,"Not quite as good as the first two, but still a great ride for X-Men fans",9,29 May 2006,"I definitely said ""Wow"" more in this movie than I did in the first two X-Men movies. It has a lot of unusual and spectacular scenes in it that will keep you excited throughout the movie. However, it sacrificed somewhat in the character development. In the first two, we really came to love or hate each character. In this one, the new mutants such as Angel weren't fully developed, so we didn't come to care for them one way or another. It's a shame, too, because Ben Foster seemed to be an excellent addition to the cast. What little we saw of him made us want to know more. Also, this movie focused a little too much on Storm. She is one of the less charismatic of the mutants (sorry ""Oscar- winner-Halle-Barry"",) so it makes the movie feel a little dull at times. Wolverine is still exciting and Ian McKellan as Magneto is magnificent as always.The plot of a ""cure"" for mutants is interesting. But mutants are killed or cured so quickly throughout that we're not given much time to care one way or another. Maybe fewer deaths and curings would have given each one more meaning.Overall, I'd say this is a good ride for X-Men fans. I have a feeling that if you weren't already a fan of the franchise, you probably wouldn't enjoy it as much.",X-Men - The Last Stand
543,magratk,The Last Stand was fine.,7,29 May 2006,"But The Last Stand should have been great. It has a great premise. Suddenly, the moral question of whether you assimilate, tolerate, or separate is presented starkly, and no one is ready for it, not even the Secretary of Mutant Affairs. And we find out that it's not just the charismatic anti-hero, the Holocaust survivor Magneto, who has been making moral decisions for other people, it's our pure hearted leader Charles Xavier. The special effects are fun, the actors great, and Ian McKellen rocks the house. But the movie is disappointing. They wave at the big question, they never grapple with it. Give me more of Rogue's anguish; this incredibly powerful woman who can not shake hands or kiss or bear a child. Give me more of McCoy's loss; this man who was a research scientist who can no longer manipulate the lab equipment. Talk to me about the fact that the cure will kill Logan. And there were strange continuity problems. Xavier unleashes at Wolverine for doing ""something,"" when we just saw him do nothing. Magneto steps over the body of the woman he loves and sends devoted followers to their apparent deaths with barely a shrug. Magneto plays for keeps, but he's always had the grace to regret it before. Storm's in charge, but Wolverine's giving orders? These things didn't work for me. There were some wonderful bits. The actors were great, especially Sir Ian. That man owned that film, and any scene with him in it was delicious. Some nicely brutal fight scenes. Kitty Pride's fight with Juggernaut was just about perfect. The slight (unintentional?) political commentary of sending a great big blue ape to the UN made me laugh. And the last scene, while not as good as Magneto quoting Malcolm X from the first film, was still nice. But I was irritated at what it could have been. The other two movies are great; a fun surface romp with depths that go deep. This was all surface. Worth seeing. But I don't think I'll be buying the DVD. Don't think it'll bear re-watching.",X-Men - The Last Stand
544,verndougall,It's alright!,7,20 September 2013,"This movie is still note worthy of viewing, and despite it still pulling in elements that shouldn't have been in, a title a few times after redeems the qualities. It's an action flick, the characters aren't the strongest, but as always, Hugh Jackman shines as a star to the Wolverine role. There aren't many outstanding elements to this movie, it feels average, but there are spectacles to dazzle the eyes. Although, you have to see the previous ones, to get a better grasp, and depth to certain characters. This movie was worth my view, and can even be thought provoking, towards a more fictional premise. Test it out, see how you like it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
545,NeilBarnett,Can't put my finger on it,7,25 May 2006,"As much as I enjoyed the film, I felt that something was not quiet right about the film.It's style isn't as polished as the other two films and I feel X-Men: The last Stand's loss is Superman's gain. Some of the special effects were not as solid looking as perhaps they should be. It's one of the few films that I've seen that I wish was slightly longer, the demise of Mystique and the quick dismissal of her character was not as it should be. After all in the first two X-Men she was central to everything Magneto was doing.Overall the film is worth seeing but it was a little disappointing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
546,Youngbuck11,Nothing special...,6,22 November 2006,"I admit to not being a huge fan of the other X-Men films. I'd much prefer to watch Superman than these guys, but I when I had nothing else to watch, they were quite enjoyable.So now, a few months later, I decided to check the third film out. I liked it and found it to be fairly entertaining, but nothing special. I can't say which of the three films are my favorite, but this one probably isn't it. It just seemed far to mediocre. It didn't take any risks and did nothing new for the series. Just another X-men film to add to the list.The acting was fairly good. Pacing was good, as it kept me pretty much interested the entire time and I never felt like turning the film off. There were only a few places in this film that it felt sort of corny. But it was the same way with the other two films, so I expected it.Overall, I'd much rather Singer direct this film, but I'd much rather him direct the next Superman, so hopefully he won't. :) I'd say rent it on DVD as I did, don't buy it unless you are a hardcore fan of the film.It was nothing special. Just another action-hero movie.-Chris",X-Men - The Last Stand
547,charlene_boyle,Again another great X-Men movie,8,19 June 2006,"Of all the superhero/comic book run-off movies being released over the past years the x-men has to be one of the best. The beauty of these movies are the never ending supply of different mutents that keep getting introduced in each installment. The Final Stand does not disappoint us there, several interesting and colorful characters age introduced if even for a short period. It in fact gives us a lot of surprises, some good and some not so good. I had intentionally not seen the trailer before I saw the movie so I had no idea what to expect, which I assume added to my enjoyment of the film. I still haven't seen the trailer, however i'm assuming one of the biggest shockers was revealed to the audience before they stepped foot in the theatre. This movie was definitely a great watch and I would recommend it to anyone even if your not an x-men fan.",X-Men - The Last Stand
548,Deafy the Timid Diver,Below Average...,4,1 June 2006,"Let me get this out of the way - I don't think that I've ever read an X-Men comic in my life. I've only watched the cartoon when I was younger.This movie pales in comparison with the first two, if only for the lack or character development/motives. I LOVE going to a movie to suspend disbelief, so when I am unable to, the plot holes must be glaring.Going from day to night in the blink of an eye? Killing off (or having mutants lose their powers) for no apparent reason other than for shock value? Cyclops, Xavier, Mystique, Rogue, Jean Grey/Pheonix, and Magneto are all rendered either a) dead or b) without powers. Not to mention a number or minor mutants that bite the dust. IMO, this was just uncalled for, mostly because they do nothing to advance the storyline.The character development was also bizarre - even the well known characters were acting differently than they were in the first two films. You can really tell that there was a different director at the helm of this one.All in all, this movie was a major letdown for me. If you go and see it, don't expect to be blown away.",X-Men - The Last Stand
549,angre1-1,boo! hiss!,1,20 November 2006,"Spoiler--What a waste of my time and money! I liked the first movie. I liked the characters. I liked the second the movie, and I liked the characters. The addition of nightcrawler in the second movie was very nice and fun to watch. By the way, where did he go? Anyway, 20 minutes into the movie, my wife said, ""I really like the fact that the same characters are in this movie."" ""Same actors, you mean,"" I corrected. ""The characters could have been replaced by different actors, but the characters would have remained the same."" ""Exactly,"" she said. ""It makes it seem more continuous, like it was a real story. That makes it cool."" Well, I agree with her. And then, I realized that the actors must've wanted out. Because they killed off characters mystique, rogue, charles xavier, Jean Grey, Cyclops, Magneto... Considering the first movie had each of those characters, and I revisited the series to follow their stories, it makes no sense to strip them from the movies. Now, the only reason to watch is to see Halle Berry? I don't think so. How about Hugh Jackman? Well, I guess he is going to be doing a solo project about Wolverine in 2008. Well, I guess if the movie had lasted 10 more minutes this would have a been a solo project too. And that is not what I wanted to see...",X-Men - The Last Stand

Then I would still be able to look at the X-Men movies with the same feeling of awe and joy that I used to have. Alas, X-Men3 happened.It's a movie that may well have been made by an X-Men hater.""Hahaha!"", the X-Men hater would say, ""This is how to ruin the third and final X-Men movie: Let a major part of the characters be killed or robbed of their powers. Preferably those who the audience grew a custom to by careful character development in the first two movies. First, demolish the Jean character by turning her, for no valid reason, into some sort of obnoxious psycho demon. Then let the victims die senselessly, and don't even give them adequate dramatic death scenes. Like, let Cyclops be in the movie for the sole purpose of being wimpy and getting instantly killed - by the hand of his love, and for absolutely no reason but that she's become a psycho demon. Don't even show his death, just let him disappear, leaving the audience wondering till the end if he really died. And Xavier, just let her kill him senselessly as well. And after she killed'em all, let her be killed. Die, X-Men, die, die, die! About Magneto and Mystique, they're far too cool characters. So let's downsize them by robbing their powers.""I wonder why authors keep killing main characters in sequels. It made the Alien franchise suck, it ruined the Matrix franchise, and in the sloppy way it was done for X-Men it was pretty well sure that it would wreck that franchise, too.",X-Men - The Last Stand
551,GeneR777,Regrettably I did not enjoy it.,1,29 May 2006,"I have been a very big X-Men fan for the last twenty-five years and enjoyed the first two films because they remained somewhat true to the spirit of the characters and the story dynamics. So it was with great anticipation that I awaited the third film. Even with the change of the director I figured it would not be so different in tone and theme. However I was wrong on both counts. When I go see a film such as an anticipated sequel I ultimately satisfied to some degree by simply being able to immerse myself in the world of some of my favorite characters. In some cases the sequels I have seen are good at keeping true to the characters' nature and relationships and thus continuing the fun. In this case however I was conflicted because: 1.) on one hand I loved seeing the characters played by some of my favorite actors (a BIG kudos for whoever thought of about casting Olivia Williams as Moira McTaggart -- what a hottie!) and 2.) I did not like the plot choices that the screenwriters and director made in this film. RE: Character Deaths If you see this film and are a die-hard X-Men fan you may agree that certain characters getting killed off made the overall dynamics of the story rather un-X-men-like. Having certain characters romantically involved with one another which was different from the comic book also make it feel a bit weird. I will not elaborate further but if you see the film and know the comic books you may agree with me on this. By the way one could argue that these unanticipated deaths actually enhances the overall storyline because it raises the stakes for the audience since none of the characters are immune from death. And a few deaths are okay, but it seemed like a little overkill (pun intended) in this film. RE: Plot Yes, there is a story contrary to popular opinion. And it's not too bad really, however there are a LOT of story lines going on simultaneously which makes you think if the film were any longer or convoluted that wthe audience would simply lose track of the progression in the story altogether. RE: In the End By the way if you do go see this film stay for the scene after the credits. I am beginning to do this more and more and they do throw in a final scene after the credits that you will not want to miss. RE: Directing Choices Ultimately I believe a director is hired for how he presents his stories. While Ratner is more than competent in his abilities to direct this film, how the story ultimately plays out in terms of tone is also his responsibility. This is a darker X-Men, true. But I believe the amount of deaths that exists in this film -- i.e. soldiers getting disintegrated -- was unnecessary for telling the story and overall rather disturbing. We know it's CG when you see it, but to see people being atomized over and over again is just sickening and unnecessary. In X2 we know a bunch of the baddies are going to die due to their own grenades however Singer at least has the good taste to not indulge in the violence. In X1 and X2, the spectacle is not the story but a tool at the hands of the director. In X3 it seems that fact is somewhat forgotten. Even though I walked out of X3 rather happy to see some of my favorite characters, after a few hours the overall impact of all tha violence left a bad taste in my mouth and I came to the conclusion that I really did not like this film. RE: The Future Is X-Men: The Last Stand the end for the X-Men? I doubt it. There's still plenty of material that could be used for sequels. However I wish the Donners reteam with Singer for the next project. He seems to have been pretty good at keeping spirit of the project on track.",X-Men - The Last Stand
552,jeffthemartin,A disappointing follow-up to X-Men 1 and 2,6,1 June 2006,"I was really looking forward to this movie, but I was disappointed. The acting and special effects were great, and the story had a lot of potential, but the movie just wasn't put together in a gripping, exciting way.The superhero characters I have enjoyed getting to know through X-Men 1 and 2 are still there, but instead of doing cool stuff, they just strut around, serving the script. I feel their passion, but not their motivation.At the end of a huge tragic scene, some of the characters start crying. When this happened, I felt suddenly catapulted out of the mood of the movie; I was just watching the actors cry, and I felt nothing, because the movie had done such a terrible job of telling the story during that scene.One of the things I like about X-Men 1 and 2 was that the movies and characters are so strongly grounded in reality. X-Men 3 is closer to its comic-book origins, and suffers because of it. The comic-book X-Men have fantastical histories; almost all of them have died and/or lost their mutant powers multiple times. For me, the strength of the first two movies is being able to identify with the characters, even while being awed by their powers. In this movie, reality is a distant memory, and the mutants' powers are little more than a special-effects freakshow.",X-Men - The Last Stand
553,KingMFreak,Somewhat satisfying wrap-up,8,26 May 2006,"The one thing I liked about X-Men: The Last Stand is that the ending was, overall, satisfying. Most, if not all, comic book movies I have seen aggravate me because the end is almost an anti-climax, holding me in suspense for the next installment. I would be very happy if the series stopped here. We already have two spin-offs slated for next year, one called Magneto and the other called Wolverine.I guess this is fitting, and explaining the back-stories of these two characters would probably be impossible to do in one sequel. However, a fourth X-Men movie would not draw me because this movie spends a lot of the time killing off or destroying the powers of its principle characters (two main ones are dead before half-an-hour has passed).The movie's storyline centers on a new medicine that has been discovered which will supposedly cure mutants of their gifts. The source comes from a child mutant called Leech (Aaron Eckhart's son in Thank You for Smoking, Cameron Bright), whose power is to rid other mutants of theirs when around him, and whose DNA provides the makeup for the medicine.This causes Magneto (Ian McKellen) to declare war on the homosapiens, especially after one character is unintentionally turned human. His main sidekick is Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who can manipulate fire. Other mutants worthy of mention are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Phoenix (Famke Janssen), and Beast (Kelsey Grammar).The movie's one vital flaw is that it throws aside all further character development for the stunning action sequences and character killing. The new character Angel (Ben Foster) is the reason this cure is first produced, and yet he only gets three scenes. Then there's the relationship between Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), the latter beginning to show interest in a new girl, Kitty (Ellen Page), though this triangle is hardly developed. Rogue mopes in the shadows while Iceman and Kitty share a special moment on ice.The list of underdeveloped characters goes on and on and on. Brett Ratner has an eye for the action, as Phoenix provides some rather stunning visuals when she enters her more hectic moments, and when Magneto lifts up the Golden Gate Bridge, I was truly stunned. The visuals overall where impressive and left me satisfied.Although X-Men: The Last Stand has a sense of finality, it doesn't achieve the satisfying wrap-up that The Return of the King achieved with its six endings. Still, I recommend it because it is great fun, and if you've been keeping track of the series you'll want to see how the war resolves. I advise to watch either of the earlier films first if you haven't in a while, because this movie provides little-to-no recap of the earlier events.",X-Men - The Last Stand
554,jdfcanada,Pretty dark but pretty enjoyable,8,29 May 2006,"The movie starts off a few months after the end of X-Men 2, with Wolverine and Cyclops still grieving over the loss of Jean Gray. If you've seen the trailers, then you have an idea of what happens next. A 'cure' for the 'X' gene is found and offered to mutants. Of course, the paranoid people in the government turn it into a weapon and plan to use it as a defence against rogue mutants, like Magento. Magento, of course takes exception to this and forms an army, with the intent on destroying the cure and taking over the planet. He enlists the help of dozens of mutants and storms the facility holding the cure. Of course, the government, armed with its new 'cure' weapons, is waiting for them and a battle ensues.There is also a love triangle of sorts between Kitty Pryde, Iceman, and Rogue, as well as some time spent on developing other 'lesser' characters, both in the X-Men and the Brotherhood. Plenty of fun new characters are introduced, the best being Juggernaut (played very hilariously by Vinne Jones).This movie is considerably darker than the others, with plenty of mayhem and death, so that may or may not be your cup of tea. Personally, I enjoyed the darker take on the X-Men instead of the usual superhero movie with the good guys winning and no one getting hurt.I was pretty impressed by this movie. After reading reviews about it, I was expecting another it to be like Mission Impossible3, another cash grab with big actors and without a story. Instead, I was treated to a pretty decent story, plenty of action, lots of payoff and lots of characters getting killed. Needless to say, there are some major characters that either get killed or lose their powers, so expect the unexpected. You also need to stay in the theatre after the credits finish to see a special scene involving one of the major characters, otherwise, you'll have to wait for the DVD in the fall.",X-Men - The Last Stand
555,pauloshdias,Desapointment with the final,7,28 October 2006,"I had great expectations to see this movie. I knew it was the last one of the trilogy and I was really anxious to see how Phoenix would be represented. If it would be as I've seen it in comics.But, at the end, the lack of flames in the Phoenix was the least of my disappointments. I got really disappointed with the end given to main characters.Anyway, I just remembered myself that I cannot give away every detail of the movie. Anyway, I just have to say that I loved the main argument except (as I said) the end given to some of the main characters.I can't really talk about the cast's performance because I don't believe I have the cinematic knowledge to do so. Still, I can keep complaining about some argument flaws. Such as, some lack of profundity in some characters and lack of explaining how some other characters ended in the movie. I'm talking about the character named ""Juggernaut"" and the little kid dressed in white (played by Cameron Bright) who didn't have explained what happened to them. And about the Angel (played by Ben Foster) who didn't have the profundity it should and seamed like it passed aside the movie, aside the story. That character was out of the story instead of playing a more important role.",X-Men - The Last Stand
556,a_ngox,Would this end of the trilogy?,8,25 May 2006,"To be honest, I could barely wait to watch this movie. I was simply amazed when I saw the trailer. There were many unexpected scenes - some of them added more values, but some of them were bit disappointing. Let say in the case of Angel. I expected that he'd be part of the main characters in the movie - at least that was what the trailers and posters showed us, but he barely showed up in the movie. Probably many people who watched the movie already would feel the same as I do. Of course, there were tons of nice unexpected scenes as well.Overall I love the movie. Compared to the first and second sequel, this has more 'mutant fights'. You could really see how powerful the mutants actually are - as it should be, of course. When you watch this movie, you'll actually believe this will end of the trilogy. Not so long until you see the end, you'll start wondering 'hey! is this really the end or what?' I don't know why the director ended the movie that way. Probably to be on the safe side since he also doesn't know whether the fourth sequel should be out or not. Anyway this is a movie that you wouldn't regret watching - especially if you like the first and second parts.The story began with invention of the mutation cure by homo sapiens, and also rise of the phoenix. Facing the war before him, Magneto - who's definitely despise the idea of curing mutation - created his own mutant armies. So, human with the X-men 'protecting' them versus Magneto's armies. Phoenix? The kitty of the whole movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
557,ignus5uk,The worst film of the year,1,11 June 2006,"I went to see this movie with high hopes and an open mind, as the previous X-Men films have remained to be one of my favourite comic-to-film conversions to date. Mainly because they took a comic series which was great to read and could have been disastrous on screen, but ended up being great films. However, with most of the production crew changed, it was instantly recognisable that there was a different feel and less intelligent driving force behind the third instalment of the X-Men series, in which there were too many things that were not handled well.The first fifteen minutes of the film did give me high hopes, as I saw a lot of things from the comic come to life on screen such as a The Morlocks and the training room scene (I'm trying not to dwell too much on the comics). However these hopes were soon crushed as soon I realised this film was nothing more than a series of action sequences put together around a really poor idea.Bryan Singer and Bret Ratner clearly had different visions for the X-Men series. Bryan Singer opted for the storyline based approach, providing a decent background for each character he involved and making everything move at a steady pace, where as Brett Ratner decided to go to town with the special effects crew, giving this film as much depth as a teaspoon and cramming it all in to about 100 minutes. What really annoyed me was how Brett Ratner was undoing all the work that Bryan Singer had done, mainly by killing of characters for no apparent reason, changing the personality of existing characters and putting in a lot of nonsense scenes in just so he could introduce some new character! It also seemed like Brett Ratner had no clue how to continue where Bryan Singer had left off in the second film with the Phoenix storyline and simply decided to make Jean Grey do an impression of Carrie throughout the film and ruin that story. I personally think it should have been left out entirely as it is too big a storyline to be a sub plot and instead should have had its own film dedicated to it.There are, however, a few good points to this film too. For example, Halle Berry played the part of Storm as a stronger character and had more screen time, which allowed her to become like the Storm from the comics and gave a good performance doing so. It was also nice to see Juggernaut, played by Vinnie Jones, on screen, although it's not much of a stretch for Vinnie Jones to play an angry thug.The best thing about this movie was Kelsey Grammar's whose performance of Beast was great and was definitely the highlight of the film for me.Overall this film had no lasting emotion or substance to it and the closing scenes emphasise that. After seeing this film it did make me appreciate how much of a good job Bryan Singer had done for the first two X-Men movies and filled me with a lot of hope and anticipation for Superman Returns.",X-Men - The Last Stand
558,redwing1499,Not impressed,4,29 May 2006,"I had high hopes for this film and I was so disappointed. It was nothing like I thought it would be. The story was not believable, the characters had grown tired and the dialogue was bad.They even looked like they were tired of playing these characters. Nothing was exciting, there was no comrade re, and it seemed stiff.I understand that they had a new director. This is what happens when you switch gears like that. Ratner did not have Singer's vision. It was like he didn't know what and who the characters were.There may be some decent films this summer, and people are going to see it no matter what I say about it.

559,Rick_Bman,Brett Ratner;The new Joel Schumacher?,3,2 December 2006,"Can we say Batman Forever? Seriously this movie really reminds me of Joel Schumacher's attempt to make a Batman movie. Both X-Men 3 and Batman Forever suffer from the same problem. They took everything that made the first two movies in their respective franchises good, and threw it out the window and instead made a run-of-the-mill action movie full of poorly written dialog and very little substance or character development.X-Men and X-Men 2 were both fairly well written for comic book movies. The writers and the directors took the stories very seriously, and made 2 very good movies about intolerance and prejudice. X-Men 3 was not at all well written, it was just filled with cheesy one-liners and pointless dialog. I have nothing against cheesy one-liners, both X-Men and X-Men 2 had their fair share. X-Men 3 however has no well written dialog to mix with the cheesy one-liners.There was also a whole lot of pointless dialog in the film; I seriously got tired of people announcing that they were going to use their powers. Just use the powers, don't inform me that you are getting ready to. The worst example of this is when Wolverine and Storm go back to the lake where Jean had been killed. It is extremely foggy and Wolverine and Storm walk around in the fog for a minute until Wolverine comments that he can not see anything, at which point Storm decides that clearing the fog would be a good idea. Why didn't she just clear the fog as soon as they got off the Jet, why did she have to wait for Wolverine to inform him that she couldn't see? Because of all this bad and pointless dialog it seriously felt as if some of the really good actors in the movie were not giving their best performances. I don't blame them, they did the best they could with the dialog that they were given.While we are on the subject of pointless things in the movie (slight spoilers beyond), why did the two mutants take Warren Worthington to the roof of the building to throw him off to kill him? Why didn't they just use their powers to kill him right away if they wanted him dead? This was done for no other reason than to give Angel the chance to swoop in and save his father. This was just a totally poorly written and unbelievable scenario.Also the actions sequences seem to come right out of one of those Live, Action/Aventure shows you see at theme parks like Six Flags and Kings Dominion. I'm not sure if it was the obvious wire work on Storm's flying, or maybe the cheesy entrances that each of the characters made, or what. Something about the entire sequence just gave me that whole cheesy vibe that you get while watching one of those shows.This movie tried to have the same type of substance that the first two had but it failed miserably. Ratner just doesn't seem to know how to include the substance and underlying messages in his film the way Singer did. The message was in there, but it was secondary to the action, and it wasn't brought to the surface in any way, shape or form. It was mostly just lame dialog proclaiming that the cure is evil and that they must destroy it. All of this had potential to be as good as the first two, but it just was not handled well at all by Ratner.",X-Men - The Last Stand

561,WheelerClown,Doubt there'll be an X-Men IV,9,30 May 2006,"This was at least as entertaining as X-Men I and II, maybe more so. The action was good. Acting wasn't too bad. Halle Berry's depiction of an angry Storm wasn't great, but then, her acting rarely is. Angel was window dressing; hardly part of the story at all. If Beast was director of Mutant Affairs, where was he in X-II at least, if not X-I? I have to say here I was pleasantly surprised by Kelsy Gramer. He is NOT one of my favorite actors, but he did a decent job of playing Hank McCoy, the Beast.And where was Nightcrawler? You'd think that there would at least have been a storyline explaining where he was, and I think, based on a conversation he had with with Mystique in the last movie, I expected to see him in line to get the ""cure."" If it was a question of special fx costs, they should have shelved Angel and stuck with Nightcrawler. I hated the way they made Jean Grey's Phoenix persona look like something out of the exorcist and never really explained what made her so murderous, or why it took her so long to re-surface. And it was a bit lame to blame Phoenx on a hidden part of her personality all along that Xavier was trying to get under control, considering that was never even hinted at in the previous films.Still, there are just as many good points. the storyline of Rogue seriously wanting the cure so she could actually be embraced and kissed by her boyfriend was riveting, although I expected her to come to a different conclusion at the end. I was thrilled to see Kitty Pryde get a major role in the movie. She's always been my favorite X-Man (or should I say X-Woman?) with Rogue a close second. I was disappointed that they didn't establish the relationship between Xavier and As for the end (and here are major spoilers, so if you don't want to know the end, read no further), it's pretty obvious to me that, except for the possibility of a prequel or another reincarnation (several, in fact), there's not likely to be an X-Men IV. Two of your major villains (including THE major villain) are no longer mutants. The same for a major X-Man (woman). And with the deaths of Xavier and Cyclops (told you this would be a spoiler), what can they possibly do for a real sequel? I liked the story and the major ending better than the last X-Man movie (except I hated who decided to take the cure). Magneto's rejection of a major supporter and ally the moment she involuntarily got ""the cure."" was magnificent. I did want Rogue to show up at the last moment and siphon off Phoenix's powers so she could be Jean Grey again. And why did Wolverine do what he did to her when he could have just shot her with the cure when he got close enough to use his claws? Sometimes, movie lines just defy logic, even if you can buy into the fantasy settings. X-IIII pretty much ended the movie franchise in my opinion. An X-Man movie just wouldn't be an X-Man movie without Xavier. But I guess we'll have to see. Money does strange things in Hollywood.Bottom line...X-Men III is definitely worth watching.",X-Men - The Last Stand
562,DizzyDitz,ridiculousity incarnate,5,27 May 2006,"This movie isn't the horror that some would make it out to be, but it does have some fairly annoying holes in its story and certainly isn't as good as the last X-men movie was. This one gets caught up in its own eye candy too much, skimps on logic, and flies in the face of much of the comics themselves. Now #3 might not be a reason to dislike this movie if you're not a comic book fan, but #1 and #2 would probably do it. It is one of those movies which is awesome on one level (re: Kaboom! Awesome action! Woooow) and totally ridiculous on every other level. Enjoyable with friends, but I'd recommend sitting in a part of the theatre where you can easily chuckle.",X-Men - The Last Stand

There are a million surprises, that any comic book or movie fan should not allow to have spoiled for them. After the delicate care Bryan Singer used for both ""X-Men"", and ""X2: X-Men United"" I was somewhat fearful of a change in director. My fears were definitely warranted. Although I definitely enjoyed the movie, it felt extremely rushed, I truly enjoyed the elements from both Joss Whedon's ""Gifted"" storyline, and the Dark Phoenix saga. Overall, I left the theater feeling full of X-Citement (hah!) but upon reflection I couldn't help but feeling something was missing. Most negative comments I have read pertain to the overuse of special effects and the misuse of parts of the story. However, in order to create a film, especially one based on a comic book which has weaved an delicately balanced continuity (barely able to stand) over the last forty-three years, only certain elements can be chosen. One example is that, a love interest may be switched in order for it to fit the storyline. However, if I must make one angry statement, there are too many characters that are unnamed, unused, unnecessary, underplayed, and given no story. There are a multitude of main characters, that don't even get names. As a comic book fan, it is a bonanza of ""who was that supposed to be? and Oh, wow, they even stuck them in?! Hey, that's Psylocke!"" But as a movie fan, if I didn't know the story of the film, I might be saying, ""Who was the Asian chick with the purple hair, and why did she blend into the wall?"" Many have blamed it all on the film not being directed by Bryan Singer, well I'll give you this question. Is it not his fault since he chose to leave for ""Superman Returns""? (Which by the way looks like it's going to suck.)",X-Men - The Last Stand
564,DCJerzeygrl,...........Wow.........Wow.................Wow,10,25 May 2006,"Having read everything about the XMen 3 -Last Stand, I was still surprised & happy/sad at the end of this movie. Yes, there's a hot scene between Logan & Jean Grey (or is it Dark Phoenix?). Yes, there are major deaths on both sides of the fight between the X-Men & Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. Yes, there are good 'funny lines' delivered by my personal favorite - Hugh Jackman. Though not enough brutal Wolverine fight scenes ---- as in X2 when he's defending Xavier's School. Good news is the transformation of Jean Grey to Dark Phoenix. It's subtle, tense, yet horrifying. Unfortunately, Mystique is not given enough screen time (she's my 2nd favorite Mutant). However, Ellen Page (star of 'Hard Candy') is perfect for Kitty Pryde and so is a beefed-up Vinnie Jones as the Juggernaut. Even if this movie does exceedingly well, I really don't think they could round up the main cast back for a 4th installment. Best way to go is with Hugh Jackman and the 'Wolverine' film. Wolverine's current screenwriter is David Benioff (husband to Amanda Peet). They don't have a director yet, but I don't think they'll have a problem securing one. The question is would Bryan Singer direct? After Brett Ratner punk'd poor Hugh Jackman on MTV......I don't think he'll work with him again, though I could be wrong. Enjoy and don't leave your seat till after all the credits roll.",X-Men - The Last Stand
565,CAL_FORD,Director ruined movie,6,10 October 2006,"X1 and X2 were different movies then X3. X3 has a new director who apparently could care less about the quality of the show or its characters but instead cares about the $$$. All aspects of X3 were rushed and poorly thought out. You could even see in the faces of the actors the uncomfortable sense of ""hurry and up get the movie over"".The only reason it received a good rating from Users is the momentum from the first two movies, on its own X3 would be a failure. It is obvious X3 was a sell out and a lead in to more $$$ in 2007's Wolverine. Why why why did the director change! Sad to see a great series die off.",X-Men - The Last Stand
566,shaundowning13666,Evolution is an illness?,10,26 March 2021,"The first film was a small collection of Mutants Fear of humanity and their first shot across the Bow of Humanity.The second was forced registration of Mutants as if they were second class citizens and then the obvious step of forced relocation of the Mutants to better control them. As history has showed repeatedly the first step on the steps of fear will always go to the second steps.The third film is the is the of cause declaring evolution as an illness and that theirs a ""cure"" for it..

567,tobias_681,A very packed Last Stand,8,21 November 2015,"I went into X-Men: The Last Stand without knowing anything much about the characters, the original comic books or the previous movies which I hadn't seen. As the X-Men movies have had remarkable success and set their mark on culture however, I knew about a guy with ""lasereyes"", I knew that Hugh Jackman was Wolverine and I knew that I'd get Patrick Stewart in a wheelchair Perhaps it seems ironic to blind-start (well, almost) into a franchise with a movie called ""The Last Stand"" and I didn't decide for myself that this would be the best place to start as the TV stations decided to air The Last Stand one day before the first two X-Men movies. However maybe the TV stations had a point well, they probably hadn't but maybe there's a point to starting with the Last Stand: So what is the point? The Last Stand is incredibly packed and I mean incredibly packed. It races through themes of cultural, social and philosophical relevance like a short-distance runner. It builds up metaphors, links concepts to individual characters (and their powers) and draws from a seemingly endless stack of themes. It lives in a limbo of themes that define political debates today. In only 104 minutes it makes us think about social conformity, the gay debate, genetic engineering, distribution of power, terrorism etc. The actions the characters do and the concepts explored are truly worth thinking about. In presenting them The Last Stand might be rushed and it barely reaches a conclusion (well, should it?) but it's undeniably very interesting.The movie enters where the 2nd part left. It introduces us to new mutants (notably a guy with angel wings which he's ashamed off – a metaphor for homosexuals and coming out) but also returns to the ones established in the previous films. After the events in X2, the team seems to be building up (as suggested in a training sequence at the start of the film) but the past is not yet over Scott in particular mourns the loss of Jean, distancing himself from the others in the process.Afterwards two main plot lines emerge: The government produces a cure for mutants, which rids them of their powers and Jean reemerges but this time as a being called Phoenix that acts only on it's instincts. Over the course of the movie we learn that Jean is in fact the most powerful of all mutants, that her powers are matched by no one. She's an allegory on absolute power.The problem this movie faces isn't that it lacks content. It outdoes any other superhero film in terms of content. But when compared to it's predecessors it actually lacks something: A competent dramatic structure. While in terms of content the stakes are very high, in terms of characters they are very low. Scott, a main character from the previous 2 films, vanishes without the others caring much and any other character development that happens feels either rushed or barely happens at all. If you've watched the first 2 movies before watching The Last Stand you'll probably be disappointed by the way this movie handles it's characters. That's why watching The Last Stand first might actually be a good idea.The movie has been rightfully criticized for all of this. 104 minutes just aren't enough for the story it attempts to tell. But while it's important that we use our heart, we also shouldn't forget to use our brain. It takes an incredibly amount of thematic weight to the final battle which the title suggests will happen. Close to the end we are confronted with a sequence of lyrical beauty: While Jean destroys everything around her, Wolverine, being in love with her still, approaches her. He moves further and further despite his skin being ripped off in the process. When through all that destruction, he finally reaches in to her you'd think he just wants to hug her It's a very tangible moment that makes you feel the characters and makes you relate to the pain and trouble you might have sometimes had when trying to reach through to people you love.In the end The Last Stand isn't a perfect movie, not even remotely. But it's an interesting and unique movie that in a genre often packed with fast paced action, manages to bring a lot of thought, even if it might not be fully coherent.",X-Men - The Last Stand
568,eldakim,Merely a Disappointment....,6,3 June 2006,"First off, I'd like to mention that X-men was my favorite comic book from Marvel, and I grew up watching the TV cartoons and the comic books. Although I'm not a ""dedicated"" fan, I can easily say that X-men was something that was part of me when I grew up. X-men, Spiderman, and Batman.This movie, I have to admit, let a tremendous disappointment to those who followed the comic book. Killing off such vital characters in the mere beginning made me tinge, because these characters were the huge backbone of the X-men. The story was definitely offplace, and characters least understood. Juggernaut was not how I thought he'd look, as well as the other characters in the film.The movie itself was still outstanding, however. It did provide action buffs with tons of explosions and CG effects, as well as an awesome finale against Magneto's forces and Xavier's X-men. It also did leave some trail of X-2 feelings behind, almost with the same feel.As a movie, it was an OK performance, but as a X-men fan, this was a disappointment.",X-Men - The Last Stand
569,Faizan,Avoid the third if you want to die happy with the memory of what Singer achieved,4,25 May 2006,"X3 is more disappointing than a movie comprising of its talents should be. Employing the same cast as the previous films in the series and nearly the same technical crew, the film is a blunt, weakly realised superhero travesty. As director, Brett Ratner, a questionable choice ever since his announcement was first made, relies on rehashing a lot of Bryan Singer's original elements, afterall, how many times can we see Magneto elevate cars into the air and actually find it exciting? The barebones plot has something to do with a mutant cure that some mutants welcome and others shun, but from this half interesting concept nothing of value ever materialises. There are no standout moments, no interesting new characters (Vinnie Jones as hirsute, pot-bellied Juggernaut is insulting to watch, as is Kelsey Grammar's embarrassing blue painted rug of a man, Beast). Surprising, very little of the action scenes visually entice, because they are either so ridiculously executed (the phoenix vs Professor X segment headlining as one of the worst cinema moments this year) or are simply plain boring (Wolverine kicking arse in a jungle - Yawn!). On a technical level as well, everything that can go wrong does - the effects are painfully obvious and the score by John Powell ill-fitting.Its sad to say this, but with one film, Ratner not only diminishes the collective memory of what was thus far a formidable film franchise, but also loses respect as a director with a promising future. Unlike Singer who used the settings in his films to hint at bigger themes such as racism and ethnicity, Ratner makes a one dimensional action filled special effects jaunt with little happening despite it seeming to imply otherwise. One important recurring element of both the comics and especially the films was Wolverine's quest to find his identity (think a mutant Jason Bourne), but here he is just another one of Professor X's lackey hanging around at the mansion spouting advice to the kids. The movie is very uneven, not only in pacing, substance and content, but also the way certain mutants are given too much screen time (Kitty Pryde) while others who might have been a big draw, are barely there for a few scant scenes (Angel, swooshing into the air as the music swells and irritates). A sign of a weak script is when it gets its high by killing off characters, and in X3 we get one too many of those. All in all, a movie to avoid if you want to die happy with the memory of the first 2 films.",X-Men - The Last Stand
570,tghood15,Good but left a lot of questions,8,30 May 2006,"OK. I saw X-Men The Final Stand this weekend and was almost fulfilled. Yes there were a few big mistakes, such as why did it go from day to night in a split second. I know it was sundown but come on it never gets dark that quick unless Storm is doing it. I will be the first to admit I don't know everything there is about about the X-Men universe which is huge. That is my point. With the countless characters and endless subplots my question is WHY? Why are they trying to end this franchise now. You that have seen the film know that we are left with some serious holes in the X-Men family, which could cause a problem if they decide to resurrect the franchise somewhere down the road. I just don't understand why finally when Hollywood gets the comic to movie formula right they decide to cut it off at the jugular. Let us all hope there is still a chance for the X-Men to return to the big screen once more. Stan Lee Help!!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
571,guitarcarl,What might have been!,3,29 May 2006,"Let me say right off if we are talking special effects this movie is a 9 star maybe even a 10 star production. But honestly, we are twenty years or more into the really cool special effects, we need a little more than that to hold us over and sadly X-Men 3 just does not do it. I really wanted to suspend my disbelief on this one but it was nearly impossible to do so. Some aspects of the plot were so silly I just couldn't take it anymore and it got worse as the movie progressed. To begin with the writers should have followed the advice of Jinni from Aladdin. Never bring people back from the dead! There is only one story where that comes out OK and it was written by God. No mere mortal writer is good enough to pull that off and it ruins this movie from the start! Jean Gray is a medium character of moderate import in the last two movies that suddenly jumps from being dead to a major pivotal role in the first ten minutes of the third. From regular part of the team to key role in a blink which was simply resolved by killing her again in the end. Horrible! Lucas at least got that right, Start with a wet behind the ears Luke in the first movie, toughen him up in the second and have him face the grave realities of good and evil in the third. I kept wondering how we were going to finally come to understand the mystery of wolverine. No such luck, they dropped that plot line I guess. The reactions of the lousy characters is always extreme either the mutant cure (which is a lousy plot idea that didn't work for me at all) was a wonderful blessing or a horrible curse. Does anybody really believe the cure is going to really work? This movie should of and could of pushed the plot to some reasonable conclusions but instead it left me with more questions than answers. It reminded me of being a kid and playing super heroes with the spoiled rich kid down the street. He always has a new power that we didn't know about that makes him more powerful than any body else in the group. When Magneto rips the Golden gate bridge off its foundation and moves it through the air perfectly placing it down so he and his army of mutants can walk to Alcatraz to kill one little boy, I had this sinking feeling come over me like my poor sick dog finally just rolled over and died. I actually felt embarrassed for the people in the movie. Could Ian Mckellen possibly have known they were going to ask him to act his way around that nonsense, I'm surprised he was willing to do it. If Magneto could do that why did he need anybody else to help him at all? How much trouble could a guy with power like that have killing a kid in a building full of metal? This movie was lousy. But hey, the special effects were cool!",X-Men - The Last Stand
572,James Felix,What an unbelievable hunk of crap,1,28 May 2006,"I'll be brief. This is an action movie without action, a character study without characters, a movie that fails spectacularly at every goal it sets for itself. It's a mere 97 minutes long and still manages to bore the crap out of you. Unsatisfied with mere disrespect for its source material it goes for full blown contempt instead. It has plot holes big enough to drive a convoy of trucks through and cannot even maintain its own internal, comic-book logic.On its own merits, compared to the comics or compared to the prior two movies this is a very, very poor film. It makes ""The Hulk"", ""Daredevil"" and ""Elektra"" look like masterpieces. As sequels go it is down there with ""Exorcist II: the Heretic"" and ""Jaws 4: the Revenge"".",X-Men - The Last Stand
573,bootderek,pathetic 3rd installment,1,21 August 2008,"OK, i really enjoyed the first two films. I was surprised to know that Singer did not continue. This movie was flat out terrible. It was badly written, for one thing. Almost every character seemed to have such dramatic dialogue that it ruined the whole thing. Bad graphics as well as rather stupid action sequences. The plot apparently focused on the Phoenix saga in the X-Men comics but did not do so completely which was a real disappointment. I mean since when does Jean Grey join the brotherhood? Many of the characters were undeveloped, poorly introduced, and had very small roles. Most of the Brotherhood are examples, such as the Juggernaut (sure Vinnie Jones was a good choice but he had little to do except rampage and push people around) Cyclops was killed off, and he shouldn't have been. A major disappointment is Rogue's appearance. She doesn't have much to do as she did in the first two, and her relationship with iceman is strained as Shadowcat is introduced. The Beast and Angel were very underdeveloped characters in this film,as were Colossus and Mystique and Pyro. Callisto was an interesting addition with a meaningless power. Storm and Xavier are also terribly positioned, and Magneto has terrible leadership skills this time around. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO NIGHTCRAWLER?! The film was rushed and the plot was twisted (since when is it a good idea to reverse a person's genetic codes? Poor plot, seriously. Overall, it's a terrible film and a waste of money. I do not recommend it for anyone looking for proper action or a good time with a marvel film directed by Rattner.",X-Men - The Last Stand
574,Reel_World,What the hell happened?? SPOILERS WITHIN,1,27 May 2006,"Long-time fan of the comics and fan of the first flicks. That being said - this was one of the worst films I have seen in ages. Brett Ratner should be ashamed of himself. It is painfully obvious that Ratner never read X-Men, nor did the screenwriters successfully piece together any sort of cohesion to the story. Such utter disregard for the history and development of so many beloved characters is like a slap in the face to true X-Men fans. With just way too many random story threads running throughout the film, the movie just winds up not knowing which way is up. Razzle Dazzle SFX does not a good film make, and killing off main characters or taking away their powers is a great way to destroy what was a great franchise.HOW TO KILL A FRANCHISE 101Cyclops: Phoenix kills him in the first 15 mins. His death is never seen. He dies like a punk. Totally inappropriate. Anyone who's read a comic would/should know this wouldn't work.Xavier: Phoenix disintegrates him. WTF?Jean: Ends up getting stabbed by Logan at the end (another huge no-no if you've read the comics)Mystique, Magneto, Rogue all lose their powers. Pointless.Not only are there too many story threads, but also too many characters. Angel - who figured prominently in the trailers is in the film for all of 3 minutes, as is Collossus. Shadowcat and Iceman's relationship is twisted since she looks all of 12 years old. And let's not even go there with Rogue whining about not being able to kiss Bobby (hence taking the cure) and Xavier being played as an arrogant SOB. The sole saving grace in the entire film was Iceman vs Pyro. The rest of it was an illogical hash of SFX, written and directed by an uninspired, uneducated (when it comes to X-Men knowledge), and ham-fisted ability. The only way this film could be good is if they had hired a different director, different writers, and added about 30 minutes to the proceedings. The film ends up imploding on itself and in the end making no sense whatsoever. A dismal and disappointing end to a great franchise. A true example of what could have been.",X-Men - The Last Stand
575,smlubecki,Good but could have been better,7,30 May 2006,"OK Here's the deal. X-men the last stand is a decent movie,but could have been SOOOO much better. To blame Bret Ratner for the movie is just wrong. True he had some input into the overall ""feel"" of the movie. It was not Bret that wrote the script and it was not Bret that held slavish to the Memorial Day release date. These circumstances made for a ""rushed"" product which was ever so apparent on the screen. ****spoiler alert***** The fact that Cyclops was assumed killed has everyone in an uproar. Show me the body. They needed to give James Marsden an out so he could film Superman with Bryan Singer(or punish him for leaving) The rushed atmosphere of the film left several characters under developed and the cure aspect was very interesting but again under developed. The complaints about Rouge going for the cure are absurd, she is totally in character for the movie continuity. And to all the nay sayers out there.....JUGGERNAUT was a pretty lame character in the comics too. His on screen incarnation was enjoyable, I mean how do you make a 6ft plus hulking none stoppable mass interesting? Ian Mckellen as always was excellent. His portrayal of Magneto is without compare. And Kelsey Grammar's portrayal of the Beast is AWESOME!to hear ""Oh my Stars and Garters"" was for this fan worth the price of admission. Did the ""deaths"" of three major characters upset me? Surprisingly no. They felt natural to the story and to the overall trilogy arc.And only one ""death"" could truly be confirmed (ps stay for the end of the credits) Would the movie had been different if Bryan Singer was still involved? Most likely,but I don't like to dwell on ""would've's or could've's"". What we got was ultimately a more than passable entry into a hopefully longer running series of films. My only wish is that they discard Halle for an actress that will understand her role in the greater scheme.Its worth seeing. Go and enjoy my friends it stays true to the established movie continuity.This has been a review from an avid Xmen comic reader since the 60's who can separate the two mediums and the difference in the print characters and their on screen counter parts.Go enjoy the film...its good.",X-Men - The Last Stand
576,synkronized-1,Ratner finally managed to left an impression of some kind,8,11 June 2006,"At first I was a little scared of what might come out of this. Brett Ratner's work so far hadn't left me any big impression. But when I saw the movie I quite liked it. It's full of action and great visual effects. Although at some cases it's quite predictable. And a negative thing - some characters left too quickly and quietly. Would've want to see something more impressive. The skating scene was visually quite enjoyable. As well as the Golden Gate scene. Of course I'm very impressed again by the good old cast (always magnificent Ian McKellen, hot and sweaty Hugh Jackman and pretty Famke Janssen) And I was glad again to see Aaron Stanford (whom I've liked since his very first movie ""Tadpole""). And I liked seeing Ben Foster (who made truly an amazing role in ""Bang, Bang, You're Dead"") as Angel. Although I really would've liked to learn much more about his character. I think that the length of the movie is probably too short :D But hopefully there will be an extended edition for the DVD. And hopefully they will really end the movie with the third part. Otherwise they will probably ruin it forever. 8/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
577,matt-szy,"very visual. entertaining, too. and really bad.",7,29 May 2006,"Xmen 3 is entertaining. It's a film about comic book characters. So it's not hard to be entertained.The story as a comic book idea is basically a good one. A potential cure for the mutant 'disease' has been found in a young mutant's blood. Anti-mutant supporters are rallying mutants to join the ranks of normal society by volunteering to receive treatment. But Magneto and his brotherhood see this as a weapon to eliminate the mutant identity completely. Xavier and his students stand as the mediators between the hard line mutants and the humans. Sounds good. And it is.What this film fails at is bringing in a truth to the characters, a sense believability in characters and what they are doing. One could say, this is a film based on a comic where people can shoot lasers out of their eyes, have adamantium claws in their hands, and walk through walls, so therefore disbelief should be somewhat suspended. Sure. And if X-Men was left to exist in the comic book medium or even as a cartoon I would maybe be less critical. But the suits and ties have decided to ride this comic movie wave and capitalize on the X-Men franchise, consequently choosing to elevate these characters and stories to a human level with live actors. And the third film in this trilogy failed to understand this, resulting in fake characters, cheap dialogue, overly sentimental situations.The film struggles with the amount of characters introduced. This is a challenge considering the amount of mutants existing in the X-Men universe and so on some level I will accept the difficultly in doing this successfully in a film shy of two hours. Yet, as von Brusak, from metroactive.com wrote in his X-Men 3 review, someone (the director) with a more careful hand could have done this more successfully. With this in mind the film tends to feel sloppy and rushed.For instance, Angel is having trouble accepting his mutant-ness. His rich father suggests the cure. Angel is hesitant, and just before he takes the cure injection he burst out of the straps and is suddenly proud to be a mutant. He flys around a little in the film. At the end he saves his rich father from amidst the chaos of the war between magneto and the humans.And more. Hank McCoy, The Beast, is also introduced in the film. He is a diplomat, working in the government for the betterment of the mutant cause. He talks about diplomacy. He is rational and smart. He reads, and does it upside down. He is against unnecessary violence. But by the end of the film he flips a switch, and fights a bloody fight side by side with Wolverine and the other X-Men, killing and smashing all those bad mutants.Other characters work simply as cutouts in the film. Juggernaut smashes through walls because Magneto says so. Colossus carries a large TV with one hand down the halls of the X-Men mansion. That's about the extent of their character development.The love story in the film exists between Jean Grey, who has returned as the all powerful Dark Phoenix who now works with Magneto, and Wolverine. Wolverine knows Jean Grey is trapped in the evil mask and that it's a matter of getting through to her. At the end of the film, when Phoenix is disintegrating mutants and humans and buildings with her power, Wolverine approaches her despite the possibility of being disintegrated, and tries to level with her, convince her to stop the destruction. She says, you would die for them? He says, no, I would die for you. And Wolverine kills her with his adamantium claws. The saying, love conquers all, comes to mind. Wolverine's love over humanity conquers the love for a woman. No comment.One thing this film does successfully is entertain. There is constant action and even suspense. As an early summer blockbuster this film hits its marks more or less. Maybe it did so even better than I can grasp. Near the end of the film, when the good have won, and the bad are defeated (this shouldn't count as a spoiler) I looked over at my buddy sitting next to me, and to my surprise, he was fighting back tears. I though maybe it's because of allergy season, or he was chocking on popcorn. I was concerned. Later he told me it was an epic ending, so powerful. I guess this is what entertainment is about.So for what it is, I'll give it a 7 out of 10. Why not.",X-Men - The Last Stand
578,leopisces,"Wow, what an ending!",8,26 May 2006,"I was fortunate enough to catch the 12:01am showing of X3. I must admit I had my concerns, but I was set at ease by this great movie. I had already set my desires on a specific story, but I found I still enjoyed the path it took. The direction this story goes is for the best. Great special effects mixed with a very involved story make for a wonderful film. The pace is set very quick yet the story doesn't suffer for it. It is missing a few characters I had hoped to see again, but it brings in some great new ones. There were quite a few surprises, which made the movie all the better. I loved this movie. I'm sure most people will agree when I say, It was worth seeing in the movie theater.",X-Men - The Last Stand
579,jwoehr,A Summer Movie that's tons of fun but that's about all it is,7,26 May 2006,"X-3 is without Brian Singer but Brett Ratner (Red Dragon, Rush Hour 1 and 2) at least stays faithful to the original movies. I'm not sure if all comic fans will jump for joy after seeing the movie though. The movies never fully become what they could've been. It would seem that this one ends things before the series could fully develop into the great stuff the comics and even the 1990's cartoon series gave us. Still though with so much great action and fun special effects it's pretty hard to call this a bad movie. It may not be the ending fans want but is it bad ending ? No. In this film, the father of Angel (Ben Foster) wants a normal life for his son who just happens to be a mutant with Angel wings. So he finds a cure but not all mutants want the cure. Magneto of course is strongly against it and plans on raging war against humans and killing the boy who's the source of the cure. While Jean Grey is back as Phoenix but without yelling ""I am PHOENIX!!"" like you may remember from the cartoon series lol. Here she just stands there thinking about what her next move will be. While Wolverine trys to get through to her. It's hard though since Magneto has a strong influence on her. Ratner offers many new bad mutants but...they are hardly developed. Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) for example isn't related to Charles Xavier at all in this movie and yes he has some great fight scenes but it's still sorta disappointing how he's used. I expected a fight between him and Colossus but that never happens here. I do like how he throws Wolverine around though and how he chases Kitty Pride around as she literly runs through walls as he just rams them down after her. The best way for the ultimate X-Men fan to enjoy this movie is to not expect a movie that's a faithful ending but at least expect a good summer movie. With so many people hating on the Da Vinci Code they'll probably be more satisfied and entertained by seeing this movie. This is a fitting end for the movies since it fits in with the tone of the other movies. But since I loved the cartoon series there's so many other directions they could've gone. Now even if this isn't the last one, I don't know how they could pick themselves up and make more. Since Hugh Jackman does kick ass Wolverine though, I do see how they could make a lot of money at least making Wolverine movies. Cyclops though got the worse end of the deal with these movies since they were never interested in developing him.",X-Men - The Last Stand
580,amit_kumar13,The worst of the Sequel but watchable,6,11 July 2007,"Why you may want to see this movie? 1) Fast paced - real fast paced, you will not even want to go to the restroom because if you do you may ask your friend about the whole part again 2) The drama just keeps you waiting for more.3) Music is just great as in the earlier Sequels 4) As people get enthralled by new technology so will viewers get enthralled by seeing new Mutants, new special affects, and new tricks on the screen.Why you may not want to see this movie?1) You wont understand some bits and pieces if you haven't watched the previous Sequels 2) You may expect some characters to be given a longer time in the movie but with countless characters you would not want to track them in the first place.. your toes and fingers may not be enough to count the number of characters.3) Too many dead people and mutants To summarize Though the movie is good and watchable for a good couple of hours and have children ogling at the screens for a long time it is not better than its predecessors.This movie still was lot more better than any other summer flicks released on the same time which was hyped about for a long time.",X-Men - The Last Stand
581,ninjathesecond,Could have been great.,6,3 June 2006,"If it ain't broke, then why fix it? If only the Hollywood people could get this into their heads. First the black costumes, then the re-hashing of all the characters. Vinne Jones as Juggernaught, with a heavy British accent, terrible. Why are they always fighting Magneto? It's like the Ninja Turtles, up against the Shredder. Are all the other supervillans on holiday or something? Phoenix was supposed to be an awesome mutant who destroyed entire worlds, and was a threat to the existence of the universe itself. But in this movie, she just walked around with a silly pout on her face. Where was the danger, the immediacy, that meant she had to be killed before she wiped out all of creation? And to make matters worse, where are all the characters? Most of them did nothing. Professor X and Cyclops were killed at an early stage, and as for the rest of them, you could have cut them out of the movie, and it would have made no difference at all. After saying all this, i feel the movie will be a hit, but only because of the names associated with it, not for the quality of the script. People will leave the theatre with thinking: what on earth was all that about?",X-Men - The Last Stand
582,potc_fan360,I DID like this,8,26 April 2008,"In this flick, a ""cure"" for mutants has been developed and the mutant world is being pressured to take the injection and be ""normal"". In this film, Kitty Pryde is being played by someone different (Ellen Page, who's gone on to make Hard Candy and Juno) and someone has managed to persuade Kelsey Grammar to take on a role where his character is covered in blue hair (which might have been difficult- who would want to be blue and covered in hair?). However, since the last movie, Jean's suppressed personality (or ""her power's personality"") Phoenix is starting to emerge and cause trouble. The X-Men are forced to fight a battle and pick a side: the humans or the Brotherhood.Please watch this film; it is good. Oh, and watch the coda (scene after the cast). It's important, I promise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
583,da_muir,Avoid,1,29 April 2015,"Apart from appalling continuity and killing major pivotal figures in the X-Universe, this whole movie has been made redundant by DoFP. Which is a wonderful thing.They had an excellent opportunity to showcase a boatload of new fan favorites and have this insane clash of mutants on an epic scale.Except it was cheese-balled. The final fight showed an army with only two powers - the power to jump really high and far and the ability to die.Why the F Phoenix was a totally unrealized character and then killed by Wolverine in the same breath is beyond comprehension.A joke of a film. Instead of brining Phoenix into her own as THE mutant and all the glorious comic story lore abounding for her - they F*&^ing killed her.Facepalm of a film is redeemed only because DoFP made it irrelevant.Totally ignorable now which is wondrous.",X-Men - The Last Stand
584,Jeff Softley,Gen-X-Men III: Mutants for the Dumbed-Down,6,27 May 2006,"To those not familiar with the X-Men comics this movie will stand as solid entertainment, with plenty of action and continuity in the storyline from the two previous film incarnations to hold their interest. It is a by-the-numbers slugfest between the X-Men, who want to protect a mutant that can drain all mutants nearby of their powers and is the source of genes used to create a vaccine or ""cure"" that the government uses as a weapon to de-power mutants and Magneto and his ad-hoc army of Gen-X skanky mutants who want to kill the boy and fight the government and normal humans for dominance.Exactly why the X-Men wind up fighting side-by-side with corporate rent-a-cops of the company that makes the virus and the US military and their plastic weapons against Magento and his army is not explored. The story is a train wreck caused by too many story tracks meeting in one place. Oh, and why cast Michael Murphy as Angel's father when he looks so remarkably similar to Bruce Davison as Senator Kelly?? To anyone at all familiar with the X-Men as characters from the comic book series, this film is a mish-mash of Gen-X drivel.We all know the story, journeyman mainstream Gen-X director Brett Ratner was brought onto the film when most of the creative elements were already set. He did a good job, considering. He's not an artist, and this film isn't art, but it's not bad - just without a soul is all.Bad creative choices were made, for example - killing off three main characters who are the pillars of the X-Men!?!? Obviously an X-Men IV will have to involve the Pheonix (Jean Grey) resurrecting and bringing back Xavier and Cyclops, and just as with time-travel movies, it is too easy an out. But there is no point in making and X-Men IV without those characters. It would not be true to the legacy of that comic to move on instead to truly lame characters like Gambit.What we got with X3:The Last Stand is the Gen-X X-Men, a whole bunch of skanky tattooed mutants who reflect the Chris Claremont influence upon the comic series.For true fans of the X-Men, Chris Claremont represents the turning point of when the X-Men started going downhill. Rogue was always a lame character, but in the films thank goodness for a truly gifted actress in Anna Paquin to give her relevance.The real X-Men were Cyclops, Iceman, Jean Grey, Angel and Professor X. The Beast was always a lame character, and the fact that the filmmakers chose to include him this time around reflects the level of poor artistic choices which went into this project. We get Angel in this film, but he's a useless presence, there simply to band-aid together story elements for the film that found their roots in the comic.The fact that the filmmakers decided to use the Phoenix storyline yet not have her character flare into the bird of fire form makes you wonder, ""why'd they bother?"" Throughout the series we've never seen Scott Summers as Cyclops really convey his leadership of the team nor use his powers in full-force demonstrating that he is one of the most powerful mutants. Why not bring Havoc, his brother, into the storyline? Havoc is one of the best characters. The Cain-and-Abel aspect to that relationship was always compelling reading, and Havoc's plasma power was cool. Bobby as Iceman is wasted as a pubescent boy beset more with the troubles of teen angst and is never allowed to demonstrate his full power until one stupid little moment where he turns all gray and icey (like a bad outtake from Terminator 2) instead of white while fighting Pyro. Where are the sheets of ice Bobby can make from the air? His power looked like a clogged snow-blower at a ski resort.The studio should just thank their lucky stars that they got Hugh Jackman for the role of Wolverine. I always hated that character, as most fans of the early X-Men series do. Jackman made me actually like the character. As written, Wolverine is like a murderous muscle-bound Bob Hoskins - and he was never the heart of the X-Men.I can see the films are going to go in the Gen-X direction of more dark story lines and skankier characters. We'll probably get that awful Gambit and Bishop in X-Men IV. (sigh)",X-Men - The Last Stand
585,wryterzblock,Was increasing Halle Berry's presence really a good idea after Catwoman?,6,26 May 2006,"Halle Berry has stated that this is her last superhero themed movie.All I have to say is THANK GOD. Storm was only cool in this movie when she was making with the lightning bolts. Such an awesome character would have been much better portrayed by someone the likes of Angela Bassett. But oh well. I wonder if she realizes that she was not the only Oscar winner in the cast? I'm sure James Marsden was thrilled that Cyclops was offed in order to placate Ms. Berry's need to be front and center.But anyway, to the movie itself. As a comic book fanatic, I will keep quiet about issues with the difference between book and film. I just think this movie tried to do too much with too little time. The script left oh so much to be desired, and a lot of dialog could be seen coming from miles away (my eyes about rolled out of my head when Kitty Pryde commented on missing the first snow back home when she was talking to Bobby). Jean Grey looked more like the world's hottest zombie than what the Phoenix should have resembled. Why Colossus was not utilized anymore than tossing Wolverine about is beyond me. Angel was an ineffective plot device. And Wolverine should never, ever be a whupped and whiny baby. Ever.Worth the money if you can watch a movie without thinking about it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
586,martine-12,The weakest of the three,5,29 August 2006,"Right off the bat you can tell that Bryan Singer isn't at the helm of this final(?) installation of the X-Men movies. The movie is a lot ""clumsier"" put together and lacks all the feeling that Singer put into the previous two movies.Quite a few of the characters are either very black and white or act out of character and the story is either too simple and obvious or to obscure and inexplicable.The actors put in a great performance but it's not enough as there's too little emotion most of the time and when there is emotion, it's so overblown that it gets embarrassing.Kelsey Grammar does a pretty decent rendition of The Beast, even in the fighting scenes (although a fair bit is CGI). Why The Beast is in the movie to begin with is not entirely clear to me though.The fight scenes are nice but they could have skipped the plot and just had 90 minutes of non stop fighting, the rest isn't even good enough as filler material.Fans of the X-Men comics will no doubt be upset over how some of the characters are re-written to fit into the movie but that's the least of this movies worries.See it if you've seen the other two or just want a decent superhero flick. Otherwise you shouldn't really bother.",X-Men - The Last Stand
587,MasterDebator5,"Ratner's film is entertaining, but lacks depth",7,27 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand Directed by Brett Ratner.Starring Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen and Famke Janssen. After two hit films about Marvel's most popular team of heroes, Bryan Singer decided that it was time to call it quits (and move on to other projects, like 'Superman Returns'). His absence is obvious, and the film suffers because of it. New director Brett Ratner (the 'Rush Hour' films) can certainly bring excellent special effects to the picture, but has a problem making a coherent story. ""The Last Stand"" is entertaining, but shallow in terms of character development.When a 'cure' is found to permanently suppress the mutant gene, there is controversy across the globe. Magneto (McKellen), fearing that this is the next step toward an extermination, gathers a group of wayward mutants and forms the Brotherhood. The antithesis of the X-Men, the Brotherhood consists of familiar faces Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), newcomer Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and even Phoenix (Janssen). Meanwhile, Xavier's men are struggling to do what's right in a world gone awry. Cyclops (James Marsden) still mourns over the loss of Jean Grey, and is surprised when he keeps hearing her voice in his head. The voices take him to Alkali Lake, where his telekinetic teammate was (supposedly) obliterated by a tidal wave in ""X2"". Cyclops is surprised and thrilled to find out she is still alive, but soon realizes that she's not the same. Jean has become the Phoenix, and her powers have become too much for her to handle.In her frustration, Phoenix ends up taking the lives of two of her fellow teammates. Magneto convinces her that she can use her powers to stop the homo-sapiens (that's us, folks) from forcing the cure upon mutants, and coerces her into joining the Brotherhood. Due to the death of two major players and the loss of Jean, the X-Men are far outnumbered. As a result, some new X-Men are given more time in the spotlight. Kitty Pride (Ellen Page), aids the team with her gift to walk through solid objects. Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) is back from the second and even gets a much-anticipated battle with former friend and classmate, Pyro. Storm (Halle Berry) also gets a bigger role, and acts as team leader. The new, blue addition to the team is Beast (Kelsey Grammar, ""Frasier""), a hairy mutant who has a place in the President's cabinet. Don't underestimate the brainy mutant, working at the White House doesn't mean that he can't trade blows every now and again (and he does, during the movie's climax).Unfortunately, some mutants don't get as much screen time as the previews let on. Angel, who is set up as a very compelling character, has about five total minutes on screen. Mystique and Cyclops, veterans from the previous two films, also had only about ten minutes each (and surely fans will be upset at the way their respective characters wind up). Some Brotherhood mutants, like Multiple Man and Juggernaut, are reduced to mere henchmen. They are just Magneto's pawns, and really don't add any depth to the proceedings.With three dead, several cured, and a few left out (Gambit, anyone?) there will be plenty of fanboys upset with the way that ""The Last Stand"" ends. Of course, with all of the loose ends not tied up (which may or may not have been Ratner's intention) one must wonder how final this last stand really is. If you're looking for a film like ""X2"", don't get your hopes up. If you want a good time watching an average blockbuster and not much else, then you should be pleased.Final Grade: C",X-Men - The Last Stand
588,uckpshh,Biggest disappointment this summer.,4,5 August 2006,"You have the A list cast back, you have a great premise, you have a budget of any high caliber summer blockbuster, you have great original material to work from, and you have one of the most anticipated movies of 2006. How was it that X3 fell short? I would argue it was the director whose vision strayed way too far from what fans would expect from the franchise.By no means am I a huge X-men enthusiast, but I'm one who respects the original material of the great minds who started a franchise. To kill off Cyclops and professor X in the first half hour in underwhelming fashion is flatly wrong. Neither of the parties are committing self sacrifice, nor are they in any way contributing to the good of mankind, they were very simply killed.The new characters are given little depth and the familiar characters are stripped of theirs. As a result, it feels as though the flow of the movie fluctuates just a little too much and a little too radically. Would this film hit the mark when it comes to the casual viewer looking for action and special effects? The short answer is yes; however, this movie will not sit well with fans of the franchise, nor will it satisfy those who were expecting more than cheap thrills.",X-Men - The Last Stand
589,lmcsharry,Wish it wasn't the Last Stand,8,29 May 2006,"I am a huge X-Men fan and I think knowing back-stores and relationships and such does make a difference to this film. Sure enough the previous two films set up the characters neatly, but having a little bit more knowledge (from the cartoon series anyway) made parts of this film breathtaking. The interplay between Magneto & Xavier hits a high point in this film  a respect was always there but the friendship element is allowed to shine through, no matter how briefly. The Beast's sensitivity  especially at his appearance is summed up in a brief scene beautifully. The underground repressed mutant community is also depicted well, and the 'racism' issue fully unfolds. The plot is simple enough  a cure for the Mutant X gene has been developed. Ideally it will be available for mutants who want to fit in, who hate their powers and want 'normality'. However, it is developed as a weapon  as the President thinking sums up  how can there be a democracy when one man can move cities with his mind? I think anyone who has seen the development of nuclear weapons and superpowers could ask the same question. But that's what X-Men is all about, telling a real story with fantastic details. What's good? Wolverine obviously, Hugh Jackman still all pain and suffering and manly swagger. You can see why he's been chosen as the first spin-off franchisee. Xavier, Patrick Stewart shows the man, shows his humanity, his helplessness, I am a huge fan. Beast, Kelsey Grammar is beyond perfect for this, his voice, his subtlety. Storm is given a bit more to do, in an attempt to evolve into the strong, proud female she is in the cartoon series. The special effects are stunning, I never saw any 'playstation graphics'  CGI so evident it detracts from the believability. The direction is great, switching from fast to slow, action to drama. What's bad? Too many characters, you will hear this critique a million times but there can be overcrowding and it's unnecessary. Rogue is awful, the character is just so dull and whiny and Paquin's accent is like a take-off, 'I'm wunnerful'?? Terrible. The side story is just doubling up on the idea some mutants would relish a cure  I think that's obvious without her teary mutterings to the boyfriend she can't kiss. There is the odd line of brutal dialogue too, Vinne Jones seems saddled with 99% of it! Mystique is underused but her moments are excellent. Magneto is a mixed bag, am I the only one who think Ian McKellum is in everything? Obviously he is a tyrant with strong views but he almost goes too far with his 'take over the world' vibe. There is a line he speaks about Xavier near the final battle that is contrary to the respect previously shown and seems to be a cheap joke. Overall, a great third installment, the emotional elements made it my favourite  and a personal dislike of Cyclops! I can't wait to buy all three as a box set. I wish there was more to come but it doesn't look like it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
590,c-blauvelt,A great premise is dumbed-down by too much action and not enough heart,6,26 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand had so much promise. It's concept was by far the most interesting to date, that a cure has been discovered for mutants, that if they so wished they could become ""normal."" Of course, Magneto fears that this is tantamount to an extermination campaign by the U.S. government, and he fears that this cure will not be voluntary for long. This storyline was initially created by Joss Whedon's innovative X-Men comics of the 90s, and what could have been such an interesting storyline in this film is watered down by the addition of too many new characters and multiple other story lines. The Phoenix Saga is explored at long last as Jean Grey is revived after her apparent death at Alkali Lake by the Phoenix force which has long remained dormant inside her. Also, we have romantic subplots with Rogue, Iceman, and Shadowcat. Many new mutants are introduced as well like the aforementioned Shadowcat, Kelsey Grammar's Beast, Angel, Colossus, Callisto, Arclight, Juggernaut, and, of course, Leech, whose ability to drain mutants of their powers is the source of the cure. I feel that Brett Ratner bit off more than he could chew with this film. All these story lines are so interesting that they could have merited films of their own and to combine all these new stories and characters in one film doesn't add complexity, but dilutes the overall narrative. There could have been more psychological complexity as characters like Beast and Rogue contemplate whether or not they want this cure to better ""fit in"" with society. I wish that there had been more explanation of whether or not it is actually cowardice to get this cure. Instead, the X-Men seem committed to protecting the rights of mutants to choose whether or not they should get this cure, while Magneto sees the cure as a weapon that can be used against his people forcibly. So what could have been psychologically complex became merely a battle between the X-Men and Magneto.Admittedly, the battle sequences in this film are breathtaking, with appropriate bullet-time slow-motion effects to allow the viewers to take in the CGI in all its glory. I felt these battle sequences were extremely well-shot. Ratner doesn't give in to the temptation to use rapid cutting to cover-up shoddy effects. I just feel that the emphasis in this film was on effects rather than heart. I didn't feel as much a connection with the characters in this film as in Singer's movies, but there could have so easily been a connection. There is such fertile ground for psychological complexity in this movie that somehow wasn't harvested. The worst aspect of this being the Phoenix storyline. Jean Grey's mental battle with the Phoenix could have been such an emotionally rich narrative, to see her struggle with her desire to unleash her caged powers despite her love for her friends and family. Instead, we don't get inside Jean's head at all, and she is merely presented as a mysterious, emotionally disconnected ""other,"" whose character is totally defined by other people's reactions to her, rather than by Famke Janssen's performance. This isn't a fault of Famke, who is truly a goddess, but of the writing.The writing is stilted, stagy, and over-theatrical throughout the film, prompting a number of appropriate giggles in the audience. I think a perfect line representative of the shallowness of the character development in this film is Juggernaut's line to Shadowcat when he reveals who he is: ""Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"" Basically, that's his only character development in the movie, and many of the other character's have equally shallow personalities and motivations. Even Magneto, the emotional heart of the first two films for me, is turned into just a deranged warlord, rather than showing how his actions are motivated by fear and the emotional scars from his past. He was never presented as an insane, monolithically evil villain, but as someone with genuine motivations for his actions. Charles Xavier could be seen as the Martin Luther King of the mutant world, while Magneto is the Malcolm X, but certainly Malcolm X is never presented as villain in our history textbooks. Yes, he adopted militant tactics for the civil rights movement, but he had genuine cause to do so. Therefore, as the first two films are about defending what makes you unique, this third film is about being given the choice to be ""normal,"" to fit in with the mainstream. Whereas to be different was a badge of honor in the first two films, the third movie is about taking the path of least resistance, not fighting for who you are or what you believe in, but just acquiescing to what is easiest. In this regard, I refer primarily to Rogue whose cowardly choice at the end of the film is presented as a triumph.X-Men: The Last Stand had such tremendous potential for being as intellectually stimulating a roller-coaster ride as the first two X-Men films, but gone is the character depth and the psychological complexity, the moody atmospherics and philosophical ruminations that made Bryan Singer's films such a rewarding viewing experience. This third film is a very enjoyable movie, but in a more superficial way. The action scenes and special effects are incredible. I'll certainly never forget the sight of the Golden Gate Bridge hovering across San Francisco Bay to rest on Alcatraz or Magneto's mutants flying in at the end to protest the insult that is the cure. It's a pretty good film that hints at greatness at times, but never follows through. What could have been a brilliant examination of the pros and cons of being different and fitting in became a CGI spectacle devoid of relatable characterizations and emotional depth. If it were any other saga, I'd say it was a good movie, but it certainly is comedown from Singer's brilliant work on the first two installments.",X-Men - The Last Stand
591,Psy33,****** X3: This is a Waste*********************,4,24 May 2015,"A really weak story. No character development. The unnecessary killing of beloved characters. This is the most bizarre application of the ""Only Wolverine can save the day concept"", which is starting to become a cliché. The idea that Wolverine could stop an all powerful being is just so stupid and unrealistic. It's unbelievable, that after two very good X-Men films the studio would allow the production of such a piece of crap. This movie was a cash grab. The fans deserved a better film and the actors deserved a better script. After the original X-Men film and X2, this film is such a waste of the good work done in those two films and the momentum developed. To the studio: next time start with a really good story and a director who knows what to do with it. Maybe consider using writers and directors who have actually read the comic books. Also, these films have some diversity regarding the characters and the actors. This is good. Consider introducing more diversity at the positions of: writer, director and producer.",X-Men - The Last Stand
592,theclash_classicrock,What the Hell?,1,31 May 2006,"Excuse me? What happened? X-Men have been my favorite comic book series (comic books, TV series, and movies) EVER! and now...just...no. no. NO! Complaint #1: They made Wolverine cry....TWICE! TWICE! You can't do that! In all my years of watching the TV cartoon and reading the comic books I don't think I've seen him do that ever and then BAM! Twice in one sitting. It was hard for me to swallow. Not only that but he was nice to Cyclops and he kept making those speeches to everyone....""we're a team"" blah, blah, blah. Since when is Wolverine a team player? Since never. That's when. Since when has he given heart warming speeches to anyone? I just don't get it. In one of the opening scenes...in the danger room. That was the true Wolverine. He doesn't care. He just lights his cigar and watches. I mean, they tried to paint him like a Superman hero. He's not. He's conflicted and gloriously twisted. It worked in the last two movies, why couldn't they keep that in this?Complaint #2: Killing off random MAIN characters. Mystique, you just don't work as a mutant...so BAM! you're not one. Xavier, you just slow things down so BAM! you're not there. Magneto you're powers are old so BAM! they're gone. Cyclops, you're a crying idiot, BAM! let's have your girlfriend kill you. Jean Grey you survived a flood, but BAM! let's have Wolverine pop his claws on ya. Dammit, no! Complaint #3: No freaking way Jean Grey is MORE powerful than Xavier. AS powerful, yes, MORE powerful, no. Also, (I never followed this story line that much) but I thought Phoenix was an alien entity that took over part of Grey's body when she was near death...not her subconscious that Xavier monitored her whole life. Also, if she was so dang powerful, why didn't she stop all the guns from firing at the mutants at the end, or stopped Wolverine from moving up to her to kill her? Complaint #4: Rogue ""cured"" herself? Since when did she do this for Iceman? My goodness it wasn't even for Gambit! Rogue is supposed to get more powers! What happened to super strength? Flying? Rogue is my favorite female X-Men character and she was absolutely RUINED! Complaint #5: I was told Comic book fans would like the thing after the credits. It did not make me feel any better. It was just wrong that he died in the first place. One of the guys in my theaters just said, ""Are you f***ing serious?""Complaint #6: The ending tried to paint everything as conclusive because it is the last in the trilogy and they felt it should have some finality. Resolution between the characters and the mutants and humans. This just proves that they missed the point. X-Men is an allegory for racism and other issues the world has with differences between people. The series never ends because these problems never end. Thus there shouldn't be that happy little feeling of resolution. Not until the world is resolved anyway. Complaint #7: I didn't think Juggarnaut was a mutant. I just thought he was really big or something... Complaint #8: Angel was almost completely pointless. Redeeming Qualities: 1) The very end when Magneto moves the little metal chess piece. Made me happy. 2) The end battle scene was pretty cool, except the whole stabbing Magneto with ""The Cure.""...did NOT make me happy. 3) Even though Juggarnaut as a mutant bugged me, the actor did a good job with him, so didn't really bug me all that much. 3) Wolverine running through the forest and killing, the way he's supposed to be. 4) Beast was good. Kelsy Grammar was perfect and his fight scene was cool. 5) Some of the lines were just classic such as Wolverine to Beast, ""Did you just call me, 'boy?'"" Great stuff there. 6) As usual the acting in the series was good. They all did well portraying the character they were given just some (*cough*RogueandWolverine*cough*) were just missing the mark on the characters due to script. I mean, Wolverine sometimes was the way he was supposed to be...but...some of it was just...no. I am usually not a picky person when it comes to my favorite books turning into movies. Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite books and I was fine with pretty much all the changes they made, because most of it was true to the characters. I just was annoyed with the liberties this movie took, 'cause I think it took too many. X1 and X2 are both great movies though, so I suggest watching those. And if you aren't a X-Men comic book fan this movie really isn't that bad. The plot is fun and the action is good...if however you are an X-Men fan (specifically a Wolverine or Rogue fan) I would suggest shying away.",X-Men - The Last Stand
593,KarisLOVER,"Not up to the high standards of the first two, but still slightly fun",5,9 July 2006,"Watching X3 was the weirdest experience for me. Everyone who knows me, knows that I'm opinionated. Not only opinionated, but passionately so; I pick a side and fight. That's why I cannot explain this completely neutral feeling about X3.I realize that the hammy story, god-awful dialog, and terrible acting should have me literally cursing the director's name, but it didn't. It was almost entertaining. All I have is a feeling, but it's there. I didn't hate itheck I didn't even dislike it.Enough with that; let's get to some of the bad parts about this movie. First off, the story in this movie is bad even for a comic book film. It's clichéd, poorly written, and boring. The storyline in the previous X-Men films have been thin, but passable. This one wasn't even close. Plus, the ending is completely contrary to the message that the writers are trying to convey.The actors are shameful. X3 has one of the most star-studded casts of the year and none of them deliver. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, both of which are always fantastic, were very forgettable in this movie. And they're the best of the bunch. Halle Berry is cringe-worthy as Storm. How did you get from Monster's Ball to this, Halle? Hugh Jackman, it seems, leaves all his coolness in his other jacket. He's gone from glorified bad to sappy and unbelievable.I'm making this film sound terrible, but I'll say it again, I actually kinda liked it. After the initial few minutes of dialog-setup, it settles into an mildly entertaining zone. The action is pretty decent. While this is no Crouching Tiger, the choreographer did the best he could.Another thing to be criticized about this movie, is the editing style. They never spend more than 3 minutes on a single scene. This bothered me. At one point, Logan is involved in, what should have been a very emotional scene. The filmmakers could have lingered a bit there, and give Hugh Jackman a chance to sell us. But instead, they cut away from it like everything else in the movie. It cheapens the moment and the style never works. Although, I just watched The Deer Hunter and it could have used a little quicker hand on the edit button I could continue to harp on the film's mistakes, but why bother? The bottom line is: This movie is the best blockbuster out there now. If you find yourself needing to see something blow up, or a fight scene, this movie could do it. Before wasting money on Mission Impossible 3 or The Da Vinci Code, give X3 a try. Keep your expectations low, and X3 might just show you a good time.",X-Men - The Last Stand
594,mitchum_unscented,still head and shoulders above the competition,8,29 May 2006,"I don't want to scare anyone off from seeing ""X-Men 3"". If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend just seeing it before you read this or any other review. It's a lot better than anything else in the theaters.That said, I found it the weakest of the three X-Men movies.They've tried to jam three of the major story lines from the comic books into one movie: the government's war against mutants, the conflict between the X-Men and Magneto's Brotherhood, and Jean Grey's transformation into the Phoenix. Plus they've added some more twists that differ from the comics. It's good material, but it's just too much to cram into a single movie and do it all justice.Also, the action and special effects have come down a notch. They set the bar high in the first movie, and then raised it in the second, but in the third they lost that edge. In the first two, they found clever ways to make small things capture your attention, like the toy on Magneto's desk that was powered by his mind, or the way Xavier froze all the visitors in the museum. The first two also had scenes you can watch again and again on DVD, like the fight in the Statue of Liberty or Nightcrawler's attack on the President. I didn't see any scenes in the third that I'd watch again and again.Finally, there are lots of new characters, but none of them are developed. In the first movie, all the characters were fresh. In the second they added Nightcrawler, William Stryker, and Stryker's son. In the third they add a ton of new mutants, but none of them are given any individuality. Magneto's army of mutants was the biggest disappointment. You expect a battle filled with hundreds of strange mutant powers, but all you get is a big fist-fight.I'm not saying this isn't a good movie. It's worth seeing, it's entertaining, and it has a solid story. I can't think of many third movies in a series that were as good as this one. I'm glad I went to see it, and I'll definitely be seeing the fourth movie when it comes out. Maybe the X-Men series will follow the pattern of the Star Trek series where the even numbered movies are the best ones.",X-Men - The Last Stand
595,Fallen_angel_kizmet,Brett Ratner not to blame,6,22 June 2006,"This film is by overall the weakest of the three. It wasn't that good, but out of all this, most people say it's because of Brett Ratner's poor director abilities. No, I do not blame him, and I don't find him and a bad director either--Red Dragon was still interesting. He made that movie much better than the book.But it wasn't his fault this movie was bad. The way many of the special effects shots were done, I was rather impressed. Also, with how the X men series was going to be done with just 3 movies rather than five, can we really blame Brett? Bryan Synger did a much better job with the first two movies, but he didn't solve much of the plot, and he left open too many damn plot holes that weren't fixable in this movie. Also, with all of the stuff Brett had to rap up and how he managed to do that much in the movie was well done in some areas.OK, on with the movie. The plot here is that now the humans have a type of antigen that can turn mutants back into people. At the same time Jean comes back as the Phoenix and is now uber evil. Also, Rogue wants to become human again so her and Iceman can get it on. Oh wait, there's more, there's this kid whose able to take away peoples powers that Magneto is bent on destroying. Is there more subplots to throw at us? You betcha'! At the beginning of the movie there is Angel who wants to become a human and then decides not to, in fact it was a subplot so lame, so useless, I wish it weren't there or maybe it could have had more of a point. I mean the whole addition of him was done so he could do some dramatic rescue in the end--yeah--and that was all. Wait! More subplots! Let's not forget that Magneto wants to start a revolution. Oh the agony, Beast is trying to support the antigen usage. Storm is now in charge of the X Men--WTF?! Wow, it's a wide ranging movie! I think this could have been better if we had a few more X men movies. The acting is good, I give some of it that. Hugh Jackman did nice on his reprise role as Wolverine. Halle Berry got on my nerves as Storm in this movie. Why you ask? Storm didn't do much in the first X men film. She barely had anything to do with the second, she a useless character, uninteresting, and now in this she's practically the main character. At least Brett kept her in, but why make her the leader? I was rather annoyed by this entry. Throughout the whole movie I was waiting for the traditional Wolverine versus bad ass and cool mutant fight... I won't say much there, but we're you as angry at this as me? Superman Returns better be good. If that's a piece of crap I will be fuggin' angry that Bryan left X3 to direct a crap ball. But don't really take my opinion on this movie, see it yourself. You might like it... Oh, and here's a salute to Fox--thanks for f*cking up one of the best mutant franchises form Marvel.6/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
596,simenkv,Over-done conclusion.,6,23 May 2006,"The final (?) movie in the X-men series was a bit disappointing. Where the two first movies were subtle and had rather good character development, this episode was over the top with silly one-liners and an endless gallery of characters that could populate a small city.The main cast, however, is overall great: Famke Janssen is stunning as the tormented Jean Grey, while Hugh Jackman is tougher than ever, and Kelsey Grammar is perfectly cast as Beast. Patrick Stewart (as always) delivers a great performance, while Ian McKellen as Magneto is good, but the one-liners he gets makes Magneto a parody of himself.In my opinion, X-men 3 lacked the finesse of the two predecessors: Magneto has become a true megalomaniac lacking the intelligent sense of logic he used to have, and where we previously were left to ponder and really feel with the characters (as in the complex friendship of Wolverine and Rogue), we are faced with an endless list of more and more powerful mutants with no function in the story, other than making Halle Berry as Storm look puny with her fog and lightning.Moreover, I felt that the violence became a bit too extreme: There is simply too much killing in this movie. Perhaps it was supposed to make the story more grave and powerful. However, the story is after all based on a comic with silly super-heroes in colored spandex suits, and violence was always very superficial in the comics. But here, bystanders and more or less innocent people are killed off without as much as a flinch.A really entertaining movie, nonetheless, but not a very satisfying conclusion to the otherwise indisputably best super hero comic-adaptation series to date.",X-Men - The Last Stand
597,chocoer,Sadly Mediocre,2,25 May 2006,"First of all this movie had a lot to live up too. The first two X-men were quite good, if not progressively better, a tall bill to live up too.The only worthwhile character in this entire movie was Juggernaut. Not a single other character had adequate screen time. A plethora of new characters introduced (Warren Worthington III a large part of the intro and then has two lines of script throughout the rest of the movie. What?), old characters completely missing without explanation, and many of the character that were apparently being set up for this movie did not make an appearance. Lest we forget Scott Summers, who finally begins to become a more heroic character, is eaten, that's right, eaten. Frasier made a good beast, incredible fight scene, only to be fowled up by a terrible line. Not to mention the fact that the script writers decided for Phoenix to be essentially on the sideline for the entire movie even when she's front and center. The only reason this movie gets a 7 is because it has the other two to stand on. If you kick out those two legs it falls completely on its ass.Go see the movie if only for (and here's the BIG spoiler), ""Don't you know who I am?

599,colunga13,I hope this is not the end of the x-men,10,21 June 2009,"I loved this movie, it had good plot and very nice dialogue. Every one seemed more powerful like Storm, because she didn't really show her strength in the first two X-movies, she seemed more motherly and consoling instead,not like in the comics but in this movie, she finally showed her strength. I also loved Wolverine her, as always, he showed himself more powerful and he was given more action scenes. Although my most favorite part was the final battle, there was so much action and I was pretty surprised that Magneto didn't die after Beast gave him something. The last scene of Wolverine and Jean was sad too. But out of all, very good movie, highly recommend watching it if you haven't seen it yet, you will not regret it. But you really have to pay attention to the movie to understand it.10/10!",X-Men - The Last Stand
600,nvivek1993,A Decent finish to a fine series.,8,22 August 2014,"I watched the final movie of the X-men saga with dire expectations.By reading the other comments i could feel all of them are little too harsh towards the new director.Of course he isn't the bryan who made the first two installments.But to completely criticize it is also lame.I feel ratner concentrated too much on the fights and showing off for different x men abilities.I liked to stress one of the points that a user comment said.The movie lacked the drama,characterization,and mainly events don't completely dot well enough.There should have been more emotional drama in the middle.Everything aside,was the movie entertaining?...Yes,that's why i can't rate it low.In spite of some disappointments the movie does keep us engaged.There is no doubt Bryan would have delivered a better finale.Still don't write off last stand.It's a pretty decent attempt",X-Men - The Last Stand
601,homey104,"""X-Men: The Last Stand"" should have been better!!!",5,21 September 2011,"After watching the first two X-Men films (Three times in a row) I had high anticipations for the third installment but after watching the film yesterday I was left in limbo and I still wonder if all that anticipation was worth it! I was hoping the film will be as good as the first two if not better, but it turns out that the film (Aleast in my opinion) is only 50% good and 50% flawed. And Here's why... Spoilers: The only things I like about the film are the action and the special effects! And the storyline involving the Dark Phoenix and the Cure is certainly a good idea (I'll give Brett Ratner credit for that), if only it was well executed than it was already been handled! But here are some things that I don't like and I bet everyone will agree with me on this one... And this involves two characters... Cyclops & Rogue. First I'll start with Cyclops... First of all Cyclops of all people suppose to be the leader of the X-Men and as mention in the first film Cyclops told the Professor while he's unconscious that he will lead them if anything happens to him. Yet in the third film Professor ask Storm to lead the X-Men and run the institute if anything happens to him and she reminded him that it was suppose to be Cyclop's position but he reminded her that Cyclops toke Jean's supposedly death too hard to even lead the team or run the institute for that matter. Later during the film Cyclops return to Alkali Lake where Jean supposedly died in the second film after hearing her voice in his head and blasted his optic beams in the lake out of frustration which seemingly causes a whirlpool and a burst of light flashes infront of Cyclops and thats where he saw Jean alive and well. Before he embrace himself on to her she ask Cyclops to remove his shades and told him that she can control her powers and his. After he remove them he open his eyes and no optic beams were shot from them and then they kiss which almost look as if Jean was absorbing Cyclop's life energy. When the Professor told Wolverine & Storm to head to Alkali Lake not only they found Jean laying on the ground but Wolverine also found Cyclop's shades floating in the air. Which soon reveal that Jean seemingly killed Cyclops with the power of the Phoenix (But dosen't directly show it). Now for Rogue... Since the first and second X-Men film Rogue seem to have a relationship with Iceman but in the third it seems Iceman was more interested in Kitty for some reasons and obviously Rogue is feed up with it. Later at the end of the film it's been reveal that Rogue has taken the cure probably because she wanted to have a chance to touch another being without absorbing their life energy. Okay first of all, and it has been mention that this was suppose to be the film where Cyclops has a bigger role than what he had in this one but I'm assuming the fact that the man who plays Cyclops (James Marsden) has scheduling conflicts with the upcoming film ""Superman Returns"" and if that is the case then maybe the film would of turn out different and a whole lot better than what was already done since this is Cyc (****ing) Lops we're dealing with here, leader of the X-Men for crying out loud!!! The man barley went done with a fight! And another thing... This the same story with Rogue who not only has been appearing in the first & second film but this is suppose to be the film where she become a full fledge member of the X-Men and learning to harness her powers and like Cyclops suppose to be joining in with the others in the final battle and extend her relationship with Iceman but apparently that didn't happen. Also it would have been fantastic if there was a Colossus & Juggernut fight. However I digress... Everything else negative about the film that I didn't mention are off of my negative list, in other words... There okay, aleast by the film's standards! In conclusion there are some good parts in the film which probably saved it from being a total failure and the flaws within the film is equally percent as the good parts that were shown and I for one feel that this third installment could have been done a lot better and Brett Ratner have & should stick to the original plan instead bastardizing a particular character just because the actor who plays that particular character was having scheduling problems with another film. Also it's been noted that this film has the shortest running time than the first two films and I feel that this film should be alittle longer, aleast completely two hours! If there's a chance somehow in the future that this film can be redone then I hope it's sooner but in the meantime, I'll stick to the first two films!",X-Men - The Last Stand
602,radiotesla2001,You Must Suffer From ADD In Order To Think This Mess Is Good,1,1 July 2006,"*** Spoilers *** Although I do not read the comics any more, it was obvious to me that the producers of this movie attempted to jam months, if not years, of plot/character development into a single 90 minute incomprehensible jumble.Jean Grey went from a total heroine in X-Men 2, to an unexplainable disaster, with only a 2 minute techno-babble spout by Professor X to lamely attempt to justify this change. I'll bet dollars to dough-nuts that the comics took months, if not longer, to effect this change. And I'll also bet that there was a h*ll of a lot more of a battle for her soul than was portrayed here. In this movie, they actually outdid ID4 for the dubious record of 'The briefest time spent on true emotion in a major motion picture'.In ID4 it consisted of two lines:""Mommy sleeping?"" ""Mommy's sleeping.""In X-Men 3 it was something like:""Professor, Save me!"" Just before she killed him. How deep. How thorough. How riveting. No Cliff Notes Required, None Needed.If you think that this passes for good movie making, then I suspect that you have never read a real novel in your life. A good movie should develop like a good novel, with real plot development, with believable reasoning behind a character's actions. Not just an impossible personality reversal for the soul purpose to set up another special effects sequence/battle, and nothing else. This movie was pure garbage. What did we get in the end? Cyclops, dead. They made him out to be a total loser. Professor X, Dead. There goes the most fully developed, strongest character of the entire series. Jean Grey, Dead, in the arms of Wolverine, and why Oh why didn't Wolverine's powers revive her as they did Rogue in X-Men? Can you say, 'Continuity Error'??????And what did we get in the End End? Why, the realization that Magneto's powers are coming back. In other words, The Cure is not The Cure, and the conflict between Humans and Mutants will certainly go on, only with a good chunk of the most enjoyable characters gone. So nothing but meaningless death happened. What a waste of time.The concepts so ineptly presented here should have been brought out skillfully over the course of 2 more 2 hour movies, not this 10 pounds of excrement in a 5 pound bag.",X-Men - The Last Stand
603,thug_thug,An overall eXcellent addition to the X-Men franchise,10,26 May 2006,"It's inevitable for fans of a book, show, etc. that's getting made in film to rebel.I too was disappointed with how they used some characters. Phoenix in particular since I got all giddy when seeing the flame-like bird in the water during the last few seconds of the previous movie.However, the translation from something to the screen can never be 100% accurate. A movie has to sell and that means that some things will have to be adjusted (a la Phoenix and her flames) which I'm perfectly fine with. They made their own representation of the characters which should please most.The worst part of this movie is the time. Everything is rushed. I mean everything. It's a shame not to see certain characters more, but considering all the eye-candy characters we do see, I, again, am alright with it.Now to the good.The effects and action will blow you away. They did the finale battle really well and many others. I also like the little things they did, like the boy flying his paper planes with his powers, and etc.The story is a bit shaky. At some points I feel like it's about a person who is resurrected... then a cure... then that person again... then - oh yeah - the cure... But it touches upon some very insightful things that I really thought about after...Fans will be turned off at some points with the lack of character time and they way they are portrayed but if you turn that 'OMG, that character isn't like it was in comic book #37,' you'll be in for a real treat.Here's hoping to another sequel.Pros: Great effects and action, interesting points. Cons: Lack of time for certain characters, a bit rushed.P.S. There's a special, but short, scene at the very end of the credits that informs us of a character not being as dead as we thought they were.",X-Men - The Last Stand
604,buckeema,X-MEN 3 is the best of the Trilogy but fails to deliver the greatness of the COMICS,6,5 June 2006,"X-MEN: The Last Stand, is a fun summer movie, but contains none of the great aspects that the COMIC BOOKS incorporated. This is a trend that can be seen throughout all the films. Every major X-MEN fan knows why the films failed. Where was the original costumes? Where was all the diverse characters? Where are the cool powers and the unique personalities that clash? Well none of these aspects are there, and that is ultimately why this film fails.Why can't these bigwig Hollywood producers realize that to make a great comic book film, all you need to do is simply copy the comic page for page, because the story boards and great dialogue are all there. I really hope one day producers realize this, instead of ruining popular franchises like X-MEN that could have ended up being great adaptations.Bryan Singer directed the first 2 films and he said he was a huge fan of the X-MEN COMICS, yet there's nothing relating to the comics at all. This trilogy is a huge disappointment to the kids who grew up reading the comics, and watching the classic 90's animated series.The only good things within these films are some of the action scenes and performances. Notably: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Famke Janssen as Jean Grey & Patrick Stewart as Professor X. Ian McKellen is a good actor, but is simply way to old to be playing the part of Magneto. Bryan Singer is planning to work on ULTIMATE X-MEN the movie, which I hope he doesn't ruin this time around.",X-Men - The Last Stand
605,thefuzmixman,succeeded in telling a story like no other,8,4 October 2006,"Fanboys/girls and Critics unite! X3 has so changed so much about the X-men universe that entire essays could be written. But should they? I view this movie in two ways- as a big action fan and as a fan of the X-Men comics and cartoon series that i watched so long ago. (i remember all the action figures I had!) As an amalgam of the two, X3: The Last Stand is an outstanding action movie that captures the heart and sole of the comic book-- it just so happens that it's story telling isn't accurately retold, rather a manifest of one person's interpretation. Obviously this leads to disputes. Many of which I've read about myself. Now, I do not pretend to know the entire history of each individual x-men character, nor do i remember much of the Pheonix saga anymore.However I do know that regarding the 40+ years that the X-Men comics have existed, including it's multitude of spin off series-- It's just not possible to make all the hardcore fans happy. How could one take so many stories and put together something that could satisfy each individual fan? To have the X-universe come to a final stand in only three short movies and accurately reproduce what the comics presented just doesn't seem feasible. Perhaps one should say fine then. Don't include something if it's only a half-way attempt. Honestly, i view little in this film as half-effort. It's more of a daring attempt to satisfy many fans and movie-goers alike in combination with the first two films. What X3 got right is capturing the underlying meaning that echoes through the comic books. Mutants aren't much different from the ordinary. Ordinary people can go bad. Something snaps, thoughts are altered and judgment fails. The conflict between Good vs. Evil is a classic tale that takes it's morals from real life and I truly believe Jean Grey was the link in the chain. Her character bridges our reality to the surreality that is the fantasy world of the X-Men. X3 realized and harnessed the power of fantasy like no other before it. Ratner understood how much potential a world where mutant abilities can exist had and put together a display of something amazing-- A mutant with mental powers so great, the destruction of anything is possible. X3 satisfies the fantasy aspect of the comic books and that should be what the main goal is. Had the X-Men comics not existed this movie would have monumental status in imagination (not to mention imagery) alone. But that isn't the case. The X-Men movies tell the an alternative story to what has already been four decades in development. To have pegged the personalities and sociality between each member of the team is a hard task to achieve. How many x- titles are in existence? Hundreds possibly Thousands? Look at what's already been accomplished in the series prior to X3. They've gotten the basics right so far, including popular love triangles and well-known grudges between characters. They have shown each main characters strength and weaknesses, even have gone as far to showcase mutant abilities with amazing accuracy. X3 does not deviate from this already set standard. Instead it backs the previous titles to showcase an even further character development. A good example of this is towards the end during the final showdown between Wolverine and Jean Grey. Logan is strong. He's been beaten and battered all his life, still living to tell about countless fights that would have resulted in certain death, even for most mutants. As he walks towards her, Pheonix is virtually ripping at his flesh. Using his healing factor he demonstrates his will to stay alive regardless of anything and his from-the-pages undying love for Jean. That was just--wow.Speaking of Jean Grey and we realize she's not actually supposed to be involved with Wolvie, rather with her husband Scott. In X3 they a do kill him off in a very unnerving way. I didn't like that scene initially but it did further the understanding of how dark Jean's alternative personality really is, so actually his death had a purpose. How evil would one have to be to kill the person you love? The sultry scene between Logan and Jean in the X-mansion was so clever. Ratner again displayed his vision of mutants well. Using her mental powers to remove Logan's belt buckle in a fit of passion. Genius. Speaking of geniuses How about Dr. Hank Mcyoy? An intellectual with words, the agility of an acrobat, the brute force of a beast. I believe they couldn't have portrayed a better version.Regardless of it's hit and misses, X3 will go down in my opinion as one of the best comic-to-movie translations of the decade. It's story telling, albeit wrong, still makes for a very compelling movie with excellent characters leading up to show downs so big, it raises the bar for all comic-book movies to come. It does have it's shortcomings but on the average the good heavily outweighs the bad so it is my opinion that Brett Ratner and all who were involved succeeded in telling a story like no other.8/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
606,rocketdive2001,An alternative choice for the fans ....,4,6 June 2006,"*Mini spoilers ahead ... but nothing too harmful* I'll admit to one thing. When i saw the trailer, I was wondering quite hard how the whole story will play out with that many characters being squeezed into one movie ... and I got to say i was quite satisfied with the end product.I read how people hated the movie ... I'm a X-men fan myself and read a decent amount to know who's who in the marvel universe from the past era. So to me, the characters put together in this movie was quite decent, I never would have thought multiple man would appear anywhere near the movie series! Anyway for comic book readers, we have so many incidents of multiple universes in the comic series, why can't we just accept this movie as one of those alternatives and just enjoy it for what's it worth! Come on, it's not as lame as you all claim it to be. I seriously think the directors and the story writers took quite a decent effort to make a story that's easy for non-comic book readers to enjoy it and also allow the fans to smile about it.Overall the experience is good. It helps a lot when you have actually watched the first two to understand the build up. Everyone did their roles justice but like some people, wished it lasted longer and had better camera angles in the fight scenes. Don't blink too much whenever it gets chaotic ... you might miss your heroes in action! I do recommend those who have yet to watch it to give it a try ... those who have yet to watch but read the spoilers somewhere to at least give it a go someday when it's out on DVD. But nonetheless, I accept that it's a decent alternative just as the many alternative re-writes of our heroes in the comic series.Oh yar, please don't leave the cinema until the credits are done. I missed it and I hope you won't!",X-Men - The Last Stand
607,Nicol_Bolas,Logan and Storm: The New Adventures of the X-Men,5,27 October 2006,"I'm really trying not to be ""That Guy"". You know, the guy who always mouths off about adaptations of his beloved book/comic/video game/etc. Who rails against any movie that breaks even slightly with the preexisting work. Regardless of how reasonable or interesting the change might be. That guy dislikes the movie for things that aren't its fault, for not living up to his personal expectations of remaining true to the original.I don't like that guy. However, I find it difficult to approach X-Men 3 without becoming ""That Guy"". I hate this movie for things that are outside the realm of the movie. I see it, and I have to compare it to the original: the Marvel Comic series known as the Dark Phoenix Saga.However, I'm clear-minded enough to be able to provide a more objective opinion: on its own merits, this movie is weak.Characters are introduced with expectations of development; you expect a character from the prologue to have some point in the story. The previous 2 X-Men movies do this with Rogue and Nightcrawler. So you expect Angel to be integral to the movie. He is in precisely 4 scenes, and you could cut all of them without sacrificing anything of value.There are two plots in this movie. One of them is about a company that has discovered a way to ""cure"" mutations and strip mutants of their powers, permanently. Magneto, quite wisely, understands that this is merely the first step towards the humans attacking mutants and forcing the cure on them. So he gathers a mutant army to deal with the cure.The other is about Jean Gray, fresh from her death in X-Men 2, and Godly powerful. Jean essentially goes insane from her powers and becomes a threat to everyone, friend and foe alike.These plot lines should cross-connect, but they don't really. Basically, they're two separate movies, one that's 1:15 long and the other that's maybe 30 minutes long. The only cross connection is that Magneto includes her in his army and sets her off as the mutant equivalent of a nuclear bomb when his attack fails.This movie could more adequately be called, ""Logan and Storm: The New Adventures of the X-Men,"" because it's really about them. Storm and Logan monopolize about 80% of all character development. It's a real shame too, since Halle Berry gives a pretty poor performance despite the material she's given. Though I don't see how anyone could come off as anything less than a jerk with the scripted line to Rogue, ""There's nothing wrong with you."" I so wanted Rogue to jump on her and drain her life, screaming, ""Oh Really?! Then why are you dying?!""As for Logan, he's dominated the previous two pictures as well, so I couldn't really expect anything different. It's just unfortunate that he has to take center stage to the degree that he does.So, plots that don't matter to one another, un/underused characters, and making it all about Logan and Storm. That, and the movie's incredibly fast pacing (due to the two plots forced together in only enough time to explore one) are the film's primary objective problems. Outside of that, it's a pretty decent action flick.Now, allow me to become ""That Guy"" for a minute, because I need to rant. This isn't the Dark Phoenix Saga. Not by a long shot.The DPS needs to hit certain marks: Jean gains infinite power. Jean is driven insane by it (power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely), thus becoming Dark Phoenix. Jean is eventually brought under control, but only temporarily. This allows Jean to examine what she has done while under the influence of those powers. Then, the containment of Jean's powers fail.And this is the key part. Jean Gray realizes that these powers will never be contained. She can't control them, and because she's human, they will corrupt her. She realizes that she is a threat to humanity, and therefore makes the only rational choice left to her: she kills herself.Jean Gray sacrifices herself willfully out of love for her friends and all of humanity. She willingly turns aside infinite power and embraces death. At the end of the DPS, it is said of Jean that, ""She could have lived to be a God. But it was more important to her to die a human.""To me, this is an incredibly powerful and HUMAN tale. That's not what X-Men 3 was. For several reasons.One, Jean as Phoenix had no character development in X3. And you need that, because the story is all about her. X3 gave Jean maybe 10-15 lines, and she says those in the first 30 minutes, before she is fully lost to Phoenix.And most importantly two, Jean does not choose to kill herself. Logan (the star of the movie) does it. She fights Logan, trying to kill him, but his healing factor lets him strike the blow. This makes it an act of murder (justified though it may be) for Logan, not an act of sacrifice for Jean. It enhances Logan's character, with Jean merely being the object of affection.At best, it could be said that Phoenix could have tossed Logan away, but Jean was restraining Phoenix from doing so. Thus, Jean may have had some choice, allowing Logan the opportunity to kill her. But that's not as powerful as Jean doing the deed herself, accepting responsibility for her own powers. Either way, it's more about Logan's feelings of regret in doing the deed than Jean.And if the story isn't about Jean, what's the point?Objectively, X-Men 3 is a 5. Subjectively, it's a 1: the brutalizing of a story that could have been done far better.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I went expecting the usual superhero movie with tight clothes and too many crap sfx. But, I have to say this movie was very enjoyable. The entire cast returns (including Famke Janssen) but Bryan Singer dropped out. The movie is actually about love in many ways. Scott is still saddened over Jean's ""death"". Storm with yet another hairstyle and the death of a well loved character is all there with loads of action. As we saw near the end of X2 jean sacrifices herself. But, she comes back as Phoenix, a darker Jean who feels the professor only wants to control her. Jean has a few new characteristics about her. Her eyes darken and her skin adapts a dead appearance when she uses her power. Storm, also having a bigger part can now fly in the movie.

It takes the fantastic x-men universe built over 40 years and through Bryan Singer's two movies and feeds it mercilessly to the Hollywood standard formula, without regard or respect to the ideas that makes X-Men endlessly intriguing. The conflicts of philosophy between Prof. X, Magneto, humans of various views show us that every side has its story and that there is no simple solution. X-Men: The Last Stand takes a giant dump on this beautiful conflict and simplifies everything to a thin gruel. The cure is absurdly handled, it hints at ""choice"" but never consequences, and motivates action without contemplation. It alters and betrays the very ideas that makes X-Men entertaining, awe-inspiring, thought-provoking.It's interesting that on this opening night, there is a 7.9 rating, with a preposterous amount of 10's, with the top-ranked reviews ranking it very favorably, only to be followed by a sea of bad reviews. Does this seem a bit suspicious to anyone?Anyway, it's a shame, on so many levels.",X-Men - The Last Stand
610,don_logan,Biggest disappointment ever!,1,22 June 2006,"This was the most anticipated film of the summer for me and just watching the first few minutes I realized that this was going to suck.The plot was awful the action scenes were cheezy and stupid. I mean perhaps it could be because of Brett Ratner considering that hes such a hack. And the Juggernaut wasn't even used for anything and hes one of the best characters in the comics.Why did they even bother with Archangel? Hes on the screen for like 5 minutes. This piece of crap is nothing compared to X2 or X men.What was Phoenix doing that whole time in that big stupid fight. I mean in the comic she swallows a planet and here she does nothing. I hope the Wolverine spin off does the comic some justice I just looked it up and its a prequel with saber tooth. I hope its good. WHO EVER READS THIS PLEASE Don't EVEN RENT IT, WATCH IT ON TV OR EVEN SEE IT ON AN AIRPLANE! DckaRD",X-Men - The Last Stand
611,Tom-AVA,Its really good..... just needs a directors cut!!,7,7 July 2006,"I was really excited and pumped up about going to see this movie as i loved the other two films. I finally managed to get to my local cinema to see it and i watched in awe.My first thought was, what the hell have they done. Then i began to ponder on it, i began to think of the jaw dropping special effects and the spectacular acting. The story was excellent and 36 hours after seeing the film, i eventually had my true thoughts on it.It is fantastic film to watch and you can truly feel the emotion of the characters. Hugh Jackman is legendary in this film and the only man who could have played Wolverine like he did. Ian Mckellan is, as usual, perfect. He does wonderful work as magneto. The rest of the cast is brilliant.HOWEVER!!!!!The movie just did not have the X-factor that the last film had. It did not retain the awesome action, or the perfect running time. Which brings me onto my next point. The film could have had another half an hour in it, at the very least. In fact you could have stretched that storyline on for another hour. That is what bothered me the most, the fact that it was so short..... and it could have been longer. I am now pleading Brett Rattner to please please please make a directors cut on DVD. I am sure that lots of people would buy it.So once again, a fantastic film, it just should have been longer. I came out thinking i was robbed of half an hours worth of film and with a horrible feeling in my stomach.",X-Men - The Last Stand

613,foxpreygaming,I'm terrified on how this movie became to be,1,28 March 2021,"From being hyped up to see juggernaut and to see him fight, I ended up being surprised by him getting defeated by a wall
Jean Grey was terrible at the very end because she could've saved Magneto from getting stabbed with a bunch mutant healing syndrome whatever it was and instead put on her stupid look and did not care what so ever
The writing was really terrible like I'd rather binge watch the entire series of me closing my eyes for 12 hours series then look at this
Overall this movie was terrible.",X-Men - The Last Stand
614,MovieMen2005,The Last Stand?,6,19 June 2007,"As a fan, I didn't quite get what I was hoping for. More of the Brotherhood and its newest members. More of Jean Grey's Phoenix and her impact, which effected almost everything. A longer movie(2 hr, 10 mins would have been perfect), which would have made everything fit. Kelsey Grammar's Beast was great, I was completely surprised. Hugh Jackman, for the third time, proved why he was chosen for Logan. And during the big Alcatraz battle, Bobby Drake, while fighting Pyro, finally became Iceman. Beautiful. But two big downers which will stay with me--Charles and Scott killed by Jean Grey, unacceptable and, without consulting the comics I believe, wrong. Same thing with Logan taking care of her at the end. If Ratner had handled the leads' deaths differently and made the movie 25 min. longer, I would have been much happier. The first movie was astonishing, and Singer never read the comics. Ratner should have been able to do the same thing, if not better. But, alas, he was obviously on medication or sleeping. If there is to be a Wolverine spin off, I pray Ratner is not on board.",X-Men - The Last Stand
615,ZombieFan,Really left a bad taste in my mouth,1,3 June 2006,"I couldn't believe what I was seeing on the big screen in front of me. Why Ratner chose this direction to take the film is beyond me. He took what we all knew and loved about the X Men and the movies and threw the rule book out the window. If he gave better cause for the deaths of some major characters and didn't just give us doubts about Why they were killed maybe I could have enjoy it better. On some good notes were great roles tailored for good actors. Grammar and Mckellan shine as Beast and Magneto and I expected nothing but the best from those two and they delivered. Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry were very underwritten in this one but some of the younger actors came out pretty good. Kitty and Iceman had some good chemistry, but Rouge and Colossus are left for nothing again. Vinnie Jones nailed down Juggernaut pretty good but Pyro didn't become the evil henchman I thought he would, he was more like a package boy. Kinda sad they didn't even seem to want to develop Archangel at all. Plus since they had Bolivar Trask as a character I really really wanted to see a couple of Sentinels walking around. Well heres hoping Spider Man 3 doesn't kill its franchise either.",X-Men - The Last Stand
616,bastiaan-rook,Brian Singer would have done a better job,10,1 June 2006,"I did like the movie, but there were letdowns. Most of the characters had almost no part in the movie. The parts with shadowcat, I did not care about it. The chemie(i don't know if this the right word, I'm Dutch) between Bobby and Rogue wasn't as big as the first two movies and it looked like rogue got instead of a big part in the movie, a semi-part. Most characters didn't got more deepness then they deserve. Wolverine's past didn't matter at all in this movie and that was a bit of a letdown.The movie itself was very good, I really enjoyed it, but there just points you just can't look away from. I hope, if there is next one, that Brian Singer is back.",X-Men - The Last Stand
617,andremarek,"Good movie, but it's definitely the worst of the trilogy",7,18 May 2006,"I saw this movie yesterday, and although I thought it was a good movie, I am sad to say that it is without doubt the worse of the trilogy.The problem with X-Men: The Last Stand is not that it's bad, because it's not. The problem is that both X-Men and X2 were so good, it had a lot to live up to; and, considering it had a new director and new scriptwriters, it would be extremely hard for it to be better than its predeceases.I found that the problems with the movie could be resumed like this: -It features too many all new mutants, and, although this is a good thing, it becomes a weakness.If you have 20 characters on an hour and a half movie (yes, it's that short), obviously there won't be enough time to develop all of them the way you would want, and here comes the weakness.Although new (I say new referring to the movies, not to the comic books) characters like Callisto and Beast receive the time they deserve, some other new characters are barely seen throughout the movie. For example: Angel, Juggernaut, Multiple Man and Arclight.Angel is an extremely secondary character, and I honestly thought he'll be one of the main ones, him being on the poster and stuff. Juggernaut is also secondary, but this is forgivable, since bad guys on the prequels were also secondary and almost non-speaking mutants. (Deathstrike, Sabretooth...) Multiple man and Arclight are cool villains, but like I said, they barely appear on the movie.-Another weakness on the movie, (this being the most important) is the scriptwriter's decision to edit out characters that were famous on the previous movies.This really made me mad, because I really liked characters like Mystique and Cyclops, and they barely appeared in the movie. The reason for this may have been that they wanted to give more screen time to Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman, that are now famous Hollywood stars.Another reason for Cyclops not appearing that much may be that the actor, James Mardsen, was also working on Superman Returns, and his schedule was maybe a little tight.Another important weakness for the movie is the music. In my opinion, music is a huge part of making what's unbelievable, believable (by saying unbelievable we're talking about a man picking up the Golden Gate Bridge, or stuff like that). The musician for the movie should definitely feel sorry for his work.Although I've spent a lot of time writing about what didn't work in the movie, there are some things that worked really great. The main characters such as Wolverine, Storm, Magneto, Pyro, Iceman, Phoenix, Beast and Shadowcat are fantastic. The scene of Magneto picking up the Golden Gate Bridge is simply spectacular. The climatic sequence is well achieved, as are most of the action sequences.Although you can't compare this with the prequels, this is a good superhero movie, and you shouldn't miss it. I rank it 7 out of 10 stars.",X-Men - The Last Stand
618,Nglas,The Best X So Far!,8,28 May 2006,"I just got back from seeing this and... WOW... I was very impressed. I loved both of the other X-Men movies, but this one finally gave us comic book fans what we wanted, which was less Wolverine and more of the others. Brett did what Bryan did not, which was throw in about ten or more mutants missing in the first two movies, even if for just a moment. The action scenes are great and the special effects were amazing, but it is the cast that really brings this movie home. I give it an 8 out of 10, missing one point due to the fact that once again Gambit was left out of the movie and the other being that there was not enough time for every Mutant to shine.",X-Men - The Last Stand
619,Kefka_8203,A decent flick...*Spoilers Ahead*,5,19 July 2006,"So, the time has come to reach the conclusion of the X-Men trilogy. one of the greatest trilogies of the last few years. So how does it fare compared to the older movies? Not so well I am afraid.The story begins with Xavier and Magneto visiting the young Jean Grey to convince her to join the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, then jumps into a near future battlefield(Which feels silly as hell since it's no real issue to figure out that it takes place in the danger room. They should have stopped the simulation the second the rockets flew through people.) Next comes some rather vain attempts at setting the mood of depression that runs through the film, which climaxes with the death of Cyclops at Jean's hands. (Remember boys, don't kiss dead people. They make you go 'poof') A series of what feels like random events leads up to the battle of Alcatraz where 6 X-men are pitted against a horde of evil orchs, oh sorry, I mean Mutants. Then we get Wolverine regenerating damage that up til then has been able to tear hundreds of people into small CGI-looking strips of..:uh...Confetti? Then the movie ends. That's for the movie, now I'll try to sum up some memorable failures.Jean Grey: Ohhhh gosh...Where to begin? Well, she's clearly intended to be a private fantasy of many pre-teen viewers of the movie more than a plot-device. Oh, and she looks bored through the entire movie, even when trying to have sex with Logan.The death of Cyclops: Throwing away a character like that feels like a waste, it had been much more interesting to see him pull himself back from depression and lead the X-Men. But at least Jean was nice enough not to ruin his glasses. Nice girl that.Death of Xavier: ...Ten times worse than Cyclop's death. Silly as heck.Angel: My thoughts: ""Cool, a new mutant"" Angel in the movie: ""Daddy I dun' wanna*cries* *goes to hide at X-men. Saves Daddy. End of Angel in movie"". Get the picture? Unused potential.Juggernaught: Only really good thing was the casting of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaught, but he gets so little screen time that he can't shine as he did in Lock Stock or Snatch.Mystique: *blinks*What the? What was her point in the movie? Rogue/Bobby/Kitty: Rogue get upsets and leaves because Bobby seems to be in love with Kitty...Bobby is surprised...And then ignores Kitty when Rogue returns? Real charmer that boy isn't he? Wolverine: Ever seen an old half-dead poodle? That is what Hugh Jackman reminds of in this movie. He seems genuinely tired, not depressed or fatalistic as the char is supposed to be. Just tired.Storm: Halle Berry is awful as always, though her badness is slightly compensated by the fact that most of the crew is even worse.Colossus: Unused potential. Need I say more? New Mutants: Cannon Fodder.Magneto: A rape of the previous movies. They've shown Magneto as utterly ruthless, but deep inside he cares for the Mutant race. Here he acts as disregardful to their lives as the Nazi's he so despises.Beast:Wonderfully played and a highlight of the movie.Summary: The movie isn't horrible, or even that bad. Really...It's a decent flick. But you know, the X-Men movies aren't supposed to be decent. They're supposed to be great. So Ratner can go shove his head in a pile of dirt and they can hire Singer again. because there ain't a chance I'll accept this as the last X-Men.",X-Men - The Last Stand
620,rickyslittlehorror,A wonderful ending to an amazing franchise,7,31 May 2015,"X-Men: The Last Stand was the final installment in the X-Men trilogy. The X-Men return one final time in this brilliant ending to one of the most prolific trilogy's of the 2000's.A cure for mutations has been found by humans, and this sends the mutant community into spiral; a third want the 'cure', a third find the cure wrong, and the remaining third - namely, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants - see the cure as the start of a war.Not many people like this movie, however, I throughly enjoyed it. I thought it was a good wrap to the movies, all loose ends were tied up and new story lines were made. New stars were shown (i.e. Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde) and yet more new mutants were introduced to the movie-verse.

621,baginman,"An Incredibly Moving, Powerful Movie",8,8 June 2016,"Directed by Brett Ratner and Starring Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian MacKellen and Halle Berry, the third movie in the X-Men Saga tells the story of the discovery of the so-called 'cure' for mutants, which leads to outrage and eventually full out war.X-Men: The Last Stand has a very different feel to it than it's predecessors. As a whole, the film received some mixed reviews, mostly due to it's lack of character development. While I understand why people have a problem with that, I believe what it lacks in character development, it makes up for with pretty much everything else.The backstory with Angel is really effective and it's a shame that his role in the film is so underplayed. There are so many interesting characters introduced in this movie, which you are not able to see much of, because there really isn't the time. It's unfortunate that they felt like they had to cram in so many characters in this film. It would have worked better if you were introduced to less of them, and therefore get to know them a little better, and maybe they could have introduced some more in another X- Men movie.I suppose you could say it has the same issues that Spiderman 3 had - The new characters may be interesting, but due to so many plots going on in the same time, you feel like you never really get to know any of them.That aside, this movie was incredible. The amount of emotion this movie has, really is remarkable. The score, by John Powell, completes this film, with beautiful music, complementing the amazing epic scale that this has. And I found the ending deeply moving and satisfying.Despite it's flaws, X-Men: The Last Stand has enough to redeem itself, and is a worthy part of the X-Men Saga",X-Men - The Last Stand

Yes, every so often, you will see a brief glimpse of the X-Men, as if you were viewing one panel of the comic, but that moment of brief recognition disappears before your eyes as the director and writers distort the image into something alien and foreign to the X-Men series.Absolutely nothing in this film makes sense. Nothing falls neatly into decades of X-Men mythos. It is all one great incongruity that has no place in the X-Men universe. ""This"" Dark Phoenix arc has absolutely no foothold within the comic lore.

623,wadetalon,Xmen 3 what the hell happened,1,25 May 2006,"Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of the whole x-men story be it comics or movies. The previous two X-men films were great movies, the x-men world was translated brilliantly by Singer and his team. What I want to know is what the hell happened that made this movie so awful when the studio had two solid films like xmen 1 AND 2 to use as reference on how it should have been done. This movie seems to be an attempt to wipe any decent work that has been done by Bryan Singer and Tom De Santo on the previous tow movies.The Characters in this film had only a slight resemblance ""character wise"" to the previous 2 movies they don't seem to be invested in these parts as much as they used to there is no chemistry in this movie between the teams like there was in the first and second xmen movies. Wolverine didn't have any of his usual lone wolf characteristics that he always has (Thats what Wolverine is a loner who finds it difficult to work in a team he will always be this way thats why the audience like him a lose cannon willing to do whatever it takes). Storm only received a larger part in this movie because Halle Berry was playing her, the Oscar made sure of that. That said I'm not the biggest fan of Berry but she was probably one of the only characters i liked in this piece she showed she can take on a role that doesn't need her to show some skin for a change.Then there was the rest of the x-men who seemed to be just thrown in for the sake of having people to fill the holes left by cyclops,jean Grey and the much missed Nightcrawler (His opening scene in X2 made the film for me) I mean Colossus was only there to use for the two scenes were he hurls Wolverine around (a.k.a the fastball special)he barely has any screen time outside of these two scenes. Shadowcat was interesting in parts but was a weak substitute for rogue in the love interest stakes for Iceman I mean come on ! she looks 12 in this movie Rogue is practically a fully grown woman at this stage. Kelsey Grammar was all well and good as beast but he just never really looked comfortable in the blue fur suit. Why did Xavier become such an arrogant ass in this movie?. He is the symbol of tolerance and understanding in the X-men verse and in this movie we see him tell Wolverine that he never has to explain his actions to anyone least of all him.!!! way to go with the words of tolerance Chuck! good job. I can see why Brett Ratner was so worried about filling in for Singer the studio had already gone through three directors before they got to him the cinematography was poor and the editing choppy the whole look are the film just didn't meld well. And Tom DE santo was sorely missed in the writers chair.where do these new writers get off dramatically changing characters like rogue and Cyclops the way they did in this movie. Did Anna paquin not want to come back for another x-men movie ?...is that the reason for her being just a shadow of her former self constantly sulking around in the background moaning about not being able to get it on with her boyfriend, that character is one of the strongest in whole scheme of things and they just wipe her out of the picture. As well as the excellent Mystique one of the best characters in the bad guys camp her role was filled in by the wooden Pyro who was a whiny kiddie substitute much like the rest of the young cast. This doesn't look good for future Xmen projects. Are we going to have to sit and watch a whole new team of young Xmen in X4. With no adult guidance? just there youthful wit and good looks to keep us interested please God don't let this be true. I have heard from a very good source that used to work for Marvel that this is what is being planned, A whole new team of xmen will be in the next movie once they get through two wolverine movies first.I could go on about this all night but at the end of the day I'm just gonna come off sounding like a whining fan boy, which believe it or not I ain't. I'm just angry with the fact that Fox allowed this to happen to a great franchise. A franchise that started the whole comic book movie craze to begin with, and in my eyes has just hammered the first long rusty nail into its coffin. Save your cash stay away from this pile of crap save your money for something else....I know a ticket for Superman I'm sure it will put a smile on Singers face .",X-Men - The Last Stand
624,jessiedhondt,confusing,9,27 May 2006,"I think i'ts hard to give a proper rating because I really don't know what to think of it. I mean, I liked the movie very much but it was so totally different from the first 2 films. I mean, if this is destined to be are future, it doesn't look very promising does it. ;-) I was totally exited about X-men: the last stand, until Cyclops died. I mean, I still enjoyed it but I was really confused. I kept thinking: ""Oh, he will come back. One way or the other..."" Because I have to admit that Scott was really me favorite character. But he wasn't coming back, and it was so sad. By the time Xavier died, I was crying my eyes out. It's almost 24h since I saw the film and I'm still sad about it. I feel really weird, like totally dark about the future. Not that I really believe that Mutants exist but...It's just, the first film had hope at the end but this one...Totally black.

625,FilmFanAndReviewer003,A Solid And Worthy Installment Into The X-Men Franchise,7,27 May 2006,"Despite having mediocre to low expectations of the latest (and allegedly final) installment of the X-Men film franchise, I made it a point to see it opening day. Despite the fact the super-director Bryan Singer dropped out of this one for ""Superman Returns"" and was replaced by ""Rush Hour"" director Brett Ratner, I am happy to say that ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is arguably the strongest film in the X-Men trilogy.The story picks up a little while after the events of the previous film. Scott Summers (Cyclops) is still recovering from Dr. Jean Grey's death at Alkali Lake, while the other X-Men are preoccupied because of a new Mutant Cure that has been developed on Alcatraz Island by a major pharmaceutical company. The President calls upon Secretary for Mutant Relations Hank McCoy (Beast) to help assuage the inevitable mutant-human conflict. Menawhile, Magneto is busy creating and recruiting for his mutant army, the Brotherhood. However, things get complicated when Cyclops suddenly disappears after a visit to Alkali Lake, where Storm and Wolverine find Jean's body. However, Professor Xavier warns that it may not be Jean at all, but her alter-ego, the Phoenix, the most powerful and unstoppable mutant on the face of the planet. It all leads to tragic deaths, amazing action, and an emotionally-charged, heart-pounding climax.The film has its flaws, mainly the handling of the Phoenix story (not a faithful adaptation of the comics). It also completely ignores the subplot of Wolverine's past that was building up in previous two films. Also, some of the characters that were heavily publicized in the commercials and trailers barely get even five minutes of screen time (namely ArchAngel). All that aside, however, this is a solid and worthy ""conclusion"" to a phenomenal superhero film franchise.Rating: ***1/2PS: There is a short post-credit sequence. I'm not going to give any spoilers away, but all that I will say is that it does sort of alleviate some of the emotional impact that the film had.",X-Men - The Last Stand
626,captrose,short review of Xmen 3 (with a few short spoilers),8,7 October 2006,"I give it an ""8"". I enjoyed it and thought it was good. Let me back track a bit. As much as I thought Singer's first two were good, there wasn't a whole lot of action. Every where I went online they kept talking about how brutal Wolverine's fight in X2 was. I kept asking where this brutal fight was. One long yell and a few swipes was about it. I like Singer, don't get me wrong. Let me state that again, I like Singer and what he started....Now here comes the big smelly ""but"" But (told you) after seeing X3, I felt like I had finally gotten what I wanted. Lots of action. Maybe a few too many cameos, but those were only for the fan boys. You could ignore them if you wanted. The main negatives were Halley Berry returning, the early death of a major character (that I kept expecting to show up, but didn't) and the fact this might be the last one. Look, I'm not a real big fan of Ratner, but he did a fine job. It's got action, lots of action. And that's something that a comic book movie should have plenty of. Singer's seemed like teasing after this. He laid the foundation but never finished the building. Now, after seeing Superman Returns, I'm beginning to wonder if that is just a flaw of his style. But I digress...If you like the comics or the first two, then you should like this. If you don't, then why the heck are you reading comments for it? I'm not going to convince you to rent it it you've not seen the other two.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The lines were told at the perfect time, the acting was on par and the special effects were right up there where they should be.For the 1 hour and a half this movie has lasted everyone embarked a ride they have enjoyed throughly and to the end.

Several MAIN characters meet their demise in this film. Ratner, or possibly those who are responsible for the script have gone pretty far wrong. They don't really get it.Yes, there are moments of the heart that the other two films had (Logan and Rogue, Angel and his father...etc) but the need for corny potty humor were generally unnecessary.The plot was insightful, but wrong for the universe. The action was amazing, the special effects stupendous, and quite surprisingly after I got over the ""AH! That's Fraiser, feeling""...Kelsey Grammar was quite a success as the blue, fuzzy Hank McCoy.In the end, this is a disappointment as a sequel. It lacked the hope that I should have.

629,DonnaGraysonDotCom,Okay Sci-Fi,7,25 June 2006,"X-Men The Last Stand is a good Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi movie. The special effects are pretty interesting. And I can see how Ian McKellen can go around saying that this is a movie he personally relates to.Even though I really like Sci-Fi, and I have seen the previous X-Men movies, I am really not an expert on X-Men. Basically, the Mutants are fighting for their right to remain Mutants. A ""cure"" has been discovered and they don't want to be forced to take the Cure.But the only character I could sympathize with was Angel, played by Ben Foster. This was really the only character in the movie that had any emotional depth. Even in a sci-fi movie, I like to have some sense of who the characters are.The scenes where the Mutants are fighting are pretty good, and with good special effects.And Of course, there is always Hugh Jackman - who is so good looking whatever role he is playing.",X-Men - The Last Stand

OK if she does this thing then the ""good guys"" will die and be the losers.

Filled with corny lines and every cliché in the book. How did this script get approved? All the main characters are reduced to non-roles namely Cyclops and Rouge. Ben Foster who I was excited to see as Angel has no point in the movie what so ever and is introduced to the audience without an explanation and practically no dialogue from Foster. Hallie Berry won an Oscar? This movie and the laughable ""Cat Woman"" make me wonder how that happened. The acting on this one was very below par. It was only and hour and forty minutes but it seemed SO much longer. The ""story"" dragged and only picked up at the end with the action sequence that to me at least did not seem as ""action packed"" and exciting as other have been saying. Also they moved the Golden Gate Bridge at daytime then like a switch it turns to night? Guess I have to add bad editing to the list as well. What this movie needed was the character driven story of the first two movies and not this crap.",X-Men - The Last Stand
632,Nico2000-nl,Crap...!!!,2,17 November 2006,"There's only one word for this movie... CRAP...!!!!Not because the action scenes aren't great. Not because the special effect aren't great. Not because we see our beloved Mutants, (good, or bad) display some neat new tricks. Not because of the excellent new mutants introduced, (superficial as it may be). No, because the makers of this movie displayed the shear audacity to kill off 50% percent of the main characters. How dare they...!!! Characters that have enchanted us for decades in the marvel comics and even some more, or less successful movies before this Hollywood gutter product. How dare they...!!!Because they couldn't be bothered to develop the character of Phoenix. Because of the pathetic duel between Iceman and Pyro. Because of the poor and totally inadequate ending. And what's with this 5 seconds at the end where we hear the voice of Charles...???CRAP... !!! (excuse my spelling, not my native language).",X-Men - The Last Stand
633,mooncheese_4,Cool film but not as good as I thought.,8,25 May 2006,"I am a big fan of the X-Men comics and cartoons and was looking forward to this third installment because of the success of the last two films. As most would know the movie is directed by Brett Ratner (Rush Hour & After the Sunset) because Bryan Singer chose to direct the new Superman movie.This film has a great plot and plenty of action, however it is disappointing to see that some characters from the first two films have very small parts and even the new characters were not portrayed as well as they should have been. The film though has it's highlights including some jokes and it is great to see that actors such as Kelsey Grammar and Vinnie Jones are doing something different in the film industry.",X-Men - The Last Stand
634,davidhicks-1,Action from start to finish,7,3 June 2006,"This movie does not disappoint where action is concerned, also it has themes of tragedy, love and comedy. The film is basically about a discovery of a cure for mutants, with some mutants wanting this cure and others not, it starts a war between mutants and non-mutants. It's up to the X Men to stop this war. About half way through this film when the war begins it is non-stop action. I think even though it is exciting and dramatic it doesn't resemble a classic X Men film in my opinion. A lot of the classics you would expect such as many of the classic characters do not have much of a parts in this film, leaving many newer characters with bigger parts. The film is very much based on the idea of war and I'm my opinion has a good and unexpected story line. With action left right and centre, this film is definitely one to watch and will have you on your seat all the way. In my opinion this film is not a classic X Men film but still a really great film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
635,andrej-zupanic,A great finale of the best MARVEL adaptation ever,8,26 May 2006,"X-men developed the characters, X2 did everything right what was made wrong in the first and The Last Stand finishes the story that was developing throughout all three films. And that is how we have to look on the final installment of the great trilogy.Brett Ratner had a very difficult job finishing what Singer started, but I think he did it better than expected. The movie sometimes really lacks in the story, but we can forgive him that, because the action scenes and the visual effects are almost flawless and through the film we have funny moments that are making such a difficult theme as war very enjoyable.We might see that the Ratner's favorite character is Wolveine, but so was Singer's and that's why I think Ratner was the ideal choice as Singer's replacement. Of course he tries to develop also other mutants, but since the length of the movie is less than two hours, it is almost impossible to develop twenty or more other characters. His decision was to develop the characters that were the most important ones for this film and even here, despite a few miscalculations, he made a very decent job.The Last stand is action-packed from the first to the last second. It has the elements in it, that the first two didn't have. The dramatic moments are quite a few and are really helping by the suspense of the film. Basically, forget Spider-Man, forget Fantastic Four and most certainly forget Hulk, because this really is Marvel's best adaptation ever.Even though it is a sci-fi action adventure we can find in it many problematics that we can find in the real world. And here is when surrealistic things in the film get very realistic and the film directly absorbs us in.If you really liked the first two, the third one is going to bring you further into the world of mutants and it really won't let you down. It has all the first two had and even more. The only thing I am still missing in the film is Gambit, but this is the writer's and director's decision. But there is still an option of making the fourth one, despite what the title says. Just watch the film till the end of the end credits and you'll understand.All in all, the film has its bad and good moments, but Ratner did a really good job by filling the gaps in the screenplay and therefore I'am giving this film nine from ten stars, because it really is an emotionally packed action bomb that at the end really explodes.",X-Men - The Last Stand
636,fotw,I hate kids!,3,26 May 2006,"I just saw the Bulgarian pre miere of X-Men 3. It's such a colossal let-down that I am unsure where to begin.Now I remember enjoying X-Men 1 and 2 when they came out. Especially 2. I don't remember what it was about but I remember the plot making sense which is a whole lot more than ""The Last Stand"" has to offer.1) If I had a dollar for every time a character said something totally predictable and stupid while heroic music was playing in the background, I'd probably have like 5 dollars. My personal favourites include but are certainly not limited to: ""I hear the's a shelter for mutants here?"" Dr. Blue Dog-like thing : ""There was, son... there was..."" A victorious anthem starts as Holly Berry utters with forced pathos: ""And there still is!!!"" Speaking of Dr. Blue Dog-like thing - how the hell did he became a doctor? What kind of university did he attend exactly? The kind where being blue is nothing to raise eyebrows to.2) Oh, yeah - I loved the little story around Rouge. It's always been my dream to see X-Men and Dowson's Creek mixed together. Oh.... wait... no, it hasn't. In fact, It was a total waste of screen time.3) ""Cure"" weapons and people disintegrate have got to be the two most pathetic substitutes for bloodshed every devised by mortal man. Now, the previous installments were engineered for kids as well but they still weren't this ridiculous.4) That angel guy you've seen in the trailer has no more than 2 lines and 3 minutes of screen time. I think it goes without saying that he was totally irrelevant to the plot or anything at all for that matter.5) The plot-line was apparently concocted in less than 30 minutes: ""Hey, guys let's bring back the psychic chick from the dead without every explaining how. We'll give her split personality despite it being at odds with the previously established character."" ""Oh, cool - I got another idea too, I was watching Dowson's Creek yesterday..."" I think you get the point.6) A lot of events contradict anything that's got something to do with sense. So many many, in fact, that I won't mention a single one.7) There were lots of other thing wrong with X-Men 3, but I'm way too lazy to write them all down. Let's just say this movie makes cool characters be uncool.",X-Men - The Last Stand
637,invincible_irvine,A frightful tertiary installment...,8,30 May 2006,"This is the first of the now three X-Men movies I watched in a theater. From what I saw on TV and word of mouth from the few people I know that watched the movie, I was expecting this installment to be different from the first two.I was nowhere near to expecting the developments that Brett Ratner and the producers of this film would give us, though. Without giving away the major events, I'll just say that by the time the movie ends, two of the franchise's key characters don't live through to the end, and three others have their lives changed in a radical way! As with all of the movies in this franchise, each scene is meticulously planned and filmed, and it shows. Though it wasn't helmed by Brian Singer, Ratner did a very good job in maintaining some semblance of a workable plot.This movie took a far darker role than what I was expecting, and I am honestly surprised the film received a PG-13 rating; much of the graphic violence would have garnered an R rating just ten years ago. And the dark plot development, particularly with the return of Jean Grey, was a shocking turn of developments.Overall, of course, I was impressed with the good use of diverse characters; Kelsey Grammar was a surprisingly good addition, although I had no hint of an idea what his mutation was until the final battle of the film. And it was good to see more screen time for the more well-known mutants from the comics we saw only hints of in the previous movies. Lastly, anytime Rebecca Romijn is lying naked on the floor is a good scene! I would recommend watching the second movie before watching this one for the sake of character development.",X-Men - The Last Stand
638,Syndicateman,Xmen 3.... Awesome action but character development?,7,26 May 2006,"This is a great movie. Not because it's a good movie movie but because of the insane amount of action. I'm not going to lie, the action makes this film. Unlike the previous two movie, people ACTUALLY get killed and they get killed in extravangant ways. The action was good and it would've been good with the previous director. This movie was VERY creative. But... The characters. Sure, the X-storyline is VERY confusing but the plot can be summed up. Just don't forget to add character development. There were many scenes where characters started to have issues and then later in the movie after the main crisis, all those character issues, AREN'T RESOLVED. NONE ARE. ESPECIALLY the one with Bobby Drake/Iceman. The last 10 minutes seemed rushed. Like they ran out of money and just wrapped it up. Thus because of the lack of an ending, the X-men Trilogy MUST now become a multi-movie franchise that I could've done without.Kudos Mr.New Director. Just don't forget to read the comic books next time and watch a chick flick or two to find out WHAT drama is. Thankyou goodnight and goodluck.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Anyone who has seen the movie, read the spoilers, or has a loud mouth friend who has seen it, can tell you that 3 main characters died. I stayed until i saw the credits, but I hear that there was a different ending?? None the less, where was nightcrawler? Anyone..Anyone..? Kind of odd, and i know they do that in a lot of movies, but in X2 wasn't he considered a ""main character."" Seemed like they rushed through to the fight scenes, and trust me I love the fight scenes, but if I'm gonna pay almost $9 bucks, give me some substance. So, if you plan on seeing it, don't expect to see anything like the first two, go with a more open mind, and expect to see some of the characters die?!?",X-Men - The Last Stand
640,darthheimdall,X-men: The Last Slouch,4,5 May 2007,"I saw the first X-men movie on F/X. Aside from a few nitpicks (not enough Sabretooth), it was very well done. Only saw the last hour of X-2, but what I saw was brilliant. Both of those were in a whole new class than X-men 3.Plotwise-Ratner should know that it is impossible to juggle two major plots in a movie that's only one hour and forty minutes. Furthermore, in the ""cure"" storyline, it was like they copied lines straight from the gay,lesbian, bisexual and transgender movement (i.e. ""They're treating us like a disease?""). Regardless of your views, it is never a good idea to blatantly copy and paste a major movement so obviously that it ruins the narrative. The Dark Phoenix story arc is completely butchered-Jean kills Cyclops, dryhumps Wolverine, kills Professor Xavier, then stands around looking bored for the remaining hour of the movie, until Wolverine kills her in the cheesiest way possible (""I love you""-stab!). Oh, and all the major confrontations at the end (Iceman versus Pyro, Wolverine versus Magneto) only last about five seconds each. All that build-up for nothing.Characters-Cyclops gets killed in the first 15-20 minutes. This was completely ridiculous, considering that Cyclops is, for all practical purposes, the leader of the X-men. The fact that Wolverine, who HATES Cyclops, is the only one who cares, makes it even worse. Beast is brought in as a welcome addition, but all the other newbies (Angel, Juggernaut, etc.) are so poorly developed that one wonders why they were put in the movie in the first place. The returning cast (Wolverine, Storm, Jean, etc.) manage to put on great performances in spite of the lousy screenplay.Special Effects and Setting-Good, but the other aspects are so poor as to render these icing on top of a burned McDonald's pastry.Dialogue-There are some good one-liners (When Wolverine fights a guy who can grow arms, he finally just kicks him in the nuts and says ""Grow those back!""). But overall, nothing special.Overall, this movie is simply not worth the time to watch, because Ratner did not put in the time required to make it good. Hopefully, he will not be allowed anywhere near the Wolverine and Magneto spin-offs.",X-Men - The Last Stand
641,S_Rhea,Did some of you even see the same movie I did?,4,27 May 2006,"I am honestly baffled how some of you were satisfied with the movie. Certainly there was potential, but to say that it merited 7+ stars is ridiculous in the extreme. Have you come to expect so little from Hollywood that anything that offers you meaningless action sequences with no character depth or story earns your approval? I was immensely pleased with the first two movies. This one...not so much. It felt like the plot could better be summed up as ""hey, let's go fight over here! Now let's go fight over here!"" Very little care is given to story or to character dialogue, focus or continuity. There are entirely too many characters and not enough time spent with any of them (with the possible exception of Storm). Professor X's conversation with Wolverine in the infirmary and Magneto's reaction to Mystique's transformation are examples of how Ratner just doesn't ""get"" the characters. Gone are the clever quips, the speeches all sound cheesy, and the tragedies almost superfluous.I purposefully dodged reading reviews or watching material before I saw the movie. I didn't want any preconceptions going in. I will admit to being very nervous when I heard that Singer was out and Ratner was in because I knew the whole Phoenix thing was a delicate story to have to work with and nothing in Ratner's portfolio suggested to me that he knew how to be delicate with anything. Sadly my misgivings were justified. I wanted to like X3. As a fan of the whole X-Men franchise since I was a teenager, I probably would have been willing to overlook some of the flaws were the director's touches not so gratuitously ham-fisted. It's not that it's a BAD movie. It's just not a great one...and it's not even a good one for a discriminating X-Men fan.I will echo what has been said elsewhere...Singer better present us with a masterpiece with Superman, because he really did drop the ball in ditching X-Men and whether or not he had a direct hand in its failure, I hold his decision at least partly responsible for the outcome of this movie. Maybe that's not fair, but there it is.",X-Men - The Last Stand
642,BTRALover100,The only trilogy ever that got better with each one,10,26 May 2006,"Have you ever gone to a movie saying to yourself, ""Well, it's probably not going to be very good, but I'll give it a shot and try to be entertained."" This is probably how many will feel going to this movie. After the second movie improved on the first, it would be ludicrous to think they could keep moving up. Well, they did.***** Possible Spoilers Below *****Here are just a few reasons why this movie moves beyond great entertainment and into classic.First, people die, and not just the ones you expect or the ones that you don't care about.Second, it defies expectations. Anyone with a firm knowledge of the X-Men Universe (and I am not such a person, but have the beginnings), can probably guess that they are not going to bring in aliens with a Pheonix saga or mysticism to rationalize Juggernaut, but when a certain mutant actually loses his/her powers (I didn't want to spoil too much), I was surprised for the first time in a long time at a movie. A little disappointment follows when a certain other mutant starts to possibly regain powers, but apparently they didn't want to rely on too much originality of villain in the next one, which there is most likely to be if only as an aside on individual characters.Third, I, like many fans was a little disappointed in the choice of Beast. Well guess what. Just about everyone involved in this film puts forth a good performance (possible exceptions include Pyro overplaying the bad guy part, some porcupine character, and the underemotional part played by what should have been a key role in the mutant power removing child whose name I can't even remember due to a stand where told and say what your supposed to performance.). At one point in the movie, I forgot who was behind the Beast mask.Fourth, it actually manages a plot in a somewhat rushed experience. I was expecting a somewhat longer film. In fact, if there was a negative, it was the 13 minutes (yes 13) of previews I was forced to watch before the actual movie began.I could keep listing reasons, but I think by now you can get to point.Oh, one last point. I keep an ear on the family friendly reports by certain parties with a religious following. Well, there is violence in this movie, but it is done in a way that could easily have been gored up, but wasn't. Furthermore, the language is soft. In general good triumphs at a cost. In so many ways, this movie is family friendly, and yet many reviewers will tell you otherwise. I have a feeling that they are too (well, too something) to accept a character named Angel and can't get past the association of special powers with magic to accept that this is a family friendly movie. Yes, there is a bit of sexual tension and violence, but they resist going overboard, and present it in a proper light.",X-Men - The Last Stand
643,remyarcher,Dark Phoenix!! Fastball special! Juggernaut! Beast!,9,29 May 2006,"First, this movie was much better than I expected! Had a lot of tense emotional moments that caught me off guard - in a good way. I'm not understanding why fans and norms alike aren't liking this film?!?! What more can be done? The good guys won. They paid a heavy price, but they won! Any fan of the books KNOWS that every member of X-Men has died at least ONCE and no death in the Marvel Universe is ever final....so why get upset becuz Professor X 'dies'?? I thought that was bad-azz!! What I loved about the movie: Jean Grey obliterates Professor X! Wolverine/Colossus 'fastball special'!, Juggernaut, Storm toughens up, Magneto as always, Mystique, Beast!I looooved watching Jean Grey go absolutely apes##t evil and damn near destroyed the world. In the story 'Dark Phoenix' she actually threatens to consume the entire galaxy! Of course, they had to downplay that for the movie. My only major disappointment is the exclusion of GAMBIT!!

644,kim-andrewj,A good culmination of the X-Men Trilogy,9,29 May 2006,"I saw this movie on opening day with a friend of mine, and I thought for such a short movie (1hr 30min) it managed to keep me and the rest of the moviegoers interested and despite minimized roles for certain usual cast members it went smoothly. The action is fast-paced and visually stunning. Brett Ratner did a good job considering he took the helm in the middle of production, and there were no obvious inconsistencies with Bryan Singer's X-Men and X2. And that little YouTube snippet near the end of the film had me rolling with laughter. Not to mention the suspenseful cliffhanger at the end.Overall, great action thriller.My only complaint: ""Where's Gambit?!""",X-Men - The Last Stand
645,Lego_Darth,Just doesn't hold up,8,15 August 2006,"Sorry, but the third X-Film just isn't as good as the first two. But, that doesn't mean that it isn' t good. Ratner's spin on the X-Men is more CG driven than character driven, but he still provides good plot in a fast-paced style that's not horrible, just different. However, the sub-plots overtake the main story and ruin what would have been decent pacing. The Kitty Pride story is a good subplot that provides a good arc for both Iceman and Rogue. However, some emotional sidelines never feel quite completed or adequately put together. The death of Xavier would have been great had the funeral scene been thrown away. It didn't have the emotional gravitas that would have been needed to make it worth the time. Also, the death of Cyclops was just simply pushed aside by plot. However, Ratner succeeded in bringing an excellent climax worthy of a much better film. Logan's near sacrifice to ""save"" Jean is gripping and moving. He, Ratner, moved the trilogy in a different direction but in the end he held true to Singer's vision. You can feel Logan's pain and Jean's relief as she dies. It is beautiful. I think this film has been unfairly cast into the pit of bad. It deserves more respect. Ratner just isn't as good a director as Singer; our expectations were dashed was all. The bar was set high, sadly, higher than Ratner could reach is all. It is definitely worth watching.",X-Men - The Last Stand

This really was good from the danger room bit at the start up to the final confrontation. My favourite bit had to be with iceman and pyro when iceman final looks like ice I have been waiting for that to happen for ages. Also having beast, angel and collosus in it was fun. Vinne Jones as juggernaut was a bit strange but can easily be forgiven as he made me chuckle and wasn't really in it for very long. Also the shocks in this film really did shock me especially cyclops.

649,MonkeyDonut69,"Mostly absurd, made me think I wrote the script",6,3 June 2006,"When I see a movie like X-Men: The Last Stand, I am often left contemplating who to blame for why the movie was so lousy. Was it the writer's fault for writing such a terrible script, or the director's fault for the terrible flow of the movie? I think in this case, both parties are to blame and should be punished accordingly.The movie appears to start to take place several months after the death of Jean Grey, with Scott Summers (Cyclops) having an intense amount of trouble getting over her death. Also, the government has discovered a mutant with the ability to reverse mutations and has begun a process of making a drug hailed as a ""cure"" for the mutant community. Also, Magneto is planning on launching a full-scale war against....um...the human race as a whole I think...not sure what his intentions really were beyond terrorism and being an overall general nuisance. Also, Rogue is upset that she can't make out with her boyfriend, so she thinks about taking the ""cure."" Also, Wolverine tells jokes and generally acts silly, except when he cries when thinking sad thoughts. Also, Jean Grey has returned from the dead randomly, except she is struggling with an inner consciousness not previously mentioned that threatens to take over her being and destroy the world. Lots of things start happening all at the same time, resulting in death of some characters, confusion by the audience, and disillusionment of the entire series.As with the last two Matrix movies, I am planning on simply believing that this last installment never happened. I can count on both hands the number of times people in the theater dropped dead after receiving a brain-damaging blow to the skull from a cliché mallet. I have never laughed out loud at the absurdity of a statement made by a character in a movie when the statement was not intended to be funny or silly; the only way to really explain it is that the dialog in this movie is ridiculous. No one would ever talk like the people do in this movie. Ever. Ever. Normally, I would say that no one would even write somewhere that people would talk like this or that a director would even think about making an actor say the things that are said in this movie, but obviously I would be wrong.Also, the plot is...um...yeah. If you were a mutant watching this movie and you had the ability to infer what was going on or what had just happened and the reasoning behind it, then you would probably be okay. Normal people without psychic powers or the ability to completely suspend disbelief over simple things (simple reasoning, the space-time continuum, how the sun sets in everywhere in the world and how long that takes,...um, why anything happens at all in this movie) will be in deep trouble...assuming they aren't a mute vegetable.In conclusion, I saw the first movie in the theater and enjoyed it immensely. I saw the 2nd movie in the theater 3 times and bought the DVD. It's a good thing I was on a date with a hot date when I went to see this third movie or my entire night would have been a complete waste. The only consolation there is that my date didn't speak English very well so she wasn't too mad at me for wasting her time and taking her to a silly movie. Oh, and the popcorn was good, too.",X-Men - The Last Stand
650,krnkd5,Is anybody else upset?,6,27 May 2006,"First, let me say that I am a fan of the Marvel Universe, though I have not read any of the comics.1) I was disappointed with X-Men 1 because it had to explain a lot about the Marvel Universe and subsequently was kind of slow. Xmen 2 disappointed me because they were still stuck on a plot revolving around Magneto and another one of his attempts to destroy mankind. Surely, I thought, the third installment would not repeat the same basic plot and use only a handful of the mutants over and over again--after all, Psylocke was supposedly gonna be in it, and Angel was featured in the trailers. To an extent, they did broaden the scope of mutants used (Colossus, Beast, Juggernaut, etc). Still, it would have been simple to include more mutant powers during the many fight scenes.2) The Phoenix was not done well. There was not enough emphasis on the battle going on between it and Jean, and for some reason they decided not to use the fiery graphic which appeared at the end of Xmen 2. It was, however, a nice addition to the plot.3)Though it started off well, the writing began to become ridiculously average around the middle of the movie. Cliché, unnatural dialogue combined with asinine, out of place one-liners (reminiscant of old Arnold quotes) to completely take me out of the fantasy (see ""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch""--funny, yes, but it belonged in a gag reel).4) The last 20 or so minutes were mediocre, and the end where humans forgive the mutants--who had tried to exterminate them--and bigotry has apparently been eliminated (how exactly did that happen?) would have been laughable had it not been such a tragic waste of opportunity. For a while I honestly believed they were going to end it there, and I was beside myself.Bottom line, the writers and director should never be allowed anywhere near future projects. I realize they had a lot to live up to, but they failed miserably. I mean, come on. You have 40 some odd years of comics with hundreds of characters, dozens of alternate universes and story lines, and at least 2 other villains who would translate perfectly onto the big screen (Mr. Sinister and to a lesser extent Apocalypse); there is even a cartoon series which translated many of the major sagas onto the small screen! Why is it so hard? Like I said, they had a lot to live up to, but so did Peter Jackson (who also had to appease a legion of fans). The difference? Jackson stayed true to the novels and universe, and didn't see it necessary to add corny one liners, bland dialogue, and make it fit a Hollywood equation. In essence, he translated it directly to the screen and didn't dumb it down. He made a movie that fans of the series and newcomers alike would love; this movie seemed like it was made not for fans but for the morons who clap when Magneto dies.If such an incredibly rich universe had not already been created (and expanded over decades), I wouldn't be so hard on it; however, I feel like there were too many wasted opportunities and that the potential of this film was not NEARLY approached.",X-Men - The Last Stand
651,ak_stinger,Wasted Potential (contains spoilers),5,1 June 2006,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERSHad ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" been about either the rise of Jean Grey as Phoenix OR the ""cure"" for mutants the movie could have been full of the meaningful allegories and edge-of-your-seat action that made ""X2"" such a great film. Instead it tries to tackle both story lines and ends up falling sadly short on both.One major crime was the misuse of characters. The biggest (but not only) faults:  Rogue: Once a major focal point of the series, she vanishes early on in the action and turns up (seemingly as an afterthought) at the very end. One of the plots was about the ""cure"" she left to get  wouldn't it have been more meaningful if the audience got to go along on the journey with this character we care about?  Bobby/Iceman: He's unfortunately been afflicted with the same good-guy-blandness that neutered Cyclops in the movies. Before, we cared about him because Rogue cared about him; without her around he's really not very interesting. That would have made his many scenes hard enough to watch even if his storyline hadn't been completely pointless. Kitty: Her character is so generic she might as well be called ""Bobby's Alternative Love Interest"". Honestly, with as much screen time as she got we should have gotten to know something about her besides the facts she can walk through walls and touch Bobby while Rogue can't. Hank/Beast: Another character with a lot of screen time that we didn't know enough about. What's his story? How is it that he's such good friends with the X-Men even though the audience hasn't met him before? Where has he been? How, out of all the mutants in the world, did he get the high position in the federal government? The movie offers few real answers to any of these questions and that makes his character difficult to care about on a personal level.  Angel: This character, on the other hand, has an interesting and relevant back-story that the audience is allowed to know and both it and he are completely wasted. This role is little more than a glorified cameo, which is a shame because the little I saw of him made me want to know more.Mystique/the bad guys: Mystique is such an awesome character and the movie wastes her; instead she is replaced with some new baddies, none of whom we know enough about to be too invested in the Brotherhood-versus-X-Men fights (more on this later).The plots are simply stretched too thin to get enough excitement and emotional impact, and the movie doesn't even seem to try for any of that. Where is Rogue's struggle with her identity as a mutant and how that affected her decision about getting the ""cure""? Where is Warren Worthington II's reaction to being saved by Angel and the mutation he'd tried to ""cure""? Where are the scrimmages between Magneto's Brotherhood and the X-Men that build up the tension and rivalries between the two factions? This movie has no big one-on-one fight scene. Sure, Iceman and Pyro's showdown is cool (no pun intended), but it's hardly on par with past greats such as the glorious and riveting showdown between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike in the second film.There are a lot of flaws in the details too. The dialog is totally dumbed-down (what, isn't anyone in the not-too-distant future capable of speaking in compound sentences anymore?). Most scenes and sequences are rushed and disjointed; and since no one bothers to take the time to flesh out characters, rivalries, and story lines the audience remains fairly emotionally disengaged during the climatic battle at the end. With too much to cover the emotional impact the movie could have had is lost, especially with its sub-par script.Not that ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is without its great moments. The final confrontation between Jean/Phoenix and Professor X is heart-stopping; Magneto moving the Golden Gate Bridge is a highlight of the action sequences; Storm is finally flying; Wolverine lighting his cigar with the burning rubble in the Danger Room simulation is perfectly in character; and Magneto's final scene alone at the chess board is lonely, intriguing, and hopeful all at once. It's too bad these are so few and far between  instead of recapturing the greatness of ""X2"", the third X-Men movie is but a shadow of what was.",X-Men - The Last Stand
652,thenudeferret,"Sure, a good action movie but..",6,29 June 2006,"Marvel-freak as I am, I might not be the best one commenting on this picture since I'm already too involved in the comic book in order to produce an objective image of the film.Anyway, compared to the first and especially the second movie, this one doesn't get through to you in the same way. The second movie is by far the best one and maybe they should have been satisfied with that. Here it's pretty much the same way as in Matrix 2 & 3, it just continues where the last movie finished without adding the essential ""extra"" which makes it unforgettable.Not much more character-building, which i necessary when making a sequel, but pretty good photo and good action makes up for a bit of those losses. Decent action film, but no more.",X-Men - The Last Stand
653,socrates_note,Missing the EMOTION GENE.,5,25 June 2006,"I am sorry but that really encapsulates what is wrong with X-Men 3. Myself, I am a fan of the X-Men movies because it is the first time ever that superhero movies were ever done well. X-Men 3 does not lack the star power or the orchestrated fight scenes come action scenes but what it lacks is a lot of everything else. Once again thrown into the paradox of the cure hence annihilation of the mutant gene, the very core of the plot is never ever dealt with in character with the numerous x-men characters. It is as if characters are efficiently gotten rid of so as to make sure that audiences know there will not be a fourth X-men. having seen this film at Cannes along with the screening of the press conference where Brett Ratner admitted to the end of this particular franchise but not dismissing a possible Professor X or a Magneto or a Wolverine - doesn't have the same optimism in me if its the likes of Mr. Ratner who will be directing and ignoring the characters/emotion/miles of wonderful tension and concentrating on the action. Performances were below par and Magneto's army of bad mutants never caught your imagination even Pyro a remnant from X-2. One is never allowed to get to know the Phoenix and that wonderful love triangle of Scott, Logan and Jean whose parameters change in this instalment are once again not exploited cinematically and instead an almost boring cliché without emotion anchors it. Much was missing, the real X FACTOR was missing.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Cool characters in this one- Juggernaut and his amazing size, the Morlocks with cool powers and stunts, madding Magneto and the psychotic powers Jean claimed. Oh, goodness! Beast! Let's welcome Beast to the show. Talk about stunts and effects, this action-packed movie will glue you to your seat out of shock. You'll be amazed by the professional effects that were input in the film.I like the idea of keeping the characters to their original ways from the comics, it's classic!

655,CowsOnlyMooForSoLong,"Good Action, Non-Exsitant Character Development",1,27 May 2006,"First I'm going to apologize for my spelling, I'm a horrible speller. I must say that i was extremely disappointed with this third X Men movie. I have been a faithful X Men fan for years and I have been anticipating the release of this movie for months. If an action movie is your type of thing then this is a great movie for you, but if you care at all about character development then wait for this to come to DVD because it isn't worth your money. There is many new characters, such as Angel, Shadowcat and Beast, that are completely underdeveloped. What was intended to be a love triangle between Iceman, Rogue and Shadowcat, turned out to be a slight friendship and a really jealous Rogue who seemed very much like a spoiled brat. Another thing that bothered me about Rogue, previously one of my favorite characters, was that she seemed to take the easy way out and not face the challenges of life. There was also needless deaths in the movie, i will not name names but if you watch it you will know who i mean. Angel, who was seen many times in the trailer, got about the same amount of time that he got in the trailer, about 2 minutes. I was also disappointed with the Pheonix. I was expecting the flaming bird and just got a really ugly version of Jean Grey! One more thing that bothered me was that Nightcrawler mysteriously vanished. He was there at the end of X2 and not even mentioned in this movie. Did the directer think we would be that stupid to not realize that one of the characters has disappeared! The Only redeeming thing about the movie was the two endings. The actual ending left it good for another (hopefully better) movie and the ending that occurred after the credits left you with even more hope for another movie. One thing that i did like about this movie was the casting of Kelsey Grammar. He did a perfect job as Beast, i just wished we could have seen more of him. Well, there is more I'd like to say about this movie but it would give away to much and i wouldn't want to spoil it for y'all.",X-Men - The Last Stand
656,clements1991,Cut throat cool,8,30 May 2006,"Now, the English critics haven't been particularly nice to this film, most of the reviews have been average at best. However, reviews don't deter me and I saw it with my mates hoping it would be as cool as the first two films which were amazing, even for those who weren't familiar with it before, (I was but that's not important.) It started and guess what, it was wicked. It shows Jean Grey as a little girl lifting up all the cars it the street with her mind preparing you for the awesome powers of Phoenix. You meet new characters and witness important character development in your faves, (the ones you're bored of get killed off). It's clever, funny and action packed, as long as you've seen the other then you'll love it and want to use your popcorn to suffocate the stiffs who didn't appreciate it's greatness. Soo cool!",X-Men - The Last Stand
657,retributionpublications,"bad, bad, bad",1,5 June 2006,"I was greatly disappointed by this film. Loved the first two - but the liberties they took with the third one were a little ridiculous. I mean, I knew it was gonna be a bad idea for them to try to tackle the Dark Pheonix saga, and boy was I right. But that's not even my biggest complaint ... the whole movie seems like it was put together last minute insofar as the writing was concerned. They tried to pack too much story into a 2-hour movie and the result was a shoddy, easy-wrap up, soulless strip of loose ends that didn't allow enough time for characters to breath. The saddest thing was that its abundance of pointless, multiple story lines cut into the much-anticipated action time. The result was negation on all fronts: it killed both the story and the action, rendering the entire movie anti-climatic and completely pointless. I mean, if you're going to flounder in story, at least give us the nerd porn action sequences we want as an easy fallback, right? But no... I mean, why didn't Wolverine at least get to go back for seconds with Juggernaut? Was it really so hard not to deny us that one? And barely any Colosus, instead they wasted waaaaay to much time on useless characters like Iceman and Angel, which simply amounted to a waste of celluloid. I'll put it this way, it's a sad day when the Beast becomes one of the shining moments of an x-men movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
658,treefiddee,Oh dear god,1,3 December 2006,"So did anyone actually read through the comics before scripting this pile of utter pap???? I seriously doubt it. With a lets kill them, introduce that attitude this movie slopes slowly into the mire of disgusting disappointing garbage. ""Woooo, we got new special effects to play with"" seems to be the order of the day as far as this film goes, with a promising start the intrigue is set, sadly it does not continue along a similar line within the first 10 minutes, I have to say it was the biggest disappointment I have endured for quite some time. For Stan Lee to do his usual cameo in this I feel saddened, he must be going senile in his later years. For utter nonsense that is actually worth watching try Sky High on for size, it never sets out to be good and so becomes a thoroughly enjoyable flick, PLEASE do not watch this film if you like the original story!!! In short I hate this film with the passion of a thousand suns, I have purchased cheesy 80s ninja films for 50p that are better scripted and a lot more enjoyable, this is a blah blah blah snore-fest with fantastic special effects, that I'm afraid is it's only saving grace!",X-Men - The Last Stand
659,Blackavaar,Wrong Wrong Wrong Wrong WRONG!!!,2,29 September 2006,"This movie is full of action and super powers, yeah. Okay. But unlike the other X-Men films, this one shreds the stories of nearly every character in pursuit of the almighty dollar.First of all, let's start with the fact that Nightcrawler has been deleted. Yes, deleted. Not only is he not in this film his disappearance is totally unexplained. Nobody even mentions him in passing. It's as if he never existed at all.Second, let's look at the fact that Scott Summers is killed right off the bat, ruining any hope for a continuation of the epic love story between he and Jean depicted in the comics.Third, let's look at how the powers of nearly every newly introduced mutant in this movie are totally wrong. Calisto's power was that she enhanced the powers of other mutants around her. She was a mutant power booster and battery not a super speed chick. Also, Calisto was unattractive and proud of it. She wasn't some cutesy bebop chick. Jean Grey as the Dark Phoenix should have had advanced control of telekinesis and telepathy as well as pyrokinesis. That's right, FIRE control. She wasn't supposed to be turning people to ash with a microwave-like ability. It was supposed to be FIRE. What's the matter couldn't get a real enough looking flame? Spent too much making the stupid magnetic bridge scene? And then there's Juggernaut. No, he's not a mutant first off and his power has nothing to do with him being in motion. Plot point, he was Professor Xavier's Half Brother, ungifted by mutant powers he grew jealous of Charles and began searching for a way to be more powerful, better than his brother. He found a mystical power source, a magical crystal he inset into a helmet that turned him into the Juggernaut, an unstoppable war machine from an era of long forgotten magiks. That sounds like it could be a movie in itself doesn't it? Doesn't it!? And let's not forgot, Juggernaut is not 'bloody' English. And then finally let's look at Kitty Pryde, aka. Shadowcat, one of my all time favorite characters from the comics. We finally get to see her powers do more than walk her thru a door and what does Ratner do? He completely screws up the rules for phasing. When desolidified (phased) the person phased does not exist in space normally, however all objects they pass through do continue to exist normally. This means that when you unphase someone in the middle of say ""a concrete floor"", the floor would still exist as the unphasing individual became solid again. The floor, as it was there before the unphasing individual, would take precedence and become part of the individual's chest. This means that whatever was in his chest before would become whatever material the floor was made of. Juggernaut in such a case should have died instantly of shock. Not to mention the fact that his heart would have stopped anyway when it became concrete. This was very thoroughly explained in the comic books.Once again Hollywood craps out a film where no one bothers to do any damn research. This movie is just the shell of the former films with a shiny, glossy, candy coating. Ratner ruined this franchise as surely as Schumacher ruined the Batmans.Oh yeah, and killing off Professor X and then having him transfer his mind into a coma patient? What an inventive way to get out of having to have Patrick Stewart if you make another sequel. NOT. If you did a little research you would find that Magneto turned back to good and became the director of the school after Charles died. But oh, it doesn't matter what the comics did, does it? Hollywood sucks.An 8 for action minus 6 for lack of research and poor writing and directing equals a 2 rating.",X-Men - The Last Stand
660,raiden1969,Emotionally UN moving,6,28 May 2006,"I really don't have problems with the plot but I must say that this just didn't move or touch me so emotionally. I'm a big fan of the comic and story. I understand that the director had to take some liberties with the plot details - I thought that worked out really well. The problem was the implausible human reactions, poor acting, and awful script. It's like Jackman and Halle Berry were just there to pick up a check. Patrick Stewart was solid as usual. Kelsey Grammar really was the only stand out in the acting department. I just left the theater unmoved - not disgusted or feeling ripped off like some movies - just unmoved.

661,manofhood,Another 10 of 10 X-Men movie,10,24 May 2006,"I'm at a loss of words. This is indescribable.X-Men - The Last Stand is high drama, a wonderful and immense story.First of all: to all those that enjoyed the first two movies: this one is just as good, at least, at least that.One second in this one is more intense than hundreds of the many crap films released today put together. It's palatable, visible in the very air, just like Phoenix's godly Power.It is a different film compared to the first two, with a different emphasis. Brett Ratner and a practically entire new behind the camera team have, inevitably a different focus, approach than Bryan Singer and his team. It's more brutal, less comics-like, consequently even further removed from the comics' story than before.But it's all still there, the familiar faces, characters, from the opening sequence and onward, coming to life, a fact still amazing to me, five years after the first movie.The younger Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Eric Lensherr (Ian McKellen) working together finding the young Jean Grey, the Phoenix-to-be, realizing immediately that they are in way over their heads.Jean is a Class Five mutant, as far «above» (power wise) the other mutants as they are «above» the other humans, and now, when her power is emerging fully, there is no place for her in the world.A «cure» is found for mutants, one changing their genetic make-up, one removing a crucial part of themselves, and rage is rising from the deepest of dark corners.The stakes are clearly higher in this one, right from the start. We are shown that early, with the first fatality, with the first death, and it only gets worse (or better) from then on. Many have stated that this should have been an R-rated film, and I, since I want films to be made solely for an «adult» audience, certainly agree with that.It centers on Phoenix. Almost all plots and characters touch her in some way, and this is a very good thing. The X-Men comics would have been lesser without her, in so many ways, and so would the films. Famke Jansen does a great, beyond great job playing her in quite the minimalist way. Less is more.Storm gets more screen time this time, but she's not really taking center stage in any way. The three main characters are Phoenix, Magneto and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and that is also how it should be.If I wanted to do some nitpicking, there are a few things I could point out that I would have changed, but I won't. The only fact I will mention is that the movie is at least half an hour too short, but that is true for every great film. We love what we see and we want more.Yet another 10 of 10 X-Men movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
662,woowacka44,Hardcore Fans vs. The General Public,6,27 May 2006,"It just comes down to this.If you're a hard core purist fan, you'll be angry at the disregard and respect for stories, truths and characters of the legendary series. You'll be let down by the lack of character development that Bryan Singer had been building up so much, as well as the amount of screen time given to some of your favorite characters.If you only know X-Men from the movies, you'll probably like it b/c it's filled with non-stop action and emotional moments that you probably didn't see coming. With some really cool special effects. Especially the Golden Gate bridge scene, that was fun.I am one of those people who find themselves being a little bit of both. I have a huge respect for the comics and the old-school continuity, although I honestly never read the comics as a kid. I'm a combination of dorky comic wannabee guy mixed with cool sports playing wannabee guy. So i'm still not sure what I think about this film.The story didn't follow continuity, but it is a film. Not a comic book. Does a film have the right to create its own canon or continuity in order to appease the masses? In order to fit into its typical 3 episode format? A film obviously doesn't have the ability to go into detail with every character as Comics do. So its tough to appease the hard core fans, and if you take the time to go into every detail, you slow down the pace for the non hardcore fans.I saw the film with fans of the movies, not comic buffs, and they liked it a lot. They were super excited and blown away by some of the choices in the story.The story... Also, Brett Ratner came into this project with everything pretty much already done. He honestly probably didn't have much to do w/ the script. I would assume at least.Having said that the directing and cinematography didn't seem to be amazing, just good enough to work.The story was intense and overwhelming, despite destroying any previously respected continuity. But thats why we have comics. Comics will continue to hold up the legacy of Xmen, while the films will give us a fun chance to see something cool.Having said that, the characters weren't developed and it was rushed and all kinds of stuff. It was lame to see more screen time given to that fake Hollywood version of Kid Omega than to Collossus or Juggernaught.Oh well. i had fun while watching it, but I usually let myself go and take whatever is happening on the screen for what it is. Then i go into film school kid mode and dissect it. But i had fun.So that's where the opinions will be different. It was cool for non-fans, painful for big-fans. Oh well... i had mindless fun watching it, and at least we still have the comics to uphold the history of X-Men and how it really went down.",X-Men - The Last Stand
663,FooserX,"Yes, it's as bad as people are saying...",1,26 May 2006,"This movie was SO bad for the following reasons: 1) It spends the whole time showcasing different mutants, powers, and F/X which leaves no room for plot. Everything is rushed and sloppy.2) Clearly the F/X team took a page out of Lucas' Star Wars new episodes by throwing so much eye candy at the audience in hopes to ""wow"" them instead of drawing them into the movie.2) How can you just KILL off or take away the powers of so many characters? Imagine watching a Superman movie where it ends with him losing all his powers. It's an utter joke. I can see one or two main characters losing abilities...but THAT many of them?? Mystique, gone. Magneto, gone. Xavier, gone. Cyclops, gone. Jean Grey, gone. lol...it's just brutal! This movie is an abortion to the franchise and a franchise killer. This series could have been great, but thanks to this movie, and the writers, they have completely destroyed it. Nice work.

664,kingmattress,Best X-Action Yet,9,27 May 2006,"My summary up above sums it up perfectly. X3 was a step up in several areas, and those that it was a step down in didn't ruin the movie at all. First, a comparison.My big problem with X2 was that while the story was great, the action was very not. The only real fight in that movie was, to me, a giant ""Who cares?"" between Wolverine and Deathstrike. X3's plot is loosely based on a combination of both the famous Dark Phoenix Saga with Joss Whedon's recent ""Gifted"" arc from Astonishing X-Men #1-6. The stories mesh relatively well together to form what was a pretty good original story. There are also aspects, namely death, that give this a very ""gloves off, fight to the end"" kind of feel of desperation, and it was refreshing and interesting to see a comic movie not afraid to kill major characters, and it leaves the audience wondering if their favorites will survive.While the story isn't as good as X2's, X3 more than makes up for it in action. The action in this movie is better than both previous films combined. The final battle scene between the six remaining X-Men and Magneto's army (literally) is amazing, particularly Kitty's one-on-one with Juggernaut.While the dialog was wooden at times, several characters are handled much better in this movie. Particularly of note is Storm, who in her role of leading the X-Men is much more fleshed out and is done much better by Halle Berry. Overall, improved by leaps and bounds. I'd be amiss, however, if I didn't mention Kelsey Grammar as Beast. In reviews I've read, even people who didn't like the movie find it hard to deny that his portrayal was perfect, a word I won't use often for comic movies. His class and occasional pompous arrogance shine through perfectly while he is still likable, and his job in the movie (political ambassador for mutants) fits both the character and plot very well. Along those lines was Pyro, who was Magneto's perfect right hand man in this. Aaron Stanford did a great job portraying him as a very bad guy that you couldn't help think was cool, and that makes for an entertaining villain.Some characters are changed dramatically from the comic to the movie, namely Callisto. Her powers of enhanced senses, abilities, and tactical planning have been replaced with what seems to be a combination of Quicksilver and Sage's powers (in the film, she has super speed and can detect other mutants and the strength of their powers). Multiple Man is a villain. Most of it works well for the story, though. It was a joy for the comic fan in me to see Storm and Callisto develop a rivalry and fight one-on-one several times, as the two had a similar relationship in the comics. The only problem I had was Kid Omega, who's powerful psychic abilities were replaced by spikes protruding from his skin. It would have been just as easy to keep this character as Quill, who is only slightly more obscure, and Kid Omega isn't a big enough name to draw more people to the theater. Also, Psylocke is credited, and for the life of me I can't figure out if she was a girl in a class scene or a villain with a very different power. I hope for the former.I've seen people divided on this movie. Some call it awful, some call it the best yet. I'd give it a relative tie for best with X2, and definitely the most entertaining. I'm seeing people say that they're true X-Men fans because they don't like this film, which is a little offensive. I believe it's clear from above that I'm not just a fan, but a geek. I thought it was a fine film worthy of the X-Men title, and that's this true fan's opinion.",X-Men - The Last Stand

666,PhattyMatty42,Not bad... not bad.,5,26 May 2006,"Well the hype for this movie on me has come and gone faster then you can say Ratner will ruin the X-Men franchise. But come to find out that he didn't totally destroy everything we hold dear and that he actually delivered a entertaining comic book ride from start to finish.This film follows our heroes as they and the rest of the mutant community try to cope with the discovery of a cure to their mutant powers. The mutants struggle with the decision to get rid of their powers and become human or decide once and for all if they want to stay as they were. The humans on the other side feel otherwise, they see the mutant gene as a disease and want the cure to be mandatory. But this merely adds as a backdrop to the real problem plaguing everyone-- Jean Grey didn't die at the end of the second film and she's a whole different woman now.The main problem I had with this film is there is just too much trying to be accomplished here. It's just not all the different mutants, there are two main stories intertwining with each other the whole way through and not once did I ever become interested in any of it. I didn't care too much whatsoever about Phoenix and her problems, and I sure as hell didn't care about the ""mutant cure"". The cure is introduced and then that's it, we never see the emotional tug it has on the world. We just see political heads wondering how it will all play out. We needed the film to focus on one of these aspects, not try to nudge both of them into the cracks. That leads me to the mutants themselves. There are so many new mutants that they are given little to do. Beast I'm sorry to say was just blah as they come. I loved the Kelsey Grammar casting job but he should of been given more screen time. Hell at times I forgot that there were more then just Storm and Wolverine on the X-Men. Colossus, Rogue, and Iceman had nothing memorable to talk about, and Angel has to be the most underused character since Darth Maul. There is no excuse for any of this, and I'm pretty sure the studio pressure to meet the release date had a lot to do with it. The new brotherhood mutants were lame, they all had peelings and tattoos to make them seem like they were cool, but they were surely not. The only new villain that I appreciated was Juggernaut. Vinne Jones own this role like no other, and delivers one classic line towards the end that I will soon not forget (had the whole theater rolling). Oh and is it me or does this film make Wolverine seem like a total wuss? Like seriously, some of those one-liners had to go.On the positive side of things, the special effects were great. Along with the set pieces they never looked better, the FX team did a outstanding job. Ratner's directing was good, you could tell he followed Singer's style of the series but none of the substance. The emotional involvement was barely there and it seems like character deaths were created to stand in place of dramatic storytelling. In light of this the climax was very nice and I liked where this film left off.All in all X3 is a highly enjoyable flick. Is it the finish we all wanted out of this franchise? No, but this movie sure isn't the disaster we all thought it would be.",X-Men - The Last Stand
667,WendyLauren,Enjoyed it thoroughly.,8,26 May 2006,"I will not pretend to know a whole lot about the X-Men comics: I haven't read one. However, this film was well made, it got the message across and also displayed many mutants that non fanatic audiences would haven't have known about otherwise. Though the cameos from Angel and a few other important mutants were there, they left the audience wanting more. The addition of other minor mutants added to the film, rather than taking away from the experience. Who ever edited the film did a great job, there wasn't a dull moment throughout the entire movie. The effects were superb. The many-tiered story line never got confusing, which is an accomplishment for such a movie. Ian McKellen, my favourite throughout the film did a fantastic job, I couldn't have imagined a better performance. In all, it was very enjoyable and worth the money I paid.

668,la-31,Mixed Emotions of a female X-Men fan,4,31 May 2006,"I wasn't going to write a review of this film - but after seeing how well it did at the box office, and seeing people rushing to heap praise on it, I felt compelled to write this.I don't understand how anyone who has been an X-Men fan from before the first film could truly like this film. Now, that doesn't mean I'm saying don't go see it. But it doesn't necessarily mean that you will be entirely happy with what you see. I never read / bought comic books except for the rebooted X-Men in the 90s. I realize now that X-Men fans accepted and even appreciated the first two films because Bryan Singer is a talented filmmaker who didn't ignore (for the most part) the excellent writing and artistry of the X-Men phenomenon. I had a friend tell me that she's really not into superhero/science fiction films except for the X-Men. I think it can be explained by the 'team' aspect. It's because X-Men involve multiple personalities, powers, and the interplay on a ""team"" of superheroes. That's why the 'Superfriends' was always my favorite Saturday morning cartoon show when I was a child (yes, I know it's cheese). And hands down, the X-Men which flowed from those crazy minds at Marvel and Stan Lee are, hands down, the coolest superheroes ever. Wolverine alone, with his back story, is a legend.This film delivers on the action, but to me the fights don't make sense (as many have pointed out on the message boards). And the scene with Jean Grey disintegrating Xavier with her mind was mindblowing (no pun intended). Well, to me those are the only two high points. If you want to see some mutants in action, and are not particular about which ones, then see the film. But I had issues with a whole host of things about this film - so Wolverine finds Cyclops' glasses, brings them back and NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING ??? The death of Cyclops deserves something more than a passing reference long after he has died!!! Why did Phoenix kill him? For the hell of it? She could have killed lots of lesser people, she tortures or plays with others, yet she kills the man who resurrects her. This was basically the most ridiculous part of the film. And no one blinks an eye. The final assault with Magneto lobbing cars set on fire by Pyro has to be the lamest idea I can think of. That scene lacked the intensity and mass scale that a true X Men fight could entail. And other than Storm and Wolverine, we're left with no one else with whom we've connected. Iceman just seemed too 'green.' It was all about Wolverine. The script of this film is lame, and is it me, or do the actors look like they're done with this? Of course, Halle Berry has never really been Storm - she was always ""phoning in"" her performance, and has always just played Halle Berry in an X-Men uniform.This movie is definitely worse than its predecessor, so don't let ticket sales fool you. What else were people gonna see on Memorial Day weekend? People are seeing this film DESPITE the fact that Brett Ratner has completely massacred (in some cases literally) the X-Men name. They're seeing this film because of the X-Men - who shine through a crap-fest of a film. And yeah, a lot of stuff explodes and there are loud noises. Enjoy. I could have done without.",X-Men - The Last Stand
669,salted11,"The More Things Change, The More They Stay the Same...",5,1 June 2006,"I was very disappointed. Perhaps I was expecting too much. Perhaps it was too much hype. But at the end of the day, I walked out of the theatre and thought, ""That just plain sucked."" A few years back, a studio exec walked into a boardroom and proposed a notion to his bosses that must have seemed revolutionary at the time. ""Let's make a comic book movie."" ""Sounds great,"" they said, ""but what's the catch? What'll be the draw?"" Raising a finger, the young revolutionary said, ""We're going to make sure it doesn't suck."" And so came X-men. And Spider-man. Batman Begins. Audienced raved and were amazed. Then came X-men 2, and Spider-man 2, again, just as good, if not better than their predecessors. Remember Batman Forever? Batman & Robin? That's what X-men 3 is. Schlock. People rave about the special effects and the ""pulse pounding excitement."" Great. I liked the Matrix, too. The first twenty minutes of set up had me hooked. I was interested. Then suddenly character development left the building. Iceman has girl issues. Wolverine throws out a few quips. Cyclops, who could have been a contender, was never given any material to work with. A character that has lasted over thirty years in comics, could not even be given a chance in the movies. And I'm not slamming the movie solely on the poor use of one character. The dialogue was horrible. The old, ""we all stand together"" line in the hallway before the final fight might have come from a Saturday cartoon. The storyline, which could have grown into something as good as Joss Whedon's original from his line of comics, basically set up the end piece of action on Alcatraz. The ending was a video game, of one boss fight after another, with nothing being fleshed out or accomplished. People are killed with the wave of a hand, Wolverine saves the day, credits roll. Brett Ratner owes me 12 bucks and I'm going to file this movie with Highlander 2. People wanted more mutants and more action. The studio gave it to them and didn't bother with a fully fleshed out storyline and sensible dialogue.",X-Men - The Last Stand
670,toddkvamme,Weak story,6,27 May 2006,"As is the case with many a Hollywood ""blockbuster"" this movie is remarkably weak on story. I am an X-Men fan....I have a complete run of the comics, but this movie failed to capture any of the drama of the Dark Phoenix that was so well done in the comics. The story was just weak. Without a good story, movies are boring. And I found this movie to be just that....dull and uninteresting. On the bright side, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen are both good and they make the movie at least rate above a 5. The effects were also impressive....but, effects can only serve a plot, and this plot was just too anemic to be saved by good acting and/or special effects.",X-Men - The Last Stand
671,tfduckman,"RE-EDITED : We, the fans, demand the true PHOENIX-story ! Remake Xmen3 !",1,6 May 2007,"I won't waste time on this movie - for it is just another piece of crap with politically correct lines, but a GIANT disappointment to any true Xmen-fan ! They should instead make a REAL sequel to X2 with Bryan Singer and call it : Xmen - the Dark Poenix rises ! THIS is what will keep us from hating those who made the misery called X3 ! Everyone of the true Xmen-fans expected Phoenix to be discussed between the extra-terrestrial forces and Professor Xavier in space with his beloved Lilandra, Majestrix of the Shi'ar Empire; we also expected to see Phoenix travel in outer space and we expected the director to not HATE the characters ! I will definitely blame the head-writer Simon Kinsberg who has made fine super-agents-movies like ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" and ""XXX : The next level"" ... BUT super-heroes are more demanding to write believably about since their anatomies have extra powers (where super-agents are trained human beings) and this Xmen3 looks FLAT and DULL, where we had SUSPENSE and DRAMA created by Bryan Singer, who most DIE HARD fans applauded before any piece of Xmen 1 was seen !Why ? I'll give You two superior reasons :1. A film such as ""The usual suspects"" has the suspense and drama, that most super-agents-movies completely lacks. This is why super-agent 007 still works for us all, there are elements of mystique, passions, romance and truth. And of course a much better humour than the watered out lines in Xmen3 !2. Bryan Singer publicly revealed that he was a personal fan of Xmen and these two movies(Xmen 1 & 2) clearly shows it along with the statement that he'd be happy to come back and direct the third Xmen after ""Superman returns"" ! If an action-director like Rattner is scared to show Phoenix in space or devouring stars, he should stick to ""Rush hour""-film which he apparently does quite well ! And if You can spend the first 15 minutes of Xmen 1 mostly concentrated on Wolverines solo-show, then You can easily show a woman's side of the story too. The Dark Phoenix-saga is not far out ; in fact it maybe one of the finest piece of comics we have and, I'll bet my next Lear-jet that Bryan Singer would do Xmen3 with REAL (not PSEUDO-)emphasis on Jean Greys character and if he wants to use some scenes from the ""Xmen : The last stand"" he won't have any problem with me !It is by the way a twist of fate (or the DC-jealousy) that just when John Byrne (Dark Phoenix saga) was near the end of his time at Marvel, he was hired by DC Comics to revamp its flagship character Superman, and now we had to relive this tragic loss with Bryan Singer being hired for Superman returns ! Just a piece of history repeating ... the morale is to leave this amazing saga with its character-developments in the hands of John Byrne and Bryan Singer again. You money-people out there may recognize success - but this time You've killed the most interesting story with Your actions ! Realize Your crime and spend A LOT OF MONEY on the Dark Phoenix Saga, oh yes, don't worry Your money will come back, because it was a success ! And the thing that made it a success was that John Byrne (with Chris Claremont) dared to drop the commercial story lines ! Unfortunately ""Xmen3 - the last stand"" is just another commercial storyline ... so we want a true successor to Xmen2 ! If they can do it with the Highlander-franchise they can do it with Xmen3 - the Dark Phoenix rises !My vote is definitely 1 (awfull) out of 10 - go and see Spiderman3 instead (haven't seen it myself , but even the trailers look better than Xmen 3)",X-Men - The Last Stand
672,Lott444,Just because it's a final film doesn't mean you destroy everything the others have built!,1,6 June 2006,"Months ahead of this film's release I heard a lot of negative information about it's production. I was told it was being butchered due to being rushed through production to beat Superman Returns and probably smite Brian Singer as well. Being the X-Men fan that I have been since I was a child, I decided to let these warnings fly by with no notice. Let me tell you; they were right. This film is an insult to fans of the comic, cartoons and even of the other films.(spoilers within) The character development is so poor here. I've heard defenses that you don't need development in a closing movie but that's BS in my opinion. There needs to be something learned in every film for established characters. Some struggle, some goal accomplished. This kind of thing doesn't happen here, really. At least not for the positive. Wolverine, Storm and Magneto seemed to regress as characters since X2. Logan ends X2 telling Scott that Jean chose said she returned Scott's love the whole time. In this film we're treated to Logan seemingly not caring that Scott is missing and possibly dead, instead he dry humps his wife first chance he gets. (At the same time ignoring Xavier's warnings) Storm went from being a timid mouse in X1 and 2 to a loudmouth in this film. Here's what we lost because of Halle Berry's demands for more pay and higher screen time in this film: 15-20 minutes of the movie that could have been used to develop a new characters, and a loss of maybe 10million from the budget. Here's what we gained: compromised story lines that contradict past films. I'm supposed to believe that Xavier chooses Storm as his heir to the school over Scott? His first student and field leader of the team? All because Scott was depressed and having mental attacks from Jean? Which leads me to my next point.Xavier knew Scott was having mental attacks from Jean according to Zack Penn, the writer. This being the case, why was Xavier shocked when he discovered she was alive? Why was he portrayed as scheming and a bit reckless in this film when in others he was a kind hearted gentleman? To give Wolverine someone to yell at, that's why.Wolverine above all others in this film. Once again, only Wolverine can save the day. We don't need 3 of the 4 ninja turtles. As long as we have Leonardo we can't lose! This movie was all regression from what we had in X2. We're introduced to characters that we don't learn anything about. Actually, to say they're introduced is misleading. The character will do their bit and move on with no mention of their names or motives for actions. We're given characters who we know and love from old films and comics and have them unjustly done away with (Psylocke, Cyclops, Mystique). In fact, this film regressed from the advertisements of it. At least in those Angel suited up and fought alongside the team.I strongly recommend any fans of the X-Men comics stay away from this, as it will make you weep for what could have been. If you know nothing about X-Men I guess it's okay. However, it will still insult your intelligence to an insane degree. You'll see what I mean.",X-Men - The Last Stand
673,Supergrass,terrible,1,27 May 2006,"my problems with the film: (1) character design:the villains were laughable. the porcupine fellow and the 2 new female recruits elicited muffled laughs from the audience i caught the film with; (2) script: the severe deviation from the comic plot line was unbearable. i mean, artistic license in the cinema is fine, but x3 does to the x-men what demi moore did to the scarlett letter. my point: why kill certain critical characters? to bring a level of gravitas to an already goofy film? i mean, this is a comic book adaptation, not Citizen Kane. (3) direction: nothing special here. it seems like the current director just rehashed the previous director's style (much like he did in ""red dragon"") w/o adding anything interesting. most of the action is silly and pedestrian. i was at least expecting some exciting good ole American movie violence. it might be better to spend your 10 bucks on singer's superman instead of this P.O.S.**Piece of Sh*t",X-Men - The Last Stand
674,martin-secker,Rushed Hour (and 39 minutes),5,23 December 2008,"This movie was fighting an uphill battle from the start - having a concrete release date fast approaching, losing Bryan Singer, now-established A-lister squabbling about character development, hefty studio interference, actor schedule clashes and a lacklustre script.I don't blame Ratner, I'm sure he did the best he could with the time allowed. I don't blame the cast. The problem was with the script - it introduces too many characters without fleshing them out, leaving big characters out of the storyline (Nightcrawler, Cyclops, Mystique) and trying to be too big in scale. The beauty with Singer's X-Men is that he managed to make complex narratives accessible to the non-fans, he Ratner is forced to subliminally supply the viewer with rapid fire sequences that confuse and distract rather than endear. On the plus side, Jackman now owns the Wolverine character, Janssen is good as Jean Grey/Phoenix and Beast looks pitch-perfect.All principal actors struggle in vain to sound more than cardboard characters from 1960's Star Trek - I feel most sorry for McKellan & Stewart who can do this stuff in their sleep. How come Halle Berry lost her accent? Was it to taxing? Rogue is forced to sit on the back burner. Cyclops, who was given a rough ride in X2, is dispatched all too quickly. Ben Foster (a talented actor) is given nothing to do as Archangel - stuck with the same facial expression in all of his three scenes. Many fans point the finger at Vinnie Jones - I thought he did very well with what he had - let's face it, there was no way the character could've been introduced to the screen without looking ridiculous - Juggernaut is not even given a death scene worthy of his introduction.X2 remains one of the finest comic book adaptations to date, so it's a shame that such a groundbreaking trilogy is left to wither and die for the sake of the studio earning a quick buck.",X-Men - The Last Stand
675,mister__freeze,Left Me Hangin!!,7,7 July 2006,Alright let me start with saying that this movie is great. Its like after you take a one hour crap that just makes you feel better. This movie is like taking an hour and a half crap. You walk out of the show with a sore corn hole and feeling 5 pounds lighter. Still it had several problems with character development. The plot moved almost as fast as a dangling poop at times but the story still went on. What makes me mad is that the hottest chick in the movie had to die. I mean they couldn't have killed some of the black people instead? All the black people were just worthless in that movie. I think the director is racist and should be shot in the face by Martin Luther King's Ghost. I hated the ending of this movie because they leave it open for a forth and that is just going to be more homosexual than William Sterling.,X-Men - The Last Stand
676,samyy_866,Unbelievable,9,29 May 2006,"I had heard very mixed reviews of 'The last stand' and so was unsure what to expect from the film and was worried that the trailer had shown the best parts of the film. However my hopes for this film were exceeded. It was brilliant, the special effects were unbelievable and the stunts were great.It could be said that this film has less emotional development than the last two films but I don't believe this to be so. All the 'X-men' are fighting their own moral and ethical battles within the storyline of the film which gives a greater understanding behind the reasons for the actions they take.Additionally it is revealed that a large number of the 'mutants' have far more evolved powers than we first thought, Jean in particular (but going into too much detail on that front will probably totally ruin the film for anyone who hasn't read the comics or internet spoilers). However i will say that her powers are far far more advanced than indicated in the first two instalments and her anger against certain characters came as quite a surprise. Additionally within the film the true extent of the powers of Iceman and Kitty Pride are revealed.Furthermore the character development of Storm (which was perhaps slightly overdue) was magnificent and well played by Hallie Berry. Hugh Jackman was (as usual) superb as Wolverine and Kelsey Grammar was (for want of a better phrase) 'absolutley wickid' as The Beast. He brings presence to his role and the character itself is just brilliant. Also the respect that Magneto and the professor have for each other, and their commitment to their dream (via their own, quite different routes) was a really important touch which brought a far greater emotional explanation for each of their actions within all three films.Therefore overall I would give the film a 9/10 simply because I feel it could have been slightly longer to allow greater character development but other than that it was a brilliant film which i would recommend fans of the films to see. I was hoping for a film to match the other two (both of which I gave an 8/10) but what I watched turned out to far exceed my hopes. Unbelievable special effects (on par with films such as Narnia and King Kong 2005)and superb emotionally driven plot line. A great film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
677,PaulNewmanIsDead,Thank god this is the last,1,22 May 2006,"The X-men series is no way excellent film making, it is a combination of special effect and brilliant music that is design to fool you. The whole series is rather comical, which should not be hard to tell since it's base on the comic book.And now I witnessed X-men: The Last Stand in a private screening, I cannot tell you how much more I hate the series. The third installment didn't save the whole series from a completely failure, but instead it made the whole thing worse. X3 bored the hell out of me, with no character development at all, the film maker expect us to know what all the character's about. Yes I saw the last 2 X-men, but how long was that ago? The last two are forgettable movies that no way I could remember them. Too bad I forget what happened on x3, I don't want know. But do you want know?

678,johny_bravvo,X traordinare,8,28 May 2006,""" .... I will give you hope old friend, all I ask in return is just stay out of my way ..."" These were the famous lines from the first movie , X Men , where Magneto politely asks Professor Charles X Xaviers to stay out of his way ..... the way he chose to defend the mutants believing that war was upon them , a war of "" survival of the fittest "" , where humanity would fight a last battle against mutants and the winner would take all. All hell breaks lose when a so called ""cure"" is found for the mutants.... a drug which will finish their super human capabilities and bring them to the level of humans. This causes a lot of mixed reactions amongst the mutants.... some like rogue who find more trouble with their powers than use , wanted to go for the medicine with the rest opposing it.X Men 3 presents a very pleasant to watch sight when a flashback was shown with the then good friends professor Xaviers and Eric Lensherr who later on become arch nemeses as professor X ( founder of X men) and Magneto ( founder of the brotherhood) , go to a very gifted young lady's house , the young lady who was so powerful that she didn't know what she was capable of. She was Jean Grey.. who was supposedly dead by the end of the 2nd movie. X Men 3 , witnesses the return of Jean Grey as the Phoenix but with so much power that she herself is unable to handle it. She poses a threat to herself and to others. The movie also brings in a couple of other mutants , some already popular from the cartoons like the Beast or Dr. Hank McCoy who has been shown as an ambassador or a political face of the mutants and Angel .Inspite of the fact that some Rogue and Mystique fans might be a little disappointed with their shortened roles, and the fact that Angel after giving such a dramatic entry has such less action in his movie to his name. But that does not effect the spirit of the whole movie. The final showdown between humans and mutants has been superbly shown. This movie features amazing special effects and an absolutely awesome storyline.The X-Men movies did one thing which I thought was almost impossible , that is to manage the multi-characters' egos into one feature length film within reasonable screen time. Kudos to Bryan Singer and his team for pulling the original X-Men off, then top it with X2, beating odds that sequels generally suck, what with bigger sets, action, and horrors, even more characters! With Singer's departure for another summer movie this year, the grand daddy of superheroes, Superman, the X-Men franchise was temporarily left direction less. Having its stars ask for more money and a bigger role, was natural too. But I'm glad that these issues were resolved and director Brett Ratner took on the task of adding a rudder to steer a fitting last movie of a trilogy .Now the question we might ask is ... will there be another sequel .... well only time can tell . But one thing i can say is stay tuned until the end of the credits for one small scene which will probably put a smile to your face. Don't say I didn't warn ya! Oh and as usual with good Marvel movies, watch out for Stan Lee too .QuotesDr. Hank McCoy: My boy, I've been fighting for mutant rights since before you had claws. Logan: Did he just call me boy? ---------------Warren Worthington, Sr.: Warren, it's a better life. It's what we all want. Warren Worthington III: No, it's what you want. ---------------- John Allerdyce( Pyro): You should have stayed in the school. Bobby Drake:(ice man) You never should have left. -------------------Logan: Let's see you grow *that* back. All I can say right now is that if a movie series like X Men had to end , it could not have asked for a better movie than X Men 3 : the last stand. I would recommend this is a must watch for all Marvel comics and X Men fans as this movie relates closest to the cartoon story line.",X-Men - The Last Stand
679,Morlock-2,Brett Ratner instead of Bryan Singer. Alarming. Very.,7,26 May 2006,"Brett Ratner instead of Bryan Singer. Alarming. Very. Brett Ratner is a guy who copies other directors' styles and makes mediocre movies (read ""Red Dragon"", where he copied Jonathan Demme and gave the film a generous portion of Ridley Scott). I didn't hate ""Red Dragon"", it just was what it was. Mediocre at best.He entered the project a year and a half ago, to replace Bryan Singer. Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg wrote a script in zero time that seems to work just fine. And that's pretty much what Ratner puts up there on the screen: a movie that works just fine. Let's not get too enthusiastic.On the flip-side we've got some of the performances. Of course, Halle Berry, is just a crashing bore. Her character Storm plans to take over after Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). This is a complete miscalculation by the filmmakers, as nobody really likes Storm. Storm's prominent role in the series has to do with Halle Berry's (undeserved) star status.Some of the mutants in the Brotherhood are really colorless, but I guess that's bound to happen as they are the villain's henchmen (and the movie only has 104 minutes at its disposal). In the first movie Singer used a couple of villains that worked great. In Penn and Kinberg's script there's a little too much going on, and too many characters - and so little time. I guess that's what happens when the production team has got 14 months to make a worthy sequel. They do succeed though - kind of. But they do not excel.",X-Men - The Last Stand
680,ian-262,Weakest of the three,3,7 June 2006,"This is basically a cheap action movie. Early on it shows some promise, but this is quickly squandered. The characters are poorly developed and they spend entirely too much time on Storm. Meanwhile most of the other mutants that should have been better developed aren't even one dimensional. It is obvious they have focused on the Storm character to appease Halle Berry, who has acted like a spoiled brat over the screen time given to what is basically a sideline character in the X-Men. We're left with a pale shadow of the first two movies that rests entirely on attempting to wow us with computer graphics. It's all old hat and time to start concentrating on things like good scripts with plots, characters and decent directors. This movie has an appalling script, poor characters and almost no plot.",X-Men - The Last Stand
681,mcewenks,A generally enjoyable film with a few major flaws,7,27 May 2006,"First off, X-Men: The Last Stand was by no means ""drivel."" In combination with the previous ventures, moviegoers and fans will receive a decent whole. The plot itself is not convoluted, but there are numerous mini-plots for just about every other character in the film. The huge number of plot lines Ratner chose to cast wound up limiting the film, removing key emotional elements. The film just was not long enough to adequately cover everyone's story. The music did not add anything to the movie either, it seemed tacky and amateur. Through length, plot numbers and music, X3 failed to properly and satisfyingly tie up the trilogy.Problems aside, X-Men did succeed in creating a fabulous action-driven film. Ratner and Fox worked magic on the special effects side of things. I was particularly impressed with the opening scene, which found a 20 year younger Xavier and Eric (Stewart and McKellan) at the house of Jean Grey. Despite being somewhat of a letdown, the film does bring in some interesting parallelism to the first two films. Speaking of the first films, I recommend viewing them right before or soon after seeing the third, as viewing them reminds you that you do care about the characters (being underdeveloped in X3). Most should find the third entry reasonably enjoyable and miles ahead of poorer entries into the superhero genre (Fantastic Four, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Ultraviolet, and the extraordinarily bad Batman Forever and Batman and Robin).",X-Men - The Last Stand
682,ImagoDei,What a mess...,3,4 June 2006,"XMen 3 is a special effects movie. Period. (This is not an endorsement btw.) Rattner does a great job of showing us really cool burning-cars-as-bombs, etc, but the weirdly rushed and glossed-over treatment of the human dimension left me nodding off. The telling of the story -- and explosions are *not* a ""story"" -- was simply a disaster. Thus... It was all about the explosions. I forgot everything about the movie by the time I got to my car.The way it was treated by Rattner, this ""cure"" for mutantism came across as non-compelling. Somebody announces a 5-second cure for mutantism in all its bazillion forms, and within 3 minutes we have a Race War, with thousands of 8th-tier mutants (Really-Bad-Dandruff-Man? Farts-Smell-Like-Chanel-#5 Girl?) lining up behind Magneto, who sets right out to destroy the world if the ""cure"" is not abandoned.Consider: Here you have a situation (far-fetched to be sure, given that ""mutantism"" isn't a specific condition, but a normal genetic process that leads to bio-diversity) that could have been very, very moving. EVERYONE in the audience can relate to being the outcast; what would you give up to ""fit in""? How would you decide? And should OTHER mutants have the right to choose for themselves? This final point -- that everyone should make their own choice -- is what our dear XMen should have concluded... with Magneto, like Osama, or Mao, or any megalomaniac throughout history deciding for everyone the way it's gonna be.Rattner's shorthand shortchanged any any pathos: or rather, there were little scenes here and there that said ""quick dose of pathos here, now let's get back to the action!"" Jean Grey -- Alive? Ugly? Who cares? Cyclops in tears? Who cares? Rogue, will she or won't she? Who cares? Oh well. It's just a movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
683,montella09,this one keeps you guessing,7,28 May 2006,"If you are a die-hard X-men fanatic like me, you probably went into this one a bit skeptical, especially with a change in director. However, I was pleasantly surprised by X-Men: The Last Stand and Brett Ratner's overall abilities as a director.I think the most important thing to point out about this film is that it wasn't the storyline or characters which made it stand out from the previous installments - it was the special effects and cinematography. Most of the scenes were incredibly done and I kept wondering throughout the film how long it must have taken to complete them (especially the Golden Gate Bridge sequence). I have to say that all of the computer generated graphics were the most realistic I think I've seen, easily on par with what was seen in the latest Star Wars or Spider-Man films.The story itself wasn't anything spectacular, and comparable to the last two, while also I must say remaining true to the characters in the comic books. Many aspects of the plot kept you guessing throughout and left me hoping for a sequel. With this in mind, things didn't get out of hand either and the film continued the same portrayal of the main characters as in the first two. Ratner also did a good job at not going overboard with the role of the Dark Pheonix which could easily have taken up too much of the story.The acting was for the most part as good as the previous films and Kelsey Grammar was a very convincing Beast. I did however notice the increase in the number of punch lines, pretty much anytime anyone was in a fight. Most were decent, but it kinda got out of hand, notably when Juggernaut cussed at a very young looking Kitty Pride (this is a family film right ?) Other than this, I didn't have any other complaints.Overall the film was a complete and entertaining action thrill ride which clearly had a much larger special effects budget than the previous installments. Cheers to Brett Ratner for staying true to the series as well as bringing to life more of the ""dazzle"" of the X-Men. 9/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
684,TheHarshAndLastWord,"An ""OK"" movie, but not for everyone",6,5 June 2006,"So it's finally here folks, X-men 3: The Last Stand. This is one of the few marvel films that I have been anticipating for awhile. With X-men being Marvel's first major franchise in the release of the new films I simply could not wait to see what happens! Sadly I was put through a roller coaster that I was eagerly getting ready to jump off of.these sections below contain spoilers-The Story Wow, what do I say about it. They suddenly FOUND a cure for the mutant gene. It just seemed TOO convenient. You got to remember X-men was a comic that was written around the time of the civil rights movement in the 60s. The comic stories were powerful and seeing their struggle past the segregation of certain factions is what ultimately fueled the fire for X-men, so yes. It seemed to let me down to say ""hey we found a cure"". It just was never plausible to me.-The Acting Majority of the acting is okay, okay for an action flick. The quirky one liners make a vengeful return in X3 and is actually more memorable than the story itself. sad really. Halle Barry portrays Storm once again, but sadly her performance is STILL lacking. She is definitely more of a key player in the film but ultimately the extra 5-10 min of extra screen time does nothing for her. She's still plays a relatively WEAK Storm. Her comic counterpart was seen almost Godly. She pales in comparison to bring that to big screen. She does much of the same change the weather and shock of a couple of people.-Errors and rewritesMost people won't understand this section, but the fans of the comics will. The MAIN flaw to X3 is they tried too hard to meld the regular X-men universe with its ""Ultimate"" universe counterpart. For those not well versed in the Ultimate series allow me to give you a small run down of what it is. The Ultimate Universe takes a lot of the key characters that we know of and change and refashion their story line. Perfect example pertaining to X3, Juggernaut and Xavier are not related like in the Ultimate series. Yet it choosing to do this RATNER confuses and bewilders a lot of the hardcore fans. I expected the story to be rewritten JUST AS LONG as the story they replace it with is not something a 1st grader came up with. Funniest continuity error is when dear old magneto severs the golden gate bridge during day time. A couple of minutes later the sun is setting and night fall has arrived. Lets just be glad Magneto doesn't work for the post office otherwise we'd get our mail extremely late.-Character DevelopmentIn choosing to do this Title Brett Ratner had a mountain of responsibility sitting on his shoulders. Yet again RATNER confuses people by introducing a wide plethora of new characters. Another main problem is all these characters are vying for screen time, but there simply is not enough time. Ratner never really elaborates on a individuals storyline. Wolverine obviously got the most exposure and still his storyline was slim to none existent. Jean Grey refits her new role as the phoenix, a darker evil split personality. In removing the cosmic fiery look of the phoenix it ultimately lessened the impact of the character. Not too mention she spends half the film standing around just staring at everyone. I could go on and on but if you're a reasonable viewer you'll catch much more problems.-Music Score Like most Fox titles the movie is accompanied with a beautiful orchestra, and X3 is no exception to that. Despite the problems X3 had the music was set just right. It helped build a scene and definitely distinguished when something important or climatic was happening. No problems here.-Overall the movie was good, but the shortened filming time definitely affected this movies story telling. They wanted a summer block buster and they got it. too bad its also a forgetful one. Its seems Ratner's main focus was for the action junkies, the extremists, those that love pointless fighting with no real storyline. If that's you're kind of cake then by all means take a slice. Personally I didn't enjoy it, there were too many things wrong with the movie to really enjoy. And no its not because it didn't follow the comics but simply because it failed to deliver as a whole movie. It almost felt as if they shot different story lines and tried to paste them all together at the last minute.6/10and that's the final word.",X-Men - The Last Stand
685,ISNIndigo,Least of the trilogy - a few problems but still a strong showing,7,27 May 2006,"Kowtowing to the wishes of Halle Berry has done significant damage. The movie was pretty much the Wolverine and Storm show because she demanded more to do as befits her station as an Oscar recipient. The problem is, she was given so much to do that short shrift was given to most of the other characters on team Xavier.I begin with the film's weaknesses first, because there were several.The plot had potential but fell short. The mutants you saw picketing the cure as well as the mutants lining up for it -- looked like normal people. There were few drastic mutations on anyone except Magneto's team. This made things look bad for Xavier's team, too, for that matter; Xavier's group is the one with the dream of unity between human and mutant, and his team had the ""pretty"" mutations.The special effects were less than sensible. The scene wherein Magneto rescues Mystique does have the cool factor, but it falls flat because although Mystique, Madrox, and Juggernaut were all treated as ""dangerous criminals"", and the government acknowledged that capturing Mystique was inviting Magneto's wrath -- they had these prisoners in a convoy of _all metal vehicles._ It's only later in the movie when they're going ""no metal, no metal."" Fans of the comic would spot discontinuities in the characters Magneto recruits.It seemed this movie was built with ""let's do fan favourites and show off how cool our special effects are, but barely attend to anything else"" in mind first and foremost.The Danger Room is only obvious for what it is if you're a comic reader. It's never identified, nor is the Sentinel Wolverine takes down. Likewise, neither is the Fastball Special move wherein Colossus throws Wolverine at an enemy.Jean Grey as Phoenix without a Phoenix Effect is practically a slap in the face to a comic reader. Also, she's supposed to be as beautiful as she is terrible, but the effects used made her look psychotic, and like her powers were destroying her from the inside out.Angel's part is small and not memorable. Leech's part likewise. The majority of the other mutants were just extras thrown in to be Magneto's army...All that out of the way, what there is good about this movie is the characterization. Rock solid. Well portrayed for the most part.Beginning with Sir Ian McKellan as Magneto: The man goes from being charming and campy in one scene to tragic in another, to cold and heartless, to astonishingly respectful, to briefly benevolent, and back to ruthless and vicious. His range is seemingly without limit, and every moment he's on the screen, he's captivating.Rebecca Romijin has barely any screen time, but she does well with Mystique. Her acting for two movies and part of a third was mostly through airbrushed blue paint, contacts, and latex prosthetics, and she pulled that off. She was able to portray Mystique's adoring devotion to Magneto believably, and more, to portray her shattering sense of horrified betrayal when Magneto turns his back on her.Paquin was a little overwrought as Rogue, but that's forgivable as her character is the one X-Man who might genuinely benefit from a cure.Stewart was a little understated, still playing the kindly Xavier, even when his ethics were questionable. And that was chilling, really. He did things he wasn't sure weren't reprehensible himself, but with the conviction he was doing them for the best reasons. And Stewart made that visible.Grammar as the Beast was the best bit of new casting for this movie. He had the intellectual, elegant, classy vibe completely down to an art.Janssen as Phoenix/Jean was actually one of the best acted parts in the movie. Despite a horrible costuming job, an atrocious wig, and practically no lines at all, she portrayed the fight of good Jean Grey vs. chaotic Phoenix persona all the way through the movie. People who don't understand how Wolverine could get thrown around by her in one scene but he gets near to her in the end aren't noticing this subtlety of the performance...Jean loved Logan in her way, and was allowing him close enough to stop her while she still could.Jackman as Wolverine pulled off the complexity of the most popular character. Again, people who thought that Wolverine's show of emotion was unseemly and out of character for him miss the subtlety of his performance, and the depth of character; Wolverine has always been more than animal senses and claws.Berry as Storm is as she has been throughout the series -- consistently bad. Her scenes are either overacted or under-acted. The best scenes in which Storm appears are the ones that should've been in from the first two movies -- Storm using her powers. Any talented woman who took the role seriously could've done better. She has more to do, but thankfully, the special effects do most of the brilliance of the character here because Berry has never respected the role to do more than phone in her ""performance."" This said, it's still a decent movie. It is clear that multiple script changes, directoral musical chairs, and the rushed script-to-release are why there are so many obvious flaws. It's the weakest of the trilogy, but the darkness and characterization kind of outstrip the problems with script and direction. With any luck, the DVD will have deleted scenes that fill those in. As a summer blockbuster goes, it's good. As an X-Men movie goes, it's so-so at best, especially in comparison with the first two. But so-so is still pretty entertaining.",X-Men - The Last Stand
686,Michael Heide,I want Bryan Singer back.,2,28 May 2006,"This film has three major flaws compared to the previous X-Men films.1.: It's set up as the final film of a trilogy. The first movie introduced the characters, the second movie started building upon the first. The third one tears everything down. Why? Why aggressively end a successful franchise? Especially if you could replace every character (if an actor doesn't want to reprise the role) with one of the countless mutants in the comic books? The X-Men franchise could have spawned another twenty movies, but no - this has to be the final film. So they kill off characters left and right, take away the powers of important characters from 1 and 2 and basically destroy the franchise. Yeah, I've seen the hidden scene after the credits that would allow a sequel. But unless you take the Halloween H20 (or Superman) approach and ignore everything after #2, it still wouldn't work. How could it work? And it's not like the characters die in the final battle. Most of the major players from the previous movies die (or lose their powers) in the first third of the movie, leaving us with a boring X-Men lineup and a no-name Brotherhood of Mutants.2.: Too much is going on. The first movie introduced us to the characters, mainly to Wolverine and Rogue. The two of them stumbled into a mutant vs mutant conflict. While it had its twists, the movie was pretty straightforward, tying everything nicely together. The second movie was similar. We already knew the characters, got introduced to another one (Nightcrawler) who stumbled into a mutant vs human conflict. Another straightforward story with a few nice twists, and yet every step logically followed the one before. In X-Men 3, we are flooded with plots. The cure. Angel. Jean Grey. Rogue and Iceman (and Kitty Pryde and Pyro). And while we are waiting for the plot threads to tie together for the showdown, we're already in the middle of it. Very disappointing. Some plots (Angel?) aren't resolved at all. And don't expect to find characterization. We don't even get to know Colossus' name (he gets called ""Pete"" once, and that's about it). And what happened to Nightcrawler? I'm told that I have to buy or at least play the video game, but just a single line in the movie would have been enough.3.: I miss the layers. The first film worked on several levels. Of course it was an action movie. A science fiction movie. A superhero movie. But it worked as a metaphor as well. Here we had outcasts of society. A minority looking for their place in the world. One group of mutants assembled around a Malcolm X type character that wanted mutants integrated into society, with brute force - if necessary. The other half of the mutants followed the Martin Luther King type character, who wanted a peaceful coexistence. The second film had one of the best scenes of any comic book adaption. A character comes out of the mutant closet in front of his parents. He is embarrassed. They are shocked. His mother asks him if he ever tried not to be a mutant. And his brother calls the cops. Beautiful, and I'm not gay myself. Movie #3 was nothing but pointless slam-bam-explosions left and right. It's what I'd expect from a Bay or Emmerich film. But not from the X-Men.All in all, a very unsatisfying and anti-climatic third episode of an otherwise great series. The special effects are the only reason this film gets a ""2"" instead of a ""1"".If you want X-Men, the money is better spent on comic books (or the excellent first two films).",X-Men - The Last Stand
687,DuaceMaxell,simply awesome,10,26 May 2006,"This movie had enough for everyone, minor plot points and technical tit-for-tat of what is true to the comics did very little to waver this juggernaut of a movie. The sounds are louder, the mutant powers more extreme, and of course the stakes have been raised dramatically. The movie was so jammed packed that it felt more like a large inhalation rather than an epic movie. The one hour and forty minutes go by without even being noticed. It is true that storm has a larger role, in addition to this, wolverine's ability seems to get elevated to immortal status. Of course this is fine with me because I like both of the characters.Other than that, Go and see for yourself, it really is one heck of a beginning for this summer's movie calendar. Oh and definitely stay after the credits !!! for the love of everything sacred stay after the credits : )",X-Men - The Last Stand
688,garyhobson,Disappointing,4,18 July 2007,"SPOILER ALERTAfter what I thought were mediocre outings for the first 2 X-Men movies, I went into this with somewhat high expectations. I was disappointed.I think 2 things are required to make a good superhero comic book to movie adaption.1. Good acting likewise with all other movies 2. Great action to showcase their super powersOK well I think the acting was fine, not that it mattered anyway. Patrick Stuart as usual, excellent. A shame he had to die though. X-Men 3 failed in the action department when it mattered: the end. The end was were it really mattered, because I thought almost all of the movie was mediocre up to that point. And if there was a good ending, that'll be more than enough to make up for it.What do we get instead? About 50 raving mutant lunatics running to their demise against the humans armed with anti-mutant guns (the new weapon that the humans developed to instantly remove mutant powers). That didn't make sense at all. Were they really that stupid? The mutant's powers were pathetic and they didn't put up a fight at all. Silly scene. Iceman and Pyro squaring off. It seems these 2 guys hated each other, so I expected a big fight. I didn't get that. We got Pyro shooting his fire at Iceman. Iceman shooting his ice at Pyro. Pyro is winning... Iceman weakening. Iceman steps it up another gear and overpowers Pyro to win... woodeedoo. At first sight that scene would have looked cool. But if you step back and have a think about, really it was cheap and unoriginal, tied in with expensive special effects to make it look cool. Nah, not cool at all. Iceman big let down.I think that was the movie's biggest problem. We never really get to see the mutants fight each other with their mutant powers properly. I mean, they do use their powers, but it's just too underwhelming! You don't need flashy special effects to make it happen. Look at the old Superman movies, see what I mean?!Star of the movie. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.I suspect a 4th X-Men movie after seeing Magneto move that chess piece slightly at the end. If that is true, it'll have to be far far far better than this!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
689,Czes,Good third installment,7,27 May 2006,"After Bryan Singer decided to leave the series, Brett Ratner took control over the third X-Men movie. I was a little bit afraid of him, because I think he made only one watchable movie this far (Red Dragon). Fortunately he could make a nice movie again, which isn't as good, as the second one, but it's definitely worth watching. The story is completely different from the comics (but some coincidences can be found with older X-Men comics, for example the destruction of the Golden Gate bridge). [*spoilers from here*] I felt, that there was too much mutant in the story, which lead to nothing (for example the three new member in Magneto's society were killed in a single second by Jean/Phoenix). Colossus has nothing to do with anything in the movie (he throws Wolwerine twice, and that's all the part he has). It was also interesting, that Jean Grey kills Professor X and Cyclops - however, we know that in a Hollywood-movie and in a comic book, a character's death never holds back him for returning in the next chapter - remember, Jean Grey died in X2, too. I was surprised, that Magneto was ""cured"" - I would have never expected the main evil mutant to get out of the X's way. The ending, where Magneto plays chess is absolutely terrific, it shows, how lonely and meaningless his life became, and it's also a good reference to the ending of the first X-Men movie, where he plays chess with X Professor - now he plays alone. (Howewer, it's an interesting question, how can he be at large after all the things he has done against humanity.)After all, X-Men: The Last Stand won't disappoint the fans, it's a good movie, but don't expect something like X2 - it's a little bit different, but still good and worth a try.",X-Men - The Last Stand
690,curtains,Should have waited for Brian Singer...,6,7 November 2006,"Imagine it like this. You leave your home in the hands of a friend while you're away on holiday. You come back, the kitchen has burnt down, the pets are dead and what used to be upstairs is now a makeshift Gazebo in your front lawn.Ratner did not have the investment of Singer or the fans in this film and he did not treat it with the respect it deserved.He dropped an immensely well acted and favoured character from the series.He took Joss Whedon's premise and did it himself, never a good start - Alien Resurrection anyone? The plot is mangled and nonsensical.He then took liberties and leaps with the characters he had no right to. So drastic that it is now almost impossible for anyone to reassemble the pre-X3 franchise in any sensible way.He didn't understand the relationships between the characters and didn't try to. These are not the characters that we left in X2. The effects are cool, there are some neat moments but there is none of the emotional resonance or connection with the characters the other films had. He sacrificed what could have been great for the sake of a poorly done ""shock"" moment and some cool effects that will age quickly.Watch, if only to see and learn why sometimes it is best to wait for a genius than hire a stand in.",X-Men - The Last Stand
691,radioanagrama,"Absolutely entertaining, intelligent and visually stunning.",8,31 May 2006,"I thought it was completely awesome and very very entertaining.People that are claiming they didn't enjoy it or it diverted from the comic book too much have to realize that the movies still have to be completely accessible to everyone. You can't make a $150 million movie and then just try and appeal to the purists.I think it was an epic storyline, intelligent ideas were posed, obviously had some cheesy Hollywood-isms but that is unavoidable. The effects were amazing and it really did look like the first full fledged superhero flick were the effects were able to capture everyones powers and potential visually, you just cant have too many FX shots in a movie like x-men, because its a movie where basically two waring factions of mutants do battle....the effects were never excessive or cheesy.Even the scene where the 7 remaining X-Men are going to do battle and Wolverine utters the phrase ""as x-men"" for the first time in the series was cool in the same sense that there was some comeradary in the animated TV series, that moments was actually sweet but cool.It's too bad they had to offer Storm so much screen time, because Halle Berry gets bloody annoying sometimes.Obviously a lot of people preferred aspects of the Bryan Singer movies (the first two) mainly the deeper character development. Whereas X2 was all Logan, at least this one delved pretty deep into Jean Grey, and still moved the pace of the entire big story of the X-Men along very effectively.and ultimately I hope its the last one unless they get an unbelievably great script with like Gambit and stuff for the next one. .",X-Men - The Last Stand
692,ironman9932,Could've been better...,6,20 January 2011,"Now X3 is not a horrible movie, don't get me wrong. But is a bit of a let down. Unfortunately Bryan Singer wasn't able to direct this film because he was occupied with ""Superman Returns"", so who steps up to the plate- Brett Ratner. If you've seen ""Rush Hour 3"", then you honestly have a pretty good idea what to expect from this film. The film is over all too short. Consider this, the first film was under two hours, simply a film overall to introduce the characters and set up their relationships. The second is a two hour elaboration of the first, with even more characters and though many problems are solved, many new arise along with them. It was the perfect set up for a third film. This film garnishes that in favor of a mediocre purely action driven storyline.Cyclops, who was played so well as James Marsden, is basically not even apart of the plot. And Jean is a major plot point, but she says so little she becomes like a ghost to everyone else. And the last action scene on Alcatraz just makes little sense and was poorly executed. The Brotherhood's army felt like a bunch of random normal people who got killed off way too easily, and Magneto, a God in every right, has his powers drained away from him in a fraction of a second with a few tiny dosages of this so called cure. it was just rock bottom rushed plot development. I mean if you're the average movie goer who loves action you'll probably love it, but if you're a real X Men fan you'll be let down.",X-Men - The Last Stand
693,GPMDan,"Packed with action, mutants, but where's the depth?",6,26 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand is an enjoyable movie; if you came seeking a thrill ride with all kinds of action and a fast, breakneck pace. Compared to the previous two installments, however, it lacks the depth and development that Bryan Singer and his team instilled to the story. Brett Ratner touches on a lot of story lines but either sews them up instantly or leaves them hanging, making us wonder what happened.Wolverine (Logan) almost seems like an accessory at times, not as integral to the storyline as he has been in the first two movies, and the only character who appears to be the core is Jean Grey (Phoenix). While the mutant cure storyline is really the main thread throughout the movie, the focus gets muddy as mutants are introduced and integrated to the fast-moving story.The action and effects are really spectacular in parts, especially the Golden Gate Bridge being 'rearranged' by Magneto.Anyhow, overall it's a movie people will go see and probably a hit one at that, but die-hard X-Men fans will be disheartened and disappointed at the lack of character development and direction of the film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
694,BarkingDoc,Entertaining but not exciting,6,30 May 2006,"The third installment in the X-Men series is entirely watchable, but doesn't have anything to get excited about. The direction is smooth and competent, the actors all show up to do their job adequately, and the design and special effects are close to top of the line. As with most comic book sequels (think Batman Forever), the film suffers enormously from being stuffed with so many plots that none of them has any time to develop or take on any weight or meaning. There are at least four major story lines, any of which could have made a great movie, but together they are so rushed that it is almost comical. What should be breathtaking revelations or shocking, deeply moving developments are all treated as minor plot points as the movie saunters toward its only real reason for existing, the final big action set piece. That piece is well staged and pretty to watch, but with no investment in any of the stories, the climax is nothing more than a nice circus fireworks show. X-Men is still deeper and more creative than any other action franchise--- the central metaphor is always appealing, watching super-heroes is a lot more fun than watching little men run around with big guns, and it is the only big movie world that includes women as more than just sex props. But this installment reaches too far and, as a result, does far too little. Enjoy it, but don't expect anything more than a glossy big budget puppet show.",X-Men - The Last Stand
695,demonichorde69,A terrible ending to a great series,1,26 May 2006,"This movie started bad and ended even worse. From the very beginning with a terrible action sequence full of badly delivered one liners i knew this movie was in trouble. When mutants start dying at the beginning and the reasons for their deaths are badly explained things got worse. When the majority of the dialogue was between iceman and his girls i really started to get a headache. But when i found out that Storm would have a large part i really started shaking my head. This movie just went from bad to worst and from cliché to cliché. Granted some of the action was good but nothing was just astounding. Juggernaught was cool and that was about the only part of the movie i did like. Even he was done completely wrong. They need to learn to cater to the real fans. If your going to make a movie make the movie good, don't destroy one of the greatest comic book series in history by turning in this piece of crap ending. We all deserved better then this Mr. Ratner, you should learn to direct before taking on such a project.",X-Men - The Last Stand

But now to the good ... no the best : PHOENIX ! That was such a cool and stunning character and the director ports it superb to the big screen.

697,paultd,New guys on the block have totally lost the plot,3,3 June 2006,"My my, what a change of director and screenplay writer can do for a franchise.After the brilliant X1 and the solid X2, we now have main characters solely for comic value (read: The Beast), a plethora of bad and good guys that we can barely keep track of before they're all vaporized anyway, so I ask the makers of the film this: would you rather have Juggernaught Bitch or Gambit, really. We don't need this many heroes, and certainly not this many meaningless ones.Nowhere to be seen is the awe-inspiring Nightcrawler (for reasons explained only in the even more crappy video game), replaced somewhat by the totally ineffective guy with angel wings. Yea, that's right, I don't even know his name. Nor do I care to find out, either. Performing a Deus-Ex Machina requires that you build up some credit beforehand.Let's talk a little about Phoenix. Why does she love standing around so much doing absolutely nothing? And does her execution mean that it is true that some of us are beyond redemption? And why exactly does she mindlessly follow Magneto onto the Golden Gate Bridge fiasco? She doesn't even like him, and is probably aware of what's going on, judging by her remark ""you're just like him (Xavier)"".You know, despite all the overdone explosions occurring every five seconds, Stewart, McKellen, and a select few others manage to turn in some jolly damn good performances. Better even than their contributions to the first two films, I would say. Unfortunately any of the talent being displayed is so completely buried beneath a massive pile of improbabilities and inanities.It's a cardinal rule of film - you can't be killing off your main characters so frequently. The audience will feel disconnected. Another cardinal rule is not to cheapen those deaths by miraculous resurrections (even if they do happen after the credits) or the regaining of powers. I know, I know, this last part was adhering to the comic, but if you don't adhere to the comic in other important areas, why should you here, when it only serves to lessen the emotional impact? There are only hints to some of these, but the hints are essentially foreshadowing, else it would be stupid to give such hints.I am seriously disappointed, and I sincerely hope this is the end of the X-Men films.

The first two movies really captured the essence of the book - misfits trying to find their place in the world as a team.This movie went for the all action - lots of characters but no substance - no story flick. Just like the ""Rush Hour"" movies. Quite sad considering Brett Ratner did the 'Prison Break' pilot about a group of misfits trying to breakout of prison as team.

A cry unheeded given that the movie after this was somehow worse, which is saying something given how bad this one is.This writer and director take all of the blame here. They clearly had funding to do whatever they wanted, and the cast were the same talented people from the 2 previous iterations, but some how the writer and director drove the franchise straight into a wall.Comic books are tough material to work with. There is a lot of back story, and a fan base who like that backstory, but then there are the practical matters of filming, making a story only around two hours long is very limiting. However, the writer clearly disrespected the material from the get go. Threw things out, made thing up, for no good reason. The director then proceeded to murder the franchise, weaving a barely coherent narrative, and getting mediocre performances out of normally outstanding actors.If your looking to save some time, just skip this one. It's so meaningless that it's essentially unwritten in later editions of the franchise. That is how much of a waste of time it is.",X-Men - The Last Stand

It is one of the campiest, cheesiest scripts I've seen for an A-list movie in the past few years. Especially, the scenes involving the President. Fortunately, you have three of the greatest actors in the biz today leading the charge: Sir Ian McKellan, Patrick Stuart, and Hugh Jackman (if you disagree with that last one, find his London Revival of ""Oklahoma!"" and watch it back to back with either of the first two X-Men films).

703,elvato87,"Good, but still disappointing",7,29 May 2006,"First of all, let me say that X3 was a great action film. If you want to have a great time at the movies, this is a fun film to watch. However, as a fan of X-Men and the film trilogy, there were some problems with the film. There are a lot of characters that are undeveloped. It's not such a problem with the one's we already know, but it is for the one's that we don't. There's also unneeded information for certain characters that aren't really in the movie. Certain characters play big roles, but we don't get to know them. Others have minor roles, and the info is meaningless. For instance, a character is introduced in the prologue to the movie, but is barely seen in the remainder of the film. The movie was way too short. It seems like everyone's in a hurry throughout the film. If it had been 2 and a half hours, it would have been able to develop all of the characters, and the back stories would have been more relevant to certain characters. The movie is action packed and fun, but it really doesn't draw you into it the way the first two did, say for a couple of scenes. Overall, it was worth seeing on the big screen, and I'm glad that I saw it. It is a good film.

Let's go for X-Men four!,10,28 May 2006,"A very good third installment to the series, but remember, just cause it's called ""The Last Stand"" doesn't mean it's the last movie. Be sure to stay until after the credits too, there's something waiting for you at the very end.I became a fan of X-men only a few weeks ago when we rented the first two from Blockbuster, and boy was I hooked! Superheros have become my new favorites. There's plenty of action to satisfy the fans of the last two movies. I heard there was a new director but to be honest I didn't even notice any changes, and I actually pay attention to those kinds of things. Enjoy it!",X-Men - The Last Stand
705,Izzy_Duquette,Wishing There Was More To It,6,28 May 2006,"Never having read the comic books I view the XMen movies as just that - movies. I loved the first two but was slightly disappointed with the third installment.This film is darker and more intense than the first two - the development of Jean Grey as the Phoenix is a fantastic storyline, and Famke Janssen is amazing as a woman with no control over the creature that lives within her soul. She is at once evil, lost, confused, dangerous and lovable.However, with the second storyline concerning a mutant ""cure"" taking up most of the screen time the Dark Phoenix story is pushed into the background and this brings out the faults with the film. Some of the dialogue is missing the sharpness and wit of the first two movies and there are more new mutants introduced in this than there were in the second movie - and thus, not many (if any) are given much character development. The Cure storyline overshadows the more emotional and important Phoenix storyline and as a result almost every mutant seems out of character.That aside the direction is good - the final fight is amazing, as is the heartbreaking scene between Jean and Wolverine. Watch till the end of the credits for an extra scene.With surprises around every corner and a higher death count than the first two films combined, XMen 3 does its' best to end the trilogy in a satisfactory way, but you just can't help but wish that there was more to it.",X-Men - The Last Stand

707,OriginalSheady,Excellent,9,30 May 2006,"Wow, I saw this film today and, what a film! It contains so much action compared to the other two films, with special effects that are out-of-this-world. We see the full potential of the mutants powers, as well as of the powers of new mutants, and rather dominates the film. It twists and turns in all sorts of directions, reminiscent of Star Wars episode III, in that it kills central characters, which is a daring thing to. do, yet it also adds depth to the story. OK, ""b*tch"" is used excessively, some characters don't get an opportunity to extend to their full potential (e.g. Juggernaut), but it's an amazing experience to see. Also, Magneto, my favourite character in the series, also shines, along with Storm, who gets a more crucial role. A great, entertaining, film and a great conclusion to the trilogy. Let's hope it isn't ruined by an attempt at making a fourth movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
708,ayed,incoherent mess,3,26 May 2006,"what a disappointment! while the first two installments of this series were far from classics, they at least stayed (relatively) true to the characters and were internally consistent, plot-wise (of course, they deviate quite a bit from the long and convoluted history of the X-Men in the comics, but that is to be expected -- and isn't a problem for me, as long as the stories make sense). you will search in vain for that kind of competent film-making here, as daytime scenes suddenly turn to night (for no reason & without time elapsing), characters come and go with little or no explanation or motive, and the plot ""develops"" with no discernible reasons or direction. as always, there are some nifty special effects, but as g. lucas has amply proved, special effects wizardry in the absence of good dialogue and plot is an empty exercise indeed. amazingly, hack director brett ratner (who only took over this project after he nearly ruined the new Superman movie -- and ya gotta wonder why the producers would hire him after he got fired from that project) can't even coax good performances out of highly gifted actors like hugh jackman and halle berry (patrick stewart and ian mckellan were still good, although they had precious little to work with here).take my advice -- wait for the DVD if you must see this, it just isn't worth the money in the theatres. and make sure to RENT the DVD, you will not want to watch it more than once.",X-Men - The Last Stand
709,Jason60,Bret Ratner ruined a franchise,1,26 May 2006,"Simple. You can't kill Professor X. Bret Ratner ruined the franchise. I cannot express enough how poor the story was for this movie. The movie was entirely special effects driven. As a fan of the comic and a fan of the previous two movies I just want you to know that there was no justification for the directions that this script went. You can't kill Cyclops, you can't kill Jean Grey, and you can't kill Professor X. Why? It's like making a Superman movie and having him die at the end, or ending the Friends series with the apartment blowing up with all of the friends in it. It makes no sense, and no one wants to see it. Those characters were too important to the franchise and there is no justification for what Bret Ratner did. To me it only showed that he had no idea what X-Men was about nor any respect for the characters. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
710,carnegis,Not even close to the first 2,5,1 June 2006,"First off, I'm not a comic book fan nor do I know very much about the X-Men other than the movies and I am a fan of movies. That being said, I thought the first two movies were excellent and that X2 is one of the best movies of the decade. I had high expectations coming in though I was somewhat concerned knowing that Bryan Singer wasn't involved since director's play such a big part.The best sequels enable you to watch the movie without having to have seen the originals. This movie was not like that at all, if you didn't see either original you would have been somewhat lost. Keep in mind that I have no problems with the movie not following the comic story lines, I see the movie as an entity unto itself.Good - acting, action, visual fx - The Rouge storyline - ""The Cure"" storylineBad - continuity (going instantly from day to night at the bridge, huge mistake. - plausibility (why didn't they just take a boat, what was the motivation for a bridge besides a cool looking effect) - character depth lacking. Why care about Jean, she hardly spoke. Why care about the bald kid, there was no emotion. Why care about Rouge, etc. What is the motivation for these new guys? - Killing a major character early on, why even care about his death if he isn't developedThe first 2 movies were great, this one is an okay final chapter.

711,giddeo,This film made me cry,1,25 April 2009,"I was recently asked to name the top 5 movies that made me cry5. Dumbo 4. Bambi 3. Jersey Girl 2. Dragonball Evolution 1. X-Men 3So bad is this movie I feel the need to review it again if I haven't done already just to bury it for good.X-men 1 was well thought out and built the story X-men 2 the hype is building, story laid out characters explained X-men 3 All they had to do was add the finishing touches. They could have made a good film without concluding the saga... but no.Oh God where to startThey started throwing in random mutants and killing them off with out a care. They took established characters from the series and put them in situations that just didn't make sense. The Juggernaut, kept in a moving car and not nearly as big as he is in the comics? Magneto throwing cars and the other mutant setting fire to them, as though being hit by a car wouldn't be quite enough to kill someone? Why not just shoot flames at the X-men.Its this complete lack of forward thinking that echoes throughout the whole movie. All could be forgiven if they had just told a simple story but instead they took huge aspects of the comic and threw them in everywhere without explanation, completely killing any opportunity for a sequel, hence the release of a prequel.Right at the beginning you see a sentinal head... The Sentinals were near unstoppable and now they're being used in a training program?? That's a HUGE plot aspect that they can NEVER look into. Completely gone because the director felt the need to spice up a prop. The fact that its included at all just throws up so many questions.Even disregarding the blatant hatred the director felt for the franchise the movie is so cliché its unbearable. beast is a wasted character and everything is so one directional.Its just terrible.I hold out hope for the day they re-make X-men 3 and pretend like this never happened.Yes, its that bad.",X-Men - The Last Stand
712,warnellsoto,The saga is dead!,1,26 May 2006,"This guy (the director) just killed the saga. The movie is boring, it is does not respect the comics. It seems as if the director has never read a Xmen Comic. The phoenix story line is stupid. And this also is not according the comics. 3 of the good guys die and none of the bad ones.If the director had decide to eliminate the Rogue, Ciclops and Archangel characters, that should be OK because those 3 did nothing in the movie.The archangel storyline is completely opposed to the comics.Again, the Xmen movies saga is dead!",X-Men - The Last Stand
713,papa_mcphat,A shame if you enjoyed the first two...,4,27 February 2008,"Imagine if Michelangelo only completed 2/3rd's of the Sistine Chapel. Now imagine if the Pope handed a 5 year old boy a box of crayons and told him to finish it. Thinking it would be ""cool,"" the boy goes on to finish the work of art by scribbling a bunch of random scenes involving monster trucks with lasers and robots fighting each other. That pretty much sums up how I felt when I left the theater after seeing X-men 3. Singer did such a wonderful job building up the characters and atmosphere in the previous two films only to have the series finished by Ratner, who only seemed concerned with fight scenes and special effects. I would write a plot summary, but that clearly wasn't the selling point of this movie. Rather, Ratner's approach to making X3 seemed to be, ""Okay I've got some really cool ideas for fight scenes and special effects. Now let's build a movie around them."" Consequently, there was scene after scene in this movie with no other purpose. For example, what was the point in moving the golden gate bridge, the most expensive special effect in the movie (and yes I know it was to reach Alcatraz, but think about it)? What was the point in the fight scene between Wolverine and the Juggernaut in Jean's house? There was none. If you would like plenty more examples of scenes that were completely pointless read any IMDb review with 5 stars or less (there are plenty). And so much for character development. This flick introduced about 2 billion new characters to the trilogy. Rather than develop any of them individually, Ratner paints all the sub-villains as ""Goth"" and doesn't even bother trying to develop the rest. The only characters I felt any emotion for were the ones that Singer developed in the previous films and by emotion I mean utter disappointment for what could have been.The director also seemed to assume his audience was a bunch of complete idiots. Gone were the subtleties that enhanced the plot of X2. Gone were any opportunities for the audience to reach conclusions by themselves. In place, the characters often explained/narrated everything they did like a bad episode of Thundercats. This movie also had the largest continuity error I've ever seen (i.e., the change from day to night when Magnito moved the bridge followed by another continuity error where all the cars remained on the bridge after magneto threw them at the police). Not to mention that entire scene was just plain retarded. Rather than Pyro lighting the cars on fire as magneto hurled them why didn't magneto just hurl everything at the police while Pyro, I don't know, burned the people directly?Normally I would say to avoid this movie like it came with an airborne form of herpies (and most of the people I saw the movie with would agree). However, one of the guys I went to the theater with thoroughly enjoyed X3. Why? Because he loves action flicks and wasn't in the mood for a movie that made him think. I suppose that's true; if you can turn your brain off it is a decent action flick. Therefore, if you're planning on viewing this, be aware it isn't anything like the first two movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
714,Hushpuppy_20,James Marsden was cut out again...,4,11 June 2006,"I've never been a big fan of cyclops, but has anyone else noticed how much he's been cut out of all three of the X-Men movies? In X2 he was kidnapped and had to be rescued and in this film he's only given like 10 minutes of screen time. James Marsden has been an allot of decent movies and for him to have less screen time than Psylocke or Spike(!?) isn't cool. He's the leader of the freakin' X-Men after all. I wonder if it was script rewrites for Halle Berry that led to his diminished role, or maybe they were a tad angry James got cast (In a more prominent role no less) in the other big Summer superhero movie ""Superman"" along with the man that actually could direct a decent X-Men film, Bryan Singer.",X-Men - The Last Stand

716,skluczkiewicz,Not as good as the others but I liked it,6,30 May 2006,"This movie had a lot of hype as well as expectations (thanks to it's predecessors) to live up to and for the most part I think it accomplished that. There are some disappointing things: the main one is that there is a lot of plot and sub-plot that is covered and not enough time to do it in; you don't get to see the abilities of a lot of the mutants on Magneto's side; (possible spoiler) I was surprised that NightCrawler wasn't in this one- I really enjoyed his character in X-Men II; (possible spoiler) the sort-of love triangle of IceMan, Rogue and Kitty seemed silly and unnecessary; and finally I thought Angel would play a more prominent role. On the positive side: the effects were fantastic; you finally get to see what Jean Grey is truly capable of; Juggernaut was a cool character; Storm was a stronger character compared to the other movies (thanks to Halle Berry's ""request""); Beast was excellent and I was highly surprised and pleased with Kelsey Grammar's performance in this role. In the end, I felt what was wrong or missing with this movie didn't take away from the thrill ride this movie is. After all, I wasn't going into this movie expecting to see Citizen Kane. I wanted to be entertained and I was. This is an excellent movie to sit back, relax, get your popcorn and enjoy. On a ten-scale, I'd give it a 7.5 but since IMDb doesn't do half's I'd be willing to give it the extra 1/2 so it gets an 8.",X-Men - The Last Stand
717,topdyke-1,"Why, oh why did you leave Bryan Singer?",3,16 June 2008,"The movie series that started the superhero film boom has unfortunately ended on a tragic note.Bryan Singer, the genius behind the delight that was the first two films decided to pull out to focus on his new project ""Superman Returns.""I do respect his decision, especially since ""Superman Returns"" was a pretty decent film.But I, like many extremely disgruntled X-Men fans am appalled at how the finale in the trilogy was handled. This installment has ignored the excellent writing of the first two, which was full of witty remarks, and excellent story-telling, and instead has reverted to sensationalist action, without any semblance of a logical plot.The painstaking development of nearly every mutant's character in the first two movies has been shamefully cast aside. New mutants like Juggernaut and Angel are treated very poorly, seemingly only thrown in to showcase their abilities with special effects. Not to mention the fact that Juggernaut looks absolutely ridiculous.The acting by proxy suffers as well. Clearly reluctant performances by Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen as Wolverine and Magneto respectively are obviously just fulfillments of contract obligations. Nightcrawler, who was played by Alan Cumming in the last film has mysteriously, and without explanation disappeared. A tragedy, since Cumming, who redeemed himself from his appearance in ""The Son of the Mask"" with a fantastic performance in X2, capturing the isolation and confusion one would expect from such a character.By the ending battle sequence, what little storyline there was is buried beneath overly extravagant special effects and violence.This film is a clear indicator that the right movie in the wrong hands (Brett Ratner) is always, ALWAYS a recipe for absolute cinematic disaster.If only Singer had returned, we fans of this engrossing series would have received the satisfying conclusion we were all aching for after the end of X2.",X-Men - The Last Stand
718,Seven_Thunders,A sad end for what could have been a lucky three...,4,27 May 2006,"X3 is not unlike Star Wars: Episode III. Both have huge budgets. Both have huge budgets that were entirely dedicated to visual splendor. Don't get me wrong - the action scenes were really cool. They didn't skimp on those, and I was really impressed by how faithfully they treated Hank 'Beast' McCoy. Kudos to Ratner and team in that respect. But what we have here is an extremely rushed production intended to beat the Superman Returns juggernaut (pardon the pun), partly out of desperation and partly out of retaliation against Bryan Singer (X-Men, X2) for leaving.***MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*** The film starts off with an arbitrary flashback showing us a young Professor X and Magneto (still played by Stewart and McKellan) approaching Jean Grey and her parents about Jean's mutant ability, which her parents refer to as an illness. Xavier and Lensherr speak with Jean alone and we get an idea of how powerful her ability really is and the potential for evil. Xavier offers to help her control the power she has.Flash forward about ten years, where we see a young Warren Worthington III (aka Angel) in a bathroom using a sharp object to cut something on his back. His billionaire father approaches the bathroom and demands he open the door. Warren frantically begins putting away all the cutting tools he was using. Upon hearing all the clanking, Warren's father breaks open the door and sees what is happening. Warren begins to cry. We see in the mirror the jagged shafts of feathers growing from his shoulder blades, to his father's utter dismay.Flash forward to present day, where the cure for mutancy has been discovered by none other than the elder Warrington using his son as the catalyst. We then flash forward to the present.And that's all the story you get. From there on out, it's nothing but a patchwork of events that tried too hard to fit two movies into one. Jean Grey, having been killed in X2, is back as Dark Phoenix. Her death in the previous film undid a series of psychic blocks Xavier put in her mind to control the evil persona. Her story is not developed in any way, nor his her strange energy absorbing power, and becomes a mere plot attraction. Though fans of the comic will understand it perfectly -having read the Phoenix Saga- the rest of the audience won't. She serves no intrinsic function in the story other than to up the stakes of battle and even that doesn't go the distance.Then there is the part about the cure. Magneto's band of villainous mutants prepare to unleash their power on the human race and the island where the cure was developed. A lot of typical ethics issues come up, and the mutants are uncharacteristically split over this issue. Like they're going to just give up their identity after fighting so hard for their genetic rights.The fans of the X-Men characters deserved something much greater than this. We are introduced to the 'Danger Room', where the X-Men practice their battle skills against a laughably arbitrary Sentinel appearance. The general movie-going audience won't get it, and it's function isn't even touched upon.There were certain touches that Ratner put in that are something the audience isn't even supposed to think about while they watch, but he makes them painfully weak attempts and bringing certain story elements in a 'full circle' kind of way.There is very little payoff in this movie. A love triangle hinted at in the trailers between Iceman, Rogue, and Kitty was nothing short of contrived, and nothing emotionally fulfilling came of it. Nothing ever comes of it, and loose ends are poorly sown for a fourth installment. Many mutant characters were wasted during this film. Colossus is cool to look at, but that's all. He doesn't really do a whole lot and any strength he exhibits (as is the case with Juggernaut as well) is extremely toned down from the comics. The greatest tragedy of this movie is the absence of the extremely popular Nightcrawler. He wasn't liked by Studio heads, and for no good reason was cut.The Fox Studio heads forgot that most people like a good story nowadays. No matter, for this movie is merely a giant commercial for ancillary rights to be exercised (i.e. movie tie-in products). Two characters die that didn't need to, and on top of that their deaths are not even given any justice or meaning. The disappearance of the first one isn't even questioned until much later, even after people discovered what happened. I could go on and on about this, but I'll rest here.What you will pay for here is some good action scenes, some funny one-liners, and a whole lot of brain-rot storytelling. Please don't get me wrong. I am glad that people have enjoyed this film. I really am. It had some cool moments. But to say it is good, or even great, is ONLY a matter of personal preference and not a matter of this film's quality. Skip it. 4/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
719,SunTsu,Well made yet a bit incoherent in its story telling,7,24 May 2006,"Taking the lead from Bryan Singer after the first two X-Men movies certainly would be a tall order for about anyone and kudos to Brett Ratner for taking the risks he took with the storyline going into this third and final installation.Admitted, with no fourth movie planned, it is easier to get a shot at killing off established team members, but actually doing it - some chutzpah! Along the way the story appears to be rather simple - you could basically write it up on the back of an envelope over lunch - which probably is what happened at some point before dialog was added. It shows on mental rewind, but is glossed over nicely with elaborate and good looking effect work at first view.Most of the cast don't get to shine, though. There's a flash of Xenia Onatopp when Famke Janssen tries to seduce Logan in the X-Men sickbay, but most of the time she's not coming out to play. Wolverine gets to throw around some of his one liners, do some berserker work, yet hardly even gets to puff on his stogies. Hugh Jackman looks a few years older a bit tired - hopefully the spin-off will play more to his strengths.The best performance quite likely comes from Ian McKellen, who plays his Magneto with relish but could have afforded a bit more elaborate dialog - the character is missing the tragic misguided depth of the first two installations. That, thinking again, could be said about any of the characters we've come to know in Part 1 and 2.These pieces were more character than effect driven and will be much better to look at ten years from now. If anything, X-Men 3 is decent popcorn movie, will earn the budget back and then some, but what it mostly does it make me look forward to see what Bryan Singer will do with Superman Returns.",X-Men - The Last Stand
720,silvercreature,Borderline offensive,5,7 June 2006,"Yes, I am a huge Marvel fan and I can be kind of a snob when it comes to these things. But so what? That's who these movies should have been made for anyway. But this trilogy is obviously a cash-grab made for the ignorant masses. What a slap in the face.My biggest problem with the trilogy is the woeful casting of Magneto. I like Ian MacKellan but he's all wrong for this part.First thing: he is too OLD. As an X-fan, I'm well aware that Magneto's back story is he is a Holocaust survivor and, obviously, would have to be quite old today. However, since this trilogy has been perfectly OK with tossing away virtually every other character's back story, I don't see why keeping Magneto's intact was necessary. Magneto is NOT a feeble, old man. MacKellan's Magneto is so smug and prissy it's revolting. Observe him in the first scene at Jean's house. Tell me he doesn't seem gay there. I have never seen MacKellan seem gay as other characters. I know that he's capable of playing roles without a hint of it. But he seems to be totally going for it here.I expected it in the first movie, tolerated it in the second, but by the third, I can't tell you how tired I was of the whole ""humanity vs mutants"" plot. It's so worn out. And yet,it was once again the driving force behind this movie. Heaven forbid they maybe push that to the background for a movie and focus on the X Men dealing with an actually interesting threat, like Apocalypse or Sinister. No, the filmmakers saw fit to once again smash us over the head with the old sticking point that most people just can't STAND them darned mutants. What a waste.They decided to include the Phoenix storyline and condensed it into a SUBPLOT. Wouldn't an entire movie about the whole Phoenix thing, where Jean Grey apparently sacrifices herself to save the team only to return possessed by an immensely powerful cosmic entity that, in adjusting to human emotions, becomes extremely dangerous and unpredictable be great? Guess not. Seems it'd be cooler to make the Phoenix a suppressed wacko personality of Jean's that's extremely powerful for no reason. Yeah,I can see how that's better.Despite his being the leader of the X Men, Cyclops has been completely underused in this series. With the Phoenix thing (as watered down as it's become) present in X3, here's a chance to really do some stuff with Scott. Instead he's shown whining and crying, then he's killed off-screen. I can't believe a movie about the X Men would have Scott Summers dying like he's some worthless throwaway character. But there it is.Beast and kitty were good.Jackman does a better job of Wolverine than any other other actor who I can think of probably could. But he's written all wrong throughout all three movies. His dialog is never close to what it should be. Wolverine is known for typically using such words as ""ain't"", ""flamin"" and ""darlin'"" but here, he talks just like everyone else. I have no problems with Iceman. My problem is with the completely fabricated Iceman/Pyro rivalry. Let's make Pyro an angst y kid who was formerly at Xavier's and develops a rivalry with Bobby!Colossus is a great character, isn't he? Well,you wouldn't know by watching this movie. The gentle, soft-spoken artist from Russia has been replaced with a one-dimensional American strongman. Perhaps no character (besides Magneto) is more ruined than Juggernaut. Cain Marko - Xavier's unstable half-brother who has an insane grudge against him, powered by the magical Gem of Cytorak (NOT a mutant), a nearly unstoppable force that used to take on the X Men completely on his own (he could be a movie on his own), reduced to a big, British (?!?!?) oaf who IS a mutant, and not even that formidable. Costume was dreadful. If you're going to put Juggernaut in a movie and ruin him all those other ways, at least make him look right.Jamie Madrox was thrown in as a gimmick. Rogue's barely there and then they make her a ""poor-me"" wuss at the end. Halle Berry continues to play her extremely angry version of Storm.A puzzler: Arclight. I know - ""WHO?!?"" She was a Marauder. Her biggest moment came during the Mutant Massacre (look it up). I have NO idea why such an obscure character was tossed into this movie and then actually portrayed accurately. They got her outfit, unique HAIRSTYLE and powers right. And I have no idea why. Ruin Colossus, rape Juggernaut, utterly DESTROY Magneto, but, for god's sake, let's make sure Arclight is well-done -the fans will riot otherwise!The super fast girl who can also detect powers for some reason is listed as Callisto in the credits. That's not Callisto. So with dozens of cool characters to choose from, the filmmakers MAKE UP their own and then say it's someone else. Why?!?!Angel: he might as well have not been in the movie. What's left is a movie with all the same flaws as its predecessors, a rehashed plot, forgettable throw-ins, and the utter devastation of lots of beloved characters. Attempting action and drama, they kill off characters and De-power them and it all ends in a completely stupid climax (why not just march Leech up to Jean while she's tearing sh*t up and have him cancel out her powers instead of making Logan run her through?)The bit after the credits hints at an X4. I guess in a few years we'll find out what else they can ruin about one of the most popular and beloved Comic series' ever.",X-Men - The Last Stand
721,silverknife,Because mutants are people too,8,3 June 2006,"I caught a showing of X-Men: The Last Stand on Friday 5/26/06. It's not the huge step forward that X2 was, but I still enjoyed it. If you go into it expecting something great and mind-blowing, you'll likely be disappointed and quickly cast it off as a horrible film (as a few IMDb reviewers already have). If you're like me and you enjoyed the first two movies, and you're anxious to experience chapter three, then you'll probably really enjoy it, as I did. If you're in the mood to see a decent action/superhero movie, then you'll certainly get something good out of this one. If you're disappointed in it before even seeing it (due to the change of directors, or maybe the knowledge that a few key characters meet their end), then chances are you'll search for every reason you can to hate it when you do see it, and you'll find them. If fast-paced action movies that sport spiffy visual effects almost as a main character isn't your thing, then obviously this is not for you. But, I liked it, and that's what matters to me. Kinda wish it was longer and delved a little deeper into a few of the characters, or maybe fleshed out some of the plot details a bit more, but these gripes are minor and forgivable.",X-Men - The Last Stand
722,tomakalinus,The Last Stand...thank goodness,6,28 May 2006,"When franchises switch directors, it's always a scary thing. Fortunately, this isn't Batman Forever. Unfortunately, part of me wishes it were *more* like that film: rather than being too campy, this movie was often too depressing and self-important, like most modern blockbusters.Oh, if only Joss Whedon had been allowed to direct this. On Buffy the Vampire Slayer, major character deaths are motivated by the needs of the story. In this movie, I felt like all the deaths were motivated by contract negotiations gone awry.James Marsden has never been happy with being in these movies, so Scott was changed from a pretty cool character in the other films (IMHO) into a complete loser who gets offed easily in the first 10 minutes. Then, apparently because Patrick Stewart wants out of the franchise, the audience has to watch as Professor X gets his very skin ripped off his body. It's painful and unnecessary. Couldn't these characters have given themselves in the final battle instead? (BTW, how do you like the Professor's strategy? ""Let me go into Jean's house alone, so that she can kill me easier."" Good thinking, Prof. Haven't you seen any horror movies?) And what happened to Rogue's character arc? She was the helpless victim in X1, then (if I remember right) she became more of a hero in X2. Now she's just worried about her boyfriend (whatever she claims, it was about him) and she gives up all her powers. She seems happier, which totally contradicts the whole ""we don't need to be cured"" theme.Jean Grey died a very cool, sacrifical death in X2. Unfortunately, that's where it should have stayed. ""Pheonix"" turned out to be nothing but Famke Janssen standing there looking stoned while the special effects whirred and whizzed around her. She was just out of control; there was no motivation for anything she did. When she died the first time, I felt bad for her; when she died the second time, it was like putting a mutt out of its misery.I really wanted to see a struggle between the two sides of Jean's personality. If she hadn't killed Scott and the Professor so early on, there could have been some suspense over whether or not she would be redeemed. Instead, it was obvious from the get-go that she needed to be killed.While everyone else is getting smaller roles, I-won-an-Oscar-so-I've-got-a-huge-ego-now Halle Berry finally got a bigger role, as she asked for. While Storm was an interesting supporting character in previous installments, she now inexplicably takes lead for everything, including the running of the school. I was keenly aware of the writers having to pull strings every time she suddenly took charge of things.Other things I didn't like: There was an unusual amount of gore in this film - it pushed the upper edges of PG-13, to be sure. Did we really need to see that many characters explode on screen, especially a couple that we cared about? I was ticked that the Sentinels showed up only briefly in a holographic test, rather than in the actual movie.I missed the bit at the end, because no one warned us in advance. But I'm disgusted that the filmmakers hedged their bets after all that. I no longer want to see X4 after this.Whew. OK. Didn't I say I like this film? I did. Here's the good stuff: Grammar was perfect as Beast. I found him totally believable in the dialogue scenes, and the audience cheered when he started kicking butt near the end. Kitty Pryde - both the action scenes and the love triangle. Juggernaut was great, scoring some of the few funny lines in the whole film. Mckellen was awesome as usual, providing the gravitas necessary to make Magneto believable. Angel was cool. And some of the fight scenes were amazing, and actually had the audience (including myself) cheering.And it was nice to see Rebecca Romjin as a human for a change. She's one of the most gorgeous women alive, yet the filmmakers somehow managed to make her hideous for the last three films. So this was a welcome change.So, actually...it was a decent film, but not good enough to warrant a continuation of the series.And the dialogue and acting in this film is still better than Revenge of the Sith. In spite of all the acclaim that film received, this one is actually a better film (though I expect a larger negative lashback).",X-Men - The Last Stand
723,tveron1,...oh my stars and garters...,10,27 May 2006,"I have seen an awful lot of movies in my time...and I can honestly say that X-Men is one of the best, if not THE best. Of course, you'll probably know the plot. A cure has been found for mutants, and while some mutants wish to have it, others are offended by the idea of it (eg: Magneto). So, these mega p-offed mutants band together to start (and hopefully end) a war against humans. More important than this storyline however, is that of the returning Jean Grey (the GORGEOUS Famke Janssen), who, though 'dead' at the end of the last film, has come back, and is wielding some terrifyingly advanced telekinetic power. This little lady packs a decidedly powerful punch. Problem is, she's throwing these punches at everyone :SWhile significantly shorter than X2, X3 manages to pack in an awesome amount of action and IMO character. Sure, some characters who people are undoubtedly fans of (Colossus for example) get little screen-time, the leads get what they need to spark emotion. And the action, my goodness gracious, they're utterly jaw-dropping. I can honestly say that this is the only movie where my jaw has ACTUALLY dropped. The scenes of Magneto ravaging the Golden Gate Bridge, and ANY moment when Jean lets loose as Phoenix, is worthy of praise. Also, as a gay teen, I can really understand the underlying message behind these movies, and the comics themselves. And while the message is a little less subtle this time around, it's just as important.While some do bag out this movie saying it has 'hackneyed' lines etc, you've got to remember that this is a world where almost everything has been done in the movies...of course the dialogue is gonna sound clichéd...but dialogue is ALWAYS clichéd nowadays :( so deal with it, and watch the great movie that is X-Men 3 :D:D:D:D:DPS: I wanna say that I am sick and tired of people failing to mention Phoenix in reviews etc....SHE'S THE MAIN BLOODY FOCUS OF THE FILM!!! ...Sorry...I'm a bit cranky :(",X-Men - The Last Stand
724,rudgeno1,Abysmal,1,29 May 2006,"After the excellent first two films in this trilogy, I was expecting big things from The Last Stand and I had heard positive reviews from friends who had seen it before me. I had not done a great deal of research into what the film would be about so as to not to give myself many pieces of info that would help give away things in the story that I did not want to know beforehand (too often I watch movies and due to what I have read, the mystery is taken away, even if the reviews aren't spoilers as such).What I saw in the cinema was a surprise, and I still haven't quite recovered. Did they drag in the director, script writers and acting coaches from Hollyoaks, because it certainly gave that impression. I have never seen a film with so many clichés, especially coming from one character, in this case the president. They were constantly flowing and throw into that the cheesiness that this film brought to the table and you have already got two properties which were not in the first two. I should have taken some crackers to help digest the cheese but nothing could have spared me from the appalling emotional acting from the main cast, most notably Storm who just lacked any genuine capacity to bring the character to a realistic emotional reaction to anything which happened in the film. And how many speeches of a patronising fashion can one director squeeze into a movie, it would seem this film suggests it is around 8 or 9 because they were also consistent in their appearance.I would go on a massive rant but to be honest, this film is not worth the effort, just a massive disappointment and very poorly made. It does not bode well for the other sequels coming out although they certainly won't have a high standard to compete with.",X-Men - The Last Stand
725,timetoduel26,Kitty or Rogue?,8,25 June 2006,"It seemed like Iceman had a thing for kitty in this movie. Although Rogue is his girlfriend he still got his flirt on with Kitty. Which raises the question who will Iceman pick. If I were Iceman I would definitely pick Kitty. She is smart, a great mutant and she extremely HOT. If Ellen Page(who played KItty) is reading this I'm a big fan and you are 100% more hot than Anna Paquin. Rogue is nice and all but she can't even touch anyone.Even though her power is decent she never seems to use in the movies, except in the first one.So if they do make a fourth movie I think he should dump Rogue and go to Kitty because shes the hottest character in the entire movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
726,striljr,good,7,26 May 2006,"I thought it was a bit fast-paced, but not to the point of confusion; the story was more or less about everything finally comin' to a head... which made the 'fast pace' seem somewhat sensible(being that it picked up with everything that had already been happening in the first two films.) I think it did a decent job in the fact that, with all things considered,it tried to give a sort of 'mundane' feel to the X-men world like the first two. I felt the acting was good, no worse than the first two either. There were also many surprises that came- even the things that I had heard were going to happen had me thinking 'WOW' when it finally happened. To me in general it seemed like the climax of the whole trilogy was the main focus in this one, all other things being shown in the first two; for example I don't really feel there was a HUGE lack of character development as some people seem to think. As for some cheezy one-liners and stuff like that, it wasn't any better or worse than the first two!! All-in-all, I like it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
727,geekygirl-11825,I Don't Understand the Hate!!,7,25 December 2015,"I'm sorry, I hate to be ""that guy"", but I cannot understand the hate for this movie. Still don't want to be that guy, but, quite frankly, this is my favorite Xmen movie in general. I've watched it with absolutely no knowledge of Xmen and liked it, then watched it after watching every single animated incarnation of Xmen (not kidding) and actually liked it even more. So this is less a review for the movie, and more a tirade about how I don't understand the hate. Sound cool to everyone? If not, just keep scrolling, and don't mind me. Just another review in a sea of text.First of all, people complain about this plot ruining pre-established ones, and ""wah, why didn't Bryan Singer direct this? It would have been so much better"". At least this one USED an actual Xmen plot line, unlike the other movies (err..excluding DoFP, but, that one hardly follows the original plot that I've seen). X1 and 2 had some completely random and out of nowhere BS, and X2 is only watchable because Nightcrawler is in it. Otherwise it's boring and random. But X3 uses both the Phoenix plot line and an interesting cure plot line.Are people mad because Cyclops dies? Because, if you ask me, and I've said it many times, I think that was a mercy killing. Singer had made Cyclops into an unlikable, flat, whiny, character, that had absolutely nothing likable about him. Personally, I prefer to see him dead than treated like that. He's supposed to be a leader, not a whiny, overly-jealous, well...As for Prof X's death..meh. If you'd stay till the end you'd know that he doesn't die.(By the way, Moira is in this scene, and she's ACTUALLY Scottish LIKE SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE. Sorry, those are issues for another review *glances at First Class*) Okay, peoples' issues with the various mutants cured...1) First of all, it's strongly hinted that the cure IS NOT PERMANENT. So that takes care of that.2) Yes, I do think it's in-character for Magneto to abandon Mystique once she is turned human. In case you didn't know the premise of the character, he sorta hates humans.3) It is also in-character for Rogue to want the cure. Heck, 80's Rogue almost got one from Apocalypse in the animated series, and if I remember right Rogue is pretty torn about it during Wolverine and the Xmen.Okay, is it the lack of Angel? This is the one I see having the most ground but at least he's there, and at least he hasn't had his entire character/backstory butchered like Rogue and slightly Nightcrawler and Cyclops and...was that supposed to be a X-23 Lady Deathstrike hybrid in X2? Okay, so he's not an Xman, there are a lot of them left out, some more important than he is.Also, this movie has the best Beast. Everything about Beast in this movie from his introduction on is spot on.Look, I could go on and on, but I've already had this conversation with so many people, and I'm tired of having to defend my minority opinion all of the time. Just, go rewatch X2, REALLY re-watch it, and then tell me that X3 has a horrible plot and treats characters badly and has bad dialogue and what have you. I'm done. I've had my little rant, I'm done.",X-Men - The Last Stand
728,buffyfan_ieuan,10 stars,10,18 June 2006,i thought x men 3 was excellent. definitely the best out of the 3. It kept me interested through the whole thing. It was so cool and shocking. The second i got out of the cinema i wanted to see it again and again. I'd go see it many times over. There was such good shocking moments.And if you go see it make sure you wait until the end of the credits because there's a seen at the end that you must see.I would highly recommend it to every 1. It was amazing. I was very happy to see storm have a bigger part in this film as she is my favourite character.,X-Men - The Last Stand
729,moviecool,A fun movie- more than you can expect from an action flick,7,26 May 2006,"I went in to the theater feeling forced, thinking only of the miserable reviews that this film got. Action films seem less and less interesting too, which foreshadowed my view of the film. Yet, I found X-Men 3 quite entertaining, with all the action sequences (amazing things made to seem like reality), delectably evil villains, and interesting subtext and room for discussion. The concept of a cure is quite interesting and sparks an interesting debate, while the film's cartooniness is actually well done. I could not expect character development when seeing this movie, but there were some interesting happenings. They were not good characters, but good caricatures. All in all, it put me back into the mood of seeing action movies because it's an exception to the usual mold.",X-Men - The Last Stand
730,smoothiedudie,Worth your money,4,26 May 2006,"I saw X-Men: The Last Stand last night and i gotta say i enjoyed. There were some parts which i felt could've been improved, and as a comic book fan there were parts that really surprised and annoyed me. Ratner definitely has a different style to Singer, and it is clear in the film. One of the bad things he does is cut the time down considerably, so some of the new characters introduced are only on screen for a few minutes. However, the films is still very good, keeping the same feeling of isolation and discrimination as in the first two films. Its hard to say whether they'll make a fourth film or not, but i definitely think they should, as the film has left us with many cliffhangers, and it would be a good chance for the new characters to be explored even more. One the whole, not as good as the first two movies, but still good enough for you to enjoy, and i hope they make a fourth film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
731,ramificating,Great for a third installer.,9,22 May 2006,"I got the chance to see it at the a charity screening here in Sydney Australia on the 22nd and i must say it is worth seeing if you've seen the last two or are a huge fan of the comics. Although it doesn't deserve full stars because it does lack quite a bit in the film. For one, fans who were hoping to see bigger roles out of character such as Professor Xavier, Colossus, cyclops or Iceman I'm afraid to tell you that they're under used in this great film. The story is great but Brett Ratner wasn't very good at achieving it as we see the film is very fast paced in the first half of the movie, no time to stop and take in everything that just happened, However the second half slowed down a lot allowing fans a little thinking time to keep up with whats happening and the special effects are much better than the last two. My personal problem was once again huge Jackman aka Wolverine hogged the light for almost 60% of the film followed by Halley berry aka storm who had some scenes i personally thought were unnecessary and could've been good for other characters. Ian McKellen didn't seem as convincing as magneto as he did in the last two, I mean he still had the personality but during the fights he seemed a bit lazy, he seemed out of time with the special effects. i won't go on but i recommend to all fans to see, by the way theirs only two words i guess you could say are swear word and no sex scenes for any one who's been wanting to know.",X-Men - The Last Stand
732,Mr_Hardcastle,Fantastic end to a strong trilogy,10,26 May 2006,"I had high expectations of the final film in the X-Men trilogy.I wasn't disappointed.The action was not only superb, but non-stop from start to finish. There were many shocks throughout the film. This began with the death of Cyclops (in all honesty he was useless, and they had to do something with him), and followed by Mystique being cured of her abilities. Xavier's death was probably the biggest shock though, but all of this was handled very well and was great viewing. Another was the moment Magneto was cured also -- but it was better than having him die instead. There were heaps of moments I loved watching; Beast and the Juggernaught during the battle at the end. Kitty was great, and Bobby was much less annoying. McKellen's Magneto again stole the show for me; and I love his line ""What have I done?!"" as he retreated helplessly at the end of the battle.As a whole the cast performed very well. There wasn't much for Famke Janssen to do - and because of the amount of action there was little room for deep, moving performances. That's why, again, McKellen shone through. The film's conclusion was perfect, as were those of the previous two films (the first in particular). This was my favourite though:- we see a sad, somewhat withered-looking Magneto (or Eric) playing chess alone, without his old friend Xavier, and he attempts to move the metal chess pieces using his powers - and one of them twitches before it cuts to the credits. EXCELLENT - wonderful end for a film.All in all you'd be missing out if you didn't see the film in its full glory at the cinema. Go now - take a stand!",X-Men - The Last Stand
733,Jasmin4,Had some good moments,6,27 May 2006,"First the acting. Ian McKellen as Magneto was nice to watch. He has become one of my favorite actors. His role as Teabing in the Da Vinci Code, his role as Magneto and his role as Gandalf in Lord of the Rings has proved to me he is one of Hollywood's well seasoned actors. I look forward to his movie Magneto coming out in 2007. Halle Berry never won me over as Storm in the first two movies. She did better in this one. She seemed more comfortable with the character Storm. But I've always thought Halle Berry as Storm was miscast. Hugh Jackman as Logan was better in the second movie. By X-Men 3 his character seemed tired. But the showdown with him and Jean was really good. Famke Janssen didn't do much as Jean. She stood around a lot. But since Jean was more Phoenix in this movie there was not much need for her dialogue. And until I just looked at the cast and crew I never ever realized the Beast aka Dr. Hank McCow was Kelsey Grammar. Wow! Kelsey Grammar did a good job playing beast and made the Beast an extremely dignified persona.*spoiler alert* The movie was decent enough. It had some unexpected moments like the death of Professor Charles Xavier, Scott, and Jean. Scott dying so early in the film caught me off guard and I think the death was premature. The death of the professor left me stunned in my seat and throughout the entire film I expected him to return. He never did and that left a void in the film. It was as if rest of the characters lost direction. I learned more about the Phoenix nature of Jean in this film and that was one of the best parts. It really fleshed out her mutant aspect and we saw what Jean was REALLY made of. While the other characters were well developed in the earlier films, I realize how underdeveloped Jean's character in the previous films. Watching her character develop independent of the Scott/Jean romance was refreshing. Phoenix came into her own in this film and we really saw how Phoenix and Jean are two personalities. What I did not understand was the need for Wolverine to kill Jean when the other mutants had their powers neutralized using those darts. Why could Jean not be neutralized yet still live? They neutralized the powers of Magneto and Mystique why not Jean? I saw no point in her dying. The Angel was a nice added mutant to the film. This movie had many more mutants than the previous two and the ""us verses them"" standoff worked out well. Juggernaunt was a hoot with a limited IQ.",X-Men - The Last Stand
734,silentholygaming,a 3 is generous,3,20 March 2019,"I hate this movie, they are very few redeeming qualities for it; Famke Janssen's acting is great, Jean's death scene is memorable & Hugh Jackman is fantastic as always. Other then that, nearly everything else in this movie is disappointing. I won't get into everything but some of the more annoying points are how Jean kills Scott, Mystique loses her powers, in the first act & she is barely in the movie after that. The two most annoying things that I hated rewatching was how they didn't continue with the phoenix effects they had in the other 2 movies & making Jean more of a side character when the storyline is meant to center around her.And we have to talk about the terrible ending, it's too fast paced, there is barely any emotion or depth to characters passing away, and it's overall stupid. I would recommend to just be wary about going into watching this movie, as it will disappoint you severely.",X-Men - The Last Stand
735,funcrunch,A disappointment,5,29 May 2006,"I saw this movie the day after watching X2 on DVD, so the previous effort was still fresh in my mind. What a disappointment. Reasonable plot, dialogue, and character development were all obviously sacrificed for action and special effects sequences.I, a San Francisco resident, actually could not stop laughing at the sequence where Magneto moved the Golden Gate Bridge to connect it with Alcatraz Island. Pure visual spectacle; with his army of various mutants, surely at least a dozen easier ways of getting to the laboratory could have been found. If nothing else, Jean/Phoenix probably could have moved the whole group herself, rather than just standing there looking pensive until she got irritated enough to start blowing people and things up. Why did Magneto want her on his side again? I never read the X Men comic books but I did see a number of episodes of the TV cartoon. I don't expect the movie to follow the comics strictly, but surely the characters could have been given more respect than this. Rogue, for example, was so powerful in the comics; here, an almost complete waste. And I'm quite sure the whole Jean/Cyclops/Wolverine triangle was not meant to be resolved like this.I only give the movie 5 out of 10 for bringing up important issues about conformity, some good visual effects, and some humorous moments (even if some were unintentional). It is worth watching to wrap up the trilogy if you have seen the first two. And with the ending of this one (make sure to stay till the very end of the credits), the door is left open for another sequel - hopefully, with a better director and writing crew.",X-Men - The Last Stand
736,danarodz,Good premise. Bad writting.,6,22 April 2021,"This movie was extremely disappointing. I did not expect it to be as good as the second one but at least close the first one. The premise of having a ""cure"" for mutations was a good idea, however the film is able to turn this dynamic into a boring movie. I'm not sure exactly how or why but it does. The pacing is slow at times and the script is bland. A good point going for it was the character development but other than that I can only recommend it for the sake of finishing the trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
737,worst_address_ever,"Great film, but a strange sense of disappointment.",7,6 June 2006,"***MAJOR SPOILERS*** I was expecting this film to be one of those films where at the end you sit back and go ""wow""... But X-men 3: The last stand left me leaving the cinema quietly with an overwhelming sense of disappointment and confusion. Several questions came to mind, and even more answers.1. A lot of attention has been brought to the fact that this IS the LAST 'X-men' film in the TRILOGY. But at the end of the film we see Magneto playing chess by himself, he clearly makes a metal chess piece move (although only slightly). And I'm left asking myself ""What is the point in the whole film if the ""bad guy"" still has his mutant powers at the end?"" And especially if its the end of a series of films. Where would we be at the end of star wars if Darth Vader were still alive! It clearly opens up the door for a FORTH film in the TRILOGY. Doesn't quite work does it?The only response I had to this question is that I know there is a film being made just based around Wolverine, and the only way it can make any sense is if Magneto is the enemy in that film. Although it's obvious who would win that battle.2. We are introduced to a new mutant in this third film, ""Angel"" (Ben Foster) is quite an elaborate character, and is quite a nice addition to the original X-men we are used to. But there is no detail into his origin, his life, and where he goes with it. At the start of the film we see him as a young boy destroying his wings. We see him almost being given the ""cure"" and escaping. And we see him saving his fathers life and flying off into the sun set... that's it, he doesn't say much, he doesn't do much, and he doesn't really interact with the other mutants (this could be deliberate by the director, maybe to emphasise how much of an outcast he is) but what's stranger? Having beautiful white wings... Or having spikes come out of your whole body? I don't see why he is such an outcast, and why nothing much is done with his character.3. The death of Scott Summers(James Marsden), or better known as Cyclops comes quickly and pointlessly; he storms off out of the school to search for the voices in his head. Next thing we know, he's dead, his glasses floating around the shore of the lake created at the end of the second film. Well... Make of it what you will, but I thought in all honesty it was kind of crap. I love to see one of the main characters die as much as the next fan, and I wasn't surprised it was Cyclops, but it was so sudden and with no investigation that the audience don't care, they want to know what Magneto is up to.4. Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) Magnetos main henchman (if that's the correct term) is turned into a human by a guard during her rescue scene, and Magneto leaves her naked in a smashed up coach in the middle of know where... Well apart from my girlfriend yelling ""bastard"" out load in the cinema at Magneto, nothing much happens with this either. We see her later in the film giving details of the where about of Magnetos mutant army ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" indeed, but lets at least see her walking down the street and trying to turn into someone and everyone just looking at her like ""What's she doing?"" We don't get to see the effect of becoming human on the mutants that receive treatment.Other then those main complaints I did enjoy this film, my favourite part was defiantly when the army thought they where surrounding Magnetos mutant army, only to find it was just Multiple Man (Eric Dane) multiplied out into about 100 guys. Very clever. And I knew Wolverine would say some sad cheesy line during a fight scene, thank god it was a classy one! ""Grow those back"" Very cool. I know I complained about the whole Magneto moving the chess piece at the end, but when it moved it did give me Goosebumps, he is one of my favourite characters and I would love very much to see a come back.If your one of those people that like to watch a film with no questions left unanswered at the end, then this film IS NOT for you. However if you love a good old action film (especially a marvel one) with a great ending which leaves you bouncing of the walls asking the question ""Has he still got his powers!? Has he still got his powers!? Has he still got his powers!?"" then this film is defiantly for you.",X-Men - The Last Stand
738,tsaint14,Hmm......,10,16 November 2006,"When we first rented this movie, I thought it was going to be just some fun action movie. No real expectations.When we watched it, it was pretty good. Good plot, for a sequel. Most sequels tend to stray from the original movie a little bit. This movie stayed on track with the others more than I thought it would.And the special effects are incredible. When Beast meets the boy, the way his hand and hair looked on each other was so lifelike. I kinda thought they just didn't put any make-up on his hand for that scene. But I looked closer, and it was special effect on Kelsey Grammar's arm. And Kelsey Grammar, by the way, excellent as Beast.",X-Men - The Last Stand
739,Reewnat,Best of the trilogy,9,28 May 2006,"Sure there were some flaws, but in my opinion, they were minor or were hindered by how short the movie was (each movie should have been 30 minutes longer).Better characterization than the Singer movies and a good balance of interaction, action, and plot.If they were going to alter her origin, Phoenix was very well done and damn wonderful when she was unleashed. Nice effects. Hugh Jackman as usual is the best Wolverine will ever be and the Beast was a very pleasant surprise. Storm was better, but that will happen when you give a character some lines.Complaints: an extension of some of the plot points: Leech, Jean was not utilized for much of the last quarter of the movie, the cure is still out there, Scott Summer's portion, a little more CGI on some parts (i.e. Sentinel).Overall, as a comic geek and a movie goer, both of me are satisfied with this.",X-Men - The Last Stand
740,masterchief3021,What happened?,6,31 August 2006,"I really enjoyed the First X-men movie then the second was good, but then when I saw the third one I got really excited and wanted to see it. While watching I had some questions. One Why did they kill the professor, Cyclops, and Jean. Why did they do that. And there's talk about X4, now I understand there is some life left in this series but by killing a couple of main characters really doesn't do anything for me. I want the old director back and make a remake, because this movie felt rushed nothing good comes out of rushed work. But by far this movie has the best graphics. I like it but you should stick with first two movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
741,tonyshangrila,total crap - *perhaps a very minor spoiler or two*,3,26 May 2006,"I give it a '3' for the effects and exciting fight scenes. Other than that, I don't remember ever having seen a movie before where all the meaningful dialogue and plot points were able to be condensed within the trailer. That's what this movie was -- a 104-minute trailer that lacked any significant story, character development, or dramatic elements. The new (or sometimes newly involved) characters could not have been any flatter if they were penciled on a 4-panel comic book page. A story that, at the start, seemed like it would evoke some thought on racism and human rights (in the X-Men tradition) literally went up in a puff of ash and degenerated into an excuse for the final throw-down between Magneto's 'brotherhood' and the NeXt-Men. If they make another one, I really hope Bryan Singer Returns; he seems to have a much firmer grip on what these people can be about.",X-Men - The Last Stand
742,nownevertherose,OK for a movie but thumbs down for the comic-followers,10,16 October 2006,"I liked the plot of the movie but for someone who has a bit of knowledge about the comic characters it doesn't make sense. If I looked at it from a comic-book fan I would have thought it was horrible. Why would they have made ArchAngel so young if they were trying to bring in all the original X-Men team together as a team? How can Professor X, Jean Grey & Cyclops die? How can Rogue take the ""cure"" if she is to meet Gambit in the future? How can Magneto been stuck with multiple cure needles & still be able to show some powers in the end? etc.BUT once I got over that part & looked at it from a movie-goer standpoint I liked it & understood what the script-writer was trying to do. I did like how they actually put Dark Phoenix into the movie, although I wish she would have referred to herself as such more often when her evil side took over. I really liked how they wrote in a part for the exercise room. I'm not sure if comic-book fans would have understood that part (it puzzled the heck out of my son & husband).",X-Men - The Last Stand
743,jack-71,a patchwork quilt of a movie,5,23 May 2006,"From the beginning I was left with mixed feelings. It bounces between being predictable and uninspired, but then you get these little moments which are memorable and worthy of the spirit of the first film of the series. Strangely, it is hard to identify the source of these good moments. Certainly some of it must come from the writers; but then why are there so many clichéd moments? Is it in the direction? If so Ratner clearly had good days when shooting and bad days- in places the action and interaction just seems lifeless. The main area of appeal of course is in the visuals. The grading (clearly digital) is really bad, with harsh coloring that presumably undermines the actual photography. The pictures look nice but there is no tonality to speak of, perhaps a metaphor for the other elements of the production. On the other hand, many of the visual effects are stunning and well-conceived, and make a break from the sometimes tedious dialogue. In terms of the story, it is a well-structured house of cards that for some reason falls apart at the end, when you realise that many of the characters were completely redundant, and the others resort to the (perhaps unavoidable) game of paper-stone-scissors.",X-Men - The Last Stand
744,hawaiianshirt79,Minor spoilers for a major movie,7,25 May 2006,"After two genre-defining films, Bryan Singer jumped ship on the X-Men franchise, leaving it in the hands of ""Layer Cake"" director Matthew Vaughn, who promptly ditched the project and left it adrift, only to be given to Brett Ratner.This farcical, musical-chairs style production history could have boded ill for the franchise, and many were worried.Ratner, after all, was a risky choice. Known for fun but ultimately by-the-numbers films, Ratner was a popcorn director. (This is, after all, the man who gave the world Rush Hour movies, and I, for one, thank him.)He was, however, being called on to fill the shoes of a visionary (Bryan Singer, who gave the world The Usual Suspects, for which many of us worship him.)So, first, the bad news: The change of director is noticeable, and has an adverse effect on the movie.The good news is: Not THAT adverse.First and foremost on the ""bad"" front is the fact that the series also changed scriptwriters for the third installment, and as such many of the characters lack a sense of cohesion. Part of the genius of X2 was it's ability to take an already large ensemble cast and give them all room to breathe. Last Stand, however, suffers from a script that all but amputates previously crucial characters. James Marsden may as well not have bothered showing up at all as Cyclops, and indeed, anyone who went to the toilet during the early part of the movie will probably be convinced that he didn't bother at all.Anna Paquin's Rogue, a character who was introduced before all others (save Magneto) in the first film, is largely absent from any meaningful scenes in Last Stand, except a brief jealous spat with her boyfriend which feels like a tacked-on excuse to have her around at all.And, as many had feared, casting Vinnie Jones as the Juggernaut is one of the worst ideas anyone in the history of film has ever come up with. His lame one-liners and ridiculous muscle suit make a mockery of a great character. As a threat, he is laughable, and as comic relief he falls flat. This is probably because Vinnie Jones can't act and isn't funny.Also, despite the title, some of the plot threads are a little TOO final for my liking, but this may be a case of personal taste.The plus side of the equation, however, is substantial. Kelsey Grammar's casting as the shambling, hairy, intellectual Beast proved to be an excellent choice, his presence lending gravitas to the character whilst clever special effects bring his more fantastic attributes to life. The return of Famke Janssen as the Phoenix, the dark, repressed side of her former character's potentially limitless power, is given most of the effects budget, and some of her scenes are jaw-droopingly impressive as a result.Halle Berry's Storm, too, is finally let loose in the effects department, after being left in the background for most of the previous two films she is finally given enough screen time here to establish her character and her abilities.Ian McKellen coolly walks away with the entire film, as usual, as the misguided separatist Magneto, aside from one moment that doesn't quite ring true; when a ""cure"" is forced on another mutant, he flatly dismisses them as ""not one of us anymore"" instead of treating them as a martyr, as Magneto almost certainly would.For the fans, there are numerous wish-list boxes checked, but telling you about them would spoil most of the fun of spotting them in the first place, and baffle non-comic fans. Suffice to say that catchphrases, special moves and cameos are all in place.My main complaint with the film is really it's bitty nature. The opening half feels like it's trying to cram too much in, and as such often feels fractured, losing it's flow amongst the jostle of plot threads, so that by the time the film picks up speed, we're nearly at the end. In changing a large part of the crew, there is a faint feeling that we're back to square one, introducing people and setting up ideas for a continued series, which should never be the case with a film entitled ""The Last Stand.""However, any complaints I have are mainly small-fry, and overall X3 produces a decent, if not revolutionary, third part of the series.Oh, and for God's sake stay until the end of the credits. You have been told.In summation: Although never scaling the incredible heights of X2, Brett Ratner ably supports the franchise through a difficult time, and creates a film that should leave the majority of fans properly satisfied. 7/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
745,may_ustb,X-Men:The Last Stand,5,8 March 2011,"The only impression that X-Men 3 left me was endless regret for Jean Grey(Famke Janssen), who killed her lover Scott Summer and our dear Professor Charlie Xavier (Patrick Stewart)with her sub-consciousness, and who was turned into a killing machine by Magneto(Ian McKellen). More sadly, she forced Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to kill his life-time lover with a piteous ending ""I Love You"".If audience has a choice to veto the sequel of X-Men, I choose to end this classic cartoon with the X-Men 2 once and for all. In X-Men 2, Jean sacrificed herself in the dam to power the jet which held lives of Logan, the professor, Scott and Storm(Halle Berry). I prefer her to die there instead of having a rebirth in the X-Men 3 as a schizophrenia patience, threatening to turn every living thing into molecule.My heart could never tolerate the pain watching Professor Charlie torn piece by piece by the crystal glass weapon sharpened and improvised by the mad Jean. Even Professor's life-long rival, Magneto, admitted it was his biggest loss to sacrifice the professor for his pursuit.Perhaps I would never comprehend why a peaceful world has to be earned by the pass-away of so many heroes, who are all great figures to inspire generation after generation. At this point, I felt lucky to live in a world with most of the things I have cherished standing by my side.",X-Men - The Last Stand
746,marshall_web,"Not Singer's X-Men, but a worthy coda to a fantastic trilogy.",7,29 May 2006,"It is safe to say that every X-Men fan, or any movie fan for that matter would have much rather seen Bryan Singer finnish out his first two X mens into a brilliant trilogy. I was very unsure that Brett Ratner, who has directed some pretty decent movies, not great, but not terrible could do a good job. Much to my chagrin Brett Ratner exceeded my expectations on how well he could direct the final chapter of this comic masterpiece.Although I feel a comic book movie has yet to top Batman Begins, I feel that all superhero movies owe it to the X men for 'relaunching' this superhero craze that we have been blessed with, and for that we have to thank Singer.For those who have seen the movie you can agree with me that Ratner did not give us the in depth character build up that Singer gave us. Instead, giving us a fun action packed movie, with a little character glimpse at Wolverine and a touching moment between Kitty and Bobby. However, that is not the director that Ratner is. Ratner is 'an action' director, one who focuses mainly on fight sequences and explosions mixed in with some mild humor, and that is what made this movie work.Although Singer's genius was deeply missed in this third chapter, I do not feel we need to be ashamed at the third movie. I know we all feel that Singer could have given us a better close on his trilogy, Brett Ratner still needs to be applauded for giving us his different yet great take on the wonderful and never to be forgotten X-Men series.",X-Men - The Last Stand

748,The_katrankin,It's another entry in the series of X-Men films. What would you expect?,8,28 May 2006,"""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" the third in the series of X-Men films based off of the immensely popular Stan Lee comic books, is just that: a mindless, fun, and highly entertaining action film. Critics have stated that it is nothing but an soulless action film devoid of a large amount of character development and drama; well, no kidding Sherlock. It's a movie about mutants that are able to run through solid objects and conjure storms instantaneously fighting other mutants that can manipulate metal and shoot giant spikes from their arms. ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" was NEVER meant to be a movie with a solid amount of depth to it...but alas, does that truly matter? The visual effects are fabulous, the performances are acceptable, and really, it's just a fun movie. And at least the characters have enough depth so that you can feel a bit of sadness when one of them gets killed off by the writers.The film's plot involves a group of scientists creating a ""cure"" for the mutant gene...a medicine that suppresses a mutant's superpowers. While Proffesor Xavier and his colleagues have some impartiality to the medicine, in that they aren't going to try to halt production of it, Magneto and his group of supervillians are not content with this medicine's existence. They soon form a plan to travel to Alcatraz and kill the boy that the government requires for the production of the cure -- a small boy named Jimmy. In traditional action flick fashion, the X-Men begin a counter attack to stop Magneto and his team of mutants.New characters are introduced in this entry, such as a giant blue creature called Beast, played by Kelsey Grammar (it must be hard finding high salary work after ""Fraiser""), a man that can smash through walls known as Juggernaut, played by Vinnie Jones (whose most famous catchphrase is from a cartoon some X-Men aficionados might recall), and a boy with giant bird wings growing out of his back, played by ""Six Feet Under""'s Ben Foster; and Jean Grey returns, this time having her dual personality known as the Pheonix taking over her body and making her an extremely powerful supervillian who carbonizes everybody in her path. It's a shame, however, than none of these characters are on screen for a very long time (other than Jean Grey), with the writers seldom exploiting their powers, and therein lies the movie's biggest weakness.Despite some flaws, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is another fabulous entry into the series of X- Men films, with extravagant visuals and good acting from Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellan, and Hugh Jackman; just don't go in expecting a lot of character exploration. But why the devil would you look for that anyway, going to a film based on a series of comic books? Not every film can be a ""Spider-Man 2,"" you know. (****/*****)",X-Men - The Last Stand
749,dirtyfinger,Big Blunder in the final battle - Joe Wood quality,6,29 May 2006,"The movie is pretty nice popcorn cinema like expected with pretty special effects and lots of new shallow characters. However, considering the size of the X-Men universe you can't really fault anyone for not going into detail for each 'major' character available, especially when you expect to see new ones, too.You can, however, fault the director for starting the final battle in FULL DAYLIGHT and actually fighting it in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT !

Shame! If you are a huge fan of the x-men comics and the two previous films then you may agree that this one has been mucked all over! The writing is so far out there you wonder if they gave an intern a crack at it. It seems that no consideration was taken in following all the characters back stories. Obviously you don't want to drag it on forever, but you shouldn't just throw new mutants in the mix with only a wink as to why they are involved. *Could Spoil*Character's ruined: XaiverMystique (Best Bad Girl Ever Pre-X3)Dr. Grey (Should Have Became The Phoenix/In Flames)Cyclops RogueMagneto (almost) Also, all the relationships are destroyed.

I don't share my bad ideas! Why do filmmakers????",X-Men - The Last Stand
751,browndc-1,Character Development......?,5,28 May 2006,"The change in director for this movie was clear from the beginning. Brett Ratner did a great job with the action, pacing, and special effects, but the emotion and character depth emphasized in Bryan Singer's X-Men and X-2 were absent, which is what made this film fall short of its predecessors. The biggest case of this is Halle Berry, who allegedly only agreed to do this film if her character were developed more.Note to Halle Berry: more screen time does not mean character development. Seeing more of her merely led to further revelation of the flatness of Storm's character. She is sad about all the sad things, and always does the ""right thing."" There is no conflict in her life. There is one moment where she appears to be in conflict (can't spoil what the moment is), but there is no reason given that she wouldn't choose the obvious course of action.The other characters' levels of emotion and personal conflict take a hit too. The depth of newcomer the Juggernaut's character can be summed up by this line: ""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch."" Wolverine is usually a very conflicted character, but we don't see nearly as much of his personal journey as in previous movies. When characters get into high-stakes conflicts (Ice Man and Pyro, Prof. X and Magneto, Angel and his father, and so on), they say words, but there isn't much emotion behind them. Actions happen, but the high stakes seem extremely artificial. There were laughs throughout the theater in the supposed ""tender"" moments.And most disappointing of all, Nightcrawler isn't in this movie. Apparently there were already too many blue characters. 20th Century Fox should have waited until Singer was done with Superman.",X-Men - The Last Stand
752,artemis-fowl-sues,You have the cake...but not icing.,5,6 June 2006,"It was obvious from the starting of the movie that the movie had a different feel to it. Subjected to a new director, I came to the cinema with an open mind, thinking that a little difference in direction might be an interesting addition to the movie.For this movie you have great actors in the cast, an awesome budget waiting to be burned and possibly enough material to pick and create a wonderful script from. Sure, it will not be as faithful to the comic series but then after watching the prequels, I have to say that this new universe is a welcoming addition.Instead I ended up being entertained by another typical summer movie where CGI triumphs over characters, lame attempts of humour, lack of subtext and an ending that seemed to be echoing the ending of Van Helsing. Yes, I know suspension of belief is required...but not the suspension of intelligence.Gone where the beautiful in-jokes that made the first two movies entertaining to watch for the die-hard fans, gone were the antagonist-protagonist tensions, instead we are replaced with those stereotypical caricature of villains and heroes, where the former are portrayed to be without any semblance of honour or charm that seduces you to their side. (The Magneto here doesn't seem to give a damn about those he fought for, why do people fight for him again?) And the plot, it seemed that they decided to take some of the memorable stories in the comics...and churned out this. It started promising with a brief introduction of Jean Grey and Angel, then Jean is turned into this thing that does little after killing Cyclops but pose, look pretty and randomly lose control to showcase more CGI. They have a chance here to fully develop the underused Cyclops instead they tossed him aside to give some angst to the audience and Wolverine. Angel...why does he even a LARGE portion of the poster? All he does if pose with his large white wings, fly ala Superman and save his dad. In less than ten minutes. One would think with the significance of him in merchandise he would have been fleshed out.A great deal of characters are underused here and most of them are either killed, lost their powers or become wallpapers in the background. You wonder why are there in the first place. It was fun to spot characters though, especially during the Final Battle Scene.Its not without its good points though. There are some lovely moments in the story, when Xavier was killed, I could actually hear a collective gasp in the cinema. And I felt strongly during Angel's scene where he frantically grind of his wings because he feared the fact that he was a mutant. It's an amazing way to show how much certain mutants would go just to blend in.Alas they are severely overshadowed by the lack of depth, character development and a strong plot.If anything it lacked a soul.

753,GoodAiden,Could Have Been Better,6,28 May 2006,"From the very start of the movie, it felt like it was missing something ... Oh yea, it was ... Bryan Singer. The man who created the franchise and then abandoned it when it needed him the most. This COULD have been the best one of the three. Darker plot, great action, but it didn't have touch that Singer gave it to make it great. Granted you will be shocked (REALLY SHOCKED) when you watch this movie, but it left me with a feeling of what if, rather than awe. The only reason I can imagine why Singer left was the script. It wasn't great, but it wasn't awful. Some of the sub-plots were worthless, but I can't blame Singer for that. So on behalf of all the grateful fans of the first two (great) movies, thank you Mr. Singer. I hope Superman was worth it.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The only thing that remotely saves it from being a total disaster is the graphics, and the hope that you will see it develop into a good movie.

Dialogue is dumbed down to the point where characters (except Storm) have 1-5 actual lines to deliver, most of which are attempts at humor or catch phrases that fall flat, and most of which seem out of character. Major characters are killed off at random (very early on) without much of a benefit to the storyline, and main characters lose their powers with seemingly no benefit to the strength of the story. None of the new characters introduced have more than a handful of scenes, none of which offer any satisfactory exploration of back-story.

Better action, humor, sadness, effects and a stronger connection for our heroes and villains. X3 never undermines the audience and does all that is expected of it. Direction is great by Brett Ratner and though they take us somewhere fresh, the script was smart and fun. Sound is sharp and vigorous, as you'd expect from an action film. Design is suave and the collaboration between whatever was left of Singer's crew and Ratner's crew was flawless. The overall impact of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done.

The movie was a little rushed and way too short. The end of the movie didn't seem rushed at all though. The movie was very funny. In my opinion, it is the funniest Marvel movie to date. It had the whole theater laughing. The only things that needed to be worked on is the time, and some of the lines. Some of them were corny. Most of the acting was pretty good though.

Cyclops gets whacked and then Professor X, Mystique gets taken out of the picture and even at the end of the film Magneto is finally silenced.This gives the other characters a chance to shine with Ice Man Finally getting some action when he squares up against Pyro (Yeah we didn't see that coming) excellent battle at the end of the film and even though it seems like this might be the last film there is always something which says nah were goina see another one, Thanks to the writers for getting rid of magneto i mean hes a good bad guy an all that but what about apocalypse and Mr sinister there is a whole host of bad guys out there Bit disappointed with the casting though i felt Vinnie Jones as the Jugernaught is a bit Stupid and why wasn't Collosus Russian Also Angel/Warren was a bit of a no show he didn't do anything except save one person, i know it was his dad but come on he flew all that way least he could have done was get some drinks or something Kelsey Grammar as Beast thought Kinda worked there is hope yet Overall this is a good film unless you are an absolute fool who goes on about it not following the comics or the cartoon But lets introduce some more characters now, Apocalypse as the new bad guy and lets get Gambit in the picture we all like him right",X-Men - The Last Stand
759,johnsyaface,"Good movie, BUT not as good as the previous 2",7,27 May 2006,"As a big fan of the previous X-Men movies, i was quite excited to watch the final movie of the trilogy. And after watching it I was quite disappointed with several reasons. 1 was the lack of character development with the new mutants which included Callisto and Angel. Another disappointment was that Bryan Singer did not direct and write the script for the movie, which would disappoint viewers because the new director would add a ""fuzzy"" feeling which makes it perfectly obvious that Singer had no participation in the project and made the movie sloppy and often the storyline was rushed. Now I'm not a big fan of the comics, but from the best of my knowledge the storyline with Jean Grey as the Phoenix in my opinion did not help shape the overall plot line of the movie which was the ""cure"" for mutants. The movie would also disappoint when Cyclops and Professor X would have small parts and would be less significant in the movie, especially Cyclops. Mystique's role as well would be reduced and would be nonexistent in the movie. But the movie didn't completely fail, as it had some success to it as well. For example the rivalry between Pyro and Iceman would be exploited in the movie and eventually both mutants would face off. Pyro was also good to watch as he carried his brash and cockiness personality from part 2 to the part 3. The fighting sequence towards the end of the movie was brilliantly directed as well, and an meaningful ending which involved Magneto was exceptionally coordinated which would lead viewers to ponder if a part 4 would be made. X-Men The Last Stand had some negative and positive points and for that reason I rate it a 7 out 0f 10 stars and overall the movie is worth watching.",X-Men - The Last Stand
760,cen19,Huge disappointment,6,5 June 2006,"Despite the critics panning this movie, I was certain it couldn't be as bad as they were saying. Well not only is it every bit as bad as they said, its quite possibly even worse.The resurrection of Jean Grey as The Phoenix seemed to be a plausible, even clever way to continue the series of movies. Unfortunately, the character is never developed. Other than being incredibly powerful, the most powerful of all mutants, the Phoenix plot goes nowhere. Why does she join Magneto? Most of the time she's with him, she's just standing there in a long, ugly dress. She has no identifiable emotion other than anger, but we're never sure what she's all twisted up about. The flashback to 20 years earlier when Xavier and Eric first meet the teenage Jean held promise, but it was all downhill after that.The movie was a total waste of the Cyclops/Scott character. If anything, Scott's love for Jean should have been what saved her. Instead, he's killed (we assume vaporized, though its never shown) by Phoenix very early in the movie. I can't believe James Marsden agreed to do the movie after reading the script.The same goes for Xavier's death at the hands, nay mind, of Phoenix. What was the point? We do see Xavier get vaporized, but it doesn't make any sense. Despite Magneto telling Jean to stop, he seems to easily recover from Xavier's death without much of a problem and whisks Phoenix away and into hiding. Xavier has always been the central, moral character. His loss so early on in the movie, let alone his loss at all, was foolish. He should have held a key role in the movie as to guide the other characters in how to handle the Phoenix, and further explain her torment.Rogue has almost no role in the movie, nor does Colossus. They're there, but the characters are flat and come across as nothing more than filler for the scenery. The same can be said for all of the other mutants that join forces with Magneto.. they're just filler. The Multiple Man character could have been interesting, but I don't think he said more than ten words.Angel seemed to be a promising character, if the movie's trailers were to be believed, but despite Angel's fantastic appearance (wings and all), nothing much comes of that character either.Kelsey Grammar as Hank McCoy, The Beast, seemed a logical casting choice. However he comes across as nothing more than a hairy, blue guy, with nifty gymnastic abilities. The Night Crawler character in X2 was much better developed and thought out. That character had a viable part in the movie whereas Beast doesn't.Storm is way overplayed in the movie and as a result becomes the de-facto lead character. Despite her vastly increased screen time, the Storm character should have never had this much focus. If reports are to be believed, blame Halle Berry for this. She allegedly balked at signing on to do the movie unless her character was given a key role.Wolverine is the second lead character in the movie after Storm. If anything, Wolverine should have had a more prominent role, but the character is cliché (too cartoonish), full of one liners but not much else. I can't fault Hugh Jackman for this. If this was the script he was given, how much can be done about it?Interesting plot turn with Mystique losing her powers to the mutant serum, and also interesting was how quickly Magneto dumped her since she was no longer ""one of them"". If anyone was all about being a mutant, and a great villain, it was Mystique.I liked the Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat character and thought she added to the movie. Her chase scene with Juggernaut was one of the movies bright spots. The same goes for Bobby/Ice Man. We got to see the inevitable showdown between he and Pyro, and of course Iceman was the victor, but it was still a decent scene.Magneto lifting the Golden Gate Bridge and moving so that the mainland connected with Alcatraz Island was a waste of special effects. Yeah, neat idea, but totally unnecessary mutant grandstanding. His loss of powers to the mutant serum was nicely played, credit Ian McKellen's acting ability to pull it off.By the time the movie was nearing an end, which came fairly quickly, I found myself hoping that the whole thing was nothing more than an X-Men Danger Room simulation. Unfortunately, that never came to pass.Being the X-Men universe, who knows if Jean, Scott, and Xavier really are dead. If there are plans for an X4, they had best try to bring back the dead characters right from the start with a plausible explanation and just make pretend the rest never happened. Maybe some of the script writers from Dallas who brought back Bobby can be recruited to develop ideas. Jean wakes up and goes to the shower, and there stands Scott, and we discover it was nothing more than a dream.Its a shame that X3 is where this series ended, at least I'm assuming this was the last installment, after the first two excellent movies. It could have ended on a high point, but instead it was by far an unworthy part of an otherwise fine series.",X-Men - The Last Stand
761,paper-revolution,Best Movie of the Year,10,24 June 2006,"First of all, I would like to say that I've never watched the comics. Looking through the message boards, I've noticed that many fans of the original comicbook series were seriously unhappy with this movie. But I have never watched the comic series before. That been said, I would like to say that this is definitely the best movie of the year! Usually when my hopes are high for a movie, it turns out to be bad. This was the first exception in my life. X-Men 3 was an extremely extraordinary movie with good plot, great characters, excellent writing, and some nice CG effects.The movie's plot is basically about a new 'cure' for mutants, and the battle that resulted from its invention. It was an interesting plot line, and the writing was surprisingly good. It didn't drag the plot and make it heavy, nor did it pace it too fast too make it light. It was an extremely thoughtful, meaningful plot that was also entertaining and exciting at the same time.The characters were also a pleasure to watch. Unlike the previous movies of the franchise, where the movie was centered on only one or two characters, this movie had developed all of its characters quite well. Despite the introduction of a handful of new characters, they were portrayed with quite some depth and we got to get fairly acquainted with them (the only exception probably might be Angel and that Tin guy, but, oh well, nobody's perfect).Add to that the spectacular special effects that really made this movie a treat to watch. It's almost enough to make you want to be a mutant! To sum it up, this movie was the best movie that I've seen this year, and also in a long time! Noteworthy for an award, in my opinion!

763,orgone_accumulator1,"Terrible film, devoid of nearly everything a good movie needs",1,24 May 2006,"Unnecessary deaths that elicited no emotional response besides disappointment typify this movie.A great many people will enjoy it for the ""spectacle"", but I hope a reasonable number of individuals will be able to recognize this for a plodding, thoughtless piece of dreck that could only stimulate people who have porridge for brains.I'm just offering my opinion, however ... I'm not looking to sway anyone else to my argument. If you enjoy the movie, good for you. Unfortunately, I like for there to be more plot, more story and more realistic emotional interaction ... and, while I know this is science fiction and therefore unrealistic, couldn't it at least be CREDIBLE? Seriously, are we supposed to believe that Angel flew all the way from Westchester, NY to San Francisco, CA in the course of a few hours? Also, his character was useless ... almost everyone in the movie was flat, 2-dimensional and uninspiring. The two times the word ""bitch"" was used seemed so pointless ... mild-expletives thrown in for the sake of it, rather than because the situation posited by the film actually called for it.This film was a hackneyed piece of garbage ... even the spectacle of effects, fights and carnage was boring.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I didn't mind the lack of continuity in the first movie, and I tolerated it in the second movie, but this movie middle fingers the original story completely and not without a certain amount of glee I might add.The first two movies were all about Wolverine and the third movie is AGAIN all about Wolverine. And they want to give him his own spin off movie. WHY? Rouge is still useless and never ends up using her powers correctly, which is sad because she was one of the most powerful characters whether the movie wanted to admit it or not.They introduce more supporting characters in this movie than in the last two combined (keep in mind that this is suppose to be the FINAL movie in the trilogy).Now I understand that in a final movie of a trilogy you can expect a death toll, but this movie's idea of closer is the senseless slaughter anyone who has the potential to reopen the series.I can't say anymore without spoilers.

I'm sorry but I must be brutally honest, the last film in a trilogy must always be the longest! I also had a serious problem with how they thought it was wise to kill of a lot of the main characters, like Cyclops had no part whatsoever because Jean Grey somehow survived in a bubble and then blew him up. Cyclops is one of the biggest characters in X-men, it was a bad idea to kill him off.I also do not understand why they put Angel in the film, he serves absolutely no purpose, he looks like he is going to do something but he never does.

766,spartacus533,X-Men Suffers without ex-Singer,6,5 June 2006,"Somewhere way back in the year 2000 one man, Bryan Singer, breathed life into the comic book genre by giving the world X-Men, a funny, smart, violent adaption of the hit comic books by Stan Lee. Fast forward four and a half years, and Bryan Singer leaves amidst allegations of arguments with studio execs. Another year after that, and after four directors, Brett Ratner released the ""last"" (said with baited breath) in the ""trilogy"", X-Men: The Last Stand. My first criticism... the man who brought the world the travesty that was Rush Hour 2 is given $200 million to direct a super-hero film? What blaspheme is this? To give him credit, he ticks some of the boxes: good special effects, brings out Storm and Wolverine to their full potential, has a reasonably good ending, and unleashes a good performance from Famke Jensen. But his worst mistake, and what is, inevitably, the downfall of the movie, is the lack of emotion. You should be upset when Professor X dies, but his death is so overblown and stupid that you really couldn't care less. You should feel Rogue's pain as she sees Bobby with a girl who he can embrace, but again, no emotion. Ratner manages to take a great scenario (the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge), and, thanks to shoddy camera work, destroy it. The final stand-off, thrilling as it is, is oddly anti-climatic, although we challenge you not to go ""Wow"" as Pheonix (Jean Grey) destroys everything around her in a massive explosion of tele-kinetic power. And how, exactly, do they decide to bring up the story line of Pheonix, if there isn't even a mention of this, or a hint of Jean's inner demon, in the previous two? Add to the mix a lot of characters that come and go (Poster boy Angel is on screen for, give or take, five minutes), and an early demise for the mysterious Mystique and Cyclops, and you have a disappointing movie, that in future years, will be said in the same breath as Jurassic Park III, and, dare I say it, The Matrix Revolutions **/***",X-Men - The Last Stand
767,Nikker1985-1,"X-Men 3:Last Stand was bad, make it again,this time with a real plot.",1,27 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last superhero movie I will ever seeX-Men 3:Last Stand AKA Last Superhero movie I will ever see.The movie goes like this. Everybody dies. And not in the end, in the beginning. More than 30 years of X-Men mythology just so that a stupid producer kills them all in one lousy movie. Cyclops dies in almost the first minute. Was he not supposed to be the successor of Xavier for almost three decades? Oh, by the way Xavier dies in the second minute. What is it with Rogue anyways? Why do they have her in the movie? She never does anything and besides the first movie where she was a ""key"" character. Even then they fitted her in, in an off-handedly way just so they can say that they have many characters. Sorry but she was never needed, she did not fight, she did not talk, she did not even have a real romance. I waited soooooooo long to finally see the battle between Iceman (Personal Favorite) and Pyro and I am telling, it is the lousiest, dumbest, most boring fight ever. The fight between Hugh Grand and Colin Firth (AKA Marc Darci) from Bridget's Jones Diary 2 was like hundreds of times more extreme. And why the ""I walk through walls"" girl has a bigger part than Colossus? Was she not supposed to be nothing more than just an extra? Never before have I been that disappointed from a movie. It is the first time I write a review about one. This is how angry I am.For instance, Spiderman 2.In the comic Spiderman never revealed his identity. In the movie every body saw him. 40 years of Spiderman comics animation and cartoons for one lousy movie to spoil it all. Why? Why don't you simply make a normal movie where you see your favorite character kick people straight in the nose? In Spiderman 1 you had to wait through the whole movie to see him finally obtain and use his powers. In the second movie you think to yourself, finally 2 hours of bum kicking when for no reason, he looses his stupid powers. I simply cant believe that all this dump producers are getting millions of dollars for their work, and you people support them by convincing yourself that you liked the movies. No you did not like the movies, you just think you did. I know 4 year old boys who would make superhero movies 10 times more successful. I say Boycott the movie, don't see it, download it from the internet, start sending letters to everyone you know, this time, it is up to us to save the mutants.How can you destroy a movie with vampires, werewolves and Kate Beckinsale? You cant!!!!! Only the director Stephen Sommers could achieve that.Here is how X-Men 4 will be: Rogue finds out that Iceman was going out with her just because of a stupid bet he made with Pyro, so she dumps him. It turns out that Iceman actually really loves her. He tries to find her and she is actually together with Pyro at the time. Meanwhile funny token guy Wolverine is afraid that he is in love with Cyclops just because he is a huge one eyed Pr!ck. Iceman gets together with ""walk through walls girl"" and go to the prom together. Iceman somehow convinces Rogue to come back and both Rogue and ""walk through walls"" girl share the Queen of the prom title. Wolverine makes out with beast.All ends well. Titles fall while you see some behind the scenes footage plus funny outtakes.Support to Alan Cumming AKA Nightcrawler who did not sold out by participating in the Movie. and people please stop saying that this review was not helpfull, the movie sucked, you expected more and you know it.",X-Men - The Last Stand

769,james-1780,The best and the worst of the trilogy,4,19 June 2006,"X men 3: The best and the worst of the trilogy. The film begins better than the others with a lot of potential and a strong emotional charge, which leads you to believe that the second act will be nail bitingly intriguing and the finale explosive. But as the dreadful storyline, which deviates from the cartoon and comic immensely, unfolds, we are left as bewildered and unsatisfied as a diner who has been able to smell the gourmet meal from the kitchen, but is served 'Jellied eels and a pint'.I feel that Ratner was a little out of his genre on this one. There was no real character development for any of our mutant heroes, who seemed to just pop in and out of the story whenever a fight scene was to commence, to the point where some of our favourite X men were just cameos. And hardly any of the social, humanitarian issues, which are paramount to the concept of the X men, are delved into.Jean Grey is found alive, though neither she nor Professor X are able to control her extraordinarily powerful alter ego, The Phoenix. The obvious opportunity doesn't escape Magneto's attention who steps in to make The Phoenix the newest addition to his mutant militants. The government have concocted a 'cure' for the mutant gene and now with The Phoenix on his side, Magneto and his cohorts endeavour to destroy this so called cure, which he believes the government are using to wipe out mutants everywhere. Wolverine defiantly goes after The Phoenix to rescue Jean from her dominance. All the conflicting factors come to a head when Magneto unleashes his evil forces on the government establishment holding the 'cure'. The X men regroup and set out to thwart Magneto. An all out action packed rumble between the military, Magneto's mutants and the X men set up the final showdown.If you are not a die hard fan of the comic or cartoon you may enjoy certain plot twists, the variety of new and exciting mutants and some of the excellent action scenes, but will feel let down by the anti-climatic ending; overall for a non-fan it's a good watch. For a true fan of the X men, you will be bitterly disappointed at the fact that the film makes no attempt to stay true to its origin. (The opposite being one of the reasons why Spiderman is such a success). This, supposed last, of the X men films substitutes the amazing storyline of morals, ethics and action which Stan Lee weaved together, for a incoherent, unfulfilling sequence of events which would raise bile to the throat of anyone who actually read more than two of the comics or watched any of the cartoons. Also Jugernaught is as bad as he looks! Best scene: When Wolverine is being chased through the woods by a mutant who can produce wooden dangers from his body and throw them with acute accuracy.Should have been called 'The Y Men', as nothing about this film resembles our comic book heroes, and nobody knows why.",X-Men - The Last Stand

X-Men: The Last Stand is a cheap excuse to see some mild fight scenes and a little bit of skin. The storyline from the comic books has been completely abandoned. The random swearing is what set me off the most. ""I'm the juggernaut...b*tch!"" What is that? That's about the scripted equivalent of the filming in ""The Blair Witch Project"". Or how about my fave ""Who's running...d*ckhe@d!"" Was that necessary? Especially coming from a supposedly innocent and child-like character?

771,juzzy_anderson,How many stories can Brett Ratner tell?,3,27 July 2006,"Guys I don't give spoilers away so any of my work will steer clear. This movie bothered me considerably. I loved x men 2 and thought what Brett Ratner did with Red Dragon was classy so I was really looking forward to X Men 3. However short and sweet the story is choppy. There are no common threads to the multiple story lines, I got the feeling Brett Ratner wanted to go big and prove himself when he didn't really need to. Wolverine annoyed me at the start and then started to settle into character. This left me uneasy for a while. This movie went through several directors until it landed with Ratner who was ironically toted to direct Superman returns at one stage, This process usually ends badly with passing directors asking for other ideas and new scenes until it lands with Spock at the helm trying to do Kirks job. The film grade was grainy in parts and could have been touched up with digital effects. A similar instance of this was ""Daredevil"" the grainy picture left a dull impact when it's a comic book movie and bright colors are needed to bring it to life, However I'm sure the DVD version will look nice. As with other comic book films there is usually a sense of continuity in cinematic style themes and characterisation X-Men 3 lacks this and seems to have gone in a completely different direction. Some may say well that's because of the dark phoenix story. Uh not really if you're clever you can do it. I'm a screenwriter once you realise the possibilities then you realise what can be done. There were some really cool parts but over time the bad outweighed the good which leads the film to be messy and left me feeling unengaged. I like the end scene one of my favorite's for leaving a movie franchise open. I'm hoping they'll make X men 4 it's an awesome series. Cheers",X-Men - The Last Stand

I think Rouge could have done a lot more because of the whole thing about her getting the cure and stuff and a lot more could have happened between Bobby and Kitty. Also I don't think Cyclops should have died of do soon (I think he only had like two lines) and how could they do that to the professor.Also I really hated the whole Jean being evil because she was such a great character and then they go and kill her and bring her back evil(you can't do that to a character as good as Jean) Buty as a whole the film was enjoyable!,X-Men - The Last Stand

However, this setback hardly taints the movie, as it kept me and the entire audience captivated and on-edge from beginning till end.I would recommend this movie to anyone if they remotely enjoy xmen, or even anyone else interested in a fast-paced action movie.

Even Chris Tucker couldn't have made this much worse. I felt like there was no action, despite the many action scenes, because there was no tension or excitement. All feelings I had for any characters in the previous films were gone. Deep characters turned into cardboard cutouts. Not to mention SPOILER_______________________________ How could they kill off the best people, and make the best characters completely absent? Rogue and Wolverine's stories disappeared, and Jean Grey was not the Phoenix that the end of the second film foreshadowed. Just a stupid bad guy. Storm also ruined every shot she was in (which was way too many). I remembered reading that Halle Berry only agreed to reprise her role as Storm if they gave her character more significance in the movie, and contained her in more shots. It was very obvious, and she was totally inappropriate. I felt like most of her lines were written for another character. Maybe Cyclops was killed off in the beginning because Halle wanted all his lines. screw THAT!!! I'm so irked, and I apologize for acting on it, but a part of me died last night at 12:30am, and it will never be brought back to life. screw it, I'm through. I miss Bryan Singer. I hope Superman is so incredible that it buries this heap of trash where nobody will find it. I will end with this ""inspirational"" line that stuck with me since I watched the movie. ""Come on guys, we can't give up. We're X-MEN!!!"" -Wolverine P.S. The CG effects looked like they were straight out of 1996. Angel had no relevance to the story and his wings looked so fake, I couldn't believe the film cost as much as it did. No special effects were convincing, and no action scenes were exciting.

776,carlsalf,Excellent third (final?) installment,10,16 May 2006,"I was very lucky to see this movie at the worldwide premiere that took place last Monday (May 15th) at Mexico City. I have to say that for me this was the movie to see this summer, and actually it exceeded all my expectations. I have loved the previous X Men movies, and this was not an exception.First, the story is right in all its contents, Drama: The cure that has been developed to suppress the mutant gene has a particular resonance (curing homosexuality, anyone?); Action: The war surfacing among both sides of the mutants and the humans caught in the middle of it all that , and of course the Mystery that brings it all together: The return of one very powerful character (actually anyone that has seen X-Men: United and the marketing for this movie knows exactly who I am talking about).The action is in the right place and in the right dose, although it does take a little to kick in, and as with the previous installments the visual effects are top-notch, including of course the new entries to the teams Angel, Juggernaut and specially Beast, he looks as good as Nightcrawler in the previous installment, despite some previous concern. Moreover, the change in director is practically non-consequential, it has the great quality that was the norm with Bryan Singer (who we hope does a great job in Returning Superman to the big screen.)Although in the other movies the acting has not been the center stage, I believe that in this particular movie, Ian McKellen and Famke Jenssen gave very good performances, particularly towards the end of the movie in which every thing is decided, including of course ""SPOILER BEGINS"" who dies and who loses its mutant powers because of the cure (for a hint: In the Full Trailer for the movie an image of Rebeca Romijn  AKA Mystique- without her blue skin, can be seen). As a matter of fact despite the excellent quality of the movie, I am very surprise that 20th Century Fox decided to ended these successful series in the third installment, believe me when I say that it has ended because X-Men: The Last Stand sheds as many characters (or powers) as Beast sheds fur in the furniture (or for any TV fan, as 24 shed characters this particular season). ""SPOILER ENDS"" Despite the good grade that I am giving to the movie, one particular was not that good: Some characters are a little (if not very) under used, with so many mutants returning and as many new some mutants being added to the mix, not all of them have that much screen time and that diminishes the impact of their stories (although they are not that important in the end to be true, but somehow it will be better to focus in some of the wide variety of mutants.) In the end, I believe this was a better movie than the previous two, it has it's heart in the right place, it's pace is solid and never lags an excellent story that at the end has as many repercussions as could be imagined.",X-Men - The Last Stand
777,csteiner-1,Worst of the three,4,7 June 2006,"I think the trailer to ""Ghost Rider"" was the best part of this movie. They could have done so much more with this movie. There was too much focus on quantity (all of the different mutants), with very little focus on quality (uhh...a story). Spoilers:Specific reasons that made this movie bad.1. For some reason Nightcrawler isn't in this movie at all. He made X-men 2 a very entertaining movie. 2. Archangel was only in the movie so that he could fly by and save his own father from falling. Otherwise, he was just there for the awe factor. 3. The fact that Phoenix (Jean Grey) is really Dark Phoenix. 4. The way they killed off Cyclops at the beginning without any real knowledge that he is in fact dead. I was actually waiting for him to suddenly show up and stop Jean from doing what she was doing or something. 5. Pheonix destroys the body of Professor X. 6. The whole golden gate bridge to alcatraz thing. For some reason magneto seems a lot more powerful than before.I left the movie theatre feeling empty. The people that are giving this movie a high rating (7 or higher) must either be young kids that find anything to do with superheros amazing, or they are people that like to go to no nonsense movies with a lot of action and absolutely little story. These are the type of people that loved 2 Fast 2 Furious and can't wait for Fast and the Furious 3 - Tokyo Drift. I own the first two installments of the X-men franchise.

778,Tutankh,"Not too shabby, but all in all little more than a popcorn flick",6,6 June 2006,"Having just seen X3: The Last Stand for the second time, I've formulated a couple of opinions. There were a few things i liked, and several things I didn't.Firstly, I loved the opening sequences. They did a lovely job making Ian McKellen look twenty years younger. Kudos there, and kudos on storyboarding the scene. While we're on the subject, it was VERY nice to see some further evidence of Charles' character. Namely that he frequently views bottling up issues as the best way to deal with them. The BEST improvement over the other two films though, (IMO) was Storm's improved role. Finally they let her actually use her powers WELL.As far as things that need improvement. I would've liked to see some acknowledgment of the relationship between Charles and Juggernaut. Second, although I appreciate the nods to comic fans like finally seeing Bobby iced over, it would've been even better to see an actual fight between he and Pyro rather than just a beam war. This underscores my main problem with all of the movies: There is not enough good action to legitimize the lack of story and character development. The large fights at the end have consistently broken down into one-on-one fights: Pyro vs. Iceman, Storm vs. Calysto, Juggernaut vs. Kitty, etc. In X2 and X men this was also true. It would be nice to see the team actually work as a team for more than the thirty seconds it takes for Colossus to fling wolverine at Magneto. Also a minor point... I'm not sure that Leech's power should have worked on Juggernaut given that his abilities are not a mutation but magically endowed. In conclusion, X-Men 3 shows us some vast action scenes which really aren't all that vast, showcasing characters which really aren't all that deep. Despite these There are a few very nice nods to the comics, and SOME characters which are finally given ample attention, while others like Colossus who are left in the dust. All in all, not a terrible movie, worth a watch, but don't expect to be wowed... especially since it cost over two hundred million to make. Go see the matinée.6/10---Slightly better than average",X-Men - The Last Stand
779,ksheyman,Like a big mac served in a fancy restaurant.,1,28 May 2006,"My first criticism is that the film was WAY too short. The plot was rushed and incomplete. The characters lacked development, the story, being so hastily made, lacked emotion and substance. My second criticism is the script. The dialog was unbelievably bad. The lines were completely shallow and not usually more than a few words. It's hard to develop characters when they barely speak. My third criticism was the story itself. Without spoiling the movie, i'll just say that it did not draw a clear enough line between the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys', so you're watching them fight without even really knowing why (they appear to want the same thing). The film didn't establish the motives or goals for any of the characters. There is no clear protagonist, no clear antagonist. The entire movie is an ending, basically. The filmmakers seem to have expected the intense action to make up for the shortcomings of the script, but since there is no clear REASON for the action, it's all in vain. I hated the movie, and felt it was a major letdown. The first two films were great. This one lacks all the redeeming qualities those had. No character development, no story resolution. Major characters from the other two movies had minor bit parts in this one. Other characters behaved in ways that were completely contradictory to their morals (as established in the other films). Brett Ratner has made a mockery of a great film franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
780,Prince_Cyan,Barely worth it,6,25 May 2006,"I saw this movie at a sneak preview at my local theater last night and I must say I was HIGHLY disappointed. Minor Spoilers contained within.The movie begins with flashbacks in which we see Magneto and Professor X coming to see Jean Grey as a child, and another of Warren Worthington trying to hide his mutanity (now there's a fake word). It's rather boring compared to the second movie's opening.Then the movie starts with a battle and you begin to wonder how Halle Berry keeps getting work. Also you wonder how her ability to control the wind allows her to twirl across the room.It's not even worth telling you what it's about any further, just that the film continues with contrived dialog, forced action, bad acting, and more Halle Berry. There are multiple times throughout the film when I expected a character to scream ""KHAAAAAAAAAAN!"" Honestly, I think that would have added more humor than the ""jokes"" they slipped in here and there.I was also disappointed to see Cameron Bright play the sad miracle child in this movie. Why must he always play the creepy kid? Any script that calls for a messed up little boy seems to be sent to him, quite like every script that needs a little girl goes to Dakota Fanning.One redeeming aspect of the movie is the action scenes, and I doubt everyone gets as excited over an action scene as I do, so it's really not much of a bonus. The other is it's abundance of femme fatals. Famke Janssen is amazing as Phoenix. As Jean Grey she's okay. I prefer her evil. Also, Mystique is as amazing as ever.

This movie is definitely the worst of the three, it is still worth watching in the theater, but it is undeserving of a ranking better than the original. The X-series is never going to set any cinematic history for dramatic dialogue but the dialogue/interplay appeared particularly contrived in this installment. To be honest, it seemed that those reprising their roles had really settled into their characters, yet the character dialogue and interaction felt below average. I must say that the critics who claimed that the absence of Singer would be the death knell of the series may have a point. In the other episodes I felt that the movie was cinematically sound, but lacking some experience in some of it actors and lacking plain old talent in others.

The biggest problem the movie has is that it disregards about everything that happened in the previous installments of the movies and just throws a lot of computer generated effects at you without making a lot of sense plot wise.*BIG SPOILERS* For instance the sudden return of Jean Grey.. her ""death"" in X2 was rather dramatic and was also the cliffhanger for X3. Well, in X3 she just pops up out of the water after Cyclops got abit emotional. Just a bright white light and *pop* there she is. I thought they could've given it a little more detail/time than that.Also, what I really disliked was the fact that the director/scriptwriters decided to kill off about everyone who was important in the first two movies. I know this is the last film of the trilogy, but c'mon.. how the hell can any director get away with killing XAVIER in about halfway the movie? How does the director even dare to touch Professor X? Same goes for Magneto, even though I appreciated the irony at the last scene of the movie when Magneto realizes the limits of normal humans. *SPOILERS END*All by all the flick was enjoyable even though it kinda killed of the franchise. I think the movie would've been better if directed by Bryan Singer cause he probably would've made the movie more in line with the previous two. X3 felt more like a standalone movie then a sequel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it is since I expected a lot of Nightcrawling teleportating action, Xavier going nuts ectetera. 6/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Ironically Rattner was once up for this year's Superman so it's funny that he and Singer have traded films in a manner of speaking.Contrary to initial fears and rumors X3 is not trashy but has loads of action a good, solid storyline with all your favorite X Men back and a plot packed with some surprising turns of events. The basic story premise is that the government has found a way to eliminate in other words ""cure"" the mutant X gene thus eliminating mutants from society by turning them into regular human beings. Although humans and mutants have now learned to coexist this newly propagated cure is reason for Magneto (Ian McKellen) to mount an offensive and wage a war on humans in ""a fury the world has never seen..""Rattner has improved on the pacing which in my opinion was but the only fault of X2 keeping a steady balance between character exposition, action and humor. The production quality such as special effects, camera and sound mix is first rate; aside from the established cast Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin there are some new mutant entries Kelsey Grammar as ""The Beast"" aka secretary for mutant affairs, Vinnie Jones as ""The Juggernaut"" and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, a young girl who can walk through walls and serves as Rogue's rival love interest for Bobby.The best acting, however, belongs to Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and most of all to Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto). McKellen who happened to be the best part of this year's abysmal DaVinci Code is quite the scene stealer in X3 portraying a smart, calm yet lethal villain, who happens to come across quite sympathetic.In a nutshell: finally a nice, solid good summer blockbuster - good entertainment!",X-Men - The Last Stand
785,solimondi,"Not bad, but wasted potential",6,27 May 2006,"I have very mixed feelings about this film. SPOILERS... There were points I enjoyed, things I liked. As a fan of the comics, I saw many nods to the audience that were appreciated. The acting was strong (given what the actors had to work with), the action was good, but... there were several mistakes made with this. I can't help but think that these moments I enjoyed could have been in a movie that worked very well cinematically (which X2 did), which this didn't. Why knock out half of your established characters in the third movie of a trilogy and add new ones? I'll take one Mystique, who has been built into a strong character over the course of two films, than 10 anonymous mutants who only serve as a means to show off CGI. The treatment of Cyclops was inexcusable, and the death that happened halfway through the film angered me so greatly that I almost walked out. After the credits, I felt much better, but I still can't help but feel that so much more could have been done with this. If only FOX had been willing to wait a year and get Singer back at the helm. If only they hadn't trimmed Mardsen's part down for his involvement with Superman Returns. If only the script writer had worked with the characters that had been developed in the previous two films, instead of tossing them out the window and starting at square one. I guess I'll enjoy this one, but I think that I'll always dream about the film that could have been...",X-Men - The Last Stand
786,die_hard_ringer,I smell a rat.,2,26 May 2006,"I don't think I ever fully appreciated Bryan Singer until now. I thought that he could have done a better job on the first two films. Now I see how great he really was. He had hte ability to balance a bunch of different characters and still make us feel them, whereas Brett Ratner has a billion mutants and not a single one who has a character. Even the already-established characters like Storm, Wolverine, and sundry fade into the periphery. The plot is convoluded, the characters completely changed and (SPOILERS!!!) they kill characters who should not have died. I'm sorry, but I thought that Scott deserved better than to die in the first 15 minutes of film, and it bothers me that Xavier followed soon after and I just CANNOT believe that Wolverine A) could and B) would kill Jean Grey, there's no way the Phoenix would let him. I'm rambling, I know, and this just scratches to surface of what was wrong with the film. But damn, it was so disappointing. I waited so long for this movie...",X-Men - The Last Stand
787,twigboy4lf,Way to screw up a good thing!,1,27 May 2006,"What a pile of crap this movie is. I loved X-men. I loved the movies, the toys, the cartoon, and the comics. This movie did known of them justice. It was a lame, chessey waste of time. First, how do you kill off the professor and cyclops. Mystique was in it 5 min., just long enough to get her naked. I am a huge fan of rebecca romjin getting naked and all but no point being in this movie. Two of the biggest X-men ever! The leaders. Then you cure rouge and magneto. Stupid. The script was good awful. The lines in this movie were awful. This movie was awful. They should bring back Bryan Singer and redue this movie. This movie had nothing to do with anything in the comics. Then, we get a crappy love story subplot with Iceman and shadowcat that is boring and dumb. Overall I rate this movie as crap and will never see it again. As far as I am concerned, the story ended at X2. Rathner, stick to Rush Hour, you were good at those.",X-Men - The Last Stand
788,skillmasta001,Horrible Writing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4,25 May 2006,"If you liked the first two x-men movies... I am here to caution you. I loved the first two. I can still watch them again and again and I never get tired of them. Bryan Singer was an outstanding director. Bret Ratner did a great job on this one, don't get me wrong, but the biggest problem with the third installment of the saga is the writing. As most people know, Singer dropped out of directing X3 to do the new Superman movie. What most people don't know is that he took his entire writing team with him. The X-men movies are very special to the genre of superhero films, not only because of the cool stunts and awesome action, but also because of the large assortment of characters. Each character is special, as is their power. The new writers took these incredible and unforgettable characters and completely destroyed them. I seriously think that they just took their favorite ones and decided to ignore the others. I couldn't believe where they took the story. Don't get me wrong. This is an incredible movie and it is very entertaining. I was very surprised how well Ratner handled everything. If you fell in love with the characters of the first two movies, you are going to be very disappointed with the story, but you will still be entertained. I think that if the writing team hadn't jumped ship with Singer, this movie could have been the best of the three and I would have rated it a 10. I would encourage everyone to see it, but you will probably walk out with mixed emotions as did I. I gave it a four, because I think that the story is more important than the action (especially in a series like this one), if stunts and special effects were all that I cared for in a movie (and there was nothing in my head but macaroni and cheese), I would I've it a 10 like everyone else is.",X-Men - The Last Stand
789,ianmhart,Ratner blows it,2,1 June 2006,"Make no mistake, Brett Ratner does for the X-Men series what Joel Schumacher did for Batman. His direction adds nothing and subtracts much. Hopefully this sequel won't kill the franchise the way Schumacher did, but anyone at Fox that signs him to another movie needs to be sacked.Ratner directed a mediocre superhero film. Some cool effects and battles, no doubt. Lots of villains, most of whom are dispatched by Wolverine before uttering a word. But in some, the film is flat and soulless.The biggest things I missed from this film were any sense of developing the characters. This was most apparent in the new characters, including Beast and Juggernaut, but especially Angel, who gets top billing in the ads and promotional materials, and all of 3 lines of dialog. If you've seen the commercial, you've seen a good chunk of his on-screen time. In his first scene (10 years earlier) he is ashamed of his powers, and so is his father. Without explanation, he is proud of his wings in the next scene, defies his father, and hops out the window.Established character development also failed to make the cut. Given that the movie clocked in at about 90 minutes, Ratner had time to develop characters and conflicts more, but apparently chose not to. The Iceman/Kitty/Rogue love triangle had as much drama (and just about as much screen time) as an acne cream ad. Rogue, basically the heart of the first film, gets barely more than a series of cameos here.Lingering questions: Why does Kitty miss the snow? She still lives in Westchester County, New York, which is in the snow belt. Why does the San Francisco Bay turn from day to night the second Magneto lands on Alcatraz? How did Angel fly across the country, just minutes after the X-Men's jet? Some might call me a fanboy, but I just like good movies. The first two took plenty of liberties with the characters and turned out great. This one was on-par with Daredevil (minus that film's art-direction).",X-Men - The Last Stand

791,vanbane,what was this? (only a few insignificant spoilers),1,15 November 2012,"What a hatchet job. This truly was a movie comic, but mangled, a hatchet job that strayed far from the comics. Here were glaring mistakes: 1) How did wolverine cut through the neck of a sentinel that had a neck much larger in diameter than his claws?! 2) Why is rogue ugly, when in the comics she's hot, and who wants to see an ugly girl, no offense to the actress.3) Rogue's acting SUCKED.4) Rogue's iceman bf SUCKED, pathetic acting, just facial expressions.5) The fire guy SUCKED, he was a skinny punk looking guy.6) What was with the teen girl dancing with iceman, so now liberals are endorsing soft pedophilia? I thought that was forbidden liberals? 7) Why is magneto the old gay guy, shouldn't he be a youthful old guy like in the comics, not near death like this gay guy is? Dumb.8) So Magneto would really cast off his main helper INSTANTANEOUSLY merely because she lost her powers for a moment, rather than he being the supposed genius and mastermind he is, think of a way to restore her powers? So he just believes instantly whatever the lying gov tells him? How shallow of the director to make Magneto shallow.9) And Wolverine knows he's the only one who can get through to Jean at the end cuz... well cuz magically his flesh after disintegrating via psychic powers can just come up with new material out of no where to restore itself.10) What was with the cheesy mutant who could sense the powers of other mutants? By what MAGIC can you sense the power of someone else lol? ""Uh yeah my mutant power tells me this guy can make spikes come out of his skin"" you might as well have a mutant power that tells you what all the secret recipes of cooks with secret recipes in the world are, or what the length of the sizes of worms are beneath your feet.11) How did Juggernaut lose his power when he isn't a mutant, and his power is supposed to come from the helmet which is magical? UGH.12) Why didn't they find a wider bodied actor to play juggernaut? 13) Why was Jug's helmet silver rather than brown like in the comics? This movie sucked.",X-Men - The Last Stand
792,DeadlyHedley007,X-Men 3 The Last Stand,9,4 June 2006,"Having seen and thoroughly enjoyed X and X-Men two I was more than eager to see X-Men 3 The Last Stand which would complete the trilogy. I knew this would have to be a top action movie and it was. It neatly picked up where X-Men 2left off and gave explanations of what had happened in previous years which affected today.The opening action scene caught my attention immediately and particularly with Wolverine taking centre screen - it was dramatic - fearsome - and the little bit of humour crept in as it does in tight situations as he chomps his cigar he he he.I knew that there were to be quite a few new characters and I also knew from reports as the film was being developments that some would die. I found it very easy to follow the smooth flowing story line between the new characters and the old. What a change there was in Jean Grey now Dark Pheonix - did she really kill Cyclops - we did not actually see him die we ??? Wolverine as always is the best character to watch - I actually believe when I am watching it he exists,his fears, his love and nightmares. His action scenes were terrific but his heart rending scene loving Jean and having to kill her on moral issues was heart breaking - he cried - I cried. I congratulate Brett Ratner for adding the extra emotions into the film it took it to a higher level - these people were not mutants or misfits without feelings - they did love, they hurt and in cases they killed and ultimately were good or evil.Prior to the great war at the end of the film when Wolverine discovered the phials of the cure - well we all knew or thought we knew - yup Wolverine is going to get Magneto. What a wonderful ruse when he slide along the ground up to Magneto preparing to kill him, but Magneto was ready for him, how smug he was he had got Wolverine just where he wanted him. But no the fatal blow came from the back - gotcha.....hooray..From there on Wolverine took charge of the fantastic battle and the war was raged and finally won.Someone had to take the cure we knew well and it seemed fitting that Rogue would do this. Angel wanted to change his mind but his father was not in agreement so Angel broke free and flew away and it was spectacular - but what a treat when he came back and saved his father's life.I enjoyed every moment of this film and congratulate Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Famke Jansenn for keeping the pace and emotions running high.I was not keen on Juggernaut but loved the stunt that Kitty Pryde pulled on him when she was in the special Lab - I fell about laughing. Halle Berry is a very beautiful lady and she got more to do in the film which was what she wanted. Her actions scenes were not bad but her voice did not take command of the situation - and particularly with Hugh Jackman and his excellent delivery it showed up more.BUT will there be X-Men Four - is Professor Xavier dead, is Cyclops dead, and is it just possible that the slight movement of Magneto's hand at the end telling us ' I'm here old friend' I had just come out of hospital with three broken bones in my foot and a broken hip - but this film I was not going to miss - and I much watch it again to see what I must have missed in the excitement",X-Men - The Last Stand

Brett Ratner completely ruined a trilogy that had started off so perfect. He decided to leave out the best characters like Nightcrawler ruin great characters like Beast and kill main characters like Professor X and Cyclops. I don't even know what he was thinking when he was making this movie it was like he wanted us to hate it.

797,topdogwoof69,Outstanding In Every Way,10,11 June 2006,"Number ONE of the three best Movies of 2006 so far. I can't sit through a movie as though it is ""mindless entertainment"", being a writer and an artist I unwillingly break the movies apart. Judging them by these things: 1. If the Director was able to capture the heart of the film, while over coming predestined obstacles. 2. If the Graphics were wisely chosen. 3. If the movie used its own ideas or stole from others. And finally, 4. If the actors, cinematographers, and producers were able to flow with the directors vision. OH YEAH and I didn't have to be on drugs to see it!That being said, ""X-Men The Last Stand"" was a great depiction of the source material. This movie did so well (for me) because of the casualties of war. This movie had casualties lost in their fight for their own individual causes. (HERE COME THE SPOILERS)... First off is: WOLVERINE: After establishing his back story with the first two films, Last Stand wonderfully utilizes his skills and his ties to all the characters. He takes time for Rogue, fills in for Cyclops, challenges Xavier, bonds with the Phoenix and rallies the X-Men during their darkest hour. Like I said, wonderful use of Logan. MAGNETO: The other main catalyst of the film. His ambitions, charisma and his power make him the perfect antagonist for the near perfect sci-fi adventure. JEAN GREY: Nuff Said! Don't argue that she was not a casualty, even if she comes back- she still lost herself and was the pure essence of power. The perfect example of power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely. Her psychotic breaks were wonderfully portrayed by Famke. BEAST: A great new voice with a great new look. Kelsey was perfect PROFESSOR XAVIER: One of the most important roles in the movie because we finally see shades of gray from Xavier (or shades of GREY if you will). The allusion to Professor X not being able to help Jean like he was unable to help Jason from X2. The frustration Xavier feels as he explains to Logan why he had to place barriers in Jean's mind is palpable. Also, the reaction of the children during his memorial is the most moving and emotional moment in any of the three films.Anyways, for the task of making a great sequel... that offered more then the first and was able to expand on the second- it met all requirements with FLYING COLORS! The pace was better, the effects were better, the writing was at least as good, the additional characters were nicely patched in, Wolverine kicked backside, and over all this is the best film of the SUMMER '06!!!!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
798,sa_online,Surprisingly good and may be better than X-M 2,7,25 May 2006,"After I heard Brian singer was opting out of the movie all my hopes were gone. My friends dragged me to the plex and then too I insisted on watching MI 3. The movie begins at a rocket pace and continues at the same pace for the 1st hour. The 2nd hour is where all the emotions are placed. It brings out the characters in the movie especially of gene and wolverines & their relationship is also portrayed nicely. All the actors did a fine job especially Hugh Jackman. The special affects are better compared to the last one. The comedy is also timed nicely. Overall, the movie is good and very good in what it is intented to give, entertainment. It taught me one thing too, never judge a movie before seeing it (especially just by looking at the directors name). I hope the next one is also directed by Brett Ratner.",X-Men - The Last Stand
799,DoctorScarlettJones,Was This Supposed To Be A Comedy?,8,10 June 2006,"I did actually like this film but I couldn't help but laugh throughout the last forty minutes. There were so many bad clichés and cheesy lines and some just outright silliness that I couldn't help myself.First of all, Kelsey Grammar, though I do love the man, was so bizarre as the Beast (is he a monkey, a lion, a bear, what is he?) and with so little explanation about him I just wanted to laugh at him.Secondly, there was no groundwork for the fact that Jean Grey has a dual personality. We saw Xavier and Magneto go to her house but there was no indication that she was suffering. Her parents looked long suffering but she seemed fine. So I had no clue about the whole dual personality thing and it came as surprise, and one that made me laugh. It just wasn't handled well enough.Thirdly, the mutant with the wings. Okay, he just looked like a giant seagull to me. It was so poorly done and I expect better from a film that spends millions on FX. Come on guys, you can do better and should, or you are just ripping the public off.Fourth, too many new characters with little or no explanation on who or what they are.And yet, despite all these problems, I loved this film. I especially like the bit at the end after the credits.Xavier lives people and I for one am very glad.

800,pinkxsunlight,Nice attempt.. but no,6,13 December 2006,"I was ready and waiting to see how ""amazing"" X3 was supposed to be. If only they had kept Bryan Singer on board. While it was a nice attempt by Brett Ratner I don't think he has the experience or creative imagination to direct X3 or any X-Men movie for that matter. For me there was just nothing there, the movie didn't surprise me or live up to it's expectations. If you read Bryan Singer's ideas that he had planned for X3 you would probably have been like me, excited, anxious and pumped.Where were half of the characters? Rogue being one of the main characters in the first two X-men movies just disappeared completely! Jean Grey/Phoenix was practically a mime the entire movie. I ached for the scenes where we could actually see some emotion in both Jean and the Phoenix. And what was up with Cyclops? Was Fox angry because he was in Superman and decided to kill him off within the first 10 minutes of X3? Halle Berry only agreed to come back on board if she got more money, more screen time and more 'character development' (which I saw none of). Storm was just annoying and seemed to be shoved in every scene available. There are more characters I could comment on but that would take a long time.If there is an X4 I will be ready to erase X3 from my mind and hopefully the terrible directing of Brett Ratner. All I have to say is BRING BRYAN SINGER BACK!",X-Men - The Last Stand
801,peevedoff2,"Characters, Effects, and Story were all beyond outstanding.",10,23 May 2006,"The third X-Men film is more sophisticated and has a better story than the first one, and better action then the second. Here, the characters previously introduced but under used are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. The music is very good as is the acting. The cast-selection is still perfect.Last Stand continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. It is a work of art/comic book pulp fiction never before seen on the silver screen. The . Everything in this movie is exceedingly better in the sequel then the first two films. Like X2, the acting is superb. The dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. What's better then its predecessor is X3's action, FX and pace. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that's been absent from far too many of today's alleged blockbusters.I can't imagine a better movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
802,daloodog,Downright terrible,2,25 May 2006,"Regardless of how insanely this film deviated from comic book story lines, the absolute triteness of this film will upset anyone who claims to own one ounce of film integrity.The opening of the film, in which a young Angel is attempting to cut off his own wings, is a very bloody, intensely dark scene that gives one the notion that X3 will be one of, if not the, darkest comic films ever. That is the high point.The plot is obviously haphazardly thrown together. There are at least four points in the film in which anyone who has watched more than ten movies in his/her lifetime can word-for-word predict the following lines. This film is a cliché encyclopedia. The score is trite and awful. As is the dialogue - even so much as to use gratuitous profanity in one of the closing scenes.To think that the finale of an extremely successful series runs under two hours goes to show exactly how much of a lack of storyline was able to be created for this film.If you enjoyed the first two in the series, think Matrix, and avoid watching this film as to not poison your notion of the first two.",X-Men - The Last Stand
803,audacious4u,Hold The Brakes,7,4 June 2006,"Seems I should've stayed until the end of the credits for a final film teaser. Hate I missed that. Okay people... true, there could've been more film development, true the film moved fast. But I enjoyed the movie and am a big fan of the comics and the ""original"" X-men animated series. Being that as it may, I also understand that when movies are made in Hollywood, we can't realistically expect them to stay true to form. Once the simulation was over, I knew what the Danger Room was and what it was for and for those who weren't familiar, they could figure that it was a training simulation room. I was saddened a bit in the film, even shed a tear at a point. But let's all hold the brakes here. Brett Ratner can not carry the entire burden for this film not being as good as the other 2. Was the movie bad... no, I enjoyed it and it was action packed. Could a lot more have been done with character development, yes, sure. Could some of those extra characters have been left out, sure but it was nice to have some more bad guys on the scene. But let's remember, in the 1st installment, Sabretooth wasn't really ""developed"". He just showed up in the snow and attacked Wolverine. If you weren't familiar with the X-Men series, you had no real clue what that beef was about. All in all, Brett Ratner came unto this film 8 weeks, 8 weeks before it was scheduled to begin shooting. No wonder the film seems rushed, he didn't have a lot of time to do much of anything but shoot the damn movie. The beloved Bryan Singer dumped this film, therefore dumping the X-men fans to go do Superman Returns. Come on... he had already started working on this film then left it (taking the writers with him) in the dust for Superman. He wanted to put it on the backburner to return to at a later date after he finished Superman. Well I say, quit giving him all this praise... if he cared so much about the X-Men franchise that he developed, why couldn't Superman wait until he finished up this film. So the studio did what it had to... you have the actors, crew, and everyone ready & waiting to begin filming and the director ups & leaves in the middle of it. That's costing the studio more money on time & production. So they tried to salvage it and Brett Ratner came in to do the best he could with only 8 weeks time to work with before shooting begin. So if you want to blame someone, blame Fox for not waiting on Bryan to return... or better yet, point the finger at Bryan Singer who left the film at the last minute and in doing so, let the X-men fans down. Do you think Sam Raimi would leave Spiderman 3, his baby, to go do another film? Bryan Singer obviously didn't care about the film that much so what are you all whining about. All in all, I think Brett Ratner did a pretty decent job for what little time he had to work with so give the guy a brake. I enjoyed the film and though saddened by characters departure... it was a good ending, besides, there are going to be spin-offs, for Magneto & Wolverine.",X-Men - The Last Stand
804,rhearob,More Correctly Titled: X-Men:The Ruin That Ratner Made,5,26 May 2006,"After seeing this farce of an X-Men movie one can only hope that there is a second version that is more competently made. I also understand why studio executives had to trumpet the comments of a studio cafeteria waitress in Entertainment Weekly to extol its virtues. I only hope the poor girl gets to keep her job.The special effects in the movie are impressive as are the fight scenes. Technically the movie is well made. That is unfortunately the best praise that it can be given. The movie lacks any of Bryan Singers subtlety or artistry.The characters are mere shadows of themselves in the first two movies. Storm, who we see becoming fiercely devoted to Mutant Rights in X2 is merely cranky in this movie. This Storm in a X-Man on the rag. Magneto is saved from caricature only by the sheer talent of Sir Ian McKellan. It seems that is his role in film this summer.As for the key emotional points in the film, they are given almost no attention. The deaths of Scott Summers, Professor Xavier, and Jean Grey (again) are almost only incidental to the film. The emotional an mental struggles that the Dark Phoenix character are going through are not explored at all outside of a cliché ""Kill Me to Save Me"" plea. The ethical struggles of Professor Xavier as he strains to contain Phoenix are completely unexplored except for a tame outburst at Wolverine.As for the new characters, the Archangel character has less screen time than James Marsden's crotch. Ben Foster is nothing more than an Abercrombie-esquire marketing campaign. The same is true of Colossus, Iceman, Pyro, and Rogue - except we do see more of them than Cyclops' inseam. I will give Kelsey Grammar credit for doing an excellent job of breathing life into Beast. As with Magneto it couldn't have happened without an extremely talented character actor.I saw the movie once and will wait until HBO to watch it again. I know the temptation to run out and see it is huge, If i could give one word of advice it would be WAIT. There is no reason to suffer through Holiday crowds for this waste of a great franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
805,Zoldello,Money's worth,8,26 May 2006,"**CONTAINS SPOILERS *** **CONTAINS SPOILERS *** **CONTAINS SPOILERS ***After seeing this movie, this is one of those times where I feel that I got my money's worth from a movie. The movie had a few faults. Like:1. If Jean was not dead from X2 how come the professor could not sense her? 2. A cure cannot work that fast as it did 3. I do not understand why Jean wouldn't destroy Logan since she is so powerful. She has other weapons and mind control 4. The director did not clearly define the ""Levels"" 5. In the bridge scene, day turn to night faster then possibleand a few other points. Still I feel satisfied from what I got from the movie; cool special effects, good story, good acting, Halle Berry! Do others feel this way?",X-Men - The Last Stand
806,arsenaltom,An excellent superhero film.,8,26 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand is most probably the last X-Men movie, at least in this series. If it truly is it sure goes out with a bang! The plot of this film is that a cure has been discovered for mutants which would make them lose the power. When mutant rights secretary Beast (Kelsey Grammar) breaks the news to Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the other X-Men, they are not too pleased. However, like always, the y believe in cooperation with the humans.Their problems get worse when ex teammate Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) is found alive at Alkali Lake by Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). She's reawoken as the Dark Phoenix and lets just say shes evil, very evil.Anyway back to the cure, of course Magneto (Ian McKellen) still hates the humans and believes this to be the perfect opportunity for war. Still with henchmen Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford)he is also joined by many new faces to build his army. Most notably are Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and the resurrected Jean Grey.Now that's all I'll tell you about the story to avoid spoilers, now on to how this movie fares.The acting, as always in these films, is excellent, and the new characters are perfectly cast. Vinnie Jones is excellent and fits Juggernaut perfectly and Kelsey Grammar is Beast-he just is! Perfect match! Ben Foster fares well as Angel and is well cast but nothing special and then you've got plenty of new small villains like Callisto and Psylocke. Ellen Page is a nice addition as well as the 'walk through walls' Kitty Pride.Obviously stars from the original 2 like Hugh Jackman are still there and are magnificent as ever. Jackman is fantastic as Wolverine and gives an amazing performance. Halle Berry is much more impressive this time round as is Famke Janssen. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are brilliant as Magneto and Xavier respectively.The special effects in this are mind blowing! An excellent achievement and the bridge sequence just took my breath away. Stunning.This film is an improvement in many ways, especially in story terms. It's also not as centered on Wolverine in particular as the previous 2, especially X2.However it's a shame that the film feels a bit empty. The effects (while brilliant) overshadow a number of what otherwise are good performances, most notably Famke Janssens. Some of the new characters are not needed and there is no where near enough time to develop them all. The only new one you get to know enough is Beast.Overall though this is an excellent superhero movie and well worth your time. Brett Ratner sir, this is your best work yet, STAY AWAY FROM CRAP IDEAS AND STICK TO FILMS LIKE THIS!",X-Men - The Last Stand
807,wswj519,Extremely Disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!,6,26 May 2006,"I was so excited to see this movie for weeks and I was completely disappointed. The action was good and the story line but the fate of the characters was horrible. I can't understand why they would kill off three of the major characters and have three of the major characters lose their powers. I loved these movies and this ruined it for me. I would never see it again and I probably won't buy the DVD. I hope that this is the last movie because without Jean, Cyclops, Professor X, Magneto, Rouge and Mystique...what's the point? They were the best characters! All hardcore X-Men will be outraged to say the least. I was!",X-Men - The Last Stand
808,Nine-Seven,Blew me away....,9,13 June 2006,"Wow, just wow. I saw the movie a few days ago and it was amazing. You have to see it- it's not a movie for everyone but i would definitely recommend it. As you probably know the basic story line is that a 'cure' for the mutant X gene has been found. Some of the mutants feel offended by it but others like Rogue want it more than anything. I was especially happy that this film included Beast and Angel (Whose wings looked very realistic). I could find one fault though- the director should have included more back story for some of the characters, especially angel who was hardly mentioned in the film. The special effects are very good and quite realistic. Jean also makes an appearance with her evil alter-ego Phoenix. This is a must see film especially if you've seen the other x-men films. It's not too deep but a very good film. P.S stay behind after the credits to see an extra scene.",X-Men - The Last Stand
809,TigerLordII,It's not as good as its predecessor but still lives up to expectations,7,25 May 2006,"As the ending of the second movie indicated, the third movie sees the adaptation of the Phoenix Saga, probably one of the most if not the most popular X-Men saga. Jean Grey is revived as the Phoenix, a powerful entity whose power are limitless. Well OK, the plot is good, and is truthfully directly taken from the comics, which might appeal to the comic fans. No doubt here also, X3 is very heavy in CGI. Special effects all over the place for the entire lenght of the movie, be it for good or for worse. No doubt there, X3 is an awesome action flick.I feared a weak adaptation of the Phoenix Saga, but it was very well done. Ratner has a very different style than Singer. Although Singer had a better style at develop his character, he didn't catch the essence on the same levels as Ratner. Beast is extremely well portrayed and had just about enough screen time to understand his character. Famke Janssen's portrayal of the Phoenix is also very solid. The movie let us understand how powerful she is, which is essentially what the Phoenix saga was all about: she is the goddess of all mutants and her powers are extreme.Unfortunately, although Ratner might understand the characters better, his technique isn't. The development of the characters is not satisfying enough. It goes too quickly and too abruptly. Another issue is that because X3 got a new scripwriter as well, he edited characters that were previously main characters that became secondary in the new movie, like Mystique and Cyclops.Another strong point was the introduction of a many new mutants, but over the course of the very short movie (90 minutes) it becomes a weakness: how are the characters suppose to get enough time to develop if there are so many? Although I mentioned a lot of things that does not work, X-Men: The Last stand isn't a bad movie. The first two were no doubt better, Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman fans will also be pleased because they get a lot of time on the screen. All-in-all although this third installment in the trilogy is the weakest of all three, it's still very entertaining and there's no doubt any fans of the previous movies as well as the comics will enjoy this one.",X-Men - The Last Stand
810,dhood-4,Xtremely good,7,24 May 2006,"The moment this film went into production everybody was saying how rubbish it was going to be. Mainly because Bryan Singer wasn't doing it and Brett Ratner was. I was one of those people. Having now seen X3 I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Although I would have preferred to have seen a Singer directed X3. I think Brett Ratner did a good job. Although there were some minor annoyances. Such as Angel having absolutely nothing to do, occasional stodgy dialogue, and a rather rushed plot. But the positives far out weighed the negatives. Especially Vinnie Jones as the Juggernaut, the confrontation between Professor X and Jean Grey and generally any scene with Wolverine. I hope this does well at the box office. As I look forward to more Xmen related films.",X-Men - The Last Stand
811,wenda_akil,Not bad but not excellent,7,9 December 2006,The only reason I watched this film is because I watched the first two. I'm not a Marvel superhero lover but I can understand that this film is rather disappointing for X-men fans. How Mystique became a normal human being and how Scott and Charles Xavier died in the hands of Jean(Pheonix) and that in the end Jean died in the hands of Wolverine. Magneto also lost his powers of a mutant that made him look not bad and not powerful anymore was kind of weird. Maybe the filmmakers wanted to make it mesmerizing and emotional and stuff but it makes x-men not like the real x-men we know. Besides that the fighting and the special effects are cool so it still makes the film worth watching. Not bad but not excellent.,X-Men - The Last Stand
812,BloodOps,"Good movie but wanted more, another X-men?",7,27 May 2006,"Just came back from seeing it and it was pretty good. Halle Berry did a better job as Storm in this movie than the first 2, thank god. Patrick Stewart had a solid performance but the acting stars were easily Famke Janssen, Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman. Famke was terrific and played her role perfectly, some of her face expressions were brilliant. Ian like the first 2 was great but in this film he surely did better. Hugh Jackman was the best IMHO, he was everything Wolverine was and the lines he did was Famke was very good. Kelsey Grammar was very good as Hank Mccoy/Beast, he fit his personality very well, Juggernaut was alright and Colossus had a bigger role than the last one but only had a few lines.The last battle was very well made with and the stand off between 6 X-men and the army of Magneto was well done. The bridge scene with Magneto was incredible. The Pyro vs Iceman fight could of been much better but it was decent. I was pretty made though because they did so little with Mystique and Cyclops and was mad with what they did with Cyclops.Overall it was pretty good but not better than the Original one but better than the second one.(I was not that big of a fan of the second one) If your a fan of X-men you gotta see this movie, but it leaves you wanting more and we probably will get it to because of the final scene of the movie.Overall: 8.4/10 **ATTENTION** Stay for after the credits role because its another reason there will probably be an X-men 4. WOOT!",X-Men - The Last Stand
813,kkdkutler,"saw the premier, i'll tell you little things, nothing about the story",8,24 May 2006,"this was definitely an action packed film I'm not going to spoil the film for you like my brother got me to do for him, but I will tell you straight up it is worth waiting in that line Friday night going to see this! I think that I am not overrating it at all if you realize that it is a superhero film and maybe it should not be the greatest film of all time but I mean believe the hype its good. tons of things happen in the movie and they cover these characters pretty well. The thing that bothered me was the ending, I liked it but it left it open for another one to go on, and if you haven't looked they are supposed to be making a prequel on just wolverine, so that should be exciting as long as they tell the story of agent X when he was a savage killer if its not then oh well. This film though was something that I think will probably make the most money out of the super hero movies so far. now another thing, I will ruin a few things but not tell the story. Does any realize how lame storm was in the first two? Well she redeemed herself in this one by leaps and bounds. Another thing, don't you wish you could see Wolverine, just go all out and kick some butt? he does in here. The angel don't expect much from him, and I see him more of an intro in this film, No people Gambit was not in this one, but I do not ever recall if they even showed even a glimpse of him or his name. Another thing nightcrawler is not a main in this, people I know Its sad but it had to happen, actually no wait no it didn't, if you have anymore questions you will all just have to wait about two days thats not that hard. but like I always say to people is it good? yes it was better than the first two put together, so believe the hype!",X-Men - The Last Stand

815,_Coon,Don't let the fanboy whiners scare you away...,10,8 November 2006,"**SPOILERS ABOUND**Geez, comic fanboys must by the most cynical, joyless people to don the hat of movie reviewer in all of history. I consider myself a fan of the comics, as I read regularly and collected for a time in the 80s and 90s and was quite surprised that I liked Bryan Singer's first X-Men film. I'll say liked, not loved, but I thought it was certainly worthy of the franchise and entertaining. The second was much better, primarily because the filmmakers had more money, and it shows. Nightcrawler was a great addition, but he never really did much after the assassination attempt at the White House. While this film built up to the conclusion much better than the first, it was the whole Jean Grey plot that really gave it impact. He sacrifice at the end of X2 was arguably the best emotional, powerful, surprising scene in the series.It's that ending that lends X-Men: The Last Stand it's strongest tool in terms of connection to the previous two films. Personally, I hadn't realized how invested I had become in the Grey character until she disappeared into the wall of water in X2. In this third installment, she's back from the dead thanks to her bipolar second-half, Phoenix. The point here is that throughout almost the entire film, Janssen is playing Grey/Phoenix in a spaced-out, confused kind of way, which is utterly perfect. The Grey character we've come to know and love appears only once or twice, and always briefly (""Where am I?"" ""Please kill me before I kill somebody else.""). These glimpses at the old Grey made me long for her to fight her way back and suppress the Phoenix.And here's where Ratner deserves some serious credit. She doesn't! The characters (Grey/Phoenix) are gutted at an emotional climax in what was really a heavy, surprisingly-sad scene. And it doesn't stop there. The writers killed off Xavier and Cyclops. Props for having the guts to shake things up. If the printed comic book world wouldn't kill off and suddenly resurrect characters every time they need a plot point, it would have the same kind of impact these deaths have here.The battle between Phoenix and Xavier is incredible. I was watching it on DVD and my heart was actually racing. And what's with the slamming of the score by reviewers here? I thought it was perfectly epic, which it needed to be, given the scope of what was going on. Especially in this scene. Oh, it's hard to forget Magneto's ""Charles!"" right before Xavier is obliterated. Jannsen's detachment from the scene after all she's just done is creepy, moving and sad at the same time.That being said, the film's not perfect. I do think Colossus deserved more screen time and it would have been better without the Juggernaut character altogether. The character is just served so much better on the printed page, along with the X-Men spandex costumes. The makeup used on Janssen for Phoenix was unnecessary, as I think she could have played cold and possessed without it. But she still sells it, and that's what counts. Look at the way she rises to her feet in front of Xavier before she takes him out. Chilling.Singer did a great job by the time he got around to X2, and he built the franchise. It's not Ratner's fault he bolted for more money and an inferior superhero, leaving those of us that had climbed on board feeling abandoned. Ratner, contrary to what some people who have no idea what they're talking about, did infuse a huge amount of emotion into this flick. Well, never mind. Ratner did an admirable job, as did the writers and the rest of the crew. I personally hope this is the last X-Men movie, as it's a perfectly respectable note to go out on. It probably made too much money for that be the case, though.Anyway, ignore the hate-filled rants on this comments board and try to look at the more moderate reviews. It's nowhere near as bad as the worst reviews here. In fact it's highly entertaining and often moving. To be enjoyed with popcorn.7.5 out of 10 from me.",X-Men - The Last Stand
816,Mastadge,X-Men: The Last Straw,1,27 May 2006,"This movie was, to put it bluntly, awful. I knew going in that Ratner was a poor director, and my expectations were accordingly low, but I generally enjoy comic book adaptations, even the mediocre ones, so I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Too bad. The movie was worse than I had feared. It's a boring, silly movie, with any hint of the style and humanity with which Singer had imbued the series gone. Scenes that should have been powerful and affecting in the hands of a director with even the least bit of class and a modicum of talent are instead laughable -- literally. The audience was laughing in what should have been key dramatic moments. In this movie, there doesn't seem to be a reason for anything: Things happen for no reason. Characters do things for no reason -- or, worse, for no reason other than to set up some kewl special effect that's generally boring given its ridiculous context. Characters -- some of them important -- are discarded with no exploration of the consequences; other characters are added, mostly for no reason other than to throw them on the screen for a few moments. The ""bad guys"" in this film are the ones who are fighting the right fight this time around, albeit in a thoroughly stupid manner; the ""good guys"" act at best like morons and make decisions that make me question why I'm supposed to be rooting for their team. Dark Willow steps out of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and into the X-Men universe without the benefit of Whedon's punchy dialogue and humanity -- the dialogue here is so cliché-ridden that the people around me, who had not seen the movie before, were delivering lines before the movie characters and getting them word-perfect. There's no character development in this movie (though there are, to be fair, several amusing moments, mostly involving Wolverine) -- just a lot of 'splosions and effects. But as George Lucas once said and seems to have forgotten, ""a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing."" Sure, on a basic level lots of water floating around and explosions and bad weather and things disintegrating look fairly cool, but without any reason to care, what's the point? Even the fight scenes were mostly unsatisfactory, with characters zipping around and the camera snapping from angle to angle and character to character so frantically, so gracelessly, that it's nigh impossible to take any pleasure from watching it. This movie is an awful mess and an astounding disappointment, even given my low expectations. It's terrible from first to last. As far as sequels go, this one's down there with Highlander 2. To be avoided.",X-Men - The Last Stand
817,wpeeters,Don't believe the negative critics,10,24 May 2006,"Man, was I afraid, after reading a load of negative reviews, when I went to see X-Men 3 today (24th May, premiere day in Belgium). But I was needlessly worried...I never thought Brett Rattner could pull off the high stakes that were set before him by Bryan Singer, but he actually managed to do so. Although the movie is too short to have each of the characters worked out in full, it's the cast as an ensemble that delivers the goods. X-Men 3 contains at least five memorable scenes that stay true the the earlier established character development, and add great momentum to some crucial scenes. Rattner definitely wanted to end the trilogy with a bang: the adagium that the heroes are invincible and the baddies are, in the worst case, a bit scratched after an encounter with the heroes, but nevertheless ready for another round in some possible next sequel, is simply not true here. Apart from this, several new characters or characters that only appeared as a brief cameo in the previous installments (Colossus and Shadowcat) are introduced, among which Beast, played by Kelsey Grammar, is the most charismatic advocate for mutant rights, while the only disappointment in the movie is the spineless performance of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut. While Wolverine has settled in his new existence after the second installment of the movie, and now has developed in just another agent for professor X's secret army of X-Men, he seems for the first time contented in his new role. Magneto, on the other hand, still shows an almost racially inspired disdain for his fellow human who is not blessed with mutant powers, even when one of his closest friends is cured accidentally, his behaviour against his former co-worker is simply despicable.SPOILERS AHEAD Of course, the comic book aficionados, who earlier on applauded when Bryan Singer gave an explanation for the white hair strand in Rogue's do, will be annoyed a bit by the developments in the movie, which quite differs from the comics. Particularly Jean Grey succumbing to the dark side of her personality, Mystique being a premature victim to the mutant cure, Rogues personal wish to be liberated from her powers that prevent any physical contact (which drives her nuts) are highly apocryphal, but I think the X-Men movie franchise has reached a point where it can be regarded as ""grown up"" as an independent entity.There's, however, more spectacle to this movie. Wolverine's run-in with Juggernaut. The matured Storm who has obviously reached the peak of her abilities. The Danger Room simulator. And of course, Magneto's vicious attack on the facility where the ""cure"" is being guarded. SPOILERS ENDTo conclude: absolutely do stay until after the credits of the film, as a little surprise plot twist will have you knocked backed to your cinema seat. It has something to do with the ethical dilemma professor X taught his children earlier on in the film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
818,Skippy rocks,A Great Film!,7,25 May 2006,"X3 is a thoroughly enjoyable, great film.It is far more graphic and violent than the previous two, but there is still a great depth in the characters and their struggles. There is more of a focus on the action, but when you consider the political, personal and social implications of the events shown here, the humanity of this film still stands firm. As Ralph Winter said in an interview recently, comic book films have an ability to really 'stick' with us when they're done well- when we can really relate to them. I am sure that this is one that will stick with us too.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The movie was very greatly done, and very emotional. It was a little boring and stretched on at first but started to pick up.Jean Grey/Phenoix was done just so well, her lines seemed so real. And everything was done perfectly with her character. The newer characters however got a lack of screen time but it worked in the end, you really see the characters change.Now if you one of those people who shred apart movies thats the only way I can see someone saying its bad. If they are going to bash it because a lot of people like it, because its a sequel, or because there die hard comic fans (those are justifed though the comic fans) but you got to ask yourself in the end did you enjoy it for all movies....If your not out to bash, this movie is great.

OK that's about it,the thing i didn't like about the movie are: Mis-Tiqe turn normal and betray Magneto? Cyclops,Phoenix and Prefessor X died? Most of the Mutants lost power,or died so easy and quick... Toad and Sabreto didn't show up,same as Night Claws... 6 X-Men > more than 100 Brotherhood?

Magneto became a normal old man?(actually I felt very sad about him,once a one of the most powerful mutant and the leader of Brotherhood...) Do you think that's so pity that the movie series ends,with lots lots lots more characters didn't have the chance to show up?I know I did't know X-Men very well,and this is my first summary so please rate it or reply it(can u reply this?) the movie is OK,but worse than the first 2 movies...",X-Men - The Last Stand
824,cooper14,X-3 Good But A Disappointment,8,26 May 2006,"I am a huge X-Men fan from the Comics. The first X-Men Movie was a very impressive attempt at turning it to a Film and was a great Movie as was the sequel 'X2'. But when I was reading things on the Internet and Magazines etc. The hype was building for 'Last Stand' to be the best in the series, when Dr. Hank McCoy (Beast, played brilliant by Kelsey Grammar) was confirmed and when Warren Worthington III (Angel, once again played superb by Ben Foster) was confirmed then you'd expect this to be a great installment in the X-Men series, but I got the chance to seeing it yesterday and if you all want my honest opinion, it's the worst in the series. I was disappointed when I discovered Gambit wasn't going to be apart of it, and although Ian McKellen, Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman (Magneto, Storm and Wolverine) played the roles once again of the X-Men characters so perfect, and were brilliant at doing the job. The action in the Movie was brilliant as were the Effects, but there was Disappointments, I have to agree with past comments posted there were casulties which were shocking, and once again I agree with some past comments posted, Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and Angel's roles were not used well enough, but in my opinion, I'm English myself and Vinnie Jones in his day was a great Soccer/Football player and has shown he's a brilliant Actor but I think he shouldn't have took on the role as Juggernaut they should've used someone that's big by nature (i.e. WWE's Paul Wight 'Big Show) but nevermind Vinnie Jones did well for the part, but once again a Disappointment in many ways and a Good film in others.",X-Men - The Last Stand
825,mythikle,xmen franchise left in ruins. thanks bret ratner!,1,26 May 2006,"ill make this brief, i loved the first xmen ,x2 was a joy ,x3 is unfortunately the biggest turkey this year! From ludicrous characterizations ,bad script ,no real plot to think of ,and don't get me started on the ending. this movie is very incoherent ,its as if this ratner guy never even heard of the xmen let alone seen the first 2 movies. vinnie jones's juggernaut is laughable ,he looks stupid like he has a tin foil nipple on his head ,and beast just looks down right comical. the effects are so so ,and the fact that you probably wont recognize the new characters (i think ratner just made some up) wont help win you over. i actually wanted to leave the cinema at 1 point. During what i presume was to be the films highlight on the golden gate bridge ,magneto uses his power to bend the bridge so his mutant army can attack the Alcatraz facility. this scene is one of the most pathetic demonstrations of special effects I've seen in a while. the effect itself is not so bad but the premise is cringe worthy.overall its safe to say there will be no more xmen after this monstrosity ,even if ratner has left it open for more . you might notice i haven't mentioned phoenix ,thats because shes barely in the film ,and has no real impact on the movie ,the plot skips around her she kills cyclops ,xavier , a couple of nobodies and thats pretty much it. sorry x fans this ones not for you!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
826,netean,"empty, lifeless and just so so disappointing",2,30 May 2006,"I'm not a comic book fan, and have only a basic understanding of the x-men mythology and universe. But, I was so disappointed by this film I really enjoyed the first two, with X2 being, in my opinion slightly better than the first - an unusual occurrence for a sequel! I'd heard bad reviews, so I wasn't expecting much but was prepared, and hoping to be surprised. I was, but only in that reviews were too kind.The film felt empty, it's basically a wolverine film (again), but now with Storm as a sidekick. But that's it. All the characters that should have been here were missing or killed: Xavier - who they'd turned from the ""father figure"" he should be into a manipulating fool and then they kill him... Hello, I don't know much, but I know that Xavier is THE linchpin of the whole x-men genre. It's primarily his battle with his friend and nemesis Magneto that makes the stories so compelling.Cyclops, poor Scott Marsden, not only getting another minor role in the X-men franchise, but virtually less than a cameo before he's killed(badly) Mystique: just no, one of the very few characters that you want to see more of and she's gone.Rogue. again, underused, under developed and removed.Beast/ Hank McCoy (never referred to as beast) - well played by Kelsey Grammar, but just again, under developed and under-used.jean Grey... Just under-developed (why was she doing the things she did and why did she die!) The x-men are supposed to be team, but in this film they're anything but.Angel, Colossus, Juggernaut etc... you saw them, you just didn't to actually meet any of them! Terrible ending too Basic story premise, is superb. again, under-developed.After 3 films we should have known much more about these characters, their background and they should be richer, enabling us to identify more with them, instead we know nothing more about any of them than we did before.Just terrible, truly awful and so so very disappointing to have such a wealth of acting talent there on screen, some there so briefly, others there a lot just made to say that terrible dialogue and act in such a rubbish movie.I left the film being upset and angry they'd killed off all the major characters but never once being moved by the action on screen. No tension, no passion, no charm, no humour, no wit, No life. nothing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
827,KarlBishop-1,Horrifyingly bad,1,1 June 2006,"I feel so cheated. Brett Ratner should be blacklisted for completely ruining what had so far been a fantastic series.I think many people have already said this but what most annoyed me was the total lack of character development. I was very disheartened when I saw in a trailer that Vinnie Jones would be playing the Juggernaut. That gave me my first suspicion that this movie would be truly awful. He is not a great actor and his accent is completely out of place in anything American. These initial feelings however did not prepare me properly for the travesty that was made of his role. The Juggernaut is depicted simply as a big bloke who runs through walls. The key aspects of his character - his connection to Charles Xavier and his power derived from a magic gem - are completely ignored. He joins Magneto's brotherhood for pretty much no reason and we are given only about two lines to explain who he is. Also the fact that he is not actually a mutant is scrapped to make way for a painfully predictable and anti-climactic defeat.Other tragic cock-ups include the pointless inclusion of Angel who is only in the film for about two minutes. We find out nothing about him apart from that his dad is a politically involved man who believes mutants are a disease to be ""cured"". The only words to come out of Angel's mouth are hideous clichés.And WHAT were the writers thinking when they decided to kill off Cyclops, Professor X and Jean Grey and render Mystique, Magneto and Rogue powerless?!? These were clearly devices designed to increase the excitement and emotional content but since the story lacked everything apart from bad dialogue and ill-conceived sequences of events I was left feeling wholly unfulfilled and with a strong desire for homicide. If I was allowed to swear here I would.I can't write any more - to include all the details of how this film ruined the X-Men series; how it angers and saddens me that great stories are forever ruined by money-grabbing, talentless film makers; and how the sum total of the worth of the entire human race has been deeply discredited and shamed would take far more time than I have to spare.I'll leave by saying that actually Kelsey Grammar was very good as Beast and I really quite enjoyed all of his scenes. Cheers :)",X-Men - The Last Stand
828,nick-1458,"X-men 3, the best movie of 2006",10,6 June 2006,"I saw X-men 3 on Saturday and I was impressed. The actors produced good acting and the action sequences were superb! The director could have done without killing off some characters, never the less Brett Ratner did not disappoint with his new approach in the third instalment of x-men. The title suggests that this film is the final film however, I don't think we have seen the last of the X-men films. The only complaint Ihave is that the film is not long enough. We wanted to see more ass kicking. The film could have hadlonger action sequences and less dialogue. Some parts also try to deliver humour but fail, I won't mention any names, Juggernaught.Do not listen to the critics who slated the movie just because it wasn't accurate to the comics its a movie worth seeing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
829,kmm1128,"Way too short, but not terrible",6,11 June 2006,"I'm not going to say that this was a bad movie because I don't think it was. It's not nearly as good as the first two, but then very few third installments are. I think the main problem with this movie is lack of character development. The movie is way too short and devotes little time for character development. The story seems to focus mainly on Jean Grey and Wolverine. All other characters act as secondaries with some humorous one-liners and such, but I still see that as a problem. In the first two movies, every character personality was given time to develop, which is how we fell in love with Storm, Rogue, Cyclops, Professor Xavier, and even Magneto and Mystique. Everyone was made an equal part of the team regardless of whose side they were on. The new characters we are introduced to are very hollow. I'm disappointed that I had to look up Callisto's mutant name on-line since she was one of the few characters that was actually given dialogue. Also, for those of you who say that Juggernaut seemed to just run around and smash into things with no development, that's pretty much what he did in the comics. Having read the comics and seen the old animated series, I think that was a pretty accurate representation of Juggernaut, so if you have a problem with him, talk to Stan Lee not Brett Ratner. Angel, however, is a big exception to this trend. Despite the fact that Angel does very little in the film, the scenes involving him and his relationship with his father are excellent. You really get the sense that these two care for each other despite the foreboding public perception of mutants. You feel sympathy for both him and his father.However, what little character development present in the film is made up for with the special effects. You can definitely tell that the budget made special effects priority one, and given the circumstances surrounding the making of this film (the constant changes in directing and such), it's nice to see that this film did not totally suffer from those circumstances. The Dark Phoenix effect is really cool (even though I would have preferred that they stick to the comics and give her actual flames), and the scene where Magneto lifts the Golden Gate bridge is fantastic (despite the huge continuity error the develops after the effect is done with). These are just one of the many cool effects that will leave you entertained throughout the movie.I will not totally spoil the movie for the ten people out there that still haven't seen it, but there are also some good scenes that were totally unexpected and very emotional (but again, most of these emotional scenes involve Wolverine and Jean Grey). I guess they really wanted you to know that this was a war, and in a war there are always some casualties. The end of the film also leaves an interesting teaser that the war may not be over just yet (but I'm kinda hoping they don't make another one; I think they've done as much as they can with these characters; you don't want to overdo it) Overall, this movie makes for a good hour and a half. Would I see it again? Personally no. I would probably just wait for it to come out on video, and then I'd rent it. However, I'm not going to sit there and blame the director, the cast, or the crew for any of the very evident problems with this film. Given the circumstances of production, they all did the best with what they were given, and it's a testament to the commitment and enthusiam these people had for the film that is not seen on very many sets in Hollywood these days.I recommend that X-men lovers see it just for a sense of closure. Just beware that there are some errors and go with them. It doesn't hold a candle to the first two, but then I wasn't really expecting it to. I think an actual grade scale best summarizes how I feel about this movie instead of the numeric system on IMDb, so I'm giving it a personal grade of B-.PS: Hats off to Brett for his small tribute to the short fan film ""I'm the Juggernaut Bitch!"" That's how you know that with all the problems, this was still a labor of love.",X-Men - The Last Stand
830,justloseit04,Could wait for the DVD,1,30 June 2006,"Well, my friends were really eager to see this movie and I didn't want to be left out so we managed to score some tickets for the opening day. I don't know what words to use to describe this movie. The plot line was nonexistent. The characters weren't well developed and some weren't developed at all and therefore seemed out of place in the movie. I hated how some characters just disappeared and reappeared at random points in the movie. And the ending was somewhat of a disappointment as well, at least when compared to the endings of the previous two movies. It seems the writers tried to squeeze in as much drama and action as possible, but doing so took away from the original concept of the series.",X-Men - The Last Stand
831,olly-40,At least the special effects were impressive...,3,17 July 2006,"Occasionally, with a final episode, you get the impression the movie or TV show's makers don't actually want to generate demand for ""more"". They'd sooner just feed the public a half-hearted and half-baked anticlimax, than bother dealing with demand for another. This is one of those cases. ""Rushed"" doesn't begin to describe how poorly put together this film is. The Phoenix saga was one of the most epic and engaging plots ever put to paper for the X-Men... and it's cinema rendition was handed to people who, I can only assume, never read it. The best part of the film is an introductory scene where Wolverine and Colossus battle a Sentinel. It is a perfunctory nod to the comic book origins of the story and its fans, and it lasts all of thirty seconds. From there on the film descends into a puerile power-trip for Ratner and his script writers, who seem to be in competition to see who can ruin the movie most: Ratner, with his alienated cast and abysmal direction, or the script writers, who will surely be remembered as having written dialogue so wooden, do tawdry, not even Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen working together could save them.

832,d_man006,Dark Phoenix is Here.... And With a Vengeance,9,21 July 2006,"Wow! This movie was a sure fire box office hit and a wonderful movie. The movie starts with scientists finding a cure for the mutant X gene, which they might make all mutants take. Many of the X-men are cured, including Mystigue, Rogue, and Magneto. But more problems are brewing for Professor X and his gang of good mutants. Jean Grey has been resurrected from the dead but is being put under a sort of spell by what we know as Dark Phoenix. Her power of telekinesis is so strong that she destroys everything that crosses her path, including people! Scott aka Cyclops found Jean but she killed him. Then when she is brought back to the mansion, her and Wolverine ""express"" their love and then she breaks the lab door off with her power blasts Woleverine out of the way and leaves the mansion. Professor X and Jean have a battle to the death and Professor X looses. Now Jean joins the Brotherhood where, with Pyro new members come as well. Callisto, who has super speed and super senses, ends up fighting with Storm a lot! In the end, it's a battle that ends with Wolverine killing the love of his life, Jean Grey. This installment was way better than the first two and I love the new characters Beast and Angel. It was cool to see Storm having her powers expand, since she's my favorite of all X-Men. By the way this one ended, I think we'll be seeing and X4, just without Scott, Professor X, and Maybe Jean Grey. Whoknows the Dark Phoenix might return to Earth and cause more destruction....... well I know that Phoenix isn't done with her life of vengeance and defeat!",X-Men - The Last Stand
833,Ed63,Nothing to be afraid of for fans!!!,10,29 May 2006,I saw X III on Saturday and enjoyed it immensely. My only complaint which is very minor is that it was to short. I enjoyed and was happy to see the expanded role that Storm had and Miss. Berry does a fine job in her role. Hopefully this will make enough money to allow future sequels to be made of the entire team. Hugh Jackman is excellent as usual. Having read the comic for thirty or so years and knowing the X canon helps but it is not necessary. This movies flows from the first two and does no disservice to them. The special effects were excellent and the story telling was fine as well as the character development. What was done in the 97 minutes could not have been done better therefore the 10 that I rated it. A fine addition to the comic movies and a challenge to Marvel to invest money for quality in its other movies besides Spiderman which I am sure will also be excellent when it comes out.,X-Men - The Last Stand
834,paul_reviews,The worst X-men movie,3,10 June 2020,"For me this has been the single most disappointing movie of all time. I grew up watching the original two x-men movies and have been tremendously excited for this one after the ending of X2, which to this day is my favorite non-MCU marvel film. So image my disbelief when this movie came out. Now at the time I was not aware that a new director was behind this so I came in extremely optimistic. The sequence at the beginning was actually interesting and made me think that I was in for a great experience. But after that, all that got lost. And by the time they basically killed iff or depowered basically all of my favorite characters, I gave up trying to find something to like.Possibly the only positive thing thing I can say about this movie is that the original cast is still great and the special effects might look better than in some of the newer entries to the franchise.Besides that there is nothing. I actually never understood why someone would call this movie good or even fun. For one, the plot is all over the place and kind of just goes wherever the script says to go without anything feeling natural. The two main storylines have little to no connection with each other. The Phoenix storyline is so forced and boring that I was actually falling asleep.Besides the story, the characters act completely illogically and become totally unlikable. Professor X starts acting like an a**hole towards everyone, Magneto starts behaving like an a**hole, which is unfortunate for such a sympathetic character, and Wolverine's love for Jean doesn't feel like a natural progression from the first movie, which makes him killing her in the end not as powerful as it could have been. There are also characters that I would have love to seen properly develop from the events of X2, but are lazily killed or depowered without a brief moment for us to feel emotional. Possibly the worst offenders are Cyclops and Mystique, whose relationship with Magneto could have gone a lot if interesting places, but Magneto leaves her he like he us the world's largest douchebag.So please, if you agree with me, give this review a like so that I know that there are other people for who this has been the disappointment of their lives.",X-Men - The Last Stand
835,colby_park,Painful,1,16 June 2006,"The final arc in the X-Men franchise has finally landed. Let me start this review by saying that X2 was and is a hard act to follow. In my humble opinion, it might be the best comic book movie ever made. Even Bryan Singer would have had a hell of a time topping that bad boy. So does X-Men 3 live up to the hype? The short answer is, of course, no. There are some extremely fundamental problems with this film's script which should have been addressed long before one bit of celluloid started to roll.The story opens with flashbacks of a young Jean being recruited to the school by a young Xavier and Magneto. This scene lulled me into a feeling that maybe this would be an awesome movie. The next scene, a young Warren Worthington trying in vain to slice off his wings, also works well. However, when his character amounts to little more than a glorified cameo, this scene becomes completely pointless. We're led to believe that this is a character we should care for, and then he gets tossed out almost immediately. After the set up we are thrust into the meat of the story. The X-Men are still reeling from Jean Grey's sacrifice in X2 and are training a new group of muties to fill out the leather uniforms. We get to see precious little of them working as a team, however. I thought the point of a team story was to show how they interact? Apparently, along with Halle Berry's upgraded role came the stipulation that she can only share the screen with one mutant at a time. Since most people are familiar with the plot line here's a super-short rundown. Magneto and X-Men clash and a small war breaks out. There's a mutant cure and a few members die. Boredom ensues. I've never felt so utterly detached from a movie. It could have to do with the overdone musical score, terrible dialog, or countless errors and goofs. It's a movie that utterly ruins a perfectly viable franchise. I felt pained after watching this.WHAT WORKED- Multiple Man! This guy had like two minutes of total screen time, but he ruled both of them. He's a cocky, sarcastic mutant who is literally his own best friend. I learned more about him in two lines than I did from Storm in three movies. - Iceman/Pyro. I've always loved the way these two interact, from the first hint of rivalry in X-Men to the museum scene in X2. My only complaint was that there is no real resolution. Iceman head-butts Pyro, end of story. The entire fight was in the trailer. If there had just been a few more seconds of dialog, or perhaps a Pyro death scene, this would have been perfect. - Beast (sometimes.) Kelsey Grammar did a fine job. I dug his look and overall approach to Beast. The scene in which he meets Leech is very well done. -Fastball Special. Any comic geek will tell you that this is a classic comic book moment which is a joy to see in action.WHAT DIDN'T WORK-Halle Berry. We get it, you're a star. Get over yourself and share the stage with someone else. Miss Berry may be an Oscar winner, but she also did Catwoman. In my opinion, two movies with storm was enough, kick her ass out and bring back... -Cyclops. Hey, here's an idea! Let's take the X-Men team leader and emotional anchor of the phoenix storyline and kill him off in ten minutes so storm can do more. Yeah, that worked real well. If his death had served a purpose I wouldn't have minded. But it seemed to me that they were killing him off just to punish James Marsden for doing Superman Returns. -Juggernaut, Bitch! Wow, talk about misused. juggernaut is a cool character and I love Vinnie Jones, but that is quite a miscast part. And he spends most of the movie looking mad and making stupid one-liners. And his big finish? Hitting his head on a wall! -Beast (Mostly.) The hook for Beast in the movie is that he's conflicted. When he first sees what Leech is capable of there is a beautiful moment where we can see his conflict. Then, like nothing has happened, he makes his choice and stands with the X-Men. That was wrapped up way too easily.ERRORS/PLOT HOLES -In X2 the phoenix entity was fiery and red when Jean accessed it. In this one she just turns dead looking...how's that work? - The X-Men fly from New York to San Fransisco very quickly. This is, I guess, plausible because they have a super-sonic blackbird jet. However, Angel shows up in the thick of the fight as well. We can assume he wasn't on the jet because they didn't show him. Are we to believe that with his little feather wings he can fly the same speed as the blackbird? - Magneto is shown playing chess all by his lonesome in the park at the conclusion of the movie. This plot hole was so huge I didn't even pick up on it at first. Shouldn't he be, like, IN JAIL!? They spend half the movie looking for him, then when the entire U.S. army is only feet away from him, and he loses his power, he is somehow able to slip away? **Here's the grand-daddy plot hole of them all** -Jean has such a powerful mutation that she cannot control it. She claims the only way to stop her is to die, as she is constantly begging Logan for death. However, her power is a result of mutation and in the movie they have rendered a cure for that. You see where I'm going with this? Why don't you geniuses just cure her? That is the epitome of crappy writing. How a plot hole that big even made it into a second draft of the script is mind boggling.",X-Men - The Last Stand
836,weine-1,A worthy ending (?) to an epic tale,9,24 May 2006,"(Mild spoilers) OK, now they have a cure for the X-gene. Good for some. Bad for others. Well, as long as nobody forces anyone to be ""cured"", it's cool, aight? Nuh-uh. Of course, somebody gets shot with the cure, against his or her will. And this of course turns another somebody into the raving lunatic we've all come to know (and love) as Dr Magneto.Magneto sees in the cure an urge from all humans to equalize the society, and mistrusts both the pharmaceutical company who developed the drug and the government. He starts to rally mutants against the society, and uses violence to show that no mutants may be forcibly cured.Evil spawns evil, or however it goes. Mutants are soon pitted against humans, and the X-Men are of course caught in between.This flick doesn't have the same momentum as did the first two, but it succeeds in closing the chronicle in a worthy way. Watching Ms Janssen squirming around the observation table with Mr Jackson, was worth the admission price all by itself. Add to that the fact that we all get a lot of action, laughs and tears for our money, and the success is a fact! :) My rating: 8,7 / 10",X-Men - The Last Stand
837,Imrak,A Sloppy Conclusion,6,25 October 2006,"X-Men 3: The Last Stand This film had the potential to be the greatest of the X-Men films. It's storyline, by far the best, could have been the most complex not only of the X-films, but also of any super-hero movie.A cure is found for mutants. The mutants have to decide if they want to accept it or not; become ""normal"" human beings, no longer outcasts from society. Some radicals see this as a final straw as to what has been waiting to become Civil War. And it does; as our famed mutant villain Magneto (the only classy actor left, Ian Mckellan) assembles an army of mutants. And as this is happening, matters are further complicated by the return of Jean Grey (Famke Jansen), who has risen under the guise of her dark alter-ego: Phoenix. Her mission; kill everything and everyone with her unlimited psychic abilities.Why is it, that this material is put to such little good use? What happened in the translation from idea to screenplay? How much was left on the cutting room floor? Even though all the supporting players from the last 2 installments are back, none are given the screen time they deserve; as a plethora of newcomers join the X brigade. These new mutants seem to have joined the film for the purpose of having new mutants; just as every mutant who dies, seems to have died just to make room. The situation is worsened b/c you do not care when one dies; you don't even have time to think about it. The film is racing forward at such breakneck speed, forcing in so many unnecessary action set pieces that you will get a headache. And as far as the ""choosing whether or not to take the cure"", every central character seems to take no time to actually think about this decision. They all make up their minds as soon as they here of it; all only have to speak a simple ""yes"" or ""no"".Other problems with the film's logic bother me. Why can all the mutants in the army jump extraordinarily far? How does it go from daylight to night-time in a matter of seconds at the final battle? And why are the X-Men even trying to stop Magneto? To save one kid from being killed? They kill scores more of their own kind in the process to save this one stupid brat. What kind of logic is this? Overall, this was one of the biggest cinematic disappointments I've ever seen. An insult to every thing that made Bryan Singer's 1st two masterpieces magical.",X-Men - The Last Stand
838,mschorr-1,"Silly, but entertaining",6,29 July 2007,"It is said of John Carradine that, in his later years, he would do any film role for $100,000. As a result, he played in a lot of dreadful films.I couldn't help but think of Carradine as I watched the eminent British actor, Sir Ian McKellan, prancing about in a ghastly costume and pantomiming throwing automobiles through the air in this 2006 installment of the comic book series.However, McKellen is not alone here. This film features a stellar cast of Oscar, Emmy and Tony winners and other distinguished performers, including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin and Kelsey Grammar. And the supporting cast includes no slouches either.As an actor, I can think of few things more difficult than standing in front of a green screen in a ludicrous outfit, feigning physical acts involving elements to be later generated by computer, while mouthing comic book dialogue. Yet, for the most part, these talented folk manage to pull it off.I must confess that I have never read an X-Men comic book, nor have I seen either of the previous X-Men films. Regarding this one, the plot is too silly to recount. On more than one occasion, I had to remind myself of my son's comment when, watching some similar film, I raised some plot objection. ""You want logic?"" he asked. Abandon all logic, ye who enter here.One unfortunate point. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen have virtually identical voices and diction. Now and then it became difficult, when they were both in a scene, to be certain which one of them was speaking.The special effects are spectacular, I guess. Like most of us, I suspect, I have become so jaded by special effects that they tend to make me yawn. ""King Kong"" was a special exception.All of these esteemed performers play ""mutants"" in this film, but their mutations are not the type you might expect; no tails, or extra fingers or webbed toes. No, their mutations allow them to control metal, throw fire or ice, control the weather, read minds or, in one case, do anything they can imagine.Poor Kelsey Grammar plays Beast. For most of the movie, his mutation seems to be that he is colored blue and very hairy. In the climactic battle, it turns out he is a refugee from the WWE.I don't want to imply by these comments that his film is not fun to watch. It is, sort of. If you were going to spend $7-10 to see it at a theater, I'd advise you to save your money. If you're going to rent it for a couple of bucks, or watch it on cable, then pop some corn, pour a beer and go for it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
839,hughlover1968,The Final Stand,10,28 July 2007,"Well, this isn't the movie I'd shed tears over, but being the last on made me quite sad. It seems that Fox can't afford to pay the actors anymore, that's what I read. But following the comic books, Phoenix, better known as Jean put on a fantastic performance. Usually movies based on comic books suck or are great. This one is great and the title suits that this is the last movie. Hugh Jackman puts his last and best performance of Wolverine if you don't count the prequel that's coming up, and adding Kelsy Grammar was pretty cool too. The Last Stand is by far the best of all the X-Men movies. It can't be topped. If there was one movie I had to watch over and over again, it would be this one. I'm just glad Fox ended it as a trilogy. But the end is opened for another one, so maybe when Fox works up the money there will be another one, hopefully with the same actors.

I for one loved this movie, i thought the director did a great job with it. i thought the story was also good just at times a little dull. i wouldn't say its the best of the series, but i will say its one hell of an ending (unless they plan on making more) i think Hugh Jackman is the perfect wolverine. i never followed the comics but i saw some of the cartoons and i would say Jackman did one hell of a job on all of them. the cast was great, in the end i wanted more and if you want till after the credits then it delivers that little bit of information that there could be more. a good movie for anyone who grew up reading the comics or is just a marvel fan all together. a great movie overall.",X-Men - The Last Stand
841,robram60,bad sequel,4,29 August 2008,"I was a fan of the original X-men comics in the 60's before the addition of a lot of the characters which made it into the movie versions. That aside, I enjoyed the way Brian Singer explored the psychological complexities of his mutants and actually created fleshed out characters with depth and humanity. For that reason, I enjoyed the first two movies immensely, particularly the second. It became obvious after watching about 10 minutes of the third movie that Singer was no longer the director. Character portrayal took a back seat to action shots, explosions and destruction, and the dialogue was full of clichés and embarrassing one liners. Ratner took characters which one grew to genuinely care about in the previous two movies and reduced them to comic book drawings, with no apparent sense of how they could have been further developed. Sad how important players were quickly killed off, and others introduced with no sense of why they were there or what motivated them. Again, cartoon characters given one or two frames in the comic book. The ending scene had sequel written all over it. Hopefully, Ratner won't be given the opportunity to further ruin what were two very good movies .. Singer deserves another chance to restore some humanity and quality to the story.",X-Men - The Last Stand
842,dbtwin28,disappointed...,3,27 May 2006,"SPOILERS!!!I have been waiting so long to see this movie, especially when I saw the teaser online. This movie fell WAY SHORT!Where to start? CYCLOPS: THE ORIGINAL X-MAN, received a very small part in X2, and with the return of Jean Grey aka Phoenix, I really thought he would have played a much bigger role in X3. Scott is a changed man, and I was ready to see him down and out over the loss of Jean, and then come to terms with her return. Not only did this NOT happen, but Scott was killed off very early in the movie. Would you believe he was killed OFF SCREEN?. I just DO NOT understand why writers wouldn't choose to do more with a key character. The return of Jean alone as the Phoenix was enough material for a movie.NEW MUTANTS: We see all kinds of new mutants in X3, and thats just it. We just SEE them. Brett Ratner DID NOT develop ANY of the new mutants in this film. Multiple Man, Juggernaut, Colossus, and Siryn to name a few and for the most part were there just to take up space. All we know is what they can do, beyond that...NOTHING.MUTANT POWERS: Something I really enjoyed about the first two movies is that director, Bryan Singer, chose not to make the mutants powers a gimmick. Ratner DID NOT follow Singers example. Around the house, at school, and even a pre-Brotherhood town meeting, you see a mutant doing something that just kind of wants to make you role your eyes and say, ""We get it!""OVERLY DRAMATIC: There are several scenes that seem to be a bit over the top as far as drama is concerned. These scenes would have played much better if there was more development, but at the same time, the same scene could have been played down and been just as effective.I also think that instead of having a real story to tell, Ratner chose to kill off key characters to shock the audience. It seems to be a last ditch effort to make sure he has your attention.I could go on and on.....POSITIVE NOTE: The only real positive I have to say about X3 is that Jean Grey as the Phoenix looked truly horrifying. I got a chill looking into those black eyes, its just a shame such a cool looking intimidating glance was wasted on such a horrible movie. Please, go see it. I can't be alone on this.",X-Men - The Last Stand
843,nightblade00,Unworthy of the X-men name,3,27 May 2006,"So long X-men I'll miss you. Brett Ratner did more to kill off the X-Men than magneto and the Government could have ever hoped to. The movie is such a disappointment that by the end I was hoping Ratner would just decide to kill off (literally) the remaining X-Men that choose to stay alive for the this movie (which sadly isn't nearly enough of them, or Ratner killed off his best actors on purpose). The plot of the movie is convincing enough: A pharmaceutical develops a cure to block the mutant X-gene, making all mutants human. The government predictably weaponises the cure, proving right magneto's fears that the human government intends to forcibly cure them. While the idea behind the plot is great, when the producers hit the execute button the whole thing froze up with incompetence.The First Problem in my idiot director crap list: The script is a definite downgrade from X-2 (the writers left with Singer to make Superman Returns). Since Ratner and the writers choose to leave out or simply kill off several lead characters early in the movie (a horrid decision! Ratner, for some reason, feels the need in this movie to kill people frequently and without apparent reason. He doesn't quite understand you don't win Oscars or fans on body count alone.) it would have only made since to develop the new characters they introduce, but no, they are just thrown into the movie with basically no introduction.Second on my idiot director crap list: The whole movie feels like a long series of loosely connected 30 second commercials. I don't think any scene lasts longer than a minute which makes it nearly impossible to identify with any of the characters.Third on my idiot director crap list: Ratner chooses to have the characters act out of character in order to solve some of the problems he created with the movie. Magneto is the best example. Ratner must have figured out that by the final battle most of the audience would be on his side (I know I was kind of hoping he'd kill all the X-men just so we wouldn't have to worry about another Ratner directed X-men movie!). So he had Magneto do and say some things that were out of character to try and push the audience back to the X-men's side...who then also do things that are way out of character to defeat Magneto.It was very clear that Ratner didn't know much about the story or the characters, but was much more interested in making a movie where he got to kill people and blow things up. This all may sound harsh, and its not like I hate Ratner...I just think he should burn in hell for this travesty.",X-Men - The Last Stand
844,divisionbell,A swing and a miss,3,31 May 2006,"I have to give Brett Ratner some credit. He tried. Sure...he failed miserably in almost every way....but he ""tried"". I'm sure it wasn't easy for him to step into Singer's shoes on the third film, I'm sure it was hard to keep up with the rushing of the film to beat Superman Returns to the punch, but he made blatant mistakes that have left fan outraged. First off, this is not an X-Men film. It's actually a rather generic action film that just happens to have X-Men in it. What we find on the screen is a massive jumble of characters and plots that never add up to anything. Ratner took 5 or 6 different plot lines from the comics and attempted to mold them all together into one film. The stories don't mesh and so you're never really sure what you are watching. And so much potential was lost along the way! Second, from a X-Men fan's point of view mind you, you don't just come into a series and start executing characters left and right. It's not fair to the fans or the characters. Cyclops shouldn't even have been considered as part of the cast. Sure Cyclops was never given a chance in the series, the leader of the X-men barely has any screen time in any of the films. But this was just embarrassing!! And if that wasn't bad enough, Ratner starts taking out major characters one after the other, with almost all of the deaths (or cures for that matter) are completely meaningless. My biggest complaint was the lack of screen time for so many big characters. Colossus alone should have had a major battle. I mean come on, Colossus vs Juggernaut, who DIDN'T want to see that happen?? Then there was the iceman vs. pyro battle that didn't even really happen. What was that? It was the setup we've all been waiting for and they just stand there and blast each other for a couple of minutes and it was over. What?? Did I miss something?? No fireballs, flaming creature, cool ice blasts that would leave the audience cheering...NOTHING!!I could keep going on and on....and on. But I'm know what I'm saying now has been said before over and over....and over again.But alas, the pinnacle of the film. YOU DON'T MAKE A FINALE AND THEN LEAVE SUCH A BLATANT OPENING FOR A SEQUEL!! Anyone who stayed through the credits knows EXACTLY what this means!! All in all, a shameful way to kill the franchise. Soooooo much potential for an amazing comic book movie was flushed down the drain.Ratner, as well as 20th Century Fox, should be ashamed of themselves!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
845,rorshachtest,"Almost as good as the 1st, but nowhere near the 2nd",7,5 January 2007,"While watching this third installment of the X-Men series I just wondered where Bryan Singer was. What was he doing at that exact moment, and was he actually happy with what Ratner did to the series? Did he wonder what his movie would have looked like if he had his way with The Last Stand? Would he have at least had better conversations between certain characters? That whole Wolverine/Beast banter made my eyes roll and the fight scene at towards the end of the film where they make their ""stand"" lacked the ingenuity and charisma I was used to. There were some bright spots with the look back at when Jean Grey was first recruited, but all in all it fell quite short of the 2nd film. I'm quite sorry it had to be made this way, but it had to be made at SOME point. I just wish someone other than Ratner had decided to pick up where Singer had left off.",X-Men - The Last Stand
846,Atlasxxiv,Bryan Singer must be so disappointed.,4,24 May 2006,"This movie was the most disappointing movie I have seen in a long time. So many short-cuts were taken, that a real storyline was completely lacking.I was looking forward to bringing in the new characters, but what they did with the old ones was just plain wrong. I know Halle Barry wouldn't work on the movie unless she took more of a starring role, and the movie suffered with her weak character taking up too much screen time. Famke Jansen is a good actress and she was just there to angrily pout the whole time like in a child in a horror movie.The music was cheesy and awful and distracting. The effects were cool - very cool. Again though, the lack of writing detracts from effects. At one point Magneto throws cars into the air from a bridge and Pyro lights them up. Very cool indeed. The next time they show the bridge the cars are all there. I hope this was the last X-men movie, because to me, it is completely ruined by the lack of presence by the Bryan Singer. Why they didn't wait for him to finish Superman I'll never know.",X-Men - The Last Stand
847,firecrow_1965,"Visually stunning, good plot, a bit fast - but worth the cash.",8,25 May 2006,"I got a chance to see this last night/this morning. The movie theater here in Petaluma got the movie yesterday afternoon, and as per usual, they held a screening for the employees and whomever the employees wanted to invite. I had to bake a huge batch of cookies to sucker my way into this one and baking that batch was worth it.The movie seemed to go by really super fast, but we started it at 12:10ish and I got out of there around 2:30. It's just really fast paced. I'm probably going to see this a few more times. The special effects blew my mind. And there were some plot points that I was sort of disappointed in, and a few key characters that were killed off that made my jaw drop. (Yes, there is OODLES of death in this one). But according to the comic book geeks there, the movie stuck to the basic comicbook storyline pretty well. I'm a Bryan Singer fan, though, and I kind of wish he hadn't chosen Superman Returns over this. But Brett Rattner did a good job.Oh, and Famke Janssen was FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE. Damn damn damn. That's really the only reason I've been anticipating this movie for three years - just to see what they did with her character.Oh, and one more thing. DO NOT - I repeat - DO NOT immediately leave when the credits start rolling. There's a 30 second scene at the very end, right after the credits. And it WILL shock you. So stick around.",X-Men - The Last Stand
848,vjcoletti,No,1,28 January 2008,"Bryan Singer set it up with an excellent adaption of the X-men into the film genre. The characters were there, the myths was there, the story lines were there...but for some strange reason Brett Ratner throws all of that out to give us a awful story crammed with a plot of nothing but special effects. I had such high hopes after X2, Bryan Singer set up one of the most monumental sagas of all time at the end of X2 and Brett Ratner ruined it. If you want a good movie read the Dark Phoenix Saga, it had such a better plot. The movies downfalls started with it being an hour and thirty minutes, Spider Man 3 may have been long but it was enjoyable, this was short and not. None of the characters ever really shine her except for Magneto, Logan and Storm. In fact the X-men do not exist accept for these people. Angel could have been an intriguing character if he had more than one and a half lines. Rogue whimpered out of existence with only 8 lines in the movie. Storm was given more screen time to do nothing but get beat and of course wolverine got the star for being the hero he was never meant to be. X-men has always been a team film, not a film about a guy with claws. There really was no need for the cure story line a much better one would have been the advent of the sentinels which you see in the first sequence. It was great they brought Jean back (by the way the phoenix is a flaming bird...get it flaming...not a dark willow wannabe...Ratner you owe Joss Whedon money for taking his idea)but who cared she was back since she really didn't matter. Her story should have gotten Nice attention. Basically this is how you ruin a movie, make it filled with special effects and put the characters on a backseat and have the car keep jumping. I am appalled by this movie, all you had to do was pick up a comic book, the storyline was right there. So in closing do yourself a favor, read the book, watch the cartoon but don't bother watching X3...actually it's not X3 i will never accept X3 as part of the movie sagas, and hope someone will remake this into the movie it should have been.",X-Men - The Last Stand
849,matchitehew,Easily The WORST Comic Book Movie,1,12 May 2009,"Brett Ratner needs a razzy for this one. Seriously. Or the person who hired him on needs to be fired from their job. And then fired out of a canon. Anyone who's seen any of his other films could easily tell you that this is the kind of scene capturing best left to prime time television dramas. That's right. TV. Ratner has no business directing something big, ESPECIALLY an established franchise. The filming had little creativity process involved, instead opting to go with standard angles that made the action very boring to watch. Any intensity, any emotion that may have been there was not captured with these cameras. Everything was bland and had me wanting it to be over with quick. Heck, even the locations of these action scenes were boring and aided to drive the viewer to sleep.His soulless directing techniques even managed to make most of the performers turn out wooden and slapstick. People who should have appeared intense, intimidating, or emotional looked like nothing more stunt doubles saying the lines of a trained actor. Was this just his direction? Probably not. Was it the actors? Except for Halle Berry, who seems to want to do nothing more than play Halle Berry, the cast here had already displayed their excellent acting skills before this farce. So what happened?Writers. Tsk. Some of em are good at their job. Not here, however. Every line of dialog spoken was forced, unnatural. Most of it didn't even fit the character who was speaking it. Heck, the characters didn't even fit the characters speaking the lines. Almost everyone here has had their role altered for the worst.Magneto is went through the amount of change that angered me the most. He went from being someone to be feared to an old guy and a jerk. Before he hated humans and wanted them to know what it was like, wanted to make them pay. Now his hate shows irrationally, it's just there. He even goes so far as to abandon his love, Mystique, when she's cured. His decisions also make no sense whatsoever. Trying to coax Jean into unleashing her dangerously uncontrollable full potential??? I'm sorry, Eric's views are a bit skewed, but he's not a moron. It's unfortunate that the writer's chose to make him a bumbling idiot instead of someone with cunning. Heck, the change in character is even reflected in the poor choice of costume. This outfit is far more form fitting to him and closes off his neck, making his old show through even more than before. It's ash-gray color makes it look more like a Sunday suit than the uniform of a leader. What he had before gave him a much more sinister appearance.Oh, and Wolverine wasn't Wolverine. He was too nice, too calm. Too collected. I understand he's old, should be wise, whatever, but he doesn't go from being a cranky guy to being deliverer of awe-inspiring locker room speeches realistically.Since they butchered the established characters there wasn't really much to do for a decently dramatic story. It's chalk-full of cliché moments that they somehow managed to make MORE cliché than they ought to have been. The cure plot, done correctly, could have had you on the edge of your seat from the get-go. Heck, something like this could have spanned three movies, introducing characters we'd want to follow as they struggle with an extremely life-changing decision. We could have seen the bigoted hatred for mutants boil over into riots. More elements from the comics could have been brought in to further flesh this out: The Friends Of Humanity, Mr. Sinister or Apocalypse, SENTINALS. YES. The towering mutant hunting robots that my friends and I were greeted to when the X-Men cartoon premiered in the 90s.Instead...the cure was introduced so that there would be an excuse for Magneto to start a war. The sad, tragic thing about this is is that war doesn't happen. What does happen is the pointless ripping away of a bridge to carry himself and a bunch of angry mutants to the island the cure is being developed on. There a battle takes place. It's not even epic. Not even pulse pounding. You would think that after a decade of great action films before it that it would be child's play filming a winner-takes-all climactic fight. The fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike, a ONE ON ONE fight, was much more gripping than what happened here. I'm not even going to go into details because the whole thing was just more of a chase sequence.Along with this crummy script came Magneto's new batch of chronies. None of them displayed any distinct personality traits like individual members of the brotherhood did in the first. The Juggernaut easily takes his place as the most annoying comic-book-based movie character EVER. That's really all there is. The others were all just like normal people, having no actual development taking place to flesh them out. Just there to take on the X-Men.Adaptation wise, this film tore everything apart. Just assume that much and you'll be safe.Gah, I gave this a one because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have given it a negative number had it been allowed. My hatred for the shear waste of potential here, combined with the irremovable blight on the franchise's story, has made me do this. I don't even care if you read it, I needed to just rant my frustration at millions of dollars once again wasted by FOX.",X-Men - The Last Stand

It was obvious how Halle Berry was just hogging the camera time argh I could go on and on and on ...I have just got back now and I am speechless to be honest I would like to write more but I find the whole experience upsetting ...My advice - avoid at all costs, pretend it was never made.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Many characters just didn't get enough screen time. I don't see why the rush the movie wasn't even two hours long. Had they made it 2 and a half hours or even 3 hours (probably pushing it) it could have been so much better because they could have added to the minor bits of character development that each character in this movie got. The acting jobs for many characters were good, but Kitty Pride and Callisto were pretty bad. The movie had awesome special effects and fight scenes. It also had a lot of moments you know were just for the fans. This movie was pretty good, but it's just depressing with maybe a teeny bit more effort into acting and script it could have been an epic finale. The scale was grand enough and the stage was set.Just some of the story parts that could have been developed into a lot more: Rogue's desire to be normal, Angel and his father's conflict with his powers, Pyro and Iceman's rivalry, Beast's powers making him look like a mutant, The Rogue Iceman Kitty love triangle, Magneto and Mystique's betrayal of each other, and Collossus( Who didn't get any character development whatsoever)",X-Men - The Last Stand
853,JNash87,Not as bad as it sounds,8,26 May 2006,"*Spoilers ahead*X-Men: The Last Stand has been a movie I have been looking forward to probably since I saw X2 just because the world of x-men is so interesting. Going into the theater I had such high hopes for this movie, but coming out I had a strange feeling. It wasn't as good as the previous two. Singer did a great job with the first two films and it is very hard to live up to doing X3. I don't know anything about Ratner except for all the stuff I've read on the forums and such so I can't judge his personality. I think he missed a lot of what could have been in the movie.One thing I was upset with was the time frame. There could have been a whole lot more character developments (and maybe less Storm stuff because I don't think anyone cares that she had a bigger role except that she did have some awesome fight scenes.) I don't believe that any of the characters are really dead (in my opinion.) Cyclops was never shown to be dead, they just excepted it. Of course the thing after the credits shows that there is something there with Professor X. I can still see Jean busting out from the grave at the mansion and reuniting with the X-Men. Hopefully there will be an X4 on the horizon and will perform a little better with the characters. Too many people were brought in this one. Beast was a good add. Jugernaut was alright, we probably could have done without him or give more history about him. I liked the appearance of Dark Pheonix with the black eyes and such, it gave an erie feel to the movie. I don't know if Ratner saw the Professor and Cyclops as just characters or what but I really wish they weren't takin out of the film. The Professor had a less heartwarming feel to him and more harsh, like when he is talking to Wolverine and he says ""I don't need to explain myself to you."" That gave off the feel that Wolverine is an outcast which is OK, but it also gave off the feel that he wasn't wanted and that the Professor was a jerk. Overall the movie wasn't that bad. I will probably go see it again just because I'm a fan of the movies and I want to see it again. People are making this movie out to be the worst movie ever, but I think it was alright.",X-Men - The Last Stand
854,pacoruban,Rounds off the series nicely,7,23 June 2006,"I went into this movie with low expectations: I had read reviews saying that this was the worst X-men movie so far, and that Bryan Singer's talents were sorely missed. However, I actually liked this movie a lot and thought it was the best of the trilogy. OK, so the Phoenix subplot was a little weak, and many of the personalities of the new mutants were not well-developed. However, the movie was exciting, the special effects were great and it was not too long. Yes, it was a bit of a no-brainer (actually, a lot of a no-brainer), but hey, sometimes that is all that you want from a late Friday night movie (especially a super-hero movie): some nice eye-candy and big explosions. Putting too much drama into a superhero movie may not always be such a good idea: look at Ang Lee's Incredible Hulk for example. Many critics loved this movie for its ""strong character development"", but this was neither what I expected, nor really wanted when I paid for my movie ticket at the time.It was great to see that Storm could hold her own in a fight. I was a little appalled in the first X-men movie when she was thrown around by that little guy with the long tongue. It was also good to see the duel between Pyro and Iceman. I've been waiting for this battle since X2! Juggernaut's costume was a little silly, but not as bad as I thought it would be having seen him on the X-men official website. His one-liners are crude and probably did not require much thought from the script-writers, but they fairly amusing. I had read about the now-infamous ""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"" line from some other review-websites, and at the time, thought it was really stupid. I have to say, though, I did laugh when I heard it in the movie. Perhaps you need the context for the line to have its intended effect :P As with the other X-men movies, my favorite X-man is Magneto. Sir Ian McCellan has great ""screen presence"" though I can't really quantify what this means, and his character is deliciously evil. I also really like how Magneto and Xavier have great respect for each other, even though they are fighting on opposite sides of the battle. Personally, I wasn't too upset with the loss of Cyclops. Even though it is widely acknowledged that Bryan Singer developed his characters really well in the first two movies, he always seemed fairly two-dimensional to me: essentially a punch-bag for the more charismatic Wolverine. I thought final battle scene was quite exciting. The actions scenes were done very well in this movie compared to the first two. However, the final part with Jean tearing off the flesh of a constantly-healing Wolverine was a bit corny, and Phoenix looks constantly constipated for basically the whole duration of this scene. BUT at least we get to watch Magneto toss around cars as if they were chestnuts and Pyro lighting them up with his powers. Hoo-ah!One last thing: so in the end, Rogue decided to take the cure. I think in the end, we are meant to assume that mutants have the choice to take the cure, if they want to, but that it is not forced onto them. Although the analogy is not perfect, this made me think of the Pro-choice versus Pro-life debate.",X-Men - The Last Stand
855,showtime22282,The Review,1,27 May 2006,"(X-MEN III: THE LAST STAND) Let me first thank all the pimple faced comic experts that went to see this movie the same time that I did. It made my movie watching experience feel that much more enjoyable. I mean, wouldn't you like it if the casual but cool kid with his collar popped up, while wearing pointy dress shoes kept commenting, ""Hey that's Beast"" or hey ""That's a sentinel""? My God, shut your flap! I realize you're trying to impress your date with your X-men trivia I.Q of a 150, so I won't make fun of you too much. Okay, maybe I just did? Now that I have that off of my chest, onto the movie review.I read my share of X-MEN comics in my day, but I'm not going to sit here and exploit how the movie didn't follow any of Stan Lee's books. I just don't care. If a movie keeps my attention, the dialogue is tight, and the characters aren't jumbled around Then there is a pretty good chance that it's already on my plus side. This however fit in with the likes of the usual crap-tastic sequels that I was hoping it would steer clear of. It felt as if Brett Ratner went with cheap one liners to try and soften up this film. Which might of worked if he casted Ryan Reynolds? I also felt bad for an important main character that was in the movie for the first 5 minutes only to be killed off. Then to make matters worse, there were a lot of juggled characters that totally fell flat. Angel, who we all thought during the previews, was going to be the strong new cool guy on the block. Well sorry to disappoint you all, but other then flying over the sea during sun sets, and looking pretty, he did absolutely nothing to give the movie a push. Instead the big pivotal character was Can I get a drum roll? Cameron Bright. Who shares a spitting resemblance to Courtland Mead. Also known as the guppy faced kid from the made for T.V. movie ""The Shinning"". That's right not The Phoenix. She was also pointless. Magneto needed her on his side through the whole movie, and then when he finally does, she is not even used. She stands there in a drugged out daze most of the time, and doesn't react until the military tries to hurt her. Which reminds me, during the end of the film after the bridge was connected to Alcatraz, did we all witness an Ed Wood edit? It went from day to night in one frame! At this point I was thinking in my head, ""I wonder how much money Bryan Singer made doing superman instead of this?"" I know I keep saying ""By the way, or The other thing is"" But this time I'm going to say, what the beef? And to the regards of my ""what the beef"" comment I retort with, WHERE WAS NIGHT CRAWLER!? You mean to tell me when the X-Men are pushed to fight they were only able to round up 6 members of the entire school? Wow, Xavier really taught the kids at accelerated levels to prepare them, didn't he? I am not going to complain that Gambit or any other new characters were not involved. However, don't have a cool character like Night Crawler that was already developed from a previous movie and not throw him into the mix. In my closing comments I would like to say, what would you do for a Klondike bar? If I had known then what I know now, I would've forfeited seeing this movie for that tasty ice cream treat.

Its not a bad movie per say, it is fun and loaded with action, but in comparison to the previous X-Men movies its not nearly as good.There are a few decent things in this movie. The opening scene shows a younger Magneto and Professor X, which is almost scary how the makeup and effects artists made Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart look 30 years younger. Ian McKellan as always gives a top notch performance and once again steals the show from everyone else like in the last two X-Men films. As I said before, this movie is loaded with action scenes, but that's also one of the movie's flaws.When I first heard Bryan Singer was no longer directed X-Men 3, I knew this movie would not be as good as the last two. When I heard Brett Ratner was directing, that was the nail in the coffin. Singer focused on story and character development in the previous two installments while Ratner focused on action and special effects. While I am a fan of action and special effects, there needs to be some depth and driving force to lead up to the action.Another major flaw of X-Men 3 is that there are way too many characters running around. Several main characters in the previous films are killed off early on just make way for new ones. Most of the new characters are introduced 123 and are used later on to perform one function in a later scene. Some characters are barely in the movie and you're left wondering, why were they even in this at all? There's a lot more about this movie that annoys me, but I could go on forever. I don't recommend this movie, but who am I? I seem to be the only one who dislikes X-Men 3.",X-Men - The Last Stand
857,Wisedog,Like the X-men? You'll hate this film.,3,26 May 2006,"This review contains a frank discussion of the film's contents, and will spoil the movie for those who've yet to see it. Don't read this if you haven't seen it. I encourage all movie-goers to see a film and form their own opinions before reading those of others.That being said, I'm going to be quite honest. This film made me upset. Let's frame this by saying that I'm no purist, by any means. I quite enjoyed the first two films. I thought they were well made, with well-developed characters who stayed true to their comic book counter parts, as well as maintained a unique on-film continuity. As for this film, it has cool action sequences. And Beast is awesome. That's about all I have positive to say about this film.Rumors flew before the films release about Halle Berry demanding more money and a larger role, and rumors followed about the studio caving quite completely to her desires by killing off Cyclops and Professor X. This obviously occurred. The movie should have been titled, ""Halle Berry is awesome."" Professor X's character completely changed. Far from wise, patient, and honest, he became presumptuous, short, and seemingly reckless. This was apparently to make him a dick, so that people wouldn't take it so personally when he was killed. Colossus's only purpose in the film, despite being one of the most powerful mutants, was simply to throw Wolverine. Angel's character was pointless: his sole function was to be a visual icon for the third film, and as witnessed on every single billboard advertising X3, he lived up to his goal. The story lines were generic and predictable, the dialogue was throw-away and cheesy, and nearly every X-man looked foolish for the benefit of Storm.All of the film's problems can be traced back to a disregard for continuity, appreciation of the fans, and decent film-making. When it comes down to it, the filmmakers discarded anything that made the X-men worth watching in favor of marketing. And because of that, there were countless untapped opportunities in this film. Someone at the top didn't understand that what makes the X-men great isn't their powers, and how cool they can be. That's just the cherry on top of great characters with interesting dynamics and charged relationships.For example, Scott as a leader of a team would have had INCREDIBLE conflict in confronting Phoenix, for obvious reasons. There could have been some conflict between Wolverine as a loner and the X-men during its' shakeup. Magneto could have been slightly more than one-dimensional, like he was in the first two films. Rogue could have actually done something. I'm just throwing these out there. Just because the film was ""cool"" doesn't make it good.Take Beast for instance. The film allowed Beast depth: more than one level of character, and (with the exception of some poorly lines included for the benefit of Storm) dialogue that defined him. From an extra-contextual standpoint, they nailed his character from the comic. And that's why he's the best part of the film. It wasn't his being blue that made him interesting, it was his character.One point for nailing Beast, and a point for making some great action sequences. But doing something that the audience already expects you to do doesn't excuse you for discarding anything that would have made the film more than a pulp action flick. A generous 3 out of 10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
858,TheSteak002,*HORRIBLE* Watered down Hollywood garbage,1,26 May 2006,"The first two X-Men movies were tolerable. The characters were cast pretty well, and seeing them in ""action"" made it all worth while. There wasn't very much ""action"" in the first two movies, and none of the mutants really utilized their powers. For a bunch of super powered mutants, the action scenes were pretty lame...In this third film (X3), a lot of the mutants get to use their powers and it looks good on screen. But then ""Hollywood"" makes up their own characters that are completely foreign to the Marvel universe just to fill in plot lines. Then they come up with a ridiculous storyline involving a weapon that turns mutants into humans and it all goes down hill. Then they water down all the mutant's powers to the point that they might as well not even have their powers to begin with.I've read the comics since I was a kid, and always loved the series... The first two X movies were tolerable. But this was just plain terrible. Now I understand the fact that you can't re-use stories from the comics, but the characters and their powers should at least stay true to the comics. The movie seems like it was written by people who know nothing about the comics, and they're just using the character's name and likeness and just making up the rest as they go. (Totally ignoring many of the powers and abilities that make the characters who they are!!!) In a nut shell: Mistake #1 Not allowing people who actually know ANYTHING about the comics to write the screenplay.Mistake #2 Not waiting for Bryan Singer to finish 'Superman'.Mistake #3 Not choosing Joss Whedon to direct X3.Mistake #4 Choosing Bret Rattner to ruin the series.Mistake #5 Making up characters for the sake of the movie.Mistake #6 X-Men 3",X-Men - The Last Stand
859,cwatson8,I enjoyed X Men 3. It's a good start to the summer .,7,28 May 2006,"I enjoyed the movie as did the 6 others who viewed the movie. I did have to throw out all I know about the years of X Men's comic book history and go with the new telling, but that goes back to the first X Men movie. So many characters were introduced and there was more than one story line going on, that easily this movie should have been longer. Finally we saw the power of Storm. She kicked a*s as did Iceman. As was shown in the previous two movies the extent of Mystique and Magneto's powers were favorably shown. I would have liked to have seen more on Colossus. The knocks against the director are overblown. It's a freaking comic book action film and for the most part a fun ride with few dead areas. Last point make sure you stay for the scene after the credits roll.",X-Men - The Last Stand

861,sndrow,X-Men Hollywood style,5,28 May 2006,"As with many in these comments, I have been following the X-Men since childhood. Love the characters, love the story lines, and really enjoyed the previous two movies (of which X2 was the better flick).That brings us to this, mmmmmm, movie. What the Hell were they thinking? This shouldn't have been about making the biggest best explosions. It shouldn't have been about introducting every character in the X-Men comics in 105 mins, ad nauseum, for a cheap ""cool"" effect. Ratner take heed of the following: First off the following from another of the comments is dead on ""It is painfully obvious that Ratner never read X-Men"". Absolutely true, this director came in to make a Rush Hour type crappy movie for a paycheck. At the very least, he has no passion for the X-Men. There was no love of the characters, history, or plot of the comics. I'd be surprised if the dude ever read the books.Secondly, don't take creative license with your audience's childhood memories. And you don't need to ask them what those memories are. Quite simply, the characters should look as they did in the comics, they should have the right powers, and they should follow the proper history.Call me a geek, but 1) Callisto with super speed and Caliban's mutant finding power?, 2) Juggernaut's powers weren't the result of him being a mutant, he just had a pretty mystical jem that gave him his powers. And he was a bad-ass, taking on all the X-Men together, not as a sidekick. Also, Hollywood made hobbits & dwarfs properly scaled, why couldn't J-man have been properly 7ft tall? 3)Jean Grey would have wiped out San Fran, had she lost control of Phoenix, not just a 50 foot section of Alcatraz, and in the books, she wasn't undone by Wolverine, but by her own hand. And these are just the tip of an iceberg of power/storyline flaws.Also, don't kill off or take away powers of main characters that are still alive and kicking in the comics. Professor X, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Mystique, Rogue, c'mon..........tell you what let's kill off Peter Parker in the next Spiderman for comparison. Then we'll have several other main characters lose THEIR powers and, instead of an epic battle, they can have a slap fight, and everyone can go home tired and bruised and with a sense of accomplishment for ruining a movie.Sheesh.........I sincerely thought the end of the movie would include some kind of ""rewind"" scene, where we found out the rest of the movie was a possible future or something from the moment of Jean and Scott's kiss early on, not what they were force feeding us as the X-Men reality (why did Xavier give that look of an accepting smile right before he died, if he didn't know something we didn't?) Finally, the X-Men Marvel Universe is an EPIC storyline. On the scale of the Lord Of the Rings movies. How could you think you could fit this into 105 min? You could have EASILY filled 3 hours with GREAT content that wouldn't have felt so rushed and chopped together. You could have explored various characters more thoroughly, and done them JUSTICE as the fully fleshed out characters they are. Follow the Mutant Registration Act story for a movie, why make up this ""Cure"" farce??? C'mon, you almost had to TRY to screw this series up.All this said, there really were okay pieces/parts of the movie, parts not explored that would have led to a better movie. The Sentinel fight in the danger room, could have led us somewhere, but no (loved the Sentinels in the comics). Angel's part in the movie and becoming an X-man and later ArchAngel/Death for Apocalypse, but no follow up. Rogue fading away was a missed opportunity in her storyline. The special effects were really quite good, and I believed in the powers that were shown. Pyro's fire, Iceman's ice, Storm's storms, etc. Explosions, bridge relocation, etc. were really well done.Wolverine was well done by Hugh Jackman, a great Beast by Kelsey Grammar, Patrick Stewart was dead on as Professor X. Iceman: good, Magneto: great, Mystique: great, Jean Grey: good.Final thoughts: this movie might strike a chord with those uninitiated to the comics and could be enjoyable, but those that love and remember the comic fondly, you might want to reconsider seeing this one. nuf said!",X-Men - The Last Stand
862,yesfan-1,How to ruin a trilogy.,1,25 May 2006,"MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD -Last night I went to watch the German premiere of what I hoped would be the triumphant finale in the X-Men trilogy. I had purposefully ignored all early reviews and news about the film, I didn't even know that Bryan Singer had left the project - believe me, after ten minutes of the movie, I knew he had.I won't bother to go into the story here, as in fact, there are almost five or six story lines from the comics collapsed into this movie, none of them working at all. It almost seems as if three different movies had been made and then just cut together. Jean Grey as Phoenix is so badly developed that it amounts to an insult to any fan of the comic book. During the final battle she just stands around in the background for -literally- twenty minutes until she decides to annihilate San Francisco, obviously for the sole purpose of creating a ""cool"" FX sequence. To see just how much the production team obviously disrespects the intelligence of the audience, watch how day turns to night from one shot to another after Magneto moves the Golden Gate Bridge to Alcatraz. My jaw dropped at witnessing such a massive continuity error.Brett Ratner obviously has no love or respect whatsoever for the comics or even the previous films, as is displayed by the following creative disasters that riddle this movie:Nightcrawler, who was a visually entrancing and emotionally interesting character in the last installment has mysteriously disappeared from the X-Men...Rattner introduces new Mutants left right and center without developing their character or even their motivation one bit - something Singer paid great attention to. The best example is the prison breakout, where Magneto frees Multiple Man and the Juggernaut, both of whom agree to join his cause without even knowing who he is or what his cause is.The costume design of the Juggernaut is indescribably ridiculous and makes every scene featuring him unintentionally funny. Think Hercules meets the Flintstones.Gone is the subtle, inventive dialog from parts 1 and 2. It is replaced by clichéd phrases that are delivered by a visibly unmotivated cast, Hugh Jackman being the best example, a mere shadow of himself. For every funny one-liner in this movie, there are at least ten that will make you wince.Cyclops is killed off like a character from a bad soap opera in the first ten minutes of the movie. It is inexcusable to remove such a vital character in such a disrespectful manner and I feel sorry for James Marsden for having to go out on a whimper like he did.The list goes on and on.This movie is the sudden demise of what Brian Singer turned into one of the great franchises and I can only imagine how he must feel at seeing what the producers are willing to do for a quick buck.Anybody who liked the first two movies, likes the comic book, or has any respect for decent film-making - I ask you to save your ten bucks and not hand it to the makers of what is a failure of character and creativity in every respect.Thanks for reading.",X-Men - The Last Stand

It seemed more raw and intense then the other two because I actually was feeling very sad for many of the characters. They all seemed to be more believable in this one than the other two because they were not as wooden in this one as the other two. I would gladly like to see it again and possibly more than twice because I enjoyed this installment a whole lot more than the other two because the other two seemed too jammed together. I HATE all the bad comments people have been giving this installment, it does not have to be as great as the other two, go and enjoy it anyway despite lack of expectations. I am already awaiting the DVD version of this because I would LOVE to know how they made Storm cloud effects more believable and how they made Wolverines claws more pristine and real looking. I really did enjoy seeing Cyclops (a.k.a James Marsden) back even though he was not in this one very long, I really felt his anger, frustration, sadness and vulnerability all the way to the last scene he is in.

865,julia__Mackenzie,Crash and Burn,1,28 May 2006,"I lined up for half an hour to see X-Men: The Last Stand hoping it would be just as good as X2. I was sorely disappointed...X-3 was possibly the worst movie I've seen in the last couple of years. The effects, of course, were something to be seen. And while in the theater some of the movie was entertaining. But for the most part it was clichéd, dull and completely unfaithful to the last two movies, the characters and the X-Men themselves.The complaints I have about this movie are too numerous to list, but I'll start with the more important ones. For one, the lack of character development in this movie was deplorable. Four of the main, core, most important characters of all time in the X-Men universe are completely disregarded. Scott Summers, one of the leaders of the X-Men is killed off in the first ten minutes. Professor X was killed off subsequently, by Jean Grey, which is implausible and ridiculous considering their relationship. As well, Rogue, yet another core X-Men has a total of five lines, and then the director takes away her power! DEPLORABLE! As well, WHAT HAPPENED TO NIGHTCRAWLER??? A great character was lost, written out of the script because the writers couldn't be bothered to include him.And those are just my character complaints! My story complaints are much deeper. None of the stories were resolved at all! What happened to the blooming romance between Kitty and Bobby? Everything dissolves when Rogue comes back without her powers - which, in itself, is a travesty. As well, Magneto and Mystique (one of the most important characters in all the many years the comics have run) lose their powers.The end of the movie, however, was the most disappointing, and, if I dare say it, ridiculous bits of writing I have ever seen in the cinema. Suddenly everything is good and right. There is no resolution, nothing gets fixed, and yet all of a sudden, everything is bright and cheery; chess in the park, birds in the sky, bright sunlight... The writers are toying with the intellects of everyone in the theater.I beg of everyone who has not yet seen this movie to avoid it! Please don't buy into the dumbing down of the cinema-going public! We deserve better than this - for lack of a more appropriate or more educated way of saying it - PIECE OF *&#%!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!",X-Men - The Last Stand

This movie is why we have X-men origins wolverine and X-men First class instead of just X-men:Attack of the sentinels or whatever.

868,afaithfulday,I miss Bryan Singer,4,29 May 2006,"This film is a perfect case for why Hollywood isn't doing well at the box office. The film takes a franchise of two good films and regurgitates generic Hollywood crap.The dialogue in this film is full of cliché statements, and corny attempts at statements with deep meaning.. The dialogue sounds like the script of a novice, offering nothing to the characters.Another failure of the film is character development. While the comics provide histories for the characters, none is given for the newly introduced characters. The viewer is left to simply accept the character at face value, without any explanation for their character, their history, or their power. Even the developed characters lack any depth of the previous films.Overall the story seems rushed. The director seems to push the film forward through the action and thus the film suffers.

869,dlr_13,Above Average Summer Blockbuster Fare,7,24 May 2006,"In this installment of X-Men, a Mutant X gene suppressor has been devised by a pharmaceutical company, offering it to anyone who wishes to be ""normal"". This sparks Magneto to gather an army in order to destroy the labs and the mutant boy who provided the necessary components to this suppressor. Things are further complicated when Jean Grey returns after her death in X2, becoming something more powerful and far more sinister.The biggest problem with this movie is that there are simply too many characters, thereby not giving enough screen time for each one and leaving too many subplots and individuals underdeveloped. Angel, who seemed to have a fairly sizable role in the trailers didn't do too much in the film. Others like Colossus and Multiple Man didn't really do too much either. However, the principal characters were developed well enough to make this an enjoyable experience. Beast in particular was quite well done, both in dialogue and action sequences (plus it's nice to see Kelsey Grammar away from his character of Frasier Crane). Some of the story lines from the comics had to be tinkered with to avoid too much confusion with the audience (i.e. in the film Juggernaut is an Englishman instead of Professor Xavier's step-brother like in the comics or Jean Grey's Dark Phoenix is supposed to be a result of a combination of her unconsciousness and a cosmic force, not a suppressed personality as explained in the movie). Nevertheless, Ratner and the screenwriters have done a decent enough job to make the movie as coherent as possible and while The Last Stand is not the same calibre as the previous two, it's far better than the blockbusters we've had so far this summer.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Fans of ""Beast"" will be pleased (think Yoda in ""Attack of the Clones""), and the introduction of the character ""Juggernaut"" was better than I could have expected. The special effects were stunning, the emotions were real, but still, the movie fell flat in some ways. Two main problems befell this movie, which ""X2"" had avoided. And here i know that I'm probably being overly critical, but I expect the best from this series. First, most of the one-liners are really really corny and annoying. Second, and of more importance, the plot is rather one-dimensional and small in scope. While ""X2"" had the feeling of building to an apocalyptic ending, this movie feels at best like another installment to the series or (if the producers have been honest in telling us this is the last installment) at worst this movie feels like a rather cheap ending. I would not be in the least surprised if the producers announce in a couple weeks production of the next installment. And there were some other things about this movie that I did not like, but those are such massive spoilers I would rather not say anything.All in all, it is a fine movie and I would recommend it to anyone who had interest in either of the first two.

The Phenix storyline was a disgrace to anyone who has ever read the comic of even see the animated series.No effort whet into making this joke of a movie. One can only assume the shot the entire movie in 2 days and told a bunch of pore school kids to quickly write them a script that kinda made sense but wasn't compulsory.My girlfriend had never read the comic but was still shocked at the lack of substance this 'joke' displayed.

In the end, it's a movie of the week you watch at 4 PM and not the remarkable big screen story of most of its predecessors. Glad I didn't pay to watch this installment.

When I went to see it I thought it would be better than X1 but not as good as X2, but this movie actually makes X2 look like a small budget movie (in a good way).All the actors are terrific, but Ian McKellen and Famke Janssen delivers out of this world acting. All the characters are fun to watch and most of them are given a good moment to shine.The special effect are amazing. The bridge scene and the whole end sequence made my jaw drop to the floor. Also the dark Phoenix is one scary woman.Another thing that makes this movie shine is the emotional stuff. This movie really has heart. The Wolverine/Jean story is heartbreaking. The last scene between Jean and Logan made me teary-eyed.But the movie is not without it's flaws. Some of the mutants are given way little to do. Characters like Arclight, Multiple Man, Psylocke and Colossus could have been explored more. Also; it wouldn't hurt the movie if it was a little longer. A couple of scenes with more character development would have been welcome.

874,adamvdm-882-474391,The Spiderman 3 of X-Men,3,14 March 2014,"To prepare for Days of Future Past coming in two months, I bought EVERY SINGLE X-Men movie to watch so that I'd be up to speed for when it hits theaters. A few days ago, I just finished #3. What the actual and incontrovertible hell happened?! Now let me make it clear why I'm so angry with this film. The acting and cinematography was all well and good. When you have Sirs Stewart and Mckellan, you're ALWAYS treated to a good performance. And I felt that Jean going Gollum was an interesting way to provide tension to Logan and the overall story. But my main gripe with this film is the fact that a whole heap of characters are just taken out of the film entirely without the proper set-up or lead-in. I'm not saying killing characters off or having them leave CAN'T work. I'm saying that having Scott killed in about 10 or so minutes since the film begins is way too damn fast. But what I'm MOST upset about is the death scene for Professor X. I can sort of get what they were TRYING to do with it, maybe leave the team in a state of hopelessness so that their comeback will seem all the more better, but like Scott's death, it was done too quickly and didn't fit the pacing AT ALL. How much MORE fitting would it have been if Xaiver lived long enough to chase after Logan when he tries to convince Jean to leave Magneto and come back to him and Xaiver sacrifices himself to save him from a blow that would have killed him? It would show him how attached to Jean he's become to the point where it blinds him from keeping everyone else safe, and has now cost him their resourceful leader. When I first heard that the Professor died, I thought it would happen at the climax, or AT LEAST near the end of it, but as is, it just doesn't flow well in my opinion. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but as useless as Rouge seemed in the first two films, she was pretty much non existent in this one. I can buy that she'd be tempted to use the cure to make her normal. What I CAN'T buy is that she'd be more than willing to just up and leave the people who housed and fed her when she was virtually homeless and not show up again until AFTER the final battle. Oh yeah, the Professor's dead and Magneto's raising a mutant army to eventually take over the world, but who cares about any of THAT when I can finally touch my boyfriend without gloves? And in her place, we get Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. No offense to her acting, I'm sure she's wonderful, but she's always been a BACKGROUND character at best for the first two movies. Those watching the films without reading the comics or watching the shows know NOTHING about her. So why the hell would you switch out a character we've known for years and can relate so well to with one that we've never heard utter a word until now?! And I hear she's set to have a much BIGGER role in Days of Future Past. It had BETTER be good.Bottom line, it wasn't TERRIBLE, but it should have been SO MUCH better. And fans should thank Odin that Bryan Singer is back in the director's chair for Days of Future Past. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to watch the theatrical debut of will.i.am.

875,jamasian_man,"Different, but pretty good",7,7 June 2006,"I saw a viewing of X-Men: The Last Stand the day after it came out. I must say, that it lived up to my expectations. Most people say that Brett Ratner ruined the series by making this movie. They are wrong. If people actually watch and learn, there is a moral in this movie. The plot of the third movie is that there is a ""cure"" for mutancy. Some mutants rejoice and take the cure willingly, others are outraged and want to destroy it. If you had mutant abilities that made you different, would you really want to take away what made you different? The other aspects make this movie enjoyable. There is not a lot of character development, as lots of new characters are put in and some characters are drastically underused. Even though this movie was not as good as the second one, it is worth seeing.*** out of ****",X-Men - The Last Stand
876,horsecrazy1789,"Must see, but don't expect too much",6,31 May 2006,"Overall, this movie is very action packed and great with graphics. However, it is lacking. It's lacking in character development and overall story plot-line. Rogue, she's been there through it all, but you only see her in the beginning and briefly at the end. Her story had a lot they could have done more with, such as her boyfriend acting very close to Kitty Pryde, the cure, and the battles. Warren Worthington III/Angel, i understand why he was there, but why wasn't he used more? You see him as a kid, then nearly getting the cure, going to the ""school"", and saving his father. that's really it. no character development to really get attached to him. Other plot-line problems include the vagueness of Jean/Pheonix and the sudden deaths of main characters right off in the beginning. The storyline had a lot of potential, and they just didn't use all of it.I do still think this movie is a must see, though I must forewarn you not to have high expectations. And also, stick around for after the credits, there is a must see scene that HOPEFULLY means more x men!",X-Men - The Last Stand
877,LokiWasAnAmateur,"Who are you, and why are you here?",2,13 October 2006,"How can I communicate all of the things that went wrong with this movie? The first two installments, while not necessarily very faithful to the comic books story lines they were supposed to reflect, told a pretty decent story from beginning to end. We knew who each character was. We knew their relationship to virtually every other character. We knew what drove them to do what they did, and with whom they were aligned.These things, both incredibly basic and absolutely essential to screen writing, are inexcusably missing from this installment.Juggernaut, Multiple Man, Arc Light, Callisto, Colossus, Angel, Beast... who are they?Juggernaut is Professor X's jealous step-brother who stumbled upon an ancient magical power, and is immune to psychic attacks.Multiple Man is a former member of a superHERO team (I forget if he was X-Factor or X-Force).Callisto is a mutant whose power, appearance and dispostion force her into a subterrainean existence, rife with its own political implications of intra-class warfare. Arc Light, subsequently, is more or less a face in Callisto's crowd.Colossus is a Soviet refugee who fled Russia with his sister Ilyana to find a better life for her, and finds it with Professor X.Angel is an ORIGINAL x-man whose overbearing rich father made life a living hell for the would-be Long Island playboy. As if this isn't bad enough, he's eventually kidnapped by Apocalypse, his wings turned metal and skin turned a light blue... a reflection of the Apocalypse's evil taint.Beast, another ORIGINAL x-man, is a former high-school football star whose desire to become human was so great that he conducted an experiment to rid himself of mutantism, only to have said experiment backfire and warp his appearance irreversibly.There, I think I've just about covered it. Why did I do this? Because there's absolutely NO MENTION of any of these rich and fleshed-out backstories at all in X-3, and people not familiar with the comic book would have no clue about any of this without the aforementioned crash course.This film makes a grievous error: squeezing in a bunch of fanboy material alien to mainstream movie-going audiences, without actually following through on the development of that material, which loses the fanboy audience, too. The result? Nobody's happy but Brett ""can't-find-a-style"" Rattner.My point is that every character that appeared in this movie, with maybe one or two exceptions, has a well-developed and complex story in the comic book. It's not as if there wasn't a wealth of material to draw upon.But enough complaining, it's time to suggest what could have been done to improve this film... Drum roll... CUT HALF THE CHARACTERS OUT!!! Seriously, if you don't have the time to present all your material well, then cut some of what you decide to present! Suggestions:Multiple Man served one disgustingly contrived purpose: use his power to fake high numbers. CUT!Juggernaut did nothing. Period. His purpose seemed to be attempting a lame summer-movie quote, ""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"" (I won't even go into why that's totally inappropriate for the character to begin with). CUT!Angel... How to begin? There was a perfect opportunity to bring into Xavier's school. Squandered... why? CUT!Arc Light & Callisto effectively exist so that we can see some ""kewl powerz"" on screen. We're supposed to ignore that Magneto never actually proves himself to them, or gives them a reason to come out of hiding.The problem with Colossus is very basic: either expand his role (his friendship with Nightcrawler and Wolverine for example), or just let him go. The ""fastball special"" Colossus-Wolvie maneuver is not so groundbreaking that it warrants a completely arbitrary character.I could continue, but I think you get the point.Shame on you, Avi Arad. Shame on you, Brett Rattner. And shame on any comic OR cinema fan who lets the inappropriately ""dazzling"" effects distract from the fact that this simply is a bad, bad movie.The Dark Phoenix saga should not have been used to throw a bunch of meaningless, underdeveloped drivel onto the screen. If anything, this was the prime opportunity to expand on the character development begun in the first two editions.Please... save your eyes. Avoid this movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
878,Dart_Adams,"So...where are the X Men? This IS an X Men movie, right?",2,18 October 2006,"******SPOILER ALERT******SPOILER ALERT********As an adult who grew up reading the X Men comic book and the many subsequent spinoffs but only read them from time to time from 1993 on, let me just say that the two men that wrote this flaming turd of a movie need to never handle other comic book adaptation again. They took one of the most well written and ambitious comic books ever made and turned it into a Nickelodeon movie. First problem, the arrangement of mutants was horrible. The mix of 1960's/1970's/1990's mutants was annoying. Having Iceman, Rogue and Kitty Pryde all the same age is stupid. Reducing Cyclops (the teams leader) to a nobody with no lines or impact spits on the entire premise of the X Men. Removing Nightcrawler, but adding Angel...just to have him DO NOTHING and say less is frustrating. Since they completely skipped/excluded the New Mutants, Emma Frost, the Hellions, Generation X, Fallen Angels, and key characters like Bishop, Forge, Cable, Gambit, etc. This becomes even more of an exercise in futility.Let's get this straight...Collossus doesn't have a Russian accent? Juggernaut can punch Wolverine REPEATEDLY and not kill him? Juggernaut doesn't know Magneto? Professor X isn't familiar with Juggernaut? HE'S HIS STEPBROTHER!! THEY GREW UP TOGETHER!! Jamie Madrox is 30, but Iceman is 18? (Not to mention that he does NOTHING in the film) When did Juggernaut become a mutant? Who the hell are all of these no name Morlocks? Callisto's powers don't work that way, first of all. WHY WASN'T COLLOSSUS FIGHTING JUGGERNAUT? WHY WAS HE HIDING WHEN MAGNETO WAS SLINGING THE CARS THAT PYRO SET ON FIRE? WHY DIDN'T HE STAY IN ARMORED MODE FOR THE WHOLE FIGHT?Where were all of the damn X Men? Callisto claimed she had 87 Morlocks...Where were all of the damn X Men? They were six of them...SIX? So Jubilee couldn't fight? No Cannonball? Mirage? Wolfsbane? Magik? Karma? Sunspot? Magma? They sure would've helped! So would've Richtor, Skids, Boom Boom and any other of the 50 characters they could've inserted since bets in the X Men Universe are apparently all off! Cypher? Sync? Chamber? Feral? Warpath? Anyone of these mutants were available for usage! I thought I'd see a final battle featuring mutants I was familiar with...WHO THE HELL IS ARCLIGHT ANYWAY? WHO WAS THE DUDE WITH THE PORCUPINE QUILLS? WHO WAS THAT GUY WHO WAS PRODUCING BONE SHARDS WHO FOUGHT WITH WOLVERINE? No Plague? No Sunder? No Masque? No Caliban? Where are all of the classic Morlocks?Aside from the innumerable gaffes in regards to powers (Storm shooting lightning from her hands, etc.) and a HORRIBLE premise and storyline (tired rehashes of old comic book plots that were GOOD in the comic book) the lack of good dialogue annoyed me. Character develop was ZERO. Killing off Professor X, Cyclops, and stripping Mystique of her powers was even dumber. Juggernaut getting knocked unconscious was stupid (he's not a mutant, therefore Leech's power wouldn't affect him). The dumbest things about the X Men movies were how they had a WEALTH of available story lines and characters to choose from and they DROPPED THE BALL THREE TIMES IN A ROW!!! Rogue had no powers and Wolverine was a brooding, 6'3 ladies man who was put in charge of the kids.....NOPE! Bad call. Wolverine would disappear and end up having to take Kitty or Jubilee with him (because they'd follow him or stow away with him 80% of the time). Too many of the dynamics between different X Men was abandoned for over the top special effects...I'd rather read the comic book or watch the cartoon in that case..I WANTED TO SEE A MOVIE.The beginning, middle and end of this movie made me want to strangle the writers of the flaming turd of an X Men movie. G4TV has been making fun of Brett Ratner's X Men 3 for a year now...I finally see why. I was disappointed in the first X Men movie. Disgusted by the 2nd one and I am appalled that this could possibly be worse than Fantastic Four. I gave that a 1 and this wasn't as bad as that so it gets a 2.Let a WRITER who is familiar with the source material make these movies please! I would've made this the best comic book movie adaption ever. I guess all we have to look forward to know is Spider Man 3 or Ghost Rider. One.",X-Men - The Last Stand
879,groovylicious_dude,A studio money-spinner with bite,8,21 May 2007,"A departed fanboy director. A widely reported rush production. And Brett Ratner as replacement director. Things weren't looking good for the third filmic outing of our X-Heroes. Cynics crossed their arms in haughty resignation, while comic geeks vented their outrage in a fittingly Phoenix-inspired display. And yet despite the odds here it is, tipped as the last stand, and the fears of those expecting the worst were perhaps unjustified.Promising more emotional grounding in his instalment, director Ratner managed to pacify the blood-braying fanboys (and girls) still reeling from the sudden departure of fan favourite Singer. A snazzy trailer helped, showcasing some saliva-inducing imagery, and confirming that Ratner was faithfully sticking to Singer's staunch visual style. The question remained, however; could he follow through and create an X adventure worthy of its highly acclaimed predecessors? The surprising answer is yes. And no. Well, sort of. X-Men: The Last Stand is a leaner, more streamlined entry excelling in slick sets, breathtaking action, and top-notch special effects. This is a summer blockbuster to the core, and damn proud of it.Ratner's presence behind the camera is unmistakable, and it is undeniably his crowd-pleasing instincts that steer X3 through the pitfalls of studio money-spinning agendas that surrounded the production. Unleashed on his audience is an infectious enthusiasm for visual spectacle that generates satisfyingly outrageous cinematic results. Not only are we are afforded a spectacular face-off at the Grey residence, but also the stunning sight of the Golden Gate Bridge being magnificently relocated, and a striking finale in which the world is literally turned upside down in an emotional confrontation.This, however, is a film creaking with franchise baggage. The events of not one, but two previous X films bear down on Ratner's film like the fists of Colossus, giving it a somewhat schizophrenic ambiance. The thrill-seeking director clearly struggles to compose X3 as both a sequel and a stand-alone adventure. As a consequence, few actors are given much to work with save the key players, who do what they can with a script that appears in a bit of a hurry. Famke Janssen stands heads above the rest: nothing short of brilliant as the returned Jean Grey (or Dark Phoenix), she portrays just the right amount of inner turmoil, vulnerability and downright creepy-ness to really hit the right notes. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are again the glue that holds everything together, both skilfully communicating the subtle nuances of their characters' complex relationship. Others, like Kelsey Grammar's Beast, and even James Marsden's Cyclops come across as something of an after thought. There's simply too much cast spread much too thinly.The sacrifices extend throughout the rest of the film, too. Those little moments that imbued the other X films with heart and gravity are glaringly absent here; characters rush through expositional speeches, barely pausing for breath before the next explosive encounter. So while the pow-pow-pow approach ensures X3 a vigorous pace that effectively gathers momentum, its resultant whirlwind can tend to sweep over the rest of the film to its own detriment.And when the final credits roll, just how has Ratner done with his last minute leap into the world of X? It's difficult to judge how much tighter his X3 could have been if more time and creative control had been offered to him. The studio leash tightens noticeably as the running time accumulates: the three plot lines each struggle for exposure but none reach an entirely satisfactory conclusion. In the end, Ratner must be commended for crafting a film in a decidedly dubious climate, a film that is not only watchable, but entertaining too. X3 has its shortcomings, but there's more than enough bang for your buck. And of course things are left nicely open for another sequel. Now, where to find a fanboy director to fill those Singer-sized shoes?",X-Men - The Last Stand
880,dustostar,Makes me sad when I think of what could have been,1,25 May 2006,"If Singer was at the helm with this story and this budget, the film would almost certainly have been a lot better.Ratner was desperately trying to cram in so many characters , effects and try to get emotional depth and character driven scenes. He failed at getting the balance right. He took on too much it seems and in a hurry, so this could be released before Superman Returns. Interesting plot developments sprung up then quickly disappeared without going anywhere. As an X men fan,it annoys me to think I could have directed it better- and I've never directed before.Sir Ian, Patrick Picard, Hugh Wolverine were all excellent as expected. The young mutant boy with the 'cure' was great for the part too, and should have featured more. I was genuinely moved when Prof X was killed(and in a very impressive way) much like I was when Data died in the last Star Trek film. But emotional catalysts were few and far between and this is partly why it scored low with me.",X-Men - The Last Stand
881,TheTollTroll,How could any TRUE FAN be disappointed with X 3!?!,10,8 June 2006,"If you are unwilling to accept that Hollywood will always take creative license to a project, than you have already set yourself up for disappointment, X-Men or otherwise. They would like to keep the entire audience guessing what is to come next, only making references to what ""fans"" would already be familiar with( like Morlocks, or Juggernaugt Vs. Wolverine, etc.) but twisting it, in hopes that you too (the fans) will be surprised, or pleased that Hollywood at least included your 'mundane' favorite characters or plot. To achieve a story that can summarize, in the case of the X-men, a fictional world that has spanned over 20 years of development, into a single movie or a series would require some ""healthy"" alterations to already developed, and known plot designs. How could anyone claim that they didn't capture the complete awesome power of the Dark Phoenix? And they used several angles of different character's awareness or powers to set the stage for this being, and everyone else's burden in relation to it. Everyones interaction and relationship development was completely believable and consistent. (As in Eric turning on Mystique when you-know-what happens, and that we aren't done with her yet, also, as she continues to interact as... I'm giving way too much away!)This series has several actors already locked in contracts for 5 movies. Sorry if that's a spoiler (it should be a thriller to a true fan!) In a quintuplet that is being released over several years, you can't get all of your character development in on the first movie, because you want every movie to hint, and fore-shadow to future plot development, ALONG with the character's. I felt the first movie was too forced in character, and story development, and I'm glad they slowed the pace. If you have never been exposed to The Dark Phoenix Saga, The Executioner's Song crossover series, The Rise of Apocalypse, or Cable: The Man From the Future, then sit back, and stop criticizing a story that has yet to be even HALF told! Mark my words, the XMen series will be the greatest comic movie series EVER!",X-Men - The Last Stand
882,flatliner345,Wal-Mart $5.50 Bin,1,28 May 2006,"Having seen the other two X-Men movies I expected this movie to be an awesome action/sci-fi flick. I also expected it to have its heartfelt moments and character depth. Man, was I wrong. This movie has been the worst in the X-Men trilogy. With all of the action in this movie you feel rushed, from scene to scene. For example: You go from Xaiver's Funeral to Iceman and Kitty Pryde Ice skating on the school's fountain, while a jealous Rogue watches from a nearby window. The characters are very cheesy and obviously fake. For example: Wolverine goes from the easily enraged loner, to a calm and calculating people person. Yeah, like that'll ever happen. It actually looked like the actors were doing it for the money, not for the story. Now, I'll admit that if Bryan Singer hadn't given up the job for Superman Returns and the new director had taken out or calmed down some of the action, and added a lot more character depth, It could have been a great movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
883,igjmann,Anyone else think this was only mediocre ? - Mild spoilers!,4,28 May 2006,"Let me just say that if you know nothing about x-men history then this is a nice little action movie. You know the kind the one where you thought it was worth the money spent at the movies/video shop...... however that is pretty much the only good thing I have to say about this film. I mean the first two weren't gr8 but hey this one takes the cake!!!!!!. It tries to do too much with far too many story lines/characters and in the end doesn't actually succeed in doing any of what it sets out to do. New characters are introduced and then given little to zero screen time, which sucks,then other characters vital to the x-men mythology are simply removed from the film altogether, which in my view crushes any chance of a follow on, or spin off!!. Bryan's vision of the x-men was at least fairly close to following the ideas/fundamentals of the originals this one like mentioned b4 takes a giant dump on the lot!!! However the acting was of course gr8 from the cast as normal and had the story been different well i personally would have it enjoyed a whole lot more. Well enough of me, thanks for reading!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
884,sikamikaniko,Dreadful,4,1 June 2006,"If you're on the fence about whether you should see this film or not, here's a shove in the right direction - don't bother. I'll sum it up as neatly as possible: the dialogue was absolute garbage. Dick & Jane books would have made for better script. The CG was so ridiculously ridiculous that the whole picture might as well have been cartoon. Why waste budget on actors if they are only playing such a minor role? The major battle sequence was fought in part by characters that had virtually no development whatsoever. And talk about acting... there was none. Hairy Belly - i mean Halle Berry, wasn't even trying. Or was she? Who can tell? Right from the opening credits - which were an exact replica of the Spiderman sequence - i knew this would be a bumpy ride. Hollywood is going too far with the comic book/sequel/re-make trip that it's on. What's next - He-Man, starring Owen Wilson? Surely they can stuff him into a muscle suit. Long story short - crap.",X-Men - The Last Stand
885,jvpeters,What is everyone's problem with this movie?,10,1 June 2006,"Why do so many people not like this movie? Granted it was rushed and a bit corny, and it might not coexist cooperatively with the comics (i wouldn't know) but X Men: The Last Stand was terrific entertainment! I do not remember a single point during this movie in which i was bored, not one. They fixed all of the problems the second film in the trilogy had. They finally realized Rogue was stupid and she only got about 3 min of screen time, the put the action from X2 on steroids and made it extremely fun to watch. This movie had a few weak points, including the short running time and the soundtrack but that is more than make up for by the ""coolness"" of this movie. All of the acting is better that X2. Storm actually fights instead of just bringing up some fog. Wolverine goes on a rampage in the forest and at the end on Alkatraz instead of just killing like 3 guys in the mansion. And holy crap Jean killed a s*** load of guys. The only problems I had with the characters were that Xavier was knocked off too early and Magneto gets too little screen time, he is one of the most fascinating characters in the other two and this time he is put on the back burner. Beast was also amazingly cool. I really admire this movie for just being entertaining. Too many action movies are trying to be too emotionally involving. This is pure entertainment. One of the best movies of the year, give Brett Ratner a break geezus. 10/10",X-Men - The Last Stand

This film was very good especially for a third installment of the X-men. After reading the book, I went to see the movie. It was so easy to compare. I enjoyed both but I believe that the movie was a lot better. I couldn't believe how great the acting was. Patrick Stewart and Ian Mclellan were perfect as Xavier and Magneto. The Plot this time was better being the entrance of Dark Phoenix. This film was my favorite of the three. Also the number of new mutants made this film enjoyable.

I never was into comic book action but X-men rocked!! I loved Wolverines charm and charisma and the fight between him and Magneto was terrificly staged. So, obviously I couldn't wait to put a fat lady's left nipple in a blender and see X-men 2! But X-men 3 just doesn't live up to the standards of its predecessors. I cannot believe how linear the plot was and how unrealistic it is ( even though its based on a comic ) I expected a lot better, what a disappointment.

Characters are one dimensional and often times their actions make absolutely no sense(for example Angel running away from being ""cured"" in the beginning and then saving the guy who invented it in the end). The writer just seemed lost in the wide variety of really cool characters and the end product turned out to have flat one or even zero dimensional shells.

X - Men: The Last Stand does not follow this whatsoever. I assure you that the film starts with the past and then moves to the future. Key. Prossor Xavier's death and Magneto's humanisation breaks Hollywood's squeaky clean image of not messing with important characters. Furthermore, the acting although not superb with Ian McKellen's predictable characterisation, and a somewhat embarrassing Vinnie Jones appearance the rest of the cast gleamed superbly. Halle Berry's rassy can be long forgotten. The smashing plot, special effects rips at your soul and does what so much twenty first entertainment fails to do: understands and then embraces its audience. X - Men The Last Stand does this infallibly, the best film I will see this year, easily, no film will come anywhere near to touching its brilliance.A must see for any human being on the planet.",X-Men - The Last Stand
891,Gohanto,Not Bad. Not Great. Better than expected from Ratner.,6,29 May 2006,"I'll admit I went to this film with lower expectations. I'm a Bryan Singer fan and I wasn't sure what to expect from the man that did Rush Hour and The Family Man. I was impressed though. It was not Singer and shouldn't be taken as trying to be something it's not, but as an action film and (I assume) end of the series it was good.**SPOILERS FROM MOVIE AND EXTRA SCENE AFTER CREDITS** The end is where I ran into trouble with it. I liked how Logan and Jean's relationship was built on passion, hence, she couldn't kill him as he approached. Magneto at the end, however, that just seemed to scream ""LET'S MAKE A SEQUEL"" which I didn't really like. I would have much rather seen that Xavier was alive and then seen Magneto playing chess at the end with him and droping the part about Magneto getting his powers back.",X-Men - The Last Stand
892,RoodyMan,What were they THINKING???!!!,4,30 May 2006,"First of all, I consider myself to be a moderate X-men fan. I've seen almost every cartoon episode, and in fact, even own the majority of them. I also own and play several X-men video games. I've read my share of comic books; I also possess and watch on occasion the first two X-men movies (Which are spectacular by the way). However, this movie came as a major disappointment. A different director, and different writers worked on this film, and it's extremely noticeable. I watched this movie with my friend who knows nothing of X-men besides seeing, and loving, the first two. So there are two prime examples here with the identical opinion that this movie just was not good: my friend, someone with almost no knowledge of X-men, and then myself, someone who loves and posses a vast knowledge of X-men. The entire time we were watching this movie, the same thoughts repeatedly ran through our heads, ""What were they THINKING??!! Why would you do THAT?! This SUCKS! That's STUPID!"" Wolverine, Storm, Magneto, and Jean Gray/Phoenix are really the only mutants who do anything and are actually ""in"" the entire film. Apparently the ""brilliant idea"" to murder off more than half of the other popular mutants in this movie was in high demand. And those mutants who weren't killed were permanently stripped of mutant powers, so in the sense of being mutants, they were ""dead."" You'll read some rather simple-minded fools' opinions that the story was ""good"" or even ""great."" These are lies as well because the story is deduced within the first five minutes with no exciting twists in it. There are some disappointing attempts at ""twists"" which any imbecile could clearly divulge before it occurs. If Angel is a favorite mutant of anyone, don't see this movie for him. Angel seriously has about 10 minutes of screen time, five of which are wasted with him flying happily into the sunset. He fights absolutely no one in the whole movie. Rogue leaves after about 20 minutes into the movie, only to return pointlessly for the last 5 minutes of the movie. Jean Gray's alter ego, Phoenix, is portrayed pathetically ""power-wise"" in visual aspects. Her personality is perfect in my opinion, but her power doesn't actually arise as a fiery phoenix at all (like they left open at the end of X2). Also, she mainly just sits back and watches for the majority of the movie, only to unleash her power at completely senseless times. Juggernaut has a few quick entertaining scenes, but nothing earth-shaking. Beast is a rather dry part in this movie, with a few cool scenes at the end. They apparently tried to sell this film with a star cast and tons of special effects, without actually paying attention to a decent storyline, or to making this movie about mutants besides Wolverine, Storm, Magneto, and Jean Gray/Phoenix. This movie was painful for me to watch, and I felt like I wasted my $8.50 to see it in movie theaters. I'm not saying that you shouldn't at least go out and rent it, but please don't go see it in theaters. X-men fans, and fans of the first two glorious X-men movies will (or at least should) be disgusted with this poor excuse for trilogy end. It reminds me of the other ending trilogy flop movie, The Matrix Revolutions. And if this doesn't turn out to be the last X-men movie, the next one will surely be a disappointment because of this one.",X-Men - The Last Stand
893,zanriel,"Great action, great storytelling, questionable plot decisions.",8,28 May 2006,"A lot of critic's complaints I had heard were about how Rattner was great with action, but weak when it came to handling characters and drama. I have to disagree, I think Rattner got a bum rap there. The storytelling was just fine. You got a good sense of the emotions and struggles the characters were going through without getting too bogged down with drama.This is an action movie. Any decent superhero movie should be primarily an action movie. You don't take a box of tissues to a movie like that. You're there to see stuff get blown up, see explosions, things flying around, etc. You're there for a great ride. X-Men 3 delivers. It's a great ride from start to finish. I do think some of the characters were underutilized, and the movie was too short, but that's not my biggest gripe about the movie.Here goes... I left the theater feeling kind of let down. I think the main thing that nagged at me, and kept me from being totally blown away by this movie, was the story itself. It wasn't the overriding plot of the X-Men vs. The Brotherhood vs. ""everyone else"", or the ""cure for mutation"" thing that bothered me. That was great. It wasn't Jean Grey as Dark Phoenix, and that whole conflict that bothered me. It was what they did with some of the characters.I don't want to give too much away, but basically there were casualties on both sides. Some major characters ended up either killed, or changed, presumably forever. I don't think that should happen, especially not in a movie. I'm there to be entertained, and to feel great at the end. If I'm left feeling disturbed about some of the major plot decisions, then I'm going to hesitate to give a movie high marks when I talk it up to people who haven't seen it.I'll say this though... stay through the credits. It's crucial. The story is not over until the credits are over.",X-Men - The Last Stand
894,mroth14,Am I the only one extremely let down by this movie?,6,7 June 2006,"After I saw the trailer for this movie 3 months before it came out, I couldn't have been more excited to see it. Being a huge X men fan as a kid, I absolutely loved the first two. The cinematography of these films, as well the development of the characters, was excellent. The third installment, however, was substandard. The directors had the wrong idea about how to approach this film. It was basically trying to cram as many mutants into one movie as humanly possible. Sure, there are plenty of cool new mutants such as angel, juggernaut, and phoenix, but none of these characters are developed. I was hoping to see angel really tear some people up but he wasn't in the movie for more than 5 minutes. The action, special effects, and cinematography are also impressive. Also, whats up with magneto's big war plan? He decides to bum rush Alcatraz with absolutely no planning or organization...ridiculous! I do have to say the golden gate bridge scene was by far the best in the movie. This film was anticlimactic and was all muscle and no brains. Overall, this movie did not inspire the nostalgia and excitement I hoped for.",X-Men - The Last Stand
895,mmalariem,What Choice Do We Have?,6,4 June 2006,"I guess I wasn't expecting to see so many changes. While I did enjoy gist of the plot, the shock factor of what was going on internally with my favorite gang of Mutants took away a lot from the movie for me. I don't want to say too much if you haven't seen it already and as far as movies go, it was enjoyable but nothing close to X-Men 1 or 2. The action wasn't as intense or thrilling and I just didn't like all the new plot twist directly involving the internal structure of the crew. (Once you see the movie, you'll know what I mean).On a more upbeat note, I thought Kelsey Grammar's character, Hank McCoy was a welcomed addition (in fact, he should have been around in 1 and 2 if you ask me) and I wished there had been more interaction between him and Wolverine.Magneto was his usual mean self, living up to his bad guy antics.On a whole I'd have to say if you are a X-Men fan you've got to go see this one just on g.p. I mean, what choice do you have? After all this is one that completes the trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
896,microhof,"Melodrama, or mellow drama? And, who cares?",8,30 May 2006,"Finally, something happens.No, seriously. When I think about a world in which an unknown but presumably large number of mutants with these sorts of abilities are running around, I tend to expect a lot would be going on at any given time. In fact, I expect much more than what happens in the first two movies. Finally, after this movie, I wasn't left wondering where all the action was! What do you do when you are working with this many characters in a universe with so many metaphorical possibilities?? Some people seem to be expecting a character study. I argue there are far too many characters to be seen at once here in the X-men universe to accomplish that in a film. Yes, even a 3-part film. Try 40 years of various serial comics, instead.Another approach is for the story to become larger than the characters. Instead, entire groups of characters become single conceptual characters...""good mutants"", ""bad mutants"", ""humans"". A side effect of this are one-liners...you have to fill in more details of each character's feelings yourself in this condensed form. Then, a bigger story can be told. The story of good vs. evil, with a modern nihilistic twist -- which is which?! Really, X3 does the best job I can expect from a short film in trying to meet the problem somewhere in the middle (especially in a universe that begs for jaw-dropping effects). ...Making it the perfect mix for a summer blockbuster. I'll give it an 8 within its own genre because I'm not enough of an X-men fan to know if it's deserving of more but I'm enough of a film fan to know it's deserving of that much.(But most importantly, this movie stars Captain Picard; therefore, it must be seen.)",X-Men - The Last Stand
897,Morpheus-24,"Nice mood, but so many plot threads that half are forgotten",5,27 May 2006,"I liked the movie, but I left the theater feeling slightly cheated. The mutants are cool (all the time - the actors hardly have the chance to breathe for the script's demands on them acting cool from start to end), the design and setting is nice and the acting is good (except for Hale Berry who is just cool. Iceman is rather stuffy too).What irks me is that they start off a lot of plots, and just forgets about them. Another problem is that despite a theme of ""are we really fighting for or against ourselves"" there is virtually no time for uncertainty or doubt - everyone knows what has to be done, and off they go.There are also several slips where wolverine and rouge in particular could be used to great effect to demonstrate conflicting ideals and emotions. I feel that the film could have been used to portray really good in-depth characterization and great moral conflict while still retaining's glitz and tempo, if the director had just dared to do it. And the ""final solution"" to defeat the evil mutants could have been used in wolverine's final moment of truth, couldn't it not?Despite failing to take advantage of the possibilities in the script the film is a good movie, but hardly a masterpiece. The ones before it are better, both of them.",X-Men - The Last Stand
898,mjgeddes,Decent X-Men flick but not as good as 1 or 2,7,25 May 2006,"Fans anxiously await the final installment in the series. The question on everyone's lips: Is it any good? The good news is that it's O.K. It's a reasonably entertaining end to the series with lots of action, spectacular effects and a fun script. Trouble is, it's just not as good as X-Men 2. Or even X-Men 1.The bad news is that there's simply no intelligence in the plot-lines. That's what 1 and 2 had. Intelligent plotting. Here logic seems to have been abandoned in favor of action and effects. Exactly why did Xavier confront Jean Grey in the house alone and why did the house have to go flying? Exactly why in the finale did Magneto have to re-arrange the Golden Gate bridge to get across the water? Surely simply catching a boat would have been easier? And how on Earth could a simple injection cure mutations so quickly and easily? In the end Magneto is reduced to looking like a bumbling klutz in a cape, which he never was. And the supposedly formidable intellect that was Charles Xavier is vanquished earlier in the movie with scarcely a fight. Give us a break! On the other hand the action scenes are spectacular, fun and effective. Jean Grey returns as the Dark Phoenix and she is certainly a very powerful character - the most effective in the movie. The awesome (and outright scary) nature of her powers clearly projects through the screen and into the psyche of the audience. Dark Phoenix rising up from the lake is a sight to behold and it really does appear that she could be the 'next stage' in evolution. We again see plenty of Wolverine and Storm in action and there are some great quips in the script. There's a great Wolverine scene - Wolverine is in his element fighting to get past the sentries in the forest in a covert operation. If one can forgive the woefully silly nature of the finale, it's still great eye-candy, with mutants using their powers in entertaining ways.Entertaining but forgettable action flick and an O.K end to the X-Men series. Nothing more. But nothing less.",X-Men - The Last Stand
899,FortyWatt,Review from a comic fan.,3,30 May 2006,"What can I say about this film? Well to start off there were many, many problems regarding the characters. I know that when a comic goes to the big screen character changes are to be expected. However, this was truly bad. My number one character issue was...JUGGERNAUT: Other than the one-liners this character was ruined, top to bottom. Juggernaut is the type of villain that if done correctly, see the x-men comics for reference, can carry the role of a film's antagonist by himself. It took Spider-Man and X-Factor, together, 3 issues to defeat Juggernaut! Over the top, loud and indestructible. The films Juggernaut managed to ruin everything great about this character. If you are going to put Juggernaut in an X-film you should take the time to do him right. Otherwise, just pick a different villain to use. One major continuity error involving Juggernaut: Juggernaut is NOT mutant! He never has been. They made him a mutant in the movie. If he had not been a mutant, like in the books, the movie would have ended quite differently. Juggernaut also should have been a computer generated character.Halle Berry is the worst thing to happen to comics since The Spider Clones.They introduced MANY new characters, good and bad alike. Multiple-Man, Angel, Marrow, and Beast, among others. Out of the above Beast was the only to receive any good amount of screen time. Like Juggernaut, many of these new characters were fooled with to the point of being unrecognizable, Marrow anyone? If you are going to take the screen time to introduce a slew of new character then take the time to do something with them, this is just bad film making.Likewise, characters who were introduced last movie, Kitty Pride and Collosus, hardly got any screen time. Even though they were both key X-Men at one point.The movie seemed like a giant trailer for the upcoming Wolverine movies. Which pains me to say, being a giant Wolverine fan. Besides Wolverine, Storm was the only other protagonist to get major screen time, and see the Halle Berry issue above.None of the X-Movies were particularly great. But this was the worst. This film fails on so many levels I can't even begin to cover all the problems. If you are a comic-geek, like myself, then you will likely have as many problems with it. If you aren't a comic fan and enjoy action films, then you will probably enjoy it.3 out of 10",X-Men - The Last Stand
900,realest115,x3,10,27 May 2006,"I liked this movie a lot. I felt that every scene worked up toward the end of the movie, the fight scene. The story was very compelling, i felt the emotions the mutants and humans went through, should i take the cure? or Should i be proud of my differences? Are mutants a threat? and others, and I understood the motives behind what happened. Angel's dad creates a cure to cure his son, magneto hears about the cure and is outraged and plans to stop this from continuing, and the x-men try to stop magneto to help protect the humans. The x-men never planned to attack or fight, but in the end they had no choice but to protect the humans and everyone's freedom. Without the two first deaths in the movie, there would be no emotion, it would just be the usual x-men trying to save the day, but this time the remaining x-men (who are unprepared for a battle) have to step up to fight for mutant rights and human safety. With problems such as changing directors and time issues, this movie was pieced together pretty well and it does feel like the end of a trilogy, it provides us with a sense of closure; but hopefully not the end of the x-men movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
901,MatMcCormick,it sucked,4,4 June 2006,"this movie was the worst out of the x men series! the acting was good, but the story line and plot were awful!! i thought i was gonna blow when they killed off the professor! The director was so played by the stuff. anyway, there were some good parts of the movie like the end where they did the last fight and all the fight scenes were good and all. I just thought that they should have at leats made the story like the other x men. i personally like the part where hugh jackman and femke were in the lab... ohhhh lalala. he he. no but sereiosly i like all the fights and bad language.

The characters were played nicely by the actors.Famke Janssen played the newly arisen Jean Grey very effectively.Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry were good too. There were a lot of characters with small but significant roles. The death scenes were subtle but effective.

903,the_evil_monkey-1,Magneto Was Right!,9,22 May 2006,"I attended a charity preview screening of X-Men: The Last Stand for the Bone Marrow Doner Institute at Greater Union in Melbourne on the 22nd May. The film was about the resurrection of Jean Grey, now known as Dark Phoenix, being used by Magneto as a weapon against the government who wanted to cure mutants.I was extremely impressed with the amount of new mutants in this film, which included Beast (A brilliant Kelsey Grammar, one of the highlights of the film) Juggernaut (Brilliant Casting), Psylocke, Multiple Man, Angel (Under used), Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat and Colossus. The effects were brilliant, however the deaths of two main characters was a bit of a shock, as was a two popular mutants losing their mutancy. And yes, the Danger Room makes an appearance. Now to clear something up for all the fans. SENTINLES. The rumors are true. At our screening, two actors from the film attended. See this film whether your a Marvel Fan, or just looking for a good, fun ride. The last shot hinted the coming of another film!",X-Men - The Last Stand
904,smwance,"Wow, just not good at all",3,28 May 2006,"So much potential in this third installment, yet such a poor follow through. I'm glad they got a little brave with some of the themes and characters, but that's not enough. The first two movies offered a great sense of heart and care. They told stories without being so amazingly self-conscious about ""going over the top"" to impress the audience. This one suffered like so many other good concepts by being put in the hands of someone who can offer an entertaining story, but doesn't know how to tell a story. There's convoluted plot changes, unnecessary scenes, major plot holes and dialogue that is unbearably awkward and campy. I can only hope that if they do another movie, it's placed in the hands of a true artist and not another Hollywood hack like Ratner.",X-Men - The Last Stand
905,hitman7000,NOT a great effort,5,30 May 2006,"Let me start off by saying I'm a HUGE X-men fan. I know quite a bit of the history of the comic book and the mythology/evolution of the characters.What I saw, was nothing short of a Director that didn't seem to have any earthly idea of any of the aforementioned dimensions. There are nagging things that will drive the die hard fans nuts. The casual fans will likely be confused and disheartened by some of the occurrences. The action fans, they will be appeased.(SPOILER ALERT SKIP PARAGRAPH IF YOU WISH TO BE SURPRISED) I'll say this, the premise, action and acting were all good. However, the movie was held back by the deaths of Cyclops, Professor X and ultimately Jean Grey. Say what you will about the characters being the most flat of the characters, but this movie successfully and pointlessly killed the Heart, Mind and Conscience (respectively) of the team. I realize that comic book characters die and get resurrected all the time, but I don't believe this is the case, as they have always been determined to keep this ""realistic."" Add to that the stripping of Rogue, Mystique and MAGNETO's powers and the fans are just left wondering ""why on Earth were you determined to kill the franchise so mercilessly?"" (END OF SPOILERS) We can only hope that if this is not the end, they will do something about the injustices done in this movie. If this truly is the end, it's a shame, and I dearly hope that much like the Superman franchise was resurrected, this one will be too, with this film forgotten. In the end, I think this movie will be attributed to what happens when actors want too much, they ruin movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
906,nathantaylor-1,Lame ending to a trilogy,6,7 June 2006,"On the plus side - good special effects, some really stunning sequences and as always Hugh Jackman is great fun to watch.Sadly, that's really all you get out of this movie. The script is horrible. No, really really horrible and without spoiling anything for anyone, the last line will make your jaw drop. How can one end a trilogy on such a very stupid line? It boggles the mind.I also suspect that at least 45 minutes to an hour of plot were left on the editing room floor. Many characters are introduced and set up to be important and then left out of the major plot, making the story disjointed and abrupt. For anyone who is a fan of superhero movies and the like, the selective use of powers is highly frustrating. Characters just standing around when their power could fix a problem, only to give other characters more screen time. Pointless.Oh wait - another good point about the trilogy is that it's over now.",X-Men - The Last Stand
907,lucho_kb,You have to watch it!,9,26 May 2006,"I think Ratner made what all X-Men fans wanted: an incredible film with most of the characters without making an ""overloaded movie"". It's incredible well filmed, the shootout and photography were great, and the character's performances very good cared. Singer made an amazing job with the two first parts, but The Last Stand was the most difficult challenge for any director for continuing the saga, so Brett Ratner shows us, that he's a very talented director (great job with Red Dragon). The only thing I don't like much in the movie was the extremely short role of Cyclops (played again by James Mardsen)..Cyclops is the X-Men leader people! and it certainly noticed that the actor who played the role, made it short 'cause he was starting to film Superman returns..a shame..

909,mosestheliar,An Average Movie,8,28 May 2006,"This film was merely okay. The action scenes were spectacularly done, and more over, did leave some sense of closure to the franchise. Bu as all movies, there are somethings that did detract from the overall aura of the film. The scripting did seem a little to childish at times and illogical. As an avid fan of the original source (comic book fan), some of the characters acted completely different than their counterpart in the graphic novel. The movie wasn't consistent in lieu of the first two installments, and seemed like a completely separate movie instead of a continuance, but overall was a minor success.The soundtrack was amazingly orchestrated and kept you in the mood through the entire film.The action scenes were jam packed with fighting and destruction, not to mention, it is the X-men. The real treat that made the movie feel a little better was the special ending at the end of the credits (wait for it, it is worth it). Overall, X-Men: The Last Stand is a good attempt to finalize (if they really are going to end the franchise) the series.",X-Men - The Last Stand
910,Gembird22,Good action movie. And that's it,6,26 May 2006,"I really wanted this movie to be amazing. The trailers and promotions looked wonderful, so I saw it at midnight. And the action was good, the movie was fast-paced, but....I love the X-men comic/cartoon/movies because there are so many fun characters with cool powers that I can identify with at least a few. Others are just fun to watch. Where this movie fails, is where it largely cuts the parts of characters who are fun, while giving larger parts to those who are just kind of OK (with the exception of Wolverine).*Spoilers!!* The following mutants have little to no part: Cyclops, Professor X, Rogue, Mystique, Nightcrawler (not even in the movie), Colossus, and Angel, despite his large promotional campaign. I mean, Angel was all over the trailer, and he has his own poster! But he has maybe 10 lines in the movie! I don't have a problem with Cyclops' exit. He was generally dull in the movies. But the others can be amazing if used right! The mutants that have a larger part: Storm, Phoenix, Pyro, Kitty Pryde, Iceman. I left out Wolverine because he was a central character in the first and second movies, so his part may actually be slightly smaller in this one.Storm, despite the larger part (and more powers), is kind of dull. It's kind of sad. She looks good, no doubt, but she's dull.Phoenix could be amazing, but she too has few lines. She just kinda stood around looking wistful when she wasn't flying and obliterating things.Pyro is decent in his teenage-induced fury. But Kitty Pryde and Iceman? Kitty Pryde has not had a large part in the old comics or cartoons, and I think it's because she's not all that exciting. I mean, I'd trade Rogue for Kitty in a split second. I can't believe that she has such a large part in this one. Plus her ""romance"" with Iceman looks inheritedly forced as Kitty looks like she's 10 up against Rogue's 19.Iceman has a decent amount of appearances, but he's not very interesting. He's mostly there for his fight against Pyro.The X-men's popularity is dependant on its characters. There are so many, and so many interesting ones. I think this movie made poor choices when it decided who to give a lot of screen time to and who not to. I'm still confused as to why Angel had such a large part in the previews and hardly anything in the movie. I've been hating the fact Gambit hasn't been in any of the movies, but I think this movie may have been much better if Bryan Singer was still behind the helm.

The marvel films have done a great job in the past of excluding foul language for a laugh but failed in this installment. Overall it was enjoyable but I will have to cleanflix the DVD after I purchase it. Yes I will purchase it because I love the trilogy, therefore I need this movie, but it's going to be the lesser of the three in my opinion.

Feeling wasted money and time to watch x-men III tonight.Based on the x-men I and II, I do not see Magneto and Wolverine are insane killers. The story does not develop well to convince the audience why the small war between mutants and human being is naturally developed and ignited.Jean Grey looks like an usual processed ghost rather Phoenix with dual character inside.

In what is the final movie in the X-men trilogy (Or is it?) we see a change in comparison to the other movies. Although many fans and even more hardcore fans this will be seen as a disappointment, and from their stand point, deservedly so, as the story falls ever so slightly short of the mark. However, if you, like me, wanted to see everyone go at it tooth and nail then your in for a treat, many memorable scenes are found through out although there are some down right stupid mistakes.

If you manage to overlook the little annoyance's throughout the movie however, you probably will enjoy it, for people who are merely here to see the last movie in the trilogy, it is a must see, but for those that like their comic book movies to stay true to the reference material, you will be let down, although the idea, I think, was a nice try.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I was truly bothered when mystique and the professor went; it may be a bold move on the part of the writers but effectively killing off these characters is pure crazy in my mind to any true fan of x-men.It is a shame, and I appreciate you may have another take on this, but this film could have been far better with much better plot line.

916,fcasanover,Why did they have to ruin something that started out GREAT?,1,2 June 2006,"I'm a huge X-Men fan, and have been since I was about five. I thought the first two were awesome, but with Bryan Singer directing, why wouldn't it be. I thought Bret Ratner would do good since I loved the Rush Hour movies, but I'm sorry I thought The Last Stand blew. It was like they all forgot how to act, especially the usually wonderful Hugh Jackman. While the first two didn't exactly follow certain comic story lines, like Magento be able to touch Rogue, Rogue being a member of the Evil Brotherhood, getting her powers from Ms. Marvel, and the relationship between Mystique, Rogue, and Mystique's son Nightcrawler, the story lines were wonderful and you connected with all the characters. The Last Stand, started out with the impression of a movie with great potential, only to flop horribly. Phoenix being a evolution of Jean Grey's telekinetic abilities was fine, because in the newer comics, Phoenix is an evolution not an cosmic entity. If you stay close to the comics, you understand some of the hidden agendas, like Xavier and Scott both being sent to another plane instead of becoming crispy critters, the cure being a huge flop, but if you're not a X-Men comic fan, sorry you're just out of luck for trying to figure out anything that happens, or is implied to happen. What was the deal with all the character/plot changes? Calisto dies? Storm BEATS Calisto, becoming the new leader of the Morlocks, making Calisto her second in command, and the Morlocks....what happened to them? How can you have Calisto and no Morlocks. Spike is a bad guy? Logan Kills him? What? Rogue gets cured? Ummm... she did go and TRY to get cured, but the X-men followed her only to find out that Trask was actually Apocalypse, and I'm not even gonna attempt to explain about Apocalypse. That storyline gets a little long. And the biggest crap-out of the film...WHAT HAPPENED TO PHOENIX!?! All she did was snarl and get black eyed and scorch people. Where was the famous, ""I am PHOENIX!"" Line Jean stats as she envelops herself with flames in the shape of the mythological bird. What happened to her being really powerful and SHOWING IT? All she did was cry and snarl. It was like she had terminal PMS. Hugh Jackman? Did you get hit on the head and loose the capacity to act? You're great, you're SEXY, but you messed up Logan in the end. What was Logan's deal? All he did was walk around with a boner sniffing out Jean with it instead of his nose, and then all you did was boohoo about her when you did find her. Logan's been my favorite character since the beginning. I even named my son Logan. Now it seems I should have named him Girlyman.

Also i thought juggernaut was Xavier's half brother there is no mention of that in the movie.I think they should have let Bryan Singer finish the trilogy because I think he would have let them go out with a major bang.I expected a lot more to finish the trilogy but no i give X3 3 out of 10",X-Men - The Last Stand

Never in my life have I been more disappointed with a movie than X-Men 3. Let's go over the basics, shall we:Acting: Aside from Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, the acting was horrible, not to mention the dialogue, which felt like a cheesy B-movie. Story: Not gonna ruin it, but if you are a comic book fan, or have seen the original cartoon show, I urge you to stay away. Action: The fighting was okay, but there was definitely not enough. Too much talking, not enough fighting, unlike the previous X-Men. Ending (the most important part of movies): If you are gonna call it the last stand, don't leave it open for more movies. Duh!I was extremely disappointed, like I said, and I hope that if they bring it back, they (a) fire the director and bring back the original guy, at least he knew what he was doing. (b) Get rid of Halle Berry, her acting sucks buttermilk out of swamp water. (c) Go with the comic books, please! Anyway, that is my review. I urge you to go watch either Spiderman movie or the first two X-Men. Much better than this slop!",X-Men - The Last Stand
919,flamingapeltd,I cried like a little girl,6,17 June 2006,"I like many was over the moon this film was released and based on the trailers and hype surrounding X Men 3, it looked like a corker of a movie.Don't get me wrong if you like action and great special effects you won't be disappointed. If you are a fan of the comics and could see the potential of the X Men Films as an ongoing issue prepare to be disappointed at some major events that happen within the film.It was a shame that Bryan stinger declined to make this movie, as I am sure he would not have made so many bad decisions with the script. Sadly Brett Ratner the Director brutalised a fantastic franchise in his first attempt.I nearly fell out of my chair in disbelief when Professor Xavier is made into dust by the dark phoenix, poor bloke his eyebrows nearly remove themselves from his face in his hideous death scene. How can you kill off such a key character that is imperative to the continued success of the films? Not only him Cyclops, Jean Gray and other new and interesting characters which were introduced all get the chop, this film had so much potential and a great story line.I walked a way crying like a little girl at the prospect of there not being another X men movie made.I think it will be very difficult to follow on from this film and if they do, I strongly think most hardcore X men fans will find it hard watch without so many key characters.Brett Ratner you have made a lot of fans very unhappy and I am sure you won't be attending any X men events for a while without a good tongue lashing from the real fans.",X-Men - The Last Stand
920,halfpint7722,X-men did it Again for the 3rd time,8,25 June 2006,"With all the new comic book flicks coming out I must say I am happy that the X-men have been able to keep making good entertainment. In the Last Stand each character has time in the spotlight. Although it may fall a little short from the actual comic it is still able to express the moral dilemma's the mutants are facing and basically sticks to the main ideas of the comic.I enjoyed most of the film with excitement until it came to the parts with Jean Grey. Some of her scenes seemed a little drawn out but not to dull.And of course if one was to think about how she is the most powerful mutant then why did she seem more like a follower. Unfortunately, it needed a little more of Jean and a little less of the Phoenix who seemed to be a deer caught in headlights through most of the film until the battle scene at the end. Although it lacked the ability to fully explain the whole Phoenix story hopefully it was just due to editing.I was shocked to see some of the main characters die but that is what makes for good entertainment...not knowing what will happen next. I was impressed with the special effects. The computer graphics didn't seem to take on any hint of animation look alike and the powers displayed by the mutants was amazingly done (just like the X1/X2).I was mostly entertained throughout the movie and did not find myself yawning at all. I watched as the young X-men grew-up to take their proper place among the team. It was thrilling to see the mutants use their gifts more in this movie. It was neat to see the new mutants in this movie too. Such as the Beast and many more. Maybe in the next we can see Gambit. If there is a next???????? Which leaves me to say make sure you wait till the end credits as there is a little surprise for all the X-men fans. So all in all an excellent movie ready to entertain any viewer...well most.",X-Men - The Last Stand
921,cigaart,Worse than expected,5,3 July 2006,"X-1 and X-2 were excellent movies and far better than expected, raising great hopes for the third part. Unfortunately, the producers have clearly run out of ideas and have settled for a film with a bunch of special effects, a crappy plot and failed attempts at shocks and twists by killing off every major character in the lamest fashion. It may entertain you but a fan is going to be majorly disappointed. A lot of main characters including Juggernaut (isnt he supposed to be Xavier's brother or something) have been reduced to sidey losers. Character powers have been shuffled.Angel is completely pointless for the most part. Too many new half-grade mutants are introduced.Jean goes mad for some stupid reasonNightcrawler and other interesting characters from part 2 have completely disappeared.Everybody dies. Magneto and Wolverine live. The last stand indeed.Heck, even X-Men Evolution is way way better than this.",X-Men - The Last Stand
922,mrguy203,"I guess, there's Always hope for Wolverine?",1,27 July 2006,"I don't see how anyone who considers themselves a fan of the first two films or the comics could possibly find this film interesting. The writing is trite and god-awful. Every piece of character development that was established in the first two films was borough to an irrelevant and illogical end. McKellen's Magneto has been abandoned all restraint and comes off as a hackneyed and tired. Besides a completely convoluted plot, actors seem to be bored and look as though they were just passing through for a quick paycheck (which, in fact, most of them were). I guess when Pepper Dennis is canceled after its first season, R.R. will wish Mystique wasn't so quickly written off. Anyway, fun surprises involve an ice-man transformation and limited Beast action. I wonder why they didn't stick to the Dark Phoneix story? Maybe Avi Arad could've answered that if they hadn't fired his sorry ass. (Don't worry, he still gets to screw things up as he's contractually attached to a few more Marvel projects!) In closing, the big winner in all of this is Allan Cumming, who wisely chose to do a revival of 3 Penny Opera instead. See you on Broadway, kids.",X-Men - The Last Stand
923,The_Dooger,worst of the three,2,7 August 2006,"Sloppy plot. Could never get over Frasier Crane as the Beast. (did they ask the writers of Frasier to sit in on the screenplay?) Should have focused more on the real conflict between Storm and Xavier. Horrible choices of secondary villain characters (Jugernaut was cool though). Was I the only one that heard bowling pins when Jugernaut ran through those soldiers at the end fight sequence? Reminds me of Chewbacca doing the Tarzan yell in the last Star Wars film (yes, when he was swinging from a vine...watch it again). X3 was just another rip-off movie of dumb gimmicks, bad action sequences, soft plot lines. Oh yeah, what ever happened to the kid that made Mutants powerless? He seemed to be the central catalyst to the plot. Stan Lee....how could you have signed off on this? It seems to me that you sold out your brilliance. I hope we see a better standard when Spiderman 3 comes out.",X-Men - The Last Stand
924,Craignikko,Get Singer back to change this Turd!,3,9 February 2007,"I first got into X-men after seeing the first film only a couple of months ago and have become a big fan since. It safe to say that Brett Ratner has took a series very well made by Bryan Singer and crapped all over it with his general like for corniness and he has never watched the previous 2 films or red comics in his live. The main problem i have with this film is the cheesy dialogue. stupid plot if there was one and the nasty habit of killing key characters (Cyclops),(Prof X), Jean Grey). Mystique who has been such a key element in the other two films is just abandoned never to be used again. The Dark Pheonix was not Dark Pheonix just an angry looking zombie not the fault of Famkee Jansson tho who i think is a fantastic actress. FOX!! BRING BACK SINGER,HAYTOR AND OTTMAN AND GET THIS FILM REMADE PROPERLY!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
925,Kinetiq,X-men has been mutilated by this finale,1,13 October 2006,"The only way i can express my amount of disappointment in this final stand is by making short and sweet, no sour points about this car crash of a movie! 1-Having an abundant of riches to play with after Bryan Singers accomplished x-men movies, they chose to highlight absolutely nothing of importance other than needless shock deaths which made no sense at all!!! 2-The writers for this movie should be banned from creating scripts for life, as they created a mutated story that was as crap as the new mutants!(with the exception of beast)3-To kill Cyclops in such a way where you feel his death was brushed under the carpet compared to Xaviers death where you see everything!is plain awful and ridiculous. Killing these two key characters was by far the worst part of this dreadful attempt at a superhero movie!4-where the hell is GAMBIT??!!!5- yes this is an action movie, but the characters and dynamic story is what makes x-men so great and it was painful to watch these characters be mutilated by this story!!!In the end this was no last stand, it was a last crouch, a last seat, a last squat in a terrible end to what was and still is a great superhero story even with this attempt to kill the franchise!.",X-Men - The Last Stand
926,haj_17,This was the first movie I was excited to see...It disappointed me terribly.,3,27 May 2006,"I really, really wanted to love this movie. I loved, loved the first two so much. They were well written, directed, acted, and produced. It is so sad how badly this movie compares to those.The story line is just dreadful. Characters are introduced and their purpose is never followed through on. The events that happened to the current characters did not really affect the movie in the way that I think they were going for. The direction and flow of this movie felt so forced. And every single event was so premeditated. I can understand whole heartily why it was an issue for the actors to show up for this third movie. If I had a look at the script as they did, I probably would have wanted to fled as far away as possible from this film too. I'm surprised Stan Lee even put himself in his traditional background cameo role.The only enjoyable thing in this movie is Kelsey Grammar. And it is so sad that this is where his character came into play. I would have enjoyed him so much more earlier in this franchise.What a sad way to most likely end this franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
927,ankur_agarwal_007,X Men- The worst stand,8,29 June 2006,"I went to the theater with high hopes. With the first two movies being so good, there's not much Brett Rattner could do to screw up the franchise. With a lot of buzz building up on the movie, about the Dark Phoenix's resurrection, and a great opening at the US box office, my expectations, obviously were very high.The story is essentially simple. The Human race(aka the government) had come up with a solution to the mutant problem (as they call it). Magneto again on the opposite side to Charles Xavier, with the all powerful Dark Phoenix on his side, and Charles Xavier's forces depleted, both fighting the govt. though in different ways.It looks as if the story was written to accommodate the special effects, and not the other way round as it should have been. The movie is essentially building up to reach the last scene, with things added to reach there. The story lacks the depth and the moments that the first two movies had in abundance. Considering the X-Men movie has been credited much with reinventing the super hero genre, the third movie fails to hold on to the promise. It is a huge let down.It has a few plus points though. Though the special effects are special. Sir Ian McKellen as always is brilliant. He makes the movie worth watching and re-emphasizes the fact that he is one of the best actors of his generation and probably has made Magneto one of the greatest screen villains of all time. Sir Patrick Stewart as always is dependable. Famke Janssen, Hugh Jackmen are good. One of the new characters, Kelsey Grammar as the beast gets a meaningful role and performs well. the other new character 'Angel' has a minuscule rule, and same is the case with Vinnie Jones aka 'The Juggernaut'. An actor of Vinnie Jones caliber is wasted in his oh so small role. Mystique- one of the big attractions of this Francisee has a very small role.On the whole, Brett Ratner disappoints big time and he should stick to his Rush Hour movies. Hopefully Fox wont make the mistake of coming up with a new sequel or even a spin off (read 'Wolverine' or 'Magneto').",X-Men - The Last Stand
928,yokese,Disappointed,5,28 May 2006,"Simply disappointed.Ridicoulus dialogs. Parallel histories that don't match. Ridicoulous mutant characterization without brain. Nonsense main characters decimation. Mutants are there to server the special effects, no to the history. In some moments of the film I felt that I had to run away from the cinema, but I was surrounded by people. After 20-30 minutes I didn't even laugh any of the comic comments of wolverine and company. In other moment I though I entered by mistake to see another Spy Kids films....And people, now you know, rebels mutants are heavies and beggars (why they don't put some Islam's terrorist too?) My god. Does it was so difficult to simply make a correct film to finish the trilogy?At least this nonsense is over....",X-Men - The Last Stand
929,Donna-DD,"Excellent, well done.",9,25 May 2006,"Great entertainment. Initially, I must say, I was a bit scared. Part III, will it be any good? Will they overdo it? But then again I had good hope. And I was not disappointed. The story was good. Famke's acting was delicious, for lack of a better word. I am not her biggest fan, but man, she did great. Thanks for the entertainment Famke. The whole cast was fabulous. It was a bit of a pity to see some of the x-men ""go"" so early in the movie. But the excitement that their goodbye came with was fab. If you enjoy this type of movies. You will definitely enjoy this one. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. (Dare I hope for part IV.......time will tell)",X-Men - The Last Stand

It failed.Being a Singer-fan (I like all the movies he has done) i had expectations on this movie, all be it, they weren't ""Singer""-ish"".So okay, the first 30 minutes where okay. (No mentioning the strangely quick demise of Cyclops). But after the first half our, one liners where becoming more essential than the script, and we are all downhill.I do regret Singer leaving the project, although I can understand him. Superman IS Superman. No matter how cool Wolwerine is, he hardly can topple Superman. (Or maybe he might have, unless Singer hadn't delegated the movie).All in all.

931,Quagmire_,Ratner has no respect for the fans,4,28 May 2006,"X-Men 3 tried to outdo the previous X-Men movies with lots of explosions and action but lacks everything that made the previous two movies and the comic books so special. Comic book fans will clearly see that Ratner has understanding of the characters or the world they live in.The whole movie was doomed from the beginning, Singer left because Fox gave him the bum's treatment and they had to settle for a sub par director. Then they rush to make the movie to beat the release of Superman Returns.I'll admit that the movie does have some entertainment value to it, but people who love the comics and the previous movies will see this as a stain upon the series.Don't bother watching X-Men 3 in the cinema, save the cash for Superman Returns.",X-Men - The Last Stand

X-Men 3 was an excellent movie visually and storyline wise, but being around so many self-described ""Comic book geeks"" they have led me to believe that since they deviated from the original storyline (there's one?) This movie should be blasted. I will not go into spoilers but with the twists and turns this movie took a lot of things were quite different then what should have happened. I enjoyed the movie but was a little unhappy at the fact that in the trailers that were shown on TV, in the movies, and on the internet the one scene I was waiting for was in the beginning and not part of the end. Of course it was Wolverine surrounded by flames trying to light a cigar. (Cool) The absence of the large robots used to subdue mutants was another point that made me unhappy as well. Plus where is Gambit? Go see the movie but wait to buy it when the special edition DVD comes out.",X-Men - The Last Stand
933,shaft226,This movie does no justice to the Dark Phoenix Saga,4,27 August 2008,"After X-men 2, I was excited because the next movie would be about one of the greatest stories in the history of the X-men comic books; The Dark Phoenix Saga. Sadly it was not to be. This movie is a mish mash of crappy stories to attempt to finish the trilogy up in one shot. Plain and simple it just doesn't work. Imagine if the producers took most of the plot from the comic book. Just think of X-men vs the Hellfire club and then possibly the Shi'ar empire. I bet it would have made a hell of a lot more money than this movie did. They could have made the movie better if they allowed Bryan Singer to direct the third film. But they didn't and the final product has the legacy of not being as well made as it should have been.",X-Men - The Last Stand
934,monstermonsters,A Huge Let Down,4,20 October 2009,"After the great X-Men, and the superb X2, fans were left itching for the third movie in the X-Men franchise. Unfortunately, as is the case with so many trilogies, the third movie tends to be the weakest, and X-Men: The Last Stand seems to come off worse than other third entries.The problem with The Last Stand seems to be the treatment of so many of the characters we came to love in the previous outings. Characters seem to be shoved here, there and everywhere, and some are omitted from the story entirely. Notable examples being Rogue, Angel, Magneto's followers and the absent Nightcrawler. Whereas other characters seem to be hogging the limelight for no apparent reason (I'm looking at you Halle Berry) A major flaw that crops up in the movie is that of Jean Gray. Fox were not keen on having a story focus on her, and it shows. After a few key scenes, she is moved into the background, looking stressed and upset, until the conclusion of the movie. It is very obvious that the film makers just did not know what to do with her. There are also far too many unintentional laughs in the movie, as it tries to come across as serious, but just can't pull it off.It is not all bad news though. Ellen Page and Kelsey Grammar prove to be great additions to the cast, and there are a couple of plot twists thrown in early in the movie that are just enough to keep your attention going. But these few positive points can't help the fact that the original X-Men trilogy ended with a whimper.",X-Men - The Last Stand

For some reason, I feel movie makers did not concentrate on the characters in depth. This movie is very fast passed. The movie has too many story lines to follow and does not concentrate on one character.To be quite honest, I was a disappointed on the story line. I was expecting a better story line. I did not appreciate the way they got rid of some characters. Yes, the movie does possess a lot of advantages in special effects, but lacks the compassion that created the X-men.",X-Men - The Last Stand
936,thefatgoaty,Too Much in one Movie,1,21 February 2010,"I really enjoyed X-Men I think it was one of the best super hero movies ever. X2 was pretty good as well. But X-Men 3. Seriously what the f**k happened. This movie suffered from the More is Less factor. The director just tried to hard to put as much stuff in this movie as possible. Too many super heroes were put into this movie and then they tried to make each super hero have a super villain to fight with in the final battle. Another problem I had with this film is that it really did not stay true to the comic. X-Men 1 wasn't that true to the comic but it was a good adaptation and X2 was based on the ""Return to Weapon X"" series. X-Men 3 wasn't based on anything, ""A cure to treat mutations"" Thats not even a clever adaptation. They cured mystique. what the f**k. Another thing. They killed of the main characters at the start. Prof X and Cyclops both died right at the start and were then replaced with Angle who sucks and Beast who is awesome but wasn't portrayed well at all and really should have been in the first movie. Plus where was Nightcrawler. He was in X2 wheres he at now. The whole movie is trying to be unpredictable and its just horrible. Don't watch it.

It is by NO means a 10. There are many numerous problems with this movies. It's not garbage like Batman & Robin, but if you've ever read a comic book, you'll probably hate it just as much.They try and cram so much into this movie, and they waste many valuable characters namely, Angel and Cyclops. Cyclops who has never been used well in these movies is again wasted. Angel was superfluous, seeing as how they could have just inserted ANY mutant into his story arch. The Phoenix storyline was a complete waste. The Phoenix Saga is one of the most successful X-Men Storyline. Hell, the FOX Kids Cartoon gave it more justice than this movie. They could have just done the whole cure thing and called it good. Wolverine is TOO cuddly. And Halle Berry should have never been cast 2 movies ago.It is not ALL negative. Ian McKellen is great as usual. Juggernaut is fun...but looks kinda stupid. And there are few better than Kelsey Grammar to play Beast.If you are a casual fan you're bound to enjoy it.

This movie shows you that great special effects won't make good story. Maybe my expectations were too high after x-men 1 and 2......I really missed character development and the struggles of being a mutant. Moreover, the mutants of the brotherhood were lame, all tattooed and wearing dark clothing. In x-men 1 and 2 each mutant looked different and had their own personality, in this installment there were to many mutants and too little running time.To sum it up I CAN REALLY TELL THAT THERE WAS A CHANGE IN DIRECTOR which is a bad thing.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Because, really, I'm not upset because of changes to the characters. I'm upset because of terrible writing and horrible directing. The characters were flat and one dimensional, the explanations made little to no sense, and there was not the sense of connection between the movie and the audience that there were with the first two films, partly because of the flatness of the characters and partly because of the shortness of the film.***SPOILER*** Perhaps my biggest beef with this film is the death of two main characters. And not necessarily the deaths, but the way the deaths were handled. The audience is not given time to take in the deaths, nor are they given much reason to mourn those who passed on. One character dies in the first twenty minutes of the film, and does not even deserve a death scene. We are only told that the character dies.BOTTOM LINE. Don't see the film.

It was definitely worth watching, and you can't complain of the action scenes. When they mixed in a few funny lines the movie actually becomes pretty fun to watch.

941,harpster_2004,Xcellent movie!! - A fitting end to the X-Men trilogy,8,29 May 2006,"Well, I went into all the X-Men movies with an open mind, and I was fairly surprised at what The Last Stand had to offer. In the third (and possibly final) installment to the X-Men trilogy, a pharmaceutical company has developed a way to ""cure"" mutants. Faced with the possibility of becoming normal again, this generates controversial views within the mutant community. Magneto, leader of the brotherhood, sees this as the humans' opportunity to exterminate his kind. Not only do the X-men have to worry about an impending war, the mysterious resurrection of an old comrade with even stronger powers than before, complicates matters.I have to say that this is a brilliant film that is indeed worth watching. There is a lot more emotion evident in this movie than the previous two. And the action has been terrifically put together, making it an all round decent blockbuster. The only problem with this X-Men movie is the overall time of the movie and, as a result, the usage of characters isn't very good. A lot of the story could of easily been extended to above the 2 hour mark. This fact makes the cut movie rushed somewhat. And as a result, many characters who we would have liked to see a lot more don't get enough screen time.Overall, the film does make up for a lot of its failures with a load f surprises at every turn.

My extreme distaste for this movie lies not in the action, the acting, the costumes or effects. It lies in the SCRIPT! *spoilers begin* I believe that the studio had absolutely NO RIGHT to kill off major characters and completely destroy the character of Jean Grey. Yes, she became temporarily bad in the comics and fight against the x-men but she did NOT murder Professor X and Cyclops! Outrageous! I completely understand that movie adaptations have to be a bit different than their book or comic book sources. No argument there. But I do believe that a movie studio and director have a responsibility to show some respect for the spirit of the source material. Murdering off beloved characters at the hands of another beloved character and leaving it that way was crossing a line. The director didn't even bother to try to explain why she kills cyclops as soon as she meets him.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The film takes a franchise of two good films and regurgitates generic Hollywood crap.The dialogue in this film is full of cliché statements, and corny attempts at statements with deep meaning.. The dialogue sounds like the script of a novice, offering nothing to the characters.Another failure of the film is character development. While the comics provide histories for the characters, none is given for the newly introduced characters. The viewer is left to simply accept the character at face value, without any explanation for their character, their history, or their power. Even the developed characters lack any depth of the previous films.Overall the story seems rushed. The director seems to push the film forward through the action and thus the film suffers.If you like the first two films then I would suggest not seeing this one.

944,stinkycookie116,Worth seeing...,7,28 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand, or more commonly known as X3, is the last movie in the X-Men Trilogy. There are rumours of there being an X4 and X5, with Magneto and Wolverine spin-offs, but for now this is the concluding movie... although the last scene after the credits leaves it open for X4. The story begins a flashback to twenty years ago when Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik/Magneto (Ian McKellen) recruits a young Jean Grey to join their school. As most of you may already know, Erik soon leaves Xavier, and forms the Brotherhood, a group bent on exterminating the human race and establishing mutants as the dominant species. Flash forward to today, and Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden, in a limited role) is still reeling from the death of Jean in X2. He proceeds to visit Alkali Lake, and a resurrected Jean Grey/Phoenix kills him. Xavier senses Cyclops' mortal danger and Jean Grey's psychic powers and sends Ororo Munroe/Storm (Halle Berry) and Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to investigate. They recover an unconscious Jean and bring her back to the X-Mansion. Meanwhile, Worthington Pharmaceutical Comany has invented a ""cure"" for the mutant race, derived from the blood of another mutant called Jimmy/Leech. Among the first to receive the injection is Worthington II's son, Warren Worthington III/Angel (Ben Foster) but he refuses and escapes to the X-Mansion. Back at the X-Mansion, Jean Grey loses control and escapes from the X-Mansion. Magneto, with newly recruited mutants Cain Marko/Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Callisto (Dania Ramirez), Arclight (Omahyra Mota), Kid Omega (Nelson Leung), Multiple Man (Eric Dane), John Allerdyce/Pyro (Aaron Stanford), and Raven Darkholme/Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) recruits Jean and proceeds to storm Worthington Pharmaceuticals and kill Leech. Wolverin and Storm, with the help of Piotr Rasputin/Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat (Ellen Page), and Hank McCoy/Beast (Kelsey Grammar) prepare to take the last stand and defend the humans. First off, I have to say hats off to Brett Ratner. The feel of X3 is very similar if not the same as X1 and X2. There were tense emotional moments, great dialogue, and fantastic action sequences. However, the downfall of the movie comes in the editing. The movie, while having the most complicated plot, is rather short, at a little bit over an hour and a half. With so many new mutants, subplots, and mutant-mutant relationships to explore, it almost lets the audience down simply because it could've been so much more. Directing 9/10, Editing 7/10The special effects was fantastic. Using new sphere technology, they were able to make Xavier and Magneto look twenty years younger. Although it almost gives them a near plastic/computer generated feel, it was as good as any I've ever seen without using makeup. 10/10The acting was again, fantastic, and I dare say the best out of all the comic book movies out there. Eric Bana in Hulk and Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man come second and third. Ian McKellen is menacing as usual, Wolverine is back with a snarl, and newcomers Vinnie Jones and Kelsey Grammar played their roles to a T. The only characters that were mildly disappointing were Colossus and Psylocke, but only because they had very small roles due to time constraints. 10/10Don't let the critics fool you - this is not the best installment, but it's definitely worth the price of admission. Longtime fans may be let down because of the inaccuracies of the characters and plot, but for the average moviegoer it's really minor. Personally, I'm hoping for a Director's Cut of the movie, with new footage. Overall 9/10Easter eggs: - Classic showdowns: Pyro vs. Iceman, Xavier vs. Phoenix, Callisto vs. Storm, Juggernaut vs. Wolverine - Iceman in his full ice form - bonus scene after the credits",X-Men - The Last Stand
945,swagman1uk,"great idea,but should have taken more time --mild spoiler",2,25 January 2007,"In principle,the idea of x men last stand was superb,but to any fan of the original comic book stories,it doesn't stick to facts outlined in their pages,e.g. Jean/Phoenix does not kill any of the X men,and Phoenix/jean grey dies in an intergalactic grudge match with fellow super heroes on another planet in the books. If this was the last stand,where was Nightcrawler,the redeeming qualities were Kelsy Grammar as Hank,Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut(though we didn't find out he was the Professor's half brother),Collossus and the numerous other brotherhood members,also the special effects were second to none,but i think a little more time spent on the story by true fans,would have made it a little more accurate and interesting,i felt that this film was a downer rather than the beginning of the x men/new mutants etc, i would make it again.",X-Men - The Last Stand
946,ukman842002,heartbreaking ...,7,1 June 2006,"I don't really what to say. It is the best of the trilogy or is it the worst? For an x-men fan, the movie will grasp your attention from the very beginning of the movie as it takes back at the very beginning of forming the x-men team. But the way the movie has developed was heartbreaking, specially the way the x-men team was shattered down when phoenix killed Scott and professor Xavier.I think the movie was successful in term of bringing mutant action, more than the previous two films which were concentrated on even driven by the x-men team, the brotherhood and the humans. If you know the mutants from the comic books, the action of this movie will really satisfy your hunger.However, the movie contained a lot of mutants who didn't have any significant role although they were classified as one of the early x-men in the original comics. Angel for example was totally ignored in the movie, is that just a way to attract people to go and watch the movie? Maybe Ratner knew that he didn't do a good job in term of developing the story so he decided to fill the movie with mutants and use extensive visual effects to show them moving around in the movie without really a good role.I would give the movie 7/10 just for how the x-men team stood against the brotherhood, it was really organised, and every member in the team got a part of the action. I really enjoyed the fight in the island.It was sad to see some mutants lose their powers; Mystique and Magneto were powerful together. It's a shame we won't see them again fighting together.",X-Men - The Last Stand
947,Kevbo7,"They go for jugular , and they get there with a big-time body count!",7,26 May 2006,"The movie was enjoyable, and the special effects were great. However, the dialog is weak and characters were shallow. When Brian Singer ran the show his characters were fully developed and believable, despite their fantastic abilities.Xavier, Storm, and even Wolverine sound more like they are delivering lines from a sermon, than lines from an action movie. Magneto and Mystique are entirely too predictable. In addition, anyone expecting to get a creative introduction to The Beast or The Angel will be rather disappointed.In fact, Kelsey Grammar sounds flat and insensitive at times, despite playing the part of one of the most intelligent and sophisticated characters in the Marvel Universe. Ben Foster obviously worked hard to physically prepare for his bare-chested scene as the Angel. But was rewarded with barely a dozen lines in the entire movie.In the last movie Xavier was the most powerful psychic in the world. Since then he has been demoted (along with Magneto) to a Class 3 mutant. In the meantime, Jean Grey became THE only Class 5 mutant in the world, more powerful than the Prof X and Magneto combined.The Phoenix story arc seems to be present only to increase the body count, which it does in graphic and gory ways. It is almost as if the writers were told to define the future of each character in the cast, or kill them off.They list great characters like Omega Red and Psylocke as part of the Full Cast and Crew but they aren't even introduced. Instead they spent time developing 3rd rate characters such as Arclight and Kid Omega. Then there is a great fight sequence between Spike and Wolverine, but the writers don't even introduce us to Spike.All and all there is plenty of entertainment value, good fight scenes, great special effects, and lots of comic relief (in the form of sight gags, verbal jabs, puns) to hold the audience's attention. In general, its a good movie... I have just come to expect more from the X-Men franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
948,goldenrosetuxedo,Awesome,10,2 June 2006,"I haven't seen special effects in a movie that wowed me since I was a kid as this one did last night. I absolutely LOVED this movie. The plot was good, full of ethical choices to be made, and the Phoenix's face when she does her stuff was very creepy---in other words, it was really cool! I didn't like Rogue's decision in the end of the movie, but I still have theories as to how long 'the Cure' lasts. And what a cliffhanger at the end. The Professor must have chosen the lesser of two evils again. And there is no conclusive evidence that says that Scott is dead. One could safely assume that he is, but it would be just like the writers to put a twist on it. I did like Stan Lee's appearance. It was cute.I loved Kelsey Grammar as Beast. I always loved Beast, Storm, and Rogue in the cartoon, and I was not disappointed. Beast was the perfect character here too.You will not be disappointed in seeing this movie. The music was great, the special effects were out of this world amazing, and the story is full of twists, action, and thought-provoking ethics that are great in today's society.A+!!!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
949,bmdevon,Fun summer movie.. good performances.,9,31 May 2006,This is my favorite X-men movie so far. I liked the action as a fan of the comics it's tough to watch in some parts. The movie overall has better pace then the other films imho. I thought as long as you treat the movie as an alternate Xmen universe you will have fun. The What if story lines and the Cameos of other mutants does drive me a little crazy. I think the only place this movie missed was being more loyal to the original IP which was better written. The acting the direction everything else was great I had fun watching it. I think it's a fun summer movie and i'm glad I saw it on the big screen. It's hard to make a film about mumbo jumbo like mutant powers and soap opera story lines. This one does a good job of adding lots of action to make the mumbo jumbo fun.,X-Men - The Last Stand
950,blairco,"Excited going in, disappointed going out.",4,7 March 2007,"There was a lot of anticipation for X-Men 3 after the incredible first two films. Singer had worked his magic and brought a comic book to life in a high-caliber film. Now it was up to Brett Ratner to keep that money-making ball rolling.This film offers you fantastic visuals, a lot of action, and great special effects. Everything looks beautifully done, and it's complemented by watching your favourite characters duke it out as you point at them on screen and say ""I remember you from issue #..."" (though I still have my beef with Vinnie Jones as the Juggernaut). It's great to see them brought to life in such an action-packed movie, though! But watching X-Men 3 did not satisfy me as a follow-up to the previous films or as a closer to its series, and I think it has several fatal flaws. The film feels rather bloated, especially in it's far too short time-frame. It tries to introduce so many characters, and develop so many sub-plots, that it lost precious and limited time that could have been used to focus on the main plot line.The hook from the first two films that made them superior products is that they chose a character to center the films around, decided whose story to tell. The first was Rogue's story, but it built up to Logan's, which was told in X2. X2 built up to Jean Grey's as the Phoenix, but when you watch this one, it's not told at all. Instead, the story bypasses the circumstances and situations surrounding Jean after she disappears following a quite shocking introduction for the majority of the film, only returning when there is more action so that her story is not told at all. No one's story is told specifically, but instead, it tries to focus on many characters, both entirely minor (such as Angel) and major. It makes great use of characters, but not of time - with it's 104 min length, it cannot handle that many plots and side-stories. As a result, the bulk of this film feels bloated and fluffy.There was also one tiny thing that bugged me to death - Storm. If I had to watch her eyes turn white one more time after watching this movie... come on, give us some credit. We know she controls weather! We don't need a huge introduction each time she uses her power.While I didn't like this movie, it was still decent popcorn entertainment. But as a follow-up of the first two, which had the perfect balance between nostalgia, action, and story, this one felt awkward and crowded. It still sits with the other two on my DVD shelf, and I'll watch #4 if it's released, but if it is, I certainly hope they snag Singer again to make an X-Men film worth being alongside other great comic book movies like Spider-Man!",X-Men - The Last Stand
951,levrion,Movie mistakes? (contains spoilers),3,25 May 2006,"This movie kind of made me mad for a couple things that they could have improved on. It seems the director never read an X-Men comic book.1. When was Juggernaut ever a mutant? 2. Where was the Phoenix, all I saw was Famke Janssen with terrible eye makeup to make her look ""evil"". I was really hoping to see the Flames, the bird and everything that made Phoenix, well, Phoenix 3. The dude from Predator who played Mac was in it which was cool. He played Bolivar Trask and Mr. Trask invented the Sentinels, but where were they? I saw the head of a Sentinel in the danger room and that was a major disappointment to me. 4. the only thing I liked was Magneto was getting his powers back at the end and we saw that the mutant ""cure"" is only temporary, even when you have 4 needles sticking out your chest. 5. Scott Summers dying kind of sucked but oh well. 6. Leech from my understanding was really that great. They were going after some kid in Worthingtons Research Facility that basically turned mutants into humans if you stood really close to him, so was killing that kid worth all that effort from Magneto. All in All it was an OK movie, I just wished it had a better script and better special effects. Don't get my wrong the effects were really neat but it lacked a lot of substance.",X-Men - The Last Stand
952,lfweigel88,A Lesson in Destroying the Beautiful,5,27 May 2006,"For a movie I have been waiting for since the marvelous ending of X2: X-Men United, X-Men 3 was a marvelous disappointment. I think the main downfall movie is the operative word ""rush"": the production of the movie was rushed, the plot was rushed, and all our favorite mutants had to work with was the director of the ""RUSH Hour"" franchise.The predictability was a major downfall as well. The opening scene very obviously was a not- so-suspenseful Danger Room sequence, and it didn't get any better from there. Every second of this film I was silently praying that it wasn't going to end up as I had hoped. Unfortunately, it did.The two leads, Storm and Wolverine, had absolutely no chemistry as team leaders. Wolverine completely breaks from his comic book character to become some genial and friendly hero, something he most certainly never was. Storm, who seems to have been stubbornly pushing her way to the front of the line over the past three minutes here, succeeds in showing us that Halle Berry certainly knows dramatic, but not action.It seems as though the writers and Brett Ratner were trying to destroy everything the past two movies had been working for. Professor X mutated into some inaccessible monster who used people just as much as the humans did, Magneto became typecast as a villain almost immediately (thankfully, Ian McKellen managed to salvage some of his role), Rogue lost all of her headstrong attitude and sold herself out for the ""love"" of a boy. Iceman and Shadowcat's love story was pushed to the front in this movie for some reason, and I couldn't have been more disinterested. The Iceman and Rogue dilemma was mildly entertaining and poignant, as they could never touch, but Shadowcat suddenly is thrust upon the viewers as some sort of leading character. So many story lines were put forth, but never sufficiently developed. Angel's story could have been an emotional tale of a youth who refused to give up what made him unique and useful, but the few minutes spent on him were wasted on sappy, melodramatic shots of him soaring over recognizable landmarks. Leach also could have had an interesting character, but his powers were misexplained (he disrupts all energy, not just powers. Juggernaut would have been unaffected and he would not have been able to use a Playstation). I think everyone was expecting Leach's gift to be the final solution, but it was traded instead for a rotating shot of Wolverine's claws buried in Phoenix's chest. And Phoenix...where do I begin. One of the most infamous sagas in the Marvel Universe, and it was written off as insanity. Phoenix was a force to be reckoned with...not just some crazy girl who stood off to the side waiting for her queue.Brett Ratner and his Destructors successfully burnt all bridges. There is no room for a decent sequel now, so this is it. The franchise that made it okay to like comic book movies again is buried in the ashes, and this time no Phoenix will arise to shine her light.",X-Men - The Last Stand
953,lissner,Unsatisfying,4,31 May 2006,"I need to state up front that I am a fan of the first two X-Men flicks, but this one just didn't measure up.The biggest problem is the lack of meat. I don't mean that Wolverine appears sickly, I mean that the story was mostly bones. Interesting, but not nearly as engaging as the first two films.I lost track of all the new characters and story lines. It's harder for me to care about or be interested in characters that have little development. For example, you get a very good history of Wolverine spread out over the first two movies. This enables the viewers to pull for or against the character. In this installment, you get some mild background on the one mutant with the bird wings. Seeee! I don't even remember his name. That was the most for a new character in this movie.It was like eating bad pizza. I mean, I'll eat it and am happy it's at least pizza, but I'll sure complain afterwards because I know it could have been so much better.",X-Men - The Last Stand
954,raccioly,Terrible...,1,26 May 2006,"This movie was a HUGE disappointment. I had high hopes for this one, since the first two were incredibly - and unexpectedly, at least for me - good. This one should've been excellent, if it wasn't for one ""minor"" detail: no Bryan Singer. The guy who gave us good dialogue, believable characters in a fantasy context, and most of all, lots of fun, is gone. We're left with lots of terribly underdeveloped characters, lots of idiotic action scenes and that not-so-nice feeling of having lost some precious minutes that can never be replaced. I know it's just another blockbuster, but the previous ones were so much more... Who knows, maybe it's good that it ended like this - this movie is so bad that I seriously doubt that it'll make enough money for them to even think about making a fourth one. If you liked X-Men and X2, avoid this wreck of a movie at all costs. I'm really sorry I didn't.

955,kerrydale555,The Best Sequel to Any Superhero Movie,10,26 May 2006,"DEAR GOD PEOPLE... X-Men 3, is simply one of, if not THE greatest superhero movie I have ever seen. Everything about the movie - the action, the drama, the complete anger and seemingly rage of the film, and its meanings, are just too great to be ignored. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and Famke Janssen... god. They were absolutely magnificent in every aspect.This movie made me stare in awe, almost CRY, YEAH! CRY, and literally FEEL what the characters felt. Brett Ratner did an excellent job, especially the dramatic scenes. Very effective.The only thing I found 'bad'... bad isn't right... 'un-right' about it, was some people didn't get enough to do (Mystique, Cyclops, Rogue, Angel), and that it was a little rushed at the ending, yet still, it made my heart want to plop out of my chest at the end.Famke has seriously made her characters mark into an image that will be burned in my head for a long time. And Storm.. oh, Storm... Halle actually has a character to play in this one. She was one of the best parts of it, and she played her excellently. If you hated this movie... you need to watch it again. And I hope you all stayed AFTER the credits - it is CERTAIN, they HAVE to have an X4.

While the San Francisco scenes with the Golden Gate Bridge were well done, the lack of a decent story and character treatments ruined what could have been a good film.The Jean Grey story elements were disappointing, as were the few scenes involving Professor X.

This film is exactly the same and I hope they make a 4th and Brett Ratner should be ashamed of himself for this effort. I mean no attempting to develop any characters at all. What was the point of some of the characters as they never really did anything. Angel, Collosus, Rogue, Multiple man, Mystiqe, Charles Xavier, Cyclops all completely pointless and the film could have existed without them. What did they do of any real significance.

961,suoived055-1,Good movie overall (unbiased review),7,30 May 2006,"First off, if you're a hardcore comic book fan (not just familiar with the cartoons), where you know the bios of most, if not all characters inside and out, then you are going to be disappointed at the direction of this movie, otherwise, this is a really good movie.Yes, Brett Ratner is no Bryan Singer, where as Bryan appears to actually care about the history of characters, and attempt at his best to present their history, Brett directs more to a general audience, that is, an audience that is not mostly composed of current/veteran comic book readers. So he's made this movie enjoyable for everyone. Am I disappointed at certain character developments (or lack there of)? Yes. Would I have rather seen this movie separated into two separate movies? Yes. But that does NOT make me regret purchasing the tickets for this movie.Also, I notice from several comments prior to this, an ongoing joke of how this movie's compared to Brett's previous Rush Hour titles. Yes, that does sound funny and disappointing (or just disappointing), but the fact is the Rush Hour titles were also good movies, NOT great, but good enough succeed as an entertaining film.That's my point here, that this movie is NOT A FAILURE. A movie that sucks is a movie that fails to entertain from any aspect. This movie had humor, plenty of action, plenty of eye-candy, and a ""decent"" storyline. This shouldn't be that big of a shock, since the ratio of typical movie watchers to comic book fans is like 10 to 2. Who do you think the studios are going to aim at?If you want a clear example of comic book movies that suck, watch Daredevil (starring Ben Afflek) and Hulk (starring Eric Bana) and come back to this movie. And if those two ""failures"" haven't changed your mind, then watch Captian America (starring Matt Salinger) and have a clear understanding of what a movie that ""sucks"" really is, and if you STILL have yet to tap out, then watch Nick Fury: Agent of Shield (David Hasselhoff) and flat out apologize to Brett even trying to degrade this current blockbuster.Bottom line, don't expect this movie to have striking similarities to any comic books related to the characters, otherwise (especially if you're not comic book savvy), enjoy the movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Ratner I salute you!",10,22 May 2006,"If your like me and never really cared for the so called subtleties and drama of X1 and X2, your gonna love this movies. Don't get me wrong I loved X1 and X2 but not because they were such 'great' movies as many of you claim and certainly not because Singer is such a 'fantastic' director, but because my favorite characters of all time were brought to life. I've seen X1 and X2 a thousand times and I never get tired of it, you know why? Because I love to see my characters, Magneto, Storm, Jean, Icy etc. Despite my unconditional love for these awesome characters, one thing more than anything else annoyed the hell out of me. They were all so damned Weak!, except for magneto. and even wolverine gets his ass kicked so bad. And rogue...?! She might as well be cured because she was introduced as a useless character to begin with. Why the hell is she necessary if she is not the real Rogue with Ms Marvel's powers. As you all know the X-men universe are about Powers not incessant posturing that the previous 2 were about. I wanted to see my X-Men unleashed. Even in X2 when Jean was suppose to show what the phoenix was about Singer held her back. She couldn't even even stop a little missile form hitting the XJet. Well I say HORAAAY! for Ratner because he did them justice. Now I know how my X-Men were meant to exist. Not only are they powerful but now they have a purpose. And even the trailers and TV Spots have more action than X1 and X2 put together........just wait till you see it!!! Its so amazing I couldn't even contain my excitement in the Theatre The only thing I don't really like about this movie is that fact that the feel the need to dispose of certain characters in order to achieve strong emotions. I'm sure they could have come up another way to make the movie more poignant. So in closing...Yes the movie feels rushed, Yes it is short, Yes the story could have been better, Yes some characters could have been more detailed but guess what...This is ten times better than X1 and X2. You finally get to see mutants go crazy and doing something than just show and tell. and when the DVD comes out I will be watching it over and over till I get sick of it.",X-Men - The Last Stand

They killed Xavier, Cyclops, and Jean Grey, then turned Magneto, Rogue, and Mystique into powerless humans. Cyclops didn't even get an on-screen death, and it seems like they killed Xavier and Cyclops simply so Halle Berry could become the new leader of the X-Men. Removing the powers of mutants is also a cop-out, since it takes away a good deal of their struggle that defines them as characters. ""Life's too hard with your mutant lifestyle? Just change!"" With mutants being likened more and more to homosexuals, it's almost admitting that there's something ""wrong"" with both groups that should be cured if it isn't convenient for them. Another cop-out was suggesting that Magneto might get his powers back and Xavier transferred his consciousness into that comatose guy. Lame. If you've got the cahones to kill of a character, stick to your guns and keep them dead. Of course, Marvel's never been too good about keeping heroes in the grave.I'll end on a positive note. There was some awesome action in this movie. Wolverine and Beast did not disappoint, and the acting (by most parties) wasn't abysmal.

965,flatline_HQ,Brett Ratner continues to set the bar for future Marvel comics titles!,9,4 October 2006,"Many will agree that each of the 3 X-Men films are stand alone blockbusters, all evoking the same incredible emotions that the comics have done for years to those that read them.Not to say that Brian Singer didn't do an incredible job directing the first 2, but having him back-out of ""The Last Stand"" may have been the best thing that could happen to the franchise. Brett Ratner provided a fresh new feel for this film while respecting certain things that Singer left in place.One thing that stood out for me was the no-holds-barred dialog; I didn't have the pleasure of seeing it in theaters, but I know for sure the DVD holds nothing back like the first 2 films may have. We owe a huge thank you to Zack Penn and Simon Kimberg for an incredible screenplay that successfully covered a lot of ground for a 104 minute film. I must say that there is no lack of material within the Marvel Universe and certainly not within the world of the X-Men; and those writers made good use of as much as they could without over-indulging.If there was one thing that I would like to see more of, it's the Sentinals. For those who don't know what they are, they are kind of like the Terminator, but they're about 6 stories tall,and are programed by a human government to hunt mutants. Other than that the film itself brings all that one can expect from a Marvel film and more, the DVD itself could have done with some better bonus features, but if the X-Men 1.5 DVD is any indication of what they may have in mind...keep an eye out.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The first story is an inferior version of phoenix,and the second,a mutant kid with the power to negate mutant abilities as area effect around him and a permanent ""cure"" of x like mutations in the form of syringes made from his blood or something.The first story instead of presenting a cosmic force that used to be a human and the events around it,it presents a zombie like jean grey with a haggard face and black eyes switching from silent follower of magneto mode to killing mode or jean to haggard zombie jean and back all the time,inexplicably killing cyclops and professor x and flirting with wolverine.Maybe her enigmatic unintelligible behaviour is because of a higher intellect or being..or because the director and the rest were unable to make intelligent characters.The second story is poorly done with unimpressive and witless plot occurring everywhere.Everybody acts like an idiot.The government leaves the precious kid exposed to magneto and magneto acts like he has an IQ of below 80 by betraying raven for no apparent reason or real gain and making the worst strategic plan for attack in the history of mankind and mutants alike.The thing is retarded.Lets not forget that magneto of the second movie with only a subtle intervention almost killed mankind.So you can't have an imbecile magneto no matter how hard you try to make a movie a pop corn stupidity.We also have angel popping into the story only to try to give the film a not necessary gay rights facet,as the main x-men allusion is first and foremost about individuality and not gay rights or minority rights,(this is my interpretation and I insist,as the x men are not a group of something but a group of not something,gay rights would be a too mundane uninspired and too politically correct shallow wannabe x men interpretation for broad sentimentalism,too conservative compared to individuality)and juggernaut speaking lines from a youtube satirical dubbed cartoon video......Really funny bitch.Your movie has a laugh aspect!!wow,to the point of laughable. The only pluses of the movie are the action and the mass ending fight together with magneto doing a bridge gymnastics thing of extreme proportion.But this cannot compensate for the sheer stupidity of all characters and the shallowness of the movie.IT's a shame as this thing ruined the trilogy.What on earth was bryan singer thinking when he left the project?",X-Men - The Last Stand
967,deejaye_11,not bad at all,9,3 June 2006,"It's one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever watched... Full of action and really worthy of your money... I haven't watched the first 2 movies, but I think, it won't be able to frustrate the avid fans of Xmen..It has lots of scenes that would really thrill you... not only about wars and saving-the-world stuff, but in some ways, it's also emotional... it has some scenes that would make you cry, laugh and afraid... it tackles some topics about family and friendships; how important it is not to be selfish; how to value time, because each moment you miss would mean a lot to the people that would be affected...When I was young, I used to watch its cartoons; my imagination of how Rogue looks like doesn't reach my expectations in the movie, and also, the death of Cyclops disappointed me adding some new characters is pretty much good for making it as one of the box office movies internationally..",X-Men - The Last Stand
968,jordanmc99,Interesting very Interesting!?,9,25 May 2006,"For me as both a film lover and comic lover I have mixed views about the film. As a film lover there is no argument that this is a great movie, entertaining, touching and at some times funny.But as a comic book lover I have many issue's with the film. I have marked this comment with *SPOILERS* so if you haven't seen the film stop reading.My first issue is the death of Scott Summers(Cyclops) so early. Yes I know James Marsden was doing Superman but his character should have had more screen time being a main role in the last two pictures. Second, the death of Professor X, needed to happen, yes, just didn't want it to.Next Magneto getting 'cured' bad twist that wouldn't happen! Even with the tease at the end where the chess piece moves slightly. Also an issue with Mystique and Rogue also getting 'cured'. ROGUE WOULD NOT DO THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!! The new cast holds there own with a few good one liners by Vinnie Jones, yes Vinnie Jones is actually Okay. Kitty (Shadowcat) Hank (Beast) and Piotr (Colossus) are great.Overall, a great ride and sufficient what I think end to the X-men films.",X-Men - The Last Stand
969,RonaldoDerErste,They did everything wrong they could.,4,1 June 2006,"""They did everything wrong they could"", is really the only thing to say about the film.All old characters have been reduced. No new character is really build up. No relationship between characters is drawn in a clear way. Most of the dialogs are trashy. A consistent story is not told, no climax produced, it is just a number of moments that somehow belong together without forming a whole. Some of the powers you can see do not seem very clear, their strength looks more like being a matter of chance than of constance. The film is much less artful than the films before. The camera is used nicely on some shots but misses the focus and perspectives that make the difference between art and craft. Some nice graphical tricks to render the mutant powers are also there, but they are also not focused and so not able to impress the viewer as they could in X1 and X2.Dissatisfaction is left after leaving the film. We were three in the film and after we had left we all said the same. Knowing the original comic or not, we all felt that the story had been killedThe only thing you shouldn't do, even dissatisfied, is to leave the film before the end. And when I say end, I mean end.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I was cheering my heart out. It looked awesome, I thought this would the best X-Men Movie ever. Man, was I wrong.The new director gutted the heart and soul out of these characters. Then Callisto, Angel, Beast, Spike, Juggernaut, and still more were thrown so fast into the mix that I had a hard time to following them all. AND I READ several X-Men titles ever month. The editing of this movie is so chopping, that it can actually cause nausea. Now that is tragic!I can only hope that Singer is free again to helm both the Magneto and Wolverine movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Wonderful emotionlove the metaphors about fear and ignorance, hate and intolerance of human beings against each other. Speaking of ignorance, no one that actually saw this movie could vote it under two stars.Overall, the very best movie of 2006 regardless of genera. This is so gritty, real, and heartfelt that it makes movies like V for Vendetta, Sin City and Constantine look foolish by comparison. X3 even outshines movies like Batman Begins and the original X-Men movie. Do yourself a favor and see this instant classic.",X-Men - The Last Stand
972,thepukingtoad,"Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, you bastards!",3,7 June 2006,"I had such high hopes for this film. Whilst I didn't enjoy X2 as much as its predecessor, it was still a great viewing experience. The characters were lush, the dialog crisp and the story lines immersing. Finally, comic-book movies which weren't overly-corny and unbelievable.Well it's all shot to Hell now. Because of the gentlemen ""writers"" mentioned above, X-Men: The Last Stand was a massive disappointment. These lads poison any movie they touch. The dialog was so clichéd in this movie I was almost brought to the point of tears. I won't go into details, but the lines ""My God, what have I done?"" and ""I won't lie to you..."" are uttered without the slightest hint of apology.I pity the actors, they probably thought they were committing themselves to another fine piece of cinematic experience, but unfortunately my dears, no.I'll finish off with this final bitch: All my girlfriend wanted to see was Hugh Jackman running around and getting sweaty, and even SHE wasn't satisfied.",X-Men - The Last Stand
973,chowb321,so-so,6,7 June 2006,"The X-Man series never really seems to interest me much. Sure the special effects were interesting but for some reason it never caught my attention. For this one, i would count it as an average summer flick, full of fun yet hollow plot. The special effects were great but the story dosn't seem to follow up with the last two. Since they change directors and screen writers, i can't blame them but Fox should have at least waited until singer has finished with superman returns.There were a few new characters but they only have a few minutes of screen time. The ending was a bit rush and it didn't ended the series properly. (Mybe a hint for 4?)Anyway,it isn't a bad film but it isn't good either. See this film if you want some excitement for the summer, but don't buy it unless you're a fan...",X-Men - The Last Stand
974,mrmkjason,"Higher rating than X Men 2, but X Men 2 was far better.",9,5 June 2006,"I give X Men 3 a higher rating than X Men 2, but I liked X Men 2 better.First, the imagery of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (BOEM) as Gothic ""punks"" is a throwback to the eighties punk culture. The less-stylish imagery of the BOEM is predicated more on reality. Still, the useless powers of a porcupine are not good for entertainment. Watching the porcupine mutant flex out his needles in front of Jean Grey's house is humorous. Really, what is he going to do? Spoiler Ahead Secondly, the scene where Wolverine and Storm searched Akalai Lake was eerie. That was a good scene, but it was messed up when Storm cleared the fog and destroyed the ominous look to it. Storm should have not been there to retain the eerie look in that scene. There are instances where certain scenes would work well if certain characteristics of those scenes were retained.Thirdly, my favorite character in the film was, Beast. The Beast played by Kelsey Grammar was very good. The idea of placing a mutant in the President's cabinet was intriguing. I liked all the scenes with Beast, because the scenes were good in dialogue and presentation.Fourthly, the problem with X Men 3 was two main plots and several sub-plots that never inter-connected. The Phoenix story only tangentily touched on the Cure story, but they never connected. These were two parallel plots that should have been two separate movies. The main mutant of X Men 3 should have been Beast, like Nightcrawler in 2 and Rogue in 1. Angel had no suffecient character development and there were several plot holes. Thence, the problem with X Men 3 is that it was trying to be several movies and it failed in that respect.Spoiler Ahead Fifthly, the political issues surrounding the cure were dealt with appropriately. Rogue became cured, so she could have a normal relationship with Iceman. Mystique became cured and was rejected by the anti-human, Magneto.Spoiler Ahead Sixthly, the death scene of Professor X was not very good. For instance, Professor X acts very calm when Jean Grey dissolves him. It appears that Professor X should have been figthing against Jean Grey or at least put up a fight, which he did not do. On the other hand, he did transfer himself to another body at the end credits.Finally, there were positive and negative things about the film that are touched on in other reviews of the film. However, Magneto should have still been put in prison for his crimes. He killed people and with no powers he could be put into a maximum security prison. The ending for Magneto is unrealistic. The first two X Men were based in reality, but X Men 3 went far beyond reality within the confines of the fantasy realm of X Men. The special effects were good and the Danger Room scene was interesting.",X-Men - The Last Stand
975,steven-beckham,Spoof,2,30 May 2006,"X3 is possibly the most disappointing film since Matrix Reloaded. The movie is high on action, but low on plot/character development. The first 90 minutes feel cheap, cheesy, and quickly thrown together, and have some genuinely bad visual effects. There are also several continuity issues that terribly obvious. The final battle between mutants is obviously the only part that was given much effort, and it proves to be the film's only highlight. The effects in this part are top-notch and the action is great, but this serves mostly to remind of how cheap they were for the rest of the movie. Other than the final battle, X3 feels almost like a spoof of the previous two films. This film had the potential to be great... Brett Ratner settled for barely mediocre.",X-Men - The Last Stand
976,ammo325,Excellent Movie. XMen integrity has been maintained,9,26 May 2006,I loved this movie. It had great action and the story line was perfect for the XMen genre. Phoenix was bad ass and seemed unstoppable. Magneto got what he deserved. The Beast was a welcomed character. I always liked him. The one thing that I though was unnecessary was the bridge scene. I would have thought that Magneto would have determined a different way to handle the situation. I cannot wait to see what happened to those that perished in this movie. The nice thing about this movie is it makes you want more!This is obviously another very successful trilogy. Lets hope there is a #4 and soon!I would recommend this to anyone!,X-Men - The Last Stand
977,lopezetta,Loosely Hangs from the Rope..... But Makes It Through,6,26 May 2006,"The night of yesterday my friends and I went to watch the premier of X-Men III in my country at my local theater. I really did have expectations for the film, but after coming through the cinema screening I have mixed feelings that the last X-Men delivery on the silver screen substantially fell flat on one end of the spectrum, though it accomplished several production values.WARNING!! Spoilers ahead. Do not keep on reading past this point, unless you have already seen the movie.The basic problem I have to churn the plot was the lack of confrontation between human and mutant points of view in respect to intolerance and discriminatory species-ism towards each other. The first film established the mutant's community animosity and frustration against human society plagued of hatred, fear, and jealousy, while the second delivery complimented well to portray human's inhumanity and indifference upon confused and withdrawn mutant kin. This is what the second sequel lacks that both sides propose their positive and negative stances on the issue. The humans are depicted one-sided and mostly morally good while divided loyalties centered around the cure separate the mutants into terrorist and conservative factions.Magneto was mostly fundamentalist of his views and manners of action. The scriptwriters flawed him on the Last Stand, as his character opted for brute force and incendiary action, than tactics and ever present conspiracy politics that characterized him in the previous movies.The idea for Phoenix is excellent but poorly executed in X-MEN 3. There's no pacing whatsoever on how Jean gradually transitions into her dark ego or how Phoenix came to be. Phoenix is portrayed as Jean's total loss of control over her powers for attaching herself to desire and only wakes when Jean breaks under severe distress or life-threatening situations.My only complain I have for the CGI effects was that the crew went over the top with Magneto's incident at the Golden Gate. That's much I could not swallow.Despite the film's serious flaws, I applaud the production for having developed the key characters with enough screen time and best visual plus make-up effects in shooting every action sequence. The three characters that out stand the most were Storm, Wolverine, and Beast, and awards should be given to Berry, Jackman, and Grammar to congratulate their respective performances.For the third delivery, Storm was turned into the leader squad for the X-Men team replacing Cyclops. Her attitude changed to take the seriousness of her role and is the first one to voice protest against the cure, defending that mutancy forms part of every mutant's identity. We got to witness the better and temperamental of her in glorious CGI effects and choreographic battles, yet delivering convincing drama during the most obscure times of the movie. She's transformed into the elder sister to guide the young generation of mutants, teaching them to stand fighting, and taking full devotion of the side she chose to stand with. No other actor would be best suited for Wolverine than Jackman himself. The guy assimilates and exudes the wild, feral side of the best known X-Man in Marvel's history and carves it on film with his trademark style. I can feel for Wolverine, as the film portrays his personal tribulations and sense of blame due to Jean's apparent death in the previous film. Yet, Logan strives not to be influenced on which path he chooses to believe is the one right for him. At the end, his character comes face to face between his wild passions and human compassion to make a lifetime choice that will forever scar him. The adamantium rage grows as this sequel progresses; Wolverine fans won't be disappointed as they will be going to see for themselves the full extent of his instinct fury.Kudos I give to Kelsey Grammar whose performance brought to life one of the most charismatic X-Men to my preference, Dr. Hank McCoy or known as the Beast. If Mr. Grammar never ever read the comics his whole life, indeed the man did his homework on the character with an A+. Beast is mannered on his quirks and exudes finesse, always remaining composed. He's a knowledgeable scholar on arts and politics. He's versatile both as a diplomat and as a ring fighter undergoing the stunning acrobatics for which is famous, the same manner that I recalled him from the 1992 animated series. Plus a special thanks goes to the visual department for the coolerrific make-up they apply on Mr. Grammar to transform him into Hank McCoy; this is a Beast that will make fans behold with proud eyes.END of SPOILERS.At first, I thought for blaming Brett Ratner for the lack of plot substance and loose coherence in the film. However, it was the studio that put pressure to stay on schedule and cut short funds for Ratner to pour resources at reworking scenes that went missing plot development. Indeed, this X-MEN was short in comparison to the previous installments, and I think it needed 20-30 minutes of film to properly mature the other characters that held potential and fix the gaping holes in the storyline. Nevertheless, Ratner found the way to pull the movie in one piece without falling apart, though it was shaking due to the loose plot.",X-Men - The Last Stand
978,arkirk,Not as good as x2,5,26 May 2006,"Not as good as it should of been. X-men 3 never builds or has the guts to flesh out its ideas and sub plots. An interesting triangle between Bobby, Rouge and Kitty is set up then never really finished. While there are some decisions and deaths that took some guts the film doesn't explore the affect that those deaths have on the characters in my view. Also the sense of humour that X-men 2 had is gone.One of the films major problems is that there are far too many characters for its pretty short (90mins) running time to cope. This means that characters come and go, some are never fleshed out while others simply disappear. Cyclops, Rouge, Colossus, Mystique even new boy Angel get very little to do and have no impact on the film.Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen all do well with what they have been given. While Halle Berry's plea for more screen time has been answered she is still uninteresting and it has meant that the script is fill of moments where people say how important she is. Aaron Stanford and Shawn Ashmore are solid just a shame their rivalry didn't get more screen time. Kelsey Grammar is good but like other characters his sub plot could have been developed a bit more. Vinnie Jones meanwhile should have been cut he is that bad.The action is a much bigger scale with mutants fighting mutants. The special effects are up to par and the final 20 minutes are awesome. But still can' fix the problems that are before it. X men 3 was always going to be in trouble when Singer left and I can't help but feel that the film's problems are direct result of different directors and their different ideas.",X-Men - The Last Stand
979,finchy4,"Maybe not the best, but really, really good",8,8 June 2006,"I was never a hardcore fan of this series, I caught the first X-men movie at a friend's house when it came out on DVD and I saw the second one in theaters but didn't think it really lived up to the hype. I recently went back and watched the first two and to my amazement, they were much better the second time around. I found myself actually excited for this movie, which is sometimes bad considering your expectations might not be met. All that being said, from the first few minutes of the movie you can definitely tell there's a different director for this movie. I love Bryan Singer, but I'm a bigger DC and Superman guy than I am a Marvel fan, so i'm thrilled X-3 had to get someone else. I think all in all the script was pretty good. There were some surprises and twists that intrigued me and with the amount of money the film is currently grossing, who knows, maybe this won't end a trilogy.

980,clow987,Fun But Rushed,7,21 June 2006,"I was very glad to see the X-Men back in action and the introduction of a few new mutants was a nice touch, especially Kitty and Juggernaut. The only problem I had with the movie was that it was way too rushed so it was hard to feel sad at times when some emotional events occurred when me being a huge X-Men fan should have felt overwhelmed. The film was a bit more darker and lost it's sort of adventurous feeling from the previous two movies. Overall I found the movie to be fun but I wish they would have given everything a bit more time to play-out and make the movie a bit more light hearted. Still a very nice date-movie or just something to watch with friends or family.",X-Men - The Last Stand
981,ThisLifeArtificial,An Opportunity Lost.,1,25 July 2006,"Where did it all go wrong, eh? The X-men movies looked to be the first trilogy to have each succeeding better than the previous. 'X-2' was a vast improvement on the already good 'X-men' which set the precedent and allowed so many other superhero films to be made. Given the characters were developed and three dimensional, the plot lines were already set up and an increased budget, the adaptation of one of the greatest X-men story arcs in a new and interesting way, the entire cast returning, nothing could go wrong, oh but it did.Heres the thing, I wanted to like this film, I really did, I loved the previous two movies and am a total fanboy and when the first few reviews of the film were slightly disappointing, I gladly defended the film and reserved my judgement, refusing to jump on the bandwagon. Of course I had mixed feelings, Bryan Singer, quite possibly one of my favourite directors had left the franchise and his replacement Brett Ratner(best known for the 'Rush Hour' films), hardly filled me with confidence but I was willing to give him a chance. I wish Fox hadn't.Where to start? The plot. Okay, I know the movies shouldn't be exactly like the comics, I'm not complaining, different is good, fresh, new, an adaptation. But it's how it was changed. From early pre-production, we knew the movie would be grounded in reality and the Phoenix arc would be changed to suit this. I had no problems with this however, despite an great turn from Famke Janssen who without a doubt is the saving grace of the film(whenever she is given something to do), the whole Phoenix was little more than a sub-plot, a poorly-written, poorly-explained sub plot. Memo to writers: Unless you are going to do the story some form of justice, don't bother. Phoenix is mute, a bystander in Magneto's war and a total disappointment.The main plot - the cure was a great idea. Sadly it is full of loose plot threads and things are left unexplained. Angel who was widely advertised in promoting the film does absolutely nothing, wasted and the whole relationship with his father underdeveloped. Anna Paquin, the terrific, young actress is relegated to a stupidly, small role. Her character has no development except a self-pitying, selfish woman. The chance of real emotion and dramatic scenes came from her plot, her wanting to finally touch but no. She disappears and another chance of some character development is lost. Sadly Rogue isn't the only character to suffer this fate. James Marsden's Cyclops, may as well not be in the film. Instead to finally being given his chance to shine as an actor and a character, he's is quickly(and poorly) written out. Instead lines and actions that belong to him, the leader of the X-men, are given to Halle Berry(in a remarkably poor performance) and Jackman's Wolverine. The pair basically take over the film, neither character is worthy of the amount of screen time they receive.The good points in the film are few and far between. There is some terrific imagery, the scene of a young Angel, hacking off his wings comes to mind and another featuring Phoenix seductively sitting on a chair while the house comes apart around her. Kelsey Grammar was the only choice as Beast, and subsequently delivers the best performance in the film. Ellen Page is also great as Kitty Pryde but sadly again her role is very under-developed.The most disappointing is the complete disregard of certain characters and their pathos. A classic and popular character like Psylocke is wasted in a small, under-written, cookie-cutter villain role. The fabulous Ian McKellen does his best with the clichéd role of Magneto. Gone is the elegance and developed character, instead a really camp and just poor version of what once was. Stewart's Xavier deserves another mention, very badly-written and nothing at all like the caring father figure we've come to expect. Other special mentions include, the wasted Mystique and the awful, awful performance form Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut. His character is cringe-worthy and delivers nothing but stupid, cheesy one liners reminiscent of Schumaccher's abomination 'Batman and Robin'.So, The Last Stand, one can't really blame Ratner, you feel he tried his best, but he is nowhere near as stylish and experienced director as Singer. He delivers action but there is no heart! But this is partly due to a poorly written script. Moments that should provoke emotion, provoke nothing. We care little for these characters. This is a remarkable feat given how much care I felt for them in the previous film. I get the feeling that the people involved were making a release date instead of a film. The film is not an ensemble picture, it is a vechile to show the 'talents' of Halle Berry and Hugh Jackamn, and to put it bluntly both were disappointing. A totally wasted opportunity.",X-Men - The Last Stand
982,hippo_butt2000,Disappointing...,3,27 May 2006,"Absolutely the worst most disappointing movie ever. I may be sticking my neck out on this one, but it was bad.I am an avid X-Men fan, and I have watched its television series since I was young. Seeing the poster with new characters and mutants in the X3 movie made me jump for joy. But my jumping was shortly let down by the lack of depth in the characters, which is what Marvel comics were famous for. All the new mutants were there just for show, and you never really feel for them.The plot was very boring, in my opinion, and many of the scenes were made just to show off the new 3D effects.The dialogue was terrible. It looked like it was written by a sarcastic teenager, as it sounded like sarcastic comments and half baked jokes being thrown back and forth.The only plus side of the movie was their use of 3D effects. Very realistic and high end.But all in all, a disappointment for all avid X-Men fans, like me. But if you aren't one, you would enjoy it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
983,death_slayer_of_worlds,The ruin of a great series,1,7 June 2006,"First let me say that if this had been a generic action film instead of being associated with the X-Men (and the two great films that precede it) then I may have scored it slightly higher. As all of the elements are there: decent action, dodgy one liners and some interesting characters.However, even for those people who know nothing of X-men other than the previous films this should come as a major disappointment. The series started off by grounding the X-men in the real world and the stories came across being gritty and imaginative, as they were presented in a way that made you believe mutants could live among us. The interaction between mutants and humans was spot on. In this film that is removed as the makers seem to have gone down the same all out comic book style that the Batman films started to suffer from.Gone is any meaningful character development, as all of the new characters are woefully underused and seem like they've been tacked onto the film for no reason. Whereas Storm, who was the weakest character in the previous films, has suddenly been thrust into the limelight and simply comes across as very annoying. The fact that Halle Berry demanded more lines is no excuse, especially when it came at the expense of Nightcrawler who made such a great impact in the second film. As if people go to see an X-men movie for Halle Berry anyway, if anyone should have been dropped it should have been Storm as her character just didn't translate from the page to the screen.The unbelievable leaps the story takes also grate. As even a casual viewer would know that the likelihood of Jean going on a killing spree (especially including Scott and Charles) is slim. So she can't stop herself killing the man she loves and her oldest mentor, but manages to restrain herself from blitzing Wolverine? Any dedicated fan will no doubt realise that major characters tend not to stay dead for long, but that's no help to people approaching the X-men universe for the first time and it just means they would have to create a ludicrous explanation to dig themselves out of a hole they should never have been in.This film suffers from having far too many ideas and characters thrown at it in the hopes they would stick. The script isn't the greatest and the whole thing feels like it his been dumbed down into just another brainless action film. I just got the feeling that unlike the first two films it was made be people who didn't share the viewers passion for the comics and films that had gone before.I recommend re-watching the first two films and pretending this one never happened.",X-Men - The Last Stand
984,big_cjc,disappointed,4,9 June 2006,"Having just watched this movie, I can't believe marvel gave it their approval, I hated the storyline, have the writers and the directors actually read the comics.To kill off Xavier, Cyclop's & Jean Gray is almost unimaginable to fans, and the Phoenix character was totally wasted, as was some of the others, When Juggernaut was released I though, thank god finally were going to see the main story line unfold, as in the comics Juggernaught is pretty much unstoppable except by Xavier, but he becomes a bit part.There are so many holes in this film, I don't know where to start. For one thing, Juggernaught is not a mutant, his powers are magical, so the cure would have no effect and neither would the kid. Logan's powers of regeneration suddenly increase when he fights the Phoenix, in xmen 1 he gets knocked out at the start of the film for about 2 mins through the crash, in the 2nd he's shot in the head, and is also out for about 2 mins, he has the crap blasted out of him by the Phoenix and he regenerates so fast its silly, Xavier is a more powerful telepath than jean Gray or the Phoenix, so really that whole scene should not have happened, Also in the comics Scott and Jeans love for each other overcome the Phoenix, Juggernaut is Xaviers brother.......I could go on.Watching it from a true fans point of view, then it is a terrible film, almost non of the characters have been used properly apart from wolverine, storm and magneto.I am still a little bewildered at what they have done with the characters in this film, especially at their choice of story line, hell you could have had a film just with the x-men battling Juggernaut, another for sinister, another with sentinels, another with apocalypse need I go on.As an action film I would give this 8/10 as an xmen film 2/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
985,jbaseball44,What Happened,4,29 May 2006,"After seeing X-men and X-men 2 i was very excited to see X-men 3 ""the last stand"" because the first 2 were some of my favorite movies. So i caught a midnight showing the night before it was coming out. In front of a sold out house filled with X-men fans the movie tanked.The first problem is Brent Rather(the new director b/c Bryan Singer is doing Superman) has no clue what he is doing. The script was weak and corny, there was almost no new character development and they focus way to much on Jean Grey. Another problem is they kill off Pro.X half way into they movie and they kill off Cyclops within they first 20 minutes. They also take away one of the fans favorite villains in Mystique when she is shot my the ""mutant cure"". What they need to do is get Bryan Singer back for X4, make the movie 20- 30 minutes longer so they can develop the new characters, and get a better script. The one good thing about this movie is the special effects were mesmerizing and the fight scene at the end is very enjoyable.",X-Men - The Last Stand
986,bigbadapplejax,Above average action flick.,6,6 November 2006,"While I admit that X-men has turned out to be a pretty good series in general, I also admit that the films have hardly broken new ground. You take a bunch of super powered freaks and put them up against other super powered freaks. What made X-men different from other comics was the human issue. The mutants at professor X's institute were out casts (Hell, there own parents usually didn't want them) and they typically had to use there powers for the good of mankind, to save the people who loathed them. The problem is, in movie form you're forced to cut down on the plot and put in more action. This tends to cut down what is generally, a layered and deep plot. That tends to be X-3's problem. You see, for ever well choreographed fight scene, we have 20 minutes of Rogue and Ice man sexual frustration. They also go so quickly from these scenes that I felt little towards the characters. I'm also disappointed in the choice of plot for the film. The whole ""birth of the Phoenix"" thing has been DONE TO DEATH. I know I speak for more than one true believer when I say, ENOUGH. I will say though, Bret Ratner didn't muck this up nearly as bad as I thought he would. He tries to go for fan pleasing (In one scene, a open mouthed Stan Lee stares at a floating car. Priceless!). Also, like all of the other X-men movies, the casting is top notch. Jackmen still makes a great Wolverine, Halle Berry is still a good storm, and new-comer Kelsey Grammar even pulls off Beast pretty well. Like I stated in the title, X-3 is a above average action flick with some great fights. If you're looking for the next masterpiece, you'll be sourly disappointed. Good job mister Ratner, see you in X-4?",X-Men - The Last Stand
987,buckmana,This movie seems to break the rules - and not in a good way,5,25 May 2006,"I've just seen X-Men 3 today.Given that the first two was great, I was expecting something even better (X-Men 2 was better than X-Man 1 and I expected X-Men 3 to continue this tradition.I was disappointed.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some of the movie. With a rewrite of half the story, it would have been great.The main problem with this movie is that they're ignoring all the rules that should have been laid out to them by Marvel. Let's start with Phoenix. Although I haven't read the comic, I've done some research on the topic, so my interpretation may be incomplete.In the movie, Phoenix is depicted as the ""evil"" side of Jean Grey's nature. In the comic, Phoenix is an alien energy force that took the form of Jean. In doing so, it replicated all her memories and consequently, it (or she now) came to believe she was Jean. Therefore, Phoenix should have behaved no differently from the real Jean. And it seems like it was a waste of an actress. She just spent most of the movie standing there and being pointed at. At the end of the 2nd movie, it seems like Jean's return is a good thing (even though it's hardly mentioned). In this movie, it's represented as being a bad thing.Two minor aberrations are Leech and Multiple Man. In the movie, Leech's suppression power is uncontrolled. In the comic, he can choose whether or not he projects his power on another mutant. Multiple Man is not a villain in the comic, he's one of the X-Men and somewhere around the age of Iceman and Rogue.Juggernaut is the next problem. In the movie, he's a mutant. In the comic, Juggernaut is not a mutant. He got his power by touching an enchanted gem.And what about Jubilee? She's a major character in the comic version. But (in the last two movies), her material seems to end up on the cutting room floor (I only discovered it by watching the deleted scenes). Why bother filming it at all? And her name is in the credits of this movie, even though I didn't see her. A hint for everyone else, if you see her, she's Chinese.There was a X-Men computer game released that preceded the movie. In the game, Sentinels (mutant killing robots) featured quite heavily. The Supreme Sentinel (known as Master Mold) also made an appearance. He's seen from a distance in the course of the game (and from inside later). He's huge, the size of skyscraper or a city.It was a source of disappointment that these robots only featured in the tiniest way in the movie. You see the eyes, laser beams and the head only. And it's only a simulated one in the Danger Room.The most significant disappointment was that three major characters were killed (Cyclops, Professor X and Jean Grey). You can't do that, no matter what. It's a rule.To me, it looks like because the movie was the last, they didn't bother putting in all the effort they should have. Or maybe someone was using ""dog-in-the-manger"" philosophy. Because it was their last film, they wrote it in such a way that it would be marked in all future versions by what they did in this one. Or maybe they didn't want a sequel at all.It would have been better if they'd taken out the Phoenix stuff (with the exception of her return) and replaced it with a Sentinel storyline instead.It's a fairly horrifying concept that the action scenes are the best part of this movie. The only non-action scene that is good is the ice-skating scene with Iceman and Kitty Pryde.So, my verdict is that it's a good movie as long as you ignore the Phoenix part of the story. Really, it's only half a movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand

989,cmihock-1,god this was horrible,1,28 May 2006,"This movie, is the complete summarization of Brett Ratner as a director. Awful. Brett Ratner must just have a knack for taking something cool and making it completely pointless and awful because this movie was filled with so many plot holes its like they tried to make things have to point. They focused on basically nothing the whole movie, and you were left with nothing to sink your teeth into. It was an hour and forty five minutes of pure agony to the eyes.Some of the visuals were cool but it was definitely not worth destroying any and all plot line. And the acting was just as bad, but the whole movie you could tell it was all because it was Brett Ratner telling them how to act, and since they were purely contractual they (the actors) had to grit their teeth and do what he said. There are absolutely no reasons as to why anyone does anything in this film, and the reactions to what the people do are even worseYou may choose to go see this movie just out of sheer interest to see what all of the fuss is about but please, don't save yourself the time and money.",X-Men - The Last Stand
990,Dexter-Filmore,Deteriorated to a slightly-above-average action movie for tabloid readers,6,31 May 2006,"(Spoilers ahead!) While the movie itself was fun to watch alright it left me with the feeling of something missing. Compared to its predecessors it is a good action movie, but that's about it. While X1 and 2 made good efforts to tune the viewer for the different party's points of view, i.e. how the masses are afraid of the unknown, how fear helps the wrong people seize power and misuse it and weave personal crusades into that story it seems worn out and carelessly rehashed in X3. The Angel character would have deserved a deeper plot, instead we were served a fast food ethics lesson ""dad embarrassed because of mutant son wants cure son gives the finger and rescues dad from villains with the once damned mutant powers"". That boy cutting the wings off his back realizes how it is wrong to fight his nature and that he's been trying to comfort his dad's ego all the time in less than 10 seconds - the character didn't develop during the movie. Talking about villains, Ratner paints a pretty dumb black/white image here. That congregation in the woods looks like most concerts I visited, and instead of Magneto and Xavier forming the light/shadow complement that provides both characters with the necessary reference to each other in the big picture of events, Magneto here is Yet Another Supervillain which for some reason needs to be stopped at all costs for doing.. um, well, something villainous or so. In X1/2 Magneto was usually fighting with the wrong means - but for the right cause. X3 fails to build up this fabric where cause and effect are a carefully balanced whole that Penn/Hayter/Singer only needed to tip at the edges and let it develop in the viewer's head. After all ethics/morale discussion is made obsolete by running the viewer through predefined patterns and paths, still the movie tries to invoke emotions and again doesn't do too well: Most of the interesting characters are killed (or deprived of their mutant nature, which comes down to the same for Mystique for example), some as a surprise to the viewer but quite obviously to evade being predictable (like the Rogue romance, which by the way was the only thing Rogue was good for in X3 - seems like the director lacks imagination to make something out of her).If there's gonna be another sequel, better let someone else write it. 6 instead of 5 out of 10 for fun popcorn cinema and hilarious visual effects, but nowhere near the well deserved 7+ of X-Men and X2.",X-Men - The Last Stand
991,gcerda88,"Movies awesome, first",8,28 May 2006,"The first thing I'd like to say is, in order to understand the movie, you have to have no hype whatsoever. Be and X-men fan, and just enjoy it for what it is. I will explain the movie with no spoilers. So, don't worry people who haven't seen this movie yet.The movie starts off differently, to explain a meaning, very different from the other two. Then the title shows up, which is pretty cool, yet, The Last Stand it is not.The movie has a decent plot. It goes smoothly, then veers off a little, then gets back on track. The plot is indeed in the comics, most of it. One thing we have yet to see is Gambit. No gambit. No spoiler, just going to tell ya. So as it ends, it gets pretty intense and cool. Before you know it, it ends......or does it? After the credits magic happens. If you catch one very important movie, and a Comic book fan, this 30 sec clip after the movie will be a twist. A very big one. No spoiler, just telling ya to see this before you leave. This is vital to see because this will uplift you, astound even. I believe the movie was good, but if you don't like it thats because you don't understand it, haven't seen the last part (you will be very confused and mad if you don't see this, so please see it.), and if you did, and still don't understand it ask me or someone who does understand it.

992,peterdillon52,Not as bad as it sounds!,7,26 May 2006,I thought this would be a lot worse. It looks rubbish well so I thought. I had seen the other two movies but not for a while. I new it would be a typical formula of blasting special effects around a loose story line. (How could it be otherwise) But I enjoyed it. It doesn't weigh up to the Spiderman movies.I love seeing two heavyweight British actors in Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stewart together.This film is great to look at and lots of fun. Typical of the Hollywood sequel formula but full of humour and makes for a great night out to the cinema. I do look forward to seeing some more serious cinema before the end of the year however.Go and see this its just about worth it. Take the family. Yay!!!!,X-Men - The Last Stand
993,feighery,True fans will be sorely disappointed.,1,26 May 2006,"True fans of the X-men will be upset with what the movie industry has done to them. The X-men are corrupted and simplified to please people who have not followed the X-men to this point. In an effort to conclude the trilogy, the writers took every liberty to take the world of the X-men, and destroy it. Leaving the theatre, you will feel robbed of the X-men you have felt comfort with your whole life. The writers felt the need to resolve every plot and every storyline until there was nothing left. The characters were exploited and this movie is a total disappointment. Very few characters are left intact and ultimately, the film ruined what was decently well set up by the first two films.",X-Men - The Last Stand
994,naomi-manuel,"Amazing Action, Poor Plot.",7,26 May 2006,"I have now totally re-edited this comment, as reading other people's comments made me realise how I truly feel about this film. Like thousands of others I was so excited when this film was announced. And like thousands of others I was disappointed with what I witnessed in the cinema. Main reasons listed below:1) The concept of losing three major characters in the first hour seems ridiculous - But losing Cyclops in the first 10 minutes is nothing short of insane! I'm not even a huge fan of Cyclops, but even I recognise that he is (or rather was!) an important character! What were they thinking?2) Introducing new characters is totally acceptable, but introducing about 7 new characters and then giving them about 5 minutes of screen time each is crazy! One of my mates paid £5 for her cinema ticket to see Angel in this film... meaning that it cost her about £1 per minute of Angel screen-time time! Totally underdeveloped characters ruin even the best action films.3) Plot - an important component of any film, right? Apparently not. The plot starts out simple enough: Do they take the ""cure"" for the mutant gene or fight against it? Then it starts unnecessarily complicating itself - Will Jean ever be the same again? Who will be cured against their will? Will they ever actually explain what happened to Cyclops rather that letting us assume he's snuffed it? It would have been better to have just had the main plot line and kept it at that.4) I can honestly say that I would rather that they'd just waited for Bryan Singer to finish his other commitments - I'd have waited another 2 years if necessary, if it meant that at the end of it all we'd have a decent Xmen film, worthy of the glory its two prequels received.After all of that ranting, I'd just like to say though that the acting of the main characters - Hugh Jackman, Sir Ian Mckellen and Halle Berry was amazing. Keep it up guys! I would say the same about Jean/ Pheonix, but unfortunately in a similar case to Angel, Jean spends about half an hour on the screen, and says about ... (counts on fingers) ... 9 words in the entire film!I really hope that they do make another Xmen film, (which is looking more and more likely) with Bryan Singer - Then my mind might finally be at peace. I know that they say that you don't fully appreciate something until it's gone, a saying which 100% applies to the directing abilities of Bryan Singer. By all means, if you liked the Xmen films before this then there's no harm in watching this film - Just don't expect as much from this one as the other Xmen movies. I give it 7/10, but only for the special effects and acting.",X-Men - The Last Stand
995,bh110027,much more satisfying than the first two,6,31 May 2006,"I have to admit, when I heard it was going to be a different director I had my doubts, but they were all erased after seeing the movie at 12:01am the day it came out. It was darker than the first two and had such sad and wonderful surprises. Yes they could go on and make another, but I like how this one was done and wish to not see another one made with this cast because they were splendid and I fear another would over do it.One thing that was done nicely was Wolverine's transition to leader. Now I know that Storm was supposed to be the leader and she was given that spot by Xavier, but it was Wolvie who shined and Jackman did a great job. I enjoyed how the powers didn't seem forced like they did in the first two movies. The big action sequence at the end allowed each to use their powers all at once. But the best part was that Wolvie never got beat up by a weaker mutant. I can't tell you how mad i was that he got beat by both mystique and deathstrike. His fighting skills are top notch, he did go through weapon x and they did not, plus he is super old due to his healing meaning he's been fighting since before they were born.But I've heard things said about this movie's plot, how it was all action and it was action, but if one actually watched the movie you would see that the characters actually do grow and change, some not for the better, but they do. I am glad that xmen took a dark twist because if this is the last one with this cast, then they certainly went out with a bang.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I've always been a huge fan of the Xmen series, and this movie is not a disappointment in the least. i can proudly say that with each scene i was left awed and moved.Once in a while u find the occasional person who does not like the movie, which is fine. In the theater i was in, i heard absolutely nothing but good comments regarding X3. Those occasional ""haters"" are the ones who come on here and trash the movie.

997,mr_ashyash,Disappointing,1,26 May 2006,"I agree with ""crouching_tiger_eating_popcorn's"" review. I was sorely disappointed with X3. I did read the comics back in the day, and very much enjoyed the first two movies. The makers of this movie (producers, writers, and director) took a great franchise and did a half-assed job with what should have been a great movie. They replaced the quite moments of the first two movies, which really contributed to their feel, with needless and poorly executed action-oriented snippets. They used poorly written and hokey expository dialog or monologues inappropriately. I had no emotional attachment what-so-ever with any of the characters. I couldn't care less if any one of them survived some fight. That emotional attachment is what set the first two movies apart and above a typical formulaic action-flick. They wrote in an idiotic speech before a big fight scene, and that fight scene was ridiculous. Whenever you have a battle with one group standing in a line facing off against another group, which you can see in some previews and commercials, you have a bunch of lazy film makers (aside from Braveheart, of course). Basically, they took some good concepts and executed them poorly. I compare X3 with the second and third Matrix movies and Star Wars episodes 1 through 3. Hardley good company to keep. When the first X-Men movie came out, I was afraid that it would follow the low-quality of most other comic book flicks. I was surprised by the high-quality of it and X2. However, X3 realized my initial fear. I, also, will pretend it was never made.",X-Men - The Last Stand
998,Marko182,Bitterly Disappointed,5,30 May 2006,"I cannot express in words how annoyed i was after i saw this movie, however i'll try.Maybe i didn't like it because it was hyped up too much, maybe it was because i was so in love with the other two x-men movies and i thought that they could top it. However the only reason I can figure is: Brett Ratner, i don't think that his style was right for this film, he didn't even try to focus on the newer characters (bar Kitty Pryde), I would have loved to see more of Angel, and everybody loves surprises but Christ did he really have to do all of the things in this movie? The action and the SFX were all up to the usual great standards and also the acting was amazing as usual (Though the script could have been A LOT better), hell Vinnie Jones didn't bring the performance down at all so the only problem I see is Brett Ratner. I hate you Brett Ratner for ruining what would have been one of the best trilogies EVER.Roll on Superman Returns and what promises to be another hit courtesy of Bryan 'The Man' Singer.",X-Men - The Last Stand
999,Thebluemaji,I really liked it,10,1 September 2006,"All I can say is that I am a fan of the comics and I think this film captured the feel of the X-Men. Some may be annoyed that certain people died, but this is just one take on the story. I think the original was good in how they developed the emotional side of wolverine and his first claw release was awesome, but the third was very alive. I liked how the love story fit in, we killed off Cyclops, and the general excitement of the story. The first two were just a fancy excuse for Gay activism and propaganda. I am not against people who struggle with homosexuality, but I also think there were so many underlying messages in the first few films. I don't like people sneaking in their own agenda in a film about mutants. I understand what it is like to struggle with acceptance and I think we all have felt like that in some way, but Bryan Singer made the first two about him and his struggles and not about the lore. People may argue with me, but listen to the commentary and watch the films. I am about as far from a homophobe or a hater as anyone, but I think the third film was more about the story and less about a personal agenda for gay pride. I hope I don't anger anyone, but this is just my opinion of the films. I still own all three and they are good films, but I was happy to see one that was just about subject matter and story.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Very good special effects but to what end? Even some of the cast looked bored. I am not sure how they managed to keep a straight face, because we had a chuckle.Why is it that to justify a sequel you have to out do the sfx of the previous film. So you have a guy throwing fire balls, another who has some serious issues with accupuncture.

Brett Ratner has done a good job from start to finish. Many said there're too many characters and not enough character development, but do you really need them? My answer is, if you want character development then read the comics, because the film is not about Juggernaut or Callisto or any of the other mutants. The trilogy circulates around the fight between Magneto and his comrades against Xavier and his X-men, everything that come between are just there to add flavour. I don't want to get into the story because you all know it, But I will say this, you won't be disappointed if you liked the first 2. Yes you might be shocked to see some of the mutants Lost but if you read the comics, then you would know that Time travelling Mutants exist!(If you know what I mean ^_^) In my opinion this movie is great fun to watch and a good ending for the Trilogy...9/10",X-Men - The Last Stand

1003,dan_d20032003,An amazing trilogy end,9,28 May 2006,"I went to watch this movie with huge anticipation and was not disappointed with the outcome. Right from the start i was intrigued as to the background history of some of the main characters and the return of jean grey/dark phoenix. The action scenes were fantastic, especially the scene in Jeans home, which i found both moving and powerful for all those involved. The movie has two story lines, that of the mutant cure and of the rise of dark phoenix/jean grey, and the effects it has on those once close to her, especially wolverine. Both are explored to a appropriate degree and i was not disappointed. All the main X men from the previous two movies had good sized roles, including Halle Berry's Storm who comes into her own in this movie. In my opinion it's Famke Janssen's Dark phoenix that steals the movie with her amazing power she casts throughout and the emotion and depth her character shows. The movie has stayed faithful to the comics and the dialogue is sharp and witty. One of the biggest letdowns is Vinnie Jones as juggernaut in what i can only cast as the worst screen performance of the year!

1004,Drake_Hottie,"Very entertaining, and will keep you wanting more!",10,16 July 2006,"All the other X-men movies have shown us the passion and strength of each of the characters. In X-men we saw Wolverine joining with other x-men, and dropping is guard to others helping us. The war between two friends' opinions about the relationship between homo sapiens and mutants. This was the beginning of major conflicting battles with mutants and humans, and themselves.In X2 we saw the growing power of Jean Grey beginning to take the best of her. Also the raging battle between the two groups that almost lead to the extermination of all mankind. And sadly the demise of Jean Grey.Finally in X-men 3, the Last Stand we saw the battles come to a shocking conclusion: how Jean Grey's alter ego, ""The Pheonix"" lead to the destruction of Scott ""Cyclops"", Professor Xavier, and herself, the cure stopping the leader of the opposition Eric ""Magneto"", and how the X-men against all odds stood together in this last stand to save all.

1006,imac_1969,Um - Why?,3,16 July 2006,"I have lived for comic book hero cartoons my whole life. Spider-man, Superman, and then XMen. I never read the comics but I was a faithful fan of the Sat morning cartoon on Fox in the 90's. And I loved it. Then they announced the movie. One couldn't express my anticipation. The first movie was good although slightly lacking action, but character development and story were key. The second, although more violent, was better for filling in holes and extending the story, as well as adding more action.And now the third...I have read many posts on this site and I can't believe that there is such a divide in the reviews of this movie - you will either love it or hate it. I will say that I am not a die-hard, comic-addicted fan, but I am incredibly disappointed to say the least with this movie. I just purchased XMen and X2 on DVD to re-watch them in anticipation of this third movie. I wish I hadn't because now I will have to buy this third movie.How can the writers do such a disservice to the fans by killing off such major characters and not developing others. I had anticipated major back stories on the kids - like Iceman in X2 - only to be denied. Scott's death - ugh! I kept expecting him to show up like in X2 saying ""Whoops - not dead - here I am to help!"" Jean's death in X2 was a sacrifice to save the others.Wolverine killing her - um, I don't think so. If you are going to kill Xavier, save it until the end, as he dies in redeeming and then saving Jean.There were good points - stunning visuals of the GG Bridge, the house destruction with the death of Xavier, and some cool new mutant powers, but the mutants were unlikeable. You still have to care about villains in a story. Sad to see Mystique and Magneto humanized, but it does give them a fitting end - becoming what they revile most - homo sapiens.It reminds me of a disaster movie from the 70's like Poseidon and Inferno. let's get a lot of really good actors, with a very thin script and see if they can ""survive"". Well, Mr. Rattner, you did it - you made a disaster movie alright - or should I say a disastrous movie?If you are fan, you've probably already seen it and been disappointed. If you haven't seen it yet, then I would warn you, you are probably not going to like it. (Some people in the theatre actually WALKED out!

Cyclops (Marsden) is indeed dead as he never returns, Mystique is still human and turns against Magento for turning his back on her, but Magneto is shot with the needle that makes him human, but before the film ends you see him magnetically move a steel chess piece. After the credits roll you see Professor X (Stewart) recovering in a hospital bed. So despite rumours a fourth film will probably be made in the coming years as the Marvel film industry grows and grows.BEST BIT: The final fight scene is awesome, but like I said before there needs to be more scenes with new characters such as Archangel and Colossus.BEST PERFORMANCE - Kelsey Grammar He pulls of the Beast's intelligent yet aggressive characters perfect.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1008,cobelee,X-Men: M.I.A,3,27 May 2006,"The cure has been created. That's right. Mutants have a cure and the first one on the list of the X Men to get one is Rogue. I have to say that I'm disappointed simply because she's in the beginning simulation (obviously very jealous of Kitty and Bobby's new ""relationship""). Not to be mean, but rogue could have done better to just drain Kitty's powers and leave her for dead...not wimp out and get a cure so she can put out for Bobby just to keep a ""relationship that is doomed to fail anyway"".Wolverine...you went from being a complete loner to ""I love you"". OK. they killed Scott for this? Jean Grey as Phoenix. I liked the make up but there are two things I will not stand for!1. Throwing temper tantrums and destroying everything in sight. 2. throwing temper tantrums and killing the professor but NOT magneto who was only a room away.Also, the beginning scenes were kind of pointless. For those who didn't see it yet, pay attention to Xavier's class. AND stay till the end of the credits. you'll thank me. OR want to harm me physically, one of the two. I also have to point out that the opening sequences were kind of useless, just like killing off main characters and shelving others. I'd go more into detail, but then there'd be more logic in this review than in the whole movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1009,oex,movies never ever match the novel/comic,8,29 May 2006,"I understand that the insiders of the original X-men-comic tend to be rather frustrated, that some of their beloved characters ""were not introduced"" properly or that ""some of the mutants were not shown in the movie the way they might have deserved"". I do not know the comics and all I can say: For the third movie of a trilogy it was really entertaining and great fun. Everybody should know by now, that you can't possibly match a story from a novel or a comic within 100 Minutes of film. So please stop whimpering around: As an ""outsider"" I did not care at all, that Cyclops was killed immediately by the ""new"" Jean. His self-pity was unbearable. I agree, that there was suddenly a plentiful of new mutants that had only a minor role and were just used as a short special effect. Who cares? The X-men-insiders do. The others, probably the vast majority, do not!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1010,athame,Cinematic Apocalypse,1,25 May 2006,"Let's start positive: the special-effects are awesome.Now that that's out of our system: the biggest problem with this film is story,story,story. Where the first two X-men always prioritized character development over effects, never forgetting that these characters have a story to tell, the third installment almost seems to disregard that this movie has characters at all. They are empty vessels for big explosions to happen to. The characters that we learned to love have vanished, their initial traits are altered and the only this that's left is a big sticker on their forehead saying either: GOOD(!) or BAD(!). There are the old characters that are barely recognizable, characters that are constantly on screen but never say anything and characters that make a promising entry into the plot and then mysteriously disappear halfway through the film (and not intended).Then there is the problem with the dialogue with its only purpose to tell us what to think. Mr. President says: ""it's hopeless"" and it's obvious what the director wants us to think. Problem is that you can say it as many times as you want, but the audience is not that easily fooled. I've read complaints about the previous movies that Storm's lines were unconvincing, always stating the obvious and just plain ridiculous. Well that virus has spread over all the other characters now and it hollows out the movie. And the most heartbreaking thing is that we know it has nothing to do with the actors, we've seen what this cast is capable of. But with a story that has absolutely nothing to it, which flies around like a missile, and a director that is unable to control that missile, you're left with a movie that wants to portray an apocalypse, but is really a cinematic apocalypse of itself.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1011,Lazerfeld,A special effects movie that will hurt the head of non marvel fans,8,4 June 2006,"A special effects movie that will hurt the head of non marvel fans. Well Where to start?... First of all, Juggernaught is as poorly used as Sabertooth was in X1. The Jugger is one of my all time fave baddies, but has been ruined in X3. Vinnie Jones is an awful choice to play him. His opener is something about needing the toilet! And the helmet is terrible! Its most important thing about Juggernaut and it looks like he's wearing a silver bob wig, with a choker collar. The body suit was impressive tho. And then there is Angel, who has a screen time of about 2.4 seconds. Totally forgotten about throughout the film. Also Beast makes his first appearance. Very impressive as Hank, however when unleashed as Beast, his fight scenes are crumby. The camera is to close to the action, and its over before it starts. Every mutant in the brotherhood had their moment to shine, showcasing their powers in a quick fashion, allowing the makers to cram in as many mutants as possible. Disappointing they didn't let people progress further with a story for themselves. Perhaps a teaser for X4? On the plus side, Ian McKellen as always, was brilliant as Magneto, giving him a really creepy feel in this one. Storms hair has finally sorted itself out. The hairpiece in X1 was awful. Kitty Pride is totally class. She takes the role night-crawler did in X2 by being a key figure in helping along the narrative structure of the film. The Kitty, Bobby, Rouge story line is brilliant, Rogue has been used in the franchise to her limit though, so hardly ever appears in x3. Cyclops has a bit part (thank god), they picked the wrong actor for Scott Summer in my mind. Also Bobby finally 'Ices Up'. Almost in tears, Goose bumps all over, Ice man squares up against Pyro and they fire each others powers at one another. As Pyro gets the upper hand and is dominating the star wars style showdown, Bobby 'Ices Up' turning himself into a full ice body!! Mint! Definitely the high point of the film for me. All in all its a good film. Its had a large budget and it shows from all the special effects. The odds and ends are tied up and attention to detail has improved from the previous films. Lets all prey together that X4 will be made and that Gambit, Bishop and Apocalypse will make an appearance.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1012,roofpig13,"For the Fans, by a Fan",8,26 May 2006,"This movie has been getting a lot flack, mostly centered around the director, Brett Ratner. I'll admit when I first heard that he was taking over the project, I thought it was all over. However, I was pleasantly surprised.X3 is not better or worse than the previous movies - it's different. It has a different feel and a different purpose. Whereas the first two movies were created to appeal to both fans and people unfamiliar with the X-Men comics, X3 was created specifically for the fans by a self-admitted fanboy. There were many references to the comics, both subtle and blatant, as well as a big nod to an internet joke concerning the X-Men. As a long-time fan of the comics, this movie was just pure fun from the get-go.I will admit that the pacing was very rushed. If the running time had been expanded and/or certain plot points had been simplified, I think this movie would have flowed very nicely. However, it wasn't so rushed that it made the story incomprehensible - at least, not if you were paying attention. I also think that there were too many new characters introduced, and as much as I liked seeing them, they should have remained in the background rather than in the foreground and underdeveloped.I'm giving this film an 8 out 10 because it did what it was supposed to do - it gave us an all-out war and it served as a final hurrah for the franchise (although I don't think I necessarily believe that Fox will end it here if it makes enough money). Fans of just the first two movies will probably be disappointed, but fans of the X-Men in any incarnation will more-than-likely be delighted.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1013,bnrup,"A great movie, but my opinion may be insufficient",9,16 October 2006,"First, let me point out that I probably should have seen the first two movies before I saw the third, so my comments might be insufficient. Despite this, it was a great action movie, and it also had some pretty moving scenes. However, I do agree that some of the newer characters needed some more background info. A few of the main characters died, but that is to be expected in an end-of-series. I found myself indifferent between the two sides, I thought it wrong for the mutants to engage in a war over it, and I also thought it wrong for the gov't to push the ""cure"" on them so harshly. It was also pretty funny that my friend and I were the only ones in the theater who had actually stayed past the credits.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1014,alistair-49,The director wasn't an x man fan,7,26 May 2006,"Sadly, the director of this movie was not a fan of the X men phenomenon. Was it really necessary to decimate the cast in such a clumsy and heavy handed way. Cyclops' demise was so sudden and unheralded that one couldn't help but imagine that there had been some contractual dispute between the actor and the filmmakers. Mystique has undoubtedly been one of the stars of the series, but alas, transformed into a common check out girl with barely a moments pause. Xavier's battle for the sanity of Jean Gray should have been the centre piece of the movie, but he was killed off half way though with barely a whimper and you were left wondering what might have been. The hint from earlier in the film that Xavier may shift his dying consciousness into the body of someone else (like the man dying of cancer) didn't materialise in the movie, and since the chances of a fourth movie seem remote the introduction of that possibility seemed like a directorial oversight. Jean Gray's tortured & psychotic character was in many ways excellent and beautifully shot, a blend of Carrie and Exorcist, but unfortunately we didn't see enough of the real Jean Gray, and too much of Pheonix standing around looking moody but doing not much else. The end scene did redeem it somewhat, however again it would have been nice to have seen some more of the real Jean, perhaps coming to terms with the enormity of what she had done. (kill her lover and mentor) All we got was a slight misting over of the eyes.If this film is the last in the series then there are too many loose ends and unanswered questions. This is a big let down for fans, because it seems to me that the makers have done this deliberately in case they are able to find enough money to throw at the cast to convince them to make a fourth movie. If they can't then that's that, and that shouldn't really have been good enough for this director.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1015,Nathanb_md,I can't believe it!,5,27 May 2006,"Okay for starters, i don't think this film (especially) does not hold true to the comic. As a film it's not that great either. The only real continuations from the other movies are the death of Jean and the actors. It was basically a mess of scenes that didn't flow together or finish any storyline. There was very little emotion, especially in the end when Wolverine kills dark phoenix, this is mostly because very little emotional ties were ever created between them. There was more emotion in Professor X's death between he and wolverine even thought Logan didn't ""love"" the professor. The tension between pyro and iceman was nonexistent they're final fight somewhat redeemed that. Nightcrawler was not only written out of this movie and his absence was never explained. It was a barrage of characters that mostly just ended up dead or forgotten. I never thought i would say this, but I miss bryan singer. The last scene and the scene after the credits are the only reason i gave this a 5. Marvel should pretend like this film never happened and make a credible sequel to X2.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1016,caebaker1,Undeveloped potential,1,29 May 2006,"X-Men the Last Stand had all the potential to be the of the X-Men movies. X-Men 2 had set the stage perfectly for the movie, and yet Brett Ratner failed to develop any coherent plot, instead settling with a few one liners to further a character ""Some people don't heal as fast as you Login"" - Scott. The social issues of the mutant cure is practically ignored, only referred to in passing by Beast and a conversation between Rogue and Storm. The fight scenes left a bad taste in the mouth, lacking any coherent superhero battles aside from a 'Quicksilver' fight with Storm and a simple face off between Iceman and Pyro. The role of the heroes themselves feels more like cameos then actual leading roles. Only Storm, Iceman and Wolverine have any real dialog and that is kept to the usual prattle of the past movies.No plot was actually furthers, instead a small dialog was expected to create a character, the movie watches more like a made for TV movie, where one expects to see the other half next week. Perhaps more accurately its the comic that comes in between the blockbuster issues, filled with just enough to keep you reading but not really bringing anything new or furthering any character or plot. After the cliffhanger ending of X2 I fail to see why this was needed.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1017,movielife426,a lukewarm reception,6,26 May 2006,"In X-men: The Last Stand, director Brett Ratner takes the reigns from Bryan Singer, and in doing so manages to sort of crap all over what made the first two movies so good. The film is kind of plagued with cheesy dialogue, and the characters are no longer believe-able, and the story just throws all sorts of new characters into the mix, without having ample time to develop them or give them any kind of significance in the movie. Also, as this is deemed the ""Last Stand"" despite a cliffhanger ending, I still have a problem with the fact that this movie so readily kills off many roles- and omits other mutants altogether with no explanation. (Nightcrawler anyone?)However, I must give it some credit- the movie isn't as bad as it could've been, and in seeing it I didn't feel like I had wasted my money. Check it out, but wait for a matinée or the DVD.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1018,bonilla858,Magnificent,10,29 May 2006,"Well first of all i am just sick of people hating off this movie it was amazing to me and don't try to say that i just think that because i don't know a lot about X-men but believe me i know plenty. I can see how the time of the movie is a problem and how some of the new characters didn't get the time they deserved but all in all it was pretty great. Now i am not going to go on and on i just wanted to say i would have liked it more if Rogue would have gotten a bigger part in the movie and got to show off her powers more. Rogue has always been my favorite, her and Iceman are good together but where is Gambit when you need him. Iceman was kind of flirting with Kitty Pryde in the movie but have to give props to Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Shawn Ashmore, Anna Paquin, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Kelsey Grammar, Famke Janssen, Aaron Stanford, James Marsden, Ellen page, and Ben Foster (lovin the wings)and the rest of the cast you guys were great.So deserves a 10 out of 10.Now I just have to say one more thing and thats there has to be another X-men movie",X-Men - The Last Stand
1019,Tabletop_Live,I feel nauseous - *spoilers*,1,27 May 2006,"Honestly, I don't know what to say. There's so much that was just completely wrong, and it's plainly obvious that Bret Ratner doesn't have a clue when it comes X-Men. Had he even heard of them before making the movie? My guess is no. I don't understand how a film like this makes it past whatever screening process it needs to go through to ensure it maintains some semblance of the series it came from. It's as if Marvel didn't have any creative influence at all - because if they had, Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Xavier wouldn't be dead - Rogue wouldn't have lost her powers, Beast wouldn't be a politician(and instead be the mechanical genius that he is), and Storm wouldn't have arbitrarily become the head of the late Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.Ratner sets it up for a sequel, but I haven't a clue how he'll drag this one from the ashes. At the rate he's going, there will be no characters left by the end of the next movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1020,blueno12001,Not bad not good you decide.,8,27 May 2006,"OK here goes. I liked the movie. I didn't love it. I liked it. I'm saying this having read the comic books since I was ten years old. I happened upon it right when the phoenix saga began and stopped getting the issues a little after the phoenix saga ended. I liked the movie for what it was. I was amazed when the first one came out because it brought the comic to life and did it well. I liked the second movie because it continued the story from the first movie. I liked the third because I think it was a good completion to the story line. I will say this. I was shocked watching the battle between phoenix and the professor. Didn't see it coming having been familiar with the comic story line. I thought that the battle was more spectacular and shocking than the actual last stand. It was visually stunning and emotional. I was disappointed that there was no phoenix flame. That would have been cool. I also have one more thing that I found bugged me. OK so mystique is handcuffed and trying to manipulate a guard so he pulls out the pepper spray and said something like ""keep it up and I will pepper spray you bitch."" OK. I bought that. Later in the movie the juggernaut is chasing down sprite and she pulls him halfway into the floor trapping him and he said this.....""do you know who I am? I'm the juggernaut bitch."" Now I thought that was a stupid line. For one don't say that to a fourteen year old girl and if your trying to establish that your a force of power it would have worked just as well if he just said ""Im the juggernaut"". Thats just me. Believe me I like throwing the s,f,a,mf,and b word around but you got to know when and what it works with. So that was just my little peeve. The ending was interesting with magneto and his chess game and if you don't already know you have to stay after the full credits have run for the last few seconds that come back on after they have rolled. Pretty interesting.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Too many events in the third movie happen that the producers and writers can use to create a fourth movie. They can use the scene where Cyclopse is killed, the scene where Professor X is killed, the scene where Magneto begins to change his feelings about Professor X and what he has done, and the scene at the end of the move, before the credits, when Magneto begins to get his powers back. I don't think it's the best idea to end the greatest comic book trilogoy with the villain gettings his powers back. If there was an X4 I would with no doubt see it after the third one.

It is a very rushed film. Most of what happens in it is completely pointless.The trailer for the film is brilliant and I mean brilliant at making you believe that this is actually a good film. Those of you who have seen the trailer and the film will know what I mean.The dialogue is corny, the ending feels like it was put together over lunch and not seriously thought out. There are far too many mutants in the film meaning lack of character development Don't get me wrong though this film is not catwoman bad. If you are a big fan of the first 2 films it is worth seeing once, but i stress only once. You will only be slightly impressed by the special effects and nothing else.I of course didn't not go and see the first 2 x men films because of the special effects, no I went for this story the messages that portrayed which were brilliantly put across by Brian Singer.It not worth the movie ticket but if you really want to go and see it then go, but personally I would wait till it gets a screening on television.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1024,rickroth81,Brutal Extravaganza,7,29 May 2006,"Scientists discover a ""cure"" for mutants thanks to the genes of a young mutant whose power reverses the X gene in mutants when they come close to him. Mixed feelings surface among all mutants upon the release of this ""cure"" though naturally Magneto takes it as an insult and the fuel to finally strike back at the humans blitzkrieg style. Complicating matters even more is the return of Jean Grey and her uncontrollable destructive alter ego The Phoenix. Compared to the first two parts of this trilogy, X3 is by far a more violent, action oriented, and emotionally charged film. The film wastes no time in making its point clear as well. The plot unfolds very quickly and allows the action to take over. A viewing of the 1st two films would be necessary to understand character relationships and the magnitude of their interactions in this movie. There are some dynamic fight sequences and confrontations in this film; Calisto vs Storm (For once Halle Berry is allowed to play her character to her most bad ass potential) Pyro vs. Iceman, Wolverine vs. everyone(!) and the most emotional scene in the trilogy where Jean Grey and Dr. Xavier engage in the most hardcore mind battle since Scanners. All of that leads up to a jolting climax battle between Magneto's Brotherhood and the X-Men on Alcatraz. This movie doesn't slow down for anything. The one thing that was a tough adjustment for me was watching Kelsey Grammar beat the crap out of people. His diplomatic roll fit him well though. This one moves much faster than the 1st two films and though everyone can nitpick, X3 does a fine job of concluding this trilogy though as always it is left opened for more films if the grosses stay up.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1025,palsy-1,Awesome and yet rather pathetic,9,28 May 2006,"I mean come on, they're so hanging on for a sequel. Every cast member says its not gonna happen but with an ending like that it would be a crime not to have a sequel. Then again, the plot line is deflated enough, so maybe they just made the park ending and the bedside ending as a reason for fans to hope who wanted to rip their hair out when Rogue, Magneto, and Mystique get stripped of their powers and Jean, Scott, and Prof X get killed. After all, the whole theme of the first movie was hope, so I think they ended it the way they did in a desperate attempt to bring the theme full-circle. Anyone who has seen the movie all the way to the end, past the credits, knows what I'm talking about. Anyone who hasn't, pay the money and go see the movie again. Brett Ratner, in my opinion, is trying to soften the blow to his fans about the whole ""Cure"" plot line. But for god sake, if you're going to have Prof X in another body and Magneto tip over a metal chess piece in the ending shot, then when Rogue touches Bobby he should fall over on the ground in pain and she should be like ""Ha, that's for flirting with Kitty!"" Overall, A+ special effects, but the movie needed to be longer if they wanted to put in those new characters and develop them properly and do them justice. Juggernaut gets a one line intro, how retarded is that. And the whole ""cure"" part of the script was just lame. If you're gonna put and end to the X-men, you don't do it by stripping their powers. It's a huge let down to comic book fans everywhere. The whole plot other than ""the cure"" basically revolves around Wolverine and Pheonix/Jean. Xavier and Cyclops get killed off too early to have any real substance in the story. Bobby and Rogue barely get two words in together, and the only verbal transaction between Wolverine and Rouge is like 2 seconds long. The only reason it gets a 9 out of 10 from me is because I loved the first two movies, the comic book series in general, and because the script backed itself into a corner but turned out decently in spite of all the writing challenges.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1026,cemendur-1,X3 last stand - last gasp is more likely.,2,28 May 2006,"The movie is the third and likely the last in what is being called the X-men trilogy. It leads on from the previous two and features most of the same heroes. Unlike the previous two this is not a fabulous movie screen adaptation of the comics. There are two major story lines competing for screen time. One deals with a cure for mutation - the other the miraculous rise from her supposed death of Jean Grey. Either would have sufficed. Unfortunately there is insufficient time to explore both and the movie ends up disjointed and neither thread is satisfactorily explored or played for depth. The actors are treated similarly. The big two hog the limelight and the story is greatly flawed as it look like rewrites eliminated continuity and storyline to cater to more screen time for Ororo and Wolverine. The elimination of other characters which should have been powerful stuff - seems lacking in drama. There are the usual trademark marvel iconic moments from the source material. Jean holding back Scot's optic blasts . Golden Gate bridge being ripped apart by magneto. And scenes of the future apocalypse of 'Nightmare of future past' are glimpsed in a danger room scene.Much absent is any real continuity with any of the original Pheonix storyline or material. And the name is not synonymous of her rebirth but is explained away as a nickname for a split personality. Poor stuff. Also lacking is any Pheonix effect - as is suggested in the closing of x2 when the traditional Phoenix effect can be glimpsed under the water. Also the 'Phoenix' storyline - thought off to a promising start - essentially disappears after about 40 minutes and is only then revisited in the last 5 minutes. As if it is an afterthought. This reeks of a director including stuff because he is told to - there is not feeling of this being a work of art. Its a comic book equivalent of a slasher flick. which has itself been butchered by its own director. If mindless superhero violence is your thing then this is it. If you want rounded characters, powerful drama and a continuation of X-men and X2 - then I'm afraid you will be sorely disappointed. This is a watch once and throw away movie. The movie obviously lost is way in the numerous changes of director. A criminal waste after the first two movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand

And I guess rightly so.This film just seemed to be lapping up all the clichés that the genre could offer especially when it came to some truly appalling dialogue. As if Magneto would ever come out with anything ascorny as ""What have I done..?"" when everything starts going pear-shaped. I found myself sitting there thinking : ""Sir Ian, please tell me you fought against saying such a hackneyed line!?""Character development (which played such a strong part in the first two films) was sadly lacking as well which made the film feel empty to me.In conclusion, the film's not a total bomb, there are some great set-pieces and some nice moments of humour However, you just can't help feeling that Mr Singer would have presented us with something with greater subtlety and more significant emotional depth...",X-Men - The Last Stand

Listen to what the people on here are saying and DO NOT bother. It's too late for those of us who have seen it, but if you haven't, save yourselves!!I've been going through the mountainous collection of comments on this movie, and in summary they all largely agree this is truly incompetent rubbish at its best. However, the comments have all taken the easy route of simply blaming Brett Ratner. Guys, c'mon we know Ratner is a hack, thoughtless, untalented and yes only the fates know how the heck he became a director. But let us not forget he is not the only culprit to the ruination of this trilogy. Indeed X3 was begun by Bryan Singer (he was moved to Superman) so we cannot discount the fact he started this tripe.But let's ignore the failed direction of the movie and consider the real problem. The writers. The plot is so boring and ill conceived it's laughable. The writers, its best their names are not spoken, are clearly not the thinking type. A 'cure' that is instantaneous has been found for mutants. OK. So those mutants who wanna keep their powers and can live a normal life (see almost all X-Men, lucky ay'?) can, and those whose powers cause deformities or are de-habilitating in some way, can be rid of them. Yay! Right? Oh no, apparently providing people with a choice is the source of eeevil! *insert head smack here*But hey, this is X-Men, so we buy it. OK, so the writers get away with that. Now, they think, how can we best antagonise every X-fan in the world? Let's just kill everyone they care about off in a pointless show of special effects, and make meatballs outta the rest... Except Cyclops, the hell with him. Yes, Cyclops doesn't even get a death scene. No special effects wasted on clearly what must be the writer's most hated character. The use of Cyclops in the three films, the last two specifically, has been to the chagrin of all his fans everywhere. It seems that either James Marsden really upset someone, they plain just hate the Cyclops character, or both. Because pairing him with the unfeeling, emotionless acting zombie that is Famke Jenson was obviously designed as some form of sick torture. Their on screen chemistry throughout has been asinine, Marsden desperately trying to elicit any kind of acting from her. What is supposed to be the most timeless love in the X-Men universe has been degraded and debauched into one man and his zombie, by the writers and the acting decisions made for the Jean Grey character. So much so, no one really cared when she died, heck I was hoping they'd reincarnate her with a different actor.It seems to many of the actors simply wanted out, and as a result the film itself suffers a series of lackluster performances, culminating in what is supposed to be a visual full roast of a finale. But what is in fact, a badly envisaged, poorly written halt, which misuses all the characters and ignores the true potential of the scene.Whilst everyone agrees the effects are spectacular, they also agree that they are also used without forethought. All the characters are a one eighty to their true counterparts in the comics, and the acting is constantly painful. Hugh Jackman is dull (how did Ratner achieve that?) Halle Berry does not have the acting shoulders to bear a leading role (see Catwoman !just an example do NOT see that film!) And the less said about the other performances the better. Except one, Kelsey Grammar. Yes, everyone thinks of him as Frasier, so now think of him as Frasier on steroids. He is the one bright spot in this movie; his portrayal of Beast is down to earth, full of conviction and simply sublime. Even in his fight scenes he is exceptionally believable. He has worked hard on himself and the character and it shows. He has such screen presence you're left wondering why they didn't just ditch everyone else and just let him get on with it.Although it's clear early on the writers missed out on an exceptional partnership, the one scene Wolverine and Cyclops have together is very, very good, and we see some of the skill these two actors truly have. After this scene the dialogue becomes painful and just plain embarrassing. All the scenes between Wolverine and Storm are weak and poorly planned. The zenith of this being Ms. Berrys line:""If you're with us, then be with us."" I laughed so hard I got shushed! Did they get Joss Whedon to write that? Is he blaming her delivery again?It seems there were so many personal backhanders, and dodgy agreements for this film to ever be any good. Why else would you remove a respected director and replace him with a joke halfway through? Why would you allow someone a starring role when she clearly hasn't got the skill? Why would you antagonise your main target audience? The list is endless, how the people involved in the production of this movie sleep at night, without the weight of abject failure tearing them apart, is as big a mystery as how this movie ever got made. It is a shame no one will see Kelsey Grammar's performance, because it's overshadowed by the unmitigated crap of the rest of the film.Don't believe me? Read a few of the other comments, just don't give these people anymore money, and don't get me started on the casting for Juggernaut, or the death of Xavier Why would you do either of those? Why would anyone make this movie? Does Fox hate the world this much?",X-Men - The Last Stand
1029,icheckthisemaileveryday,"no character development, move was short, cheesy music",6,1 June 2006,"Like many other people, I have come to the conclusion that this final installment of X-Men was a hack job. The X-Men comics provide a rich environment of character development and thick, entertaining plot lines, any of which would have sparked sufficient interest in fans and moviegoers alike. While the original director ""adapted"" to those comics to create a cohesive plot that would properly fit in the time span of a movie, this new film seems to have taken on more than it could handle. It displays many of the lovable characters fans love, but there is no character development, no introductions, and no relevance or significance to what these characters actually mean to the story; to the ""X-men saga"" itself. If the X-Men franchise is a golden egg of cash crop to the production company, why butcher the story and limit the movie as a ""trilogy"". And if the movie MUST be a trilogy, why butcher the movie instead of just further developing and introducing characters and leaving the story open like just another comic episode. And if you did want to chew on that many characters in one movie, with a plot as big as this one was, why not make the movie longer? It never seemed to be a problem for Peter Jackson( lord of the rings, king Kong). No disrespect to the director of this X-men movie(he's an action director not a screenwriter/drama director), but much disrespect given to the production company for allowing this botch up to exist. For allowing the script to sh*t all over the story and characters alike. Rogue cant fly, shes weak, shes a genuine crybaby. Nightcrawler ""poof""ed out of this movie altogether. People defend the time line as to why rogue has no powers yet other than the absorption technique, as to why there is no gambit or jubilation lee or banshee yet(shes apparently a student in one scene being taught by Xavier), as to why archangel hasn't lost his original wings and just sort of flaps around the movie from time without any significance to the plot or ever fighting (much like the squirrel in ice age.)Why psylocke is apparently a bad guy...But if this is the case, and ""these things just haven't happened yet"",don't just make up your own ending by killing off all the main characters (cyclops,Xavier,jean Grey)to fit into the confines of a trilogy. I like that kitty is in the movie, I like Juggernaut in the movie too. But come on. Pick a plot, pick a few characters, and make it work. Juggernut vs wolverine and night-crawler. Juggernut vs colossus. Both worked well in the comics. But Juggernut just running after kitty until slamming into a wall and knocking himself out? That ""action"" scene lasted all of a solid minute. ew. Leave the characters out if you're not going to expand on them or make them work with the over-all story.And seriously, if you're stuck making a ""trilogy"" and forced into killing off characters and screwing up the storyline this much to get closure, don't add a goofy scene at the end leading an audience to think that a sequel may come with the ""cure"" not being a permanent fixture/effect on those it has been administered to. Or, after credits, having a sequence leading one to wonder if Charles Xavier is still alive. That be the case, perhaps cyclops and jean are alive too? Then what? So no one died and no one lost their powers, absolutely nothing happened all movie long and you couldn't even develop the story started in the previous two movies further for the next installment? *shakes fists in air*",X-Men - The Last Stand
1030,hegemonever,"Good for the average viewer, crap for a comic book fan",6,29 May 2006,"First off, I just want to say that as a movie, it was good if it were something dreamed up out of the blue. Unfortunately, its based on a comic book series that the writers apparently didn't care to take the time to read, proof that Cliff's Notes don't work for everything. Comic fans are the target base for XMen and the writers missed the mark! SPOILER WARNING! Rogue's character was developed and spun throughout each of the previous films and then her character was dumped. She had maybe 10 lines. I had expected that she would have turned around at some point and realized that she was given a gift that had unfortunate prices, but she gave up. The writers totally missed the point of Rogue's character, that one must persevere through adversity, not just give up to make things easier. They really missed a chance to shine and give a moral to the story.Juggernaut was practically a bit part. I was incredibly excited to find out that Juggernaut was in this movie only to discover that they had completely whitewashed the character. I can forgive them for turning him into a mutant for time's sake and for not putting in the link between he and Xavier but they completely changed his abilities! He's supposed to be invincible (super strength, impervious, immune to pretty much everything) but these idiots turned him into a glorified battering ram with a couple great lines. I agree that a battle between he and Colussus could have been the best fight sequence in the film and the writers missed this opportunity as well. Immense disappointment! Some people had problems with certain previously lead characters dying but I was OK with it. It added a little shock and awe to the story and I respect that but the above flaws in the story ruined it for comic book fans.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1031,marimavi,Angela Bassett in the role of Storm,9,23 May 2006,"I really love the X-Men series and although I really like Halle Berry's work, I really feel that the role of Storm should have gone to Angela Bassett. The strength of her body type and features would have added more power to the role. I also think Bassett is more in line with the cartoon version. Halle seems to cutesy for the role. She does not carry the physical strength of what the character of Storm should represent, whereas Angela Bassett does. I believe Halle was miscast for this role. Again, I love her work, but Angela Bassett would have been the perfect Storm. It is a shame that they picked the more popular actress over the one who would have suited the role the best.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1032,c-rystal-clea-r,What to expect...,7,28 May 2006,"I went to see X3 this Friday, highly expecting excellency. The movie started out with two scenes on two characters in their younger selves--Jean and a new guy who you might have seen in the commercial, the guy with wings. This was a great thing and boosts my rating. It was not only interesting but it told a lot about the main plots about the movie, which I will refrain from telling.This movie was directed by a different person--Brett Ratner. The first two movies in the series were directed by Bryan Singer, and the change of director is evident in this movie. The special effects were awesome and I can't expect any better of them. However, the plot was rambling on about nothing... more specifically, how powerful Jean is and all that. The action was immense yet the plot was thinning as the movie went on. It seemed as if it had been longer yet had to be cut short.The first 30 minutes or so of the movie the plot was thickening, yet not much was going on. Basically, all you find out is that Jean is really powerful, which is probably what you knew before the movie, though the action was OK. The next part was just... iffy, though trust me when I say you'll get some major shocks. And the last part was intense with action, and I was always on the edge of my seat. However, there was a corny ending to this movie that I will not tell you but convinces me that there probably is going to be an X4, which I doubt will be good because some of the actors will be too old.Basically, X3 wasn't as good as I expected, though overall it wasn't a bad movie. Don't expect too much of it except for some action and some major shocks. X3 is not the best movie in the world, but I've seen worse. For the plot, two stars. For the movie and acting and special effects... three stars. I don't know about you, but I'd give it a generous 2 1/2 stars.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1033,Danny73,The worst X-Men movie,4,8 June 2006,"I've seen five times the first movie, twice the second one, while I won't do the same with X3: OK, in this movie you'll find a lot of characters, but only few ideas, poor dialogs and another last sequence suggesting a possible X-Men 4. More, I had the feeling that there were characters practically useless to the plot, or not well-defined. The movie is someway grotesque but not dramatic, too unreal even for a comic book. ""BOOMS"" and ""BANGS"" are not enough to make the movie interesting. Concluding, you might want to see Episode 1 'cause you're a Star Wars fan, and perhaps you'd like to see X3 'cause you're an X-Men fan, but it's not worth the price, definitely. And it's a real pity.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1034,bogof_tom,Good but could have been so much better,7,25 May 2006,"7 out of 10 is a rating from an X-Men fan in general and certainly a fan of the first two movies. If I were to remove my rose-tinted glasses (no I'm not Cyclops...) it would probably be around 5 out of 10.Why you ask? Well...a) Some of the characters are far too unnecessary and under-developed. Take Jean Grey. I think she has around 50 words of dialogue all movie, and I could probably include her younger counterpart playing her in the first 5 minutes in that assessment. An explanation is given about the Phoenix side to her character but throughout the movie she tends to just stand there, gazing at something in the distance. Without giving away details of what she does, there's no real idea as to what her motives are, where her loyalties lie, what she wants out of the situation. Of course she ""takes a stand"" on one of the sides of the battle but why? Also, a mutant with ""unlimited powers"" begs the question - did Magneto really need an army? It's like sending the US army to Iraq when everyone knows Jack Bauer could do the same job with a spud gun.b) Magneto doesn't end up behind bars!! What the hell happened there? A man who has his face, his agenda, his words beamed around the planet - he commits some pretty darn harsh crimes and he's strolling around a park at the end? It's not like he was inconspicuous.c) Why did they even need Mr. Marsden for this film? Rather than write him the 10 minutes of screen time he got they should have played it so differently, given him a purpose in the film.d) Ditto Angel.e) Ditto Colossus.f) Ditto Rogue.I imagine you can see a thread of thought there! HOWEVER: It is an enjoyable film for the effects and action, and overall the film does move at a frenetic pace. Wolverine is again played very well by Hugh Jackman and Magneto is also done well by Sir Ian McKellen. You have to see it just to complete the trilogy. Although the way they left things you wouldn't count on it ending there....",X-Men - The Last Stand
1035,GNobuyo,Best film this year by far!,10,8 June 2006,"This film was amazing! There was nothing boring about it and it was always exciting. I can't say anything bad about it other than it was too short. This could easily have been an 3 hour climactic epic: Which I expected. Well, we got the 'climactic epic' part so I was happy enough to give a 10 out of 10. I just hope it does better than it's prequel's because it deserves to. Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen were outstanding and brought their characters to life and added that level of realism. And that realism was what made it better than X-men and X2. X2 was just too dark and bizarre and X-Men felt like a trailer. So to round it all up... X-Men:The last stand was fantastic. But why don't people like it? well, it is very far away from th comic book stories. Bu these films were abou the fight for acceptance. To wipe out the prejudice and discrimination and they did that with a a bang. Yes, maybe some of the characters didn't get looked into as much as I had hoped. I didn't like Angel included in the story just for the sake for the cure. I thought he could have been included far more. Also rogue. They didn't look at her side of the story very much. This did frustrate me as the other X-men movies looked deep into the hearts of the characters thoughts and emotions. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. After thinking about it, Rogue and that includes the other mutants, had many of their thoughts conveyed in the other films; so as it was already justified there was no need to repeat or re-emphasize th point. Brian singer did a good job but so did Brett Ratner. He didn't make a bad film just a different one and that's why it hasn't gone well with the real fans....So please enjoy it peeps..Film ain't doing well anymore",X-Men - The Last Stand
1036,on_the_peripheral,Fantastically breath-taking scenes and a radical plot,8,26 May 2006,"Having watched just once (so far!) yesterday on the release day of this film in the UK, i was pretty much blown away. I'm a fan from the comics and cartoons, and have since adjusted my expectations the films, realising they are never going to produce something that's going to align perfectly with the comic visions. With the film-expectations, this movie was spectacular. And even held up against its comic history, it really held its own. For a start, aesthetically it was really splendid - the special effects were fantastic, and there was some really alien and spooky moments. The fight sequences seemed to get better and better, they really pulled out all the stops. They finally included some sorely missed aspects from the comics, and the Danger Room scene was virtually perfect, that was the *real* Wolverine for a while. Brilliant.Character-wise and plot-wise i thought it was a really brave film, making some dramatic changes. Some characters such as Juggernaut and Kitty were perhaps not given the attention they deserved, but i've always been a Wolvie fan so i was less concerned with the others. In this film they maintain their treatment of the 'sensitive wolvie' and don't balance it out as much as i'd like with his lethal side, but he still gets a chance to puncture things with those claws. :PThis film looks really brilliant, has an ending that left me zinging, and is definitely one i'm going to catch a few times at the big-screen. I'd highly recommend watching it at least once at the cinema, to get the benefits of the huge visuals. Now, time to hope they give the same kind of excellent treatment to the Wolverine movie...",X-Men - The Last Stand

Bad move: we adore those characters. Brian shouldn't have allow this step of ruining his way of producing personalities of those mutants! Angel, well, nothing but attractive because of his wings. His role is practically useless, except when he saves his father, who is been taken to the roof of some building by mutants to be thrown, although they can blast the mountains, COME ON! Some scenes are really immature, and it is said that film talks about serious questions about racism?! Effects are cool, in Matrix way, BUT: Will someone, any One can tell me what Jean does in her whole role, except she's trying to get laid with Wolv, and, you know, Hugh and Halle are big stars, so when they act in some movie, their must be main, they must be the strongest, smartest, wisest, unbreakable, ALIVE although all around them are DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Alas, I know the story all to well and am very disappointed with the job done for #3. So many blatant filming errors, boring 1-liners that should be saved for cartoons on Saturdays, missing characters from the last movie for no apparent reason, too many new characters to ""flesh-out"" and several plots with no real story line or support.The worst of it all is that in #2 Jean Grey was becoming the Phoenix - they have barely skimmed the surface of this aspect and expect true X-Men lovers to just accept what the director and writers have come up with? It's ridiculous and it pisses me off that I wasted my money to see the film like that. I wish I could go back in time and let them know this release is an embarrassment to Marvel and the X-Men heritage.I'll be very scepticle about attending a 4th viewing (if one is ever released).

1040,steve-2837,Horrible!,1,27 May 2006,"Very few things keep me awake at 2am, yet I feel I cannot go to sleep until I tell everyone just how pathetic X-Men: The Last Stand truly was.If you are planning on seeing this movie, please take my advice: don't see it. Save your time. Save your money. Save yourself from being so frustrated you literally shake your fist at the screen.Bryan Singer definitely knows when to leave a sinking ship. Ratner, of Rush Hour...fame(?)...certainly has ensured the X-Men franchise is finished. He does this in a multitude of ways, some of which I will not get into just in case you want to see this stinker without any spoilers. In short, I am simply amazed Marvel actually let their characters be misrepresented as badly as they are! It is clear the film has been written to accommodate Halle Berry's demands for more screen time as Storm -- the X-Men movie universe now apparently revolves around this lackluster character. Additionally, it is quite apparent that the film has been written to pave the way for a future Wolverine spin-off film. Frankly, apart from one moment involving Iceman near the end of the film, I felt cheated and disappointed.Character development is shoved to the wayside in order that we see a whole lot of mutant cameos. Who cares? Kelsey Grammar is quite good as Beast, and is crucial to the main plot of the movie, but Ben Foster as Angel is quite unnecessary. I respect Ben Foster as an actor, but he has three lines all film and a subplot involving his father that is just ridiculous. The part his father plays in the story could easy be re-written to have the character as just another doctor, thereby removing Angel altogether and the expensive CG-effects required of the character. The money saved right there could have been used to hire a writer with some actual merit.Cyclops is one-dimensional. Magneto comes across as merely a lunatic and loses every ounce of the conflict he has shown in the two previous films and throughout the X-Men comics. Rogue gets turned into a whining, selfish little girl. And just what the hell happened to Nightcrawler?Grandiose displays of stupidity are attempted to be passed off as plot devices. Characters do not stay true to themselves. An array of unnecessary deaths are carried out in front of the audience, draining the film of every single drop of emotion it potentially could have had. The Jean Grey-Phoenix storyline is completely ridiculous and plays no real part in the film. It could have been scrapped altogether, and thereby would have left the franchise with a leg to stand on. Instead, the film robs the franchise of its former glory and ensures its tattered remains will never be resurrected.At least I can breathe a sigh of relief and know I'll enjoy Superman Returns because there is no way Singer can manage to screw up his film like Ratner did this one.Comment on this review at my blog, http://stevivor.livejournal.com/131066.html, or at www.stevivor.com.",X-Men - The Last Stand

But listen to our popular music nowadayz...specifically hip hop which ""steals"" music for previously written songs, adds in their own words and then calls the song the same thing as the original recording...as if it were a cover(??)If X-men 3 doesn't follow true to the original concept of the comics...i blame you, the general public, for demanding so much from Hollywood. The directors decisions are based on what YOU would like to see in the theater and what will determine a marketable DVD. One big problem with Hollywood has always been that the directors aren't only directing...they're writing and needless to say, ""re-writing"".Um i thought thats why we had WRITERS and screen writers and the directors were there simply to DIRECT how the story should be put into visual form. Maybe i'm wrong but if i owned a major movie making company in Hollywood....a lot of over-payed suck ups would be weeded out from their directors chairs.As far as the movie feeling rushed.....think of X-men 3 as a long commercial for the next movie. Rattner did his ""job"" and set us all up, leaving us all wanting MORE.Personally, as a movie, i thought X-men 3 was great. I don't think i've read one review mentioning the suspense that was created in the scenes. Some of the events that took place in the story i was NO WHERE NEAR expecting!! And yeah the action was great but there was a lot of emotional drama in this sequel paired with tragedies that really would leave anyone with an once of a conscience in the theater seat very moved. And thats what film making as an art form is all about right? entertaining and MOVING the audience?

It shows why humanity should fear mutants, and the actual ramifications of having power to ""levitate cities"".So what if Juggernaught was a mutant this time instead of Xavier's halfbrother in possession of a mystical doodad that would have taken 1/2 an hour to explain.

1043,spiletta42,More Than Just Action,10,28 May 2006,"The X-Men movies, and this one in particular, are about more than action and special effects -- although those are great -- but also provoke thought about real ethical issues.If you strongly dislike action movies, then no, you won't be a fan, but there's far more going on in this than just explosions and fist fights. These characters face some weighty decisions, about morality and their own lives.The special effects are stunning, the writing is good, the characters are well developed, the acting is solid. The costuming, in my opinion, had one flaw -- Hank McCoy, aka The Beast, could have used more fur on his face. As in the previous films, the X-costumes used in the movie are black leather, which look sleek on screen, although they very from the comic book costumes. But do we really want to see what yellow spandex looks like when it isn't pencilled and inked by graphic artists, but is actually worn by Hugh Jackman? Probably not.

Also, there are too many mutants in this movie, as apposed to the first where there were to little. Many of the mutants have very small parts, and they even leave out mutants that were a key part in the second. The battle scenes seemed less real then the ones in the other two and the special effects were much worse. The movie is a good ½hour shorter then the second and much less deep. Overall I give this 7/10 stars, it was a very good movie, but not as good as X2, and extremely choppy is some parts.

1046,firewynd,Utter crap,1,29 May 2006,"*Spoilers*I loved the first two X-men movies, but this one was just a big pile of crap. This is a perfect example of how Hollywood ruins movies by having a completely retarded plot, bypassing character development, and just aims straight for all of the big special effects.This movie was one constant emotional crybaby movie. * Cyclops is freaking out and is all emotional. * The pheonix.. at times she does nothing but stand there for like 20 minutes, and other times she just flips out for no reason and just starts blowing crap up. She is just one emotional character all around. * Rogue - acts purely on emotion and gets the cure. * Xavier can be summed up by: No I'm NOT trying to control you! You must CONTROL your powers. LET ME HELP YOU. He says this about 15x times over and over. Its like his one liner. * Wolverine was about the only character who at least wasn't controlled purely by emotion. * Storm? I couldn't stand her. After Xavier dies, shes supposed to lead the Xmen - you know be a real leader. Instead shes flipping out, and giving ultimatiums to wolverine. Hmm wow really impressive leadership skills there.The whole ""hey we've traveled all the way from the east coast to the west coast with my mutant army, but cant cross a 2-3 mile stretch of ocean and now we are stumped"" scene was retarded. They are supposed to be attacking a base to get the kid - that should require surprise. But I know - LETS MOVE THE WHOLE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE cause that will LOOK COOL and everyone WILL LOVE IT - even though it makes absolutely NO SENSE and was purely an excuse to make some special effects. The marines at the base had like 5 minutes to react, and definitely knew they were coming. Real marines would have been sniping the heck out of them. Then all of the mutants just charge the marines not using any of their powers - yah real bright and realistic. The whole movie was this way. For the most part, no logic to any of their actions.

Here it is.,6,30 May 2006,"Being a late-comer to the X-Men cinematic franchise (not unlike the way I belatedly became a Matrix mark), I am blessedly free of the purist tendentiousness that so often biases reviews of comics-based movies of this sort. I also think that my relative disinterest in the behind-the-scenes goings-on about old directors leaving and new directors taking over frees me up to look at ""The Last Stand"" in its own light and in the context of the film trilogy itself.That said, my take on X-3 is pretty similar to what I thought about ""Revenge of the Sith"": it gave us only what we should have expected, and not much else.In ""Sith"" you knew what was going to happen - Anakin Skywalker turning to the dark side and becoming Darth Vader, the Republic crumbling into the Empire, the Jedi Order annihilated. In X-3, the ""war"" between mutants and the rest of humanity that had been the undercurrent of the first two films had to finally play out on the big screen.And it does, spectacularly. As I wrote about ""Attack of the Clones,"" the special effects X-3 are mind-blowing and more than justify the price of admission. Heck, what Magento does to the Golden Gate bridge does that all by itself. You can tell that by how it is only upon reflection afterward that you come to realize how thin and clichéd the plot (what there was of it) really is.There are two story tracks that have almost no connection with each other: Magneto's long-promised ""war"" and the resurrection of Dr. Jean Grey. Of the two, at least the former was established in the first two installments as a looming possibility; the latter existed only for the purpose of offing two central characters for no plot-evident reason, and the first fatality doesn't even take place on-screen. A rather ignominious end, it seems to me, especially as Grey ends up dying again at the end, and in highly implausible fashion.As to Magneto's gotterdammerung, it had a few good moments - his rebuke of Pyro for dissing the Professor, showing that even though the two mutant leaders ended up on opposite sides, they still had a bond of mutual respect; the aforementioned special effects, as when Magneto liberated Mystique from the police convoy by crushing and throwing aside cars and a semi truck like they were soda cans; and his smirk at a family on the Golden Gate bridge locking the doors to their car - but on the whole Magneto was reduced to a one-dimensional ""bwa ha ha ha"" villain. Before you could believe that he didn't see the irony in a survivor of the Holocaust becoming a racist, fascist, would-be tyrant; Ian McKellan brought a nobility that made his blinding self-righteousness understandable, almost compelling. It fit in with the moral conundrum of what to do about the ""mutant problem"" in general, and the eternal tension between security and safety on one hand and freedom and liberty for all on the other. Here Magneto was an unreasoning, tunnel-visioned baddie. Also appallingly stupid, as when he abandons a ""cured"" Mystique because she's no longer ""one of them,"" after she took the medicinal dart intended for him, which made an instant enemy of his closest associate who knew everything about all his plans. Dismissing all the followers he recruited as ""pawns"" to serve as cannon fodder was disappointing character contempt as well.Then again, the ""war"" itself was little more than a skirmish, despite all the pyrotechnics. Why didn't Magneto take a longer range view? Try to recruit more than just a few hundred followers, and from across the country - perhaps even in the government itself? Think big, like, say, nuclear blackmail (He COULD control metals, right?)? What did he have to gain by attacking Alcatraz besides eliminating the cure and its source, which was a purely defensive objective that would make him and his ""brotherhood"" even bigger targets?Magneto wasn't alone in being miniaturized, though. How is it that the government needed Mystique to find the ""brotherhood's"" secret staging area, but the whole inconspicuous lot of them marched right onto the Golden Gate bridge *against traffic*? And that six X-Men (and -Women) could take on hundreds of fellow mutants like the hero in a ""B"" kung fu flick? Oh, yeah, that's right, Storm - Halle Berry's snarl as she fried Callisto was tremendous.Ah, well. At least the introduction of several new mutants that get no development whatsoever is explicable. After all, you're not supposed to care about cannon fodder. Or, I suppose, a Cookie Monster-esquire Frasier Crane. And Iceman and Rogue do get satisfying development and a nice resolution to their romantic obstacle.Just one parting tip: Stay through the credits. You won't regret it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1048,mdavis4183,Killing Off X-men is BAD idea,7,30 May 2006,"FOX tries to kill any chance of another X-men series by killing off Pofessor X and Cyclops and removing Magneto's powers. I'm surprised Stan Lee agreed to this. Jean Grey does become the Phoenix. That is good. But I don't buy the army of mutants raised by Magneto or that Mystique could be so easily defeated. The real Magneto would not expose himself to the ""cure"" without a backup plan. Like a ""cure"" for the ""cure"".The X-men franchise is a license to print money. FOX must hate their investors to kill the franchise in three movies. Yeah, Halley Berry wanted out, but she's not the most important X-man.Shame on FOX. Shame on Marvel for allowing FOX to create this travesty.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1049,ceefactor,"Lived up to expectations, but never exceeded them.",7,31 May 2006,"I'm sure i'm not the only one that hung on for the final installment of X-Men, and although i didn't expect a mind-blowing finale (because, let's face it... very few are) i did expect it to follow along in the same style of it's predecessors. Unfortunately, it didn't. This is probably due to the fact that Bryan Singer didn't stick around to see this one out. But you also have to give credit to the new director - Singer was, and always will be, a hard act to follow. The storyline, as usual, was as good as it was believable. I wasn't disappointed on that front. I was, however, on the characterization of the cast. Unless you had seen the previous film/s, then you were left in the dark. You weren't given the chance to properly understand the characters or grow attached to them if this was the first time you had watched an X-Men movie. I also have to admit that a number of the new characters were not fleshed out at all - I was excited when i'd heard Ben Foster was in this, but it turned out that his character was barely mentioned. It was almost as if it was just an afterthought, a throw in. A character that was convenient to the plot, and had almost no substance. Although, thought must go out to the rather large cast - so many characters, and so little time to pay homage to them. There were also many unanswered questions, or many scenarios that weren't seen to the end. You often had to piece together afterward what had happened, and even when you did come to a conclusion, it still didn't put your mind to rest. But that is where the criticism ends. I believe that the X-men trilogy is one of the few Marvel movies that have turned out exceptionally well. Was i disappointed? No. I didn't leave the theater with a sense of 'but i wanted...'. I ate it all up, and enjoyed the final installment.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1050,rjcmt,This may spoil an already spoiled movie,4,31 May 2006,"Since the end of X2 I have been waiting for this movie, and now I know the meaning of the word ""disapointment."" The movie had great special effects, an amazing cast, and a story line that was so good it had to be made into a movie. Even with all these things going for the movie it was still awful. I want to know what responsibility if any the director felt to the fans who made the comic book so popular that it had to be turned into a movie. Everything that made the Phoenix saga so great, was taken away. Jean Grey barley spoke during the movie, we have no idea how she came to the point of being evil, she just was. They called her Phoenix, only once, and it wasn't even to her face! Hugh Jackman in the last 2 movies was great, now his role has become a far cry of what it used to be. I understand some things have to change so the story can be turned into a movie, but come on! One of the things that made Phoenix great was the bird effect, why the hell was that not in the movie? What I hated about the spider-man movie was shoots of people panicking, it was so cheesy and made the movie look so fake, I love the fact that Bryan Singer never did that, it felt like it was a real movie. The new director just made some superfical movie, that didn't give justice to the story, the actors, or the fans. If by chance he reads this I want a apology! Hell I want one from Bryan Singer for doing Superman the movie and leaving X3 in the hands of this butcher. But if you don't care about the story, and have never read the comics, and just want to see a summer movie, you will like it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1051,emma_sunbeam,"Good for the movie goer, OK for a true fan!",7,31 May 2006,"X:3 is a good movie, full of action and a plot that will have you rooting for the good guys! A fair few shocks will make you sit up in your seat with a butt kicking action packed finale, but will also leave you hoping that 20th Century Fox see sense to make X:4. An awful lot of detail and character development was left out and you may leave the cinema wondering what happened to certain characters and wishing other characters that remained in the background throughout the movie weren't developed more. The movie does stay true to the comics in a lot of ways, but lets itself down in others. For example, many other fab X-Men from the comics could (and should) have been introduced, like Gambit. Also, it would have been great to see the current X-Men's powers explored and developed more, like Rogue, Iceman, Collosus and Angel. Certainly, there is scope for a fourth movie, maybe with the current characters and certainly with the background characters from the first three AND new characters that are in the X-Men comics. I feel that the movie was left a little unfinished, a will-we, won't-we for a fourth movie.However, if X:4 is not to be, the director and the studio really should have known better! Having said all of that, it is a good movie, but it is just that.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1052,zenkitan,What a blockbuster failure!!,1,1 June 2006,"The story has been TWISTED, not like most comics blockbuster which are rewritten to create attraction and better action... Charles Xavier, Cyclops and Jeans deaths totally spoilt the entire show. The original story has been twisted beyond help. Charles should be rescued by illandra the shi'ar empress, whereas cyclops and jean has been transported to an alternate universe to raise cable. They also have a daughter rachael summers aka marvel girl and later becoming phoenix II. This show is totally made for Hugh Jackman and Halle Belle. It should named Wolverine & Storm instead of X-men. Well I guess the producers are giving the audience a message that there will not be a X-Men 4, as there is no more story to continue... Simon Kinberg, Zak Penn, Brett Ratner u are pissing off x-men fans. Last comment, watching a B-Grade movie is better than watching x-men!",X-Men - The Last Stand

Wovlerine soon finds himself doing the thing he hates the most being a leader. Beast played by Kesley Grammar is new to the Movies and is secutery of Mutant rights. Ben Foster plays Angel who's role should have been more involved with the film. It also showed the past of Jean Grey and how powerful she really is *Spoilers* Jean goes mad and kills Professor .X. and Cyclops, we learn that she is unstoppable it gets worse when she joins Magneto. Along back with the cast is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm, Ian Mkellen as Magneto, Shawn Ashmoore as Iceman, Aaron Stanford as Pyro and Anna Paqin as Rogue. Rogues role keeps viewers gripped without the film *SPOILERS* Weather she wants the cure or not. Rogue gets the cure and herself and Iceman can finally be together, we also see how much Mystiqie loves Magneto and she jumps infront of a bullet for him and she gets cured and he goes to dump her!, Vinnie Jones and Ellen Page as Juggernaut and Kitty Pryde are also new. Juggernauts role looks very cool and Kittys role has a crush on Iceman but it doesn't happen.

1054,SF_Omega,Great Action Movie - diverted from Marvel Intentions,8,3 June 2006,"I have to say that this movie was awesome in many ways. The action, the excitement, the emotional ties and the passion of the actors (and actresses) made this movie a pleasure to observe. Despite the fact that it was a great action movie, for those who followed the X-Men saga before this movie, there were a few, some very serious letdowns.--SPOILER BELOW-- In the movie, Professor Xavier divulges the information to Wolverine that Jean Grey was a ""the only Class Five Mutant"" he's ever seen. He continues to say that Jean Grey's power was limitless, and he knew that from when she was a child. He tells Wolverine that he suppressed her split personality that formed with psychic blocks, and that the impulsive, raging side of her was called ""The Phoenix"".--End Spoiler-- This is incredibly inconsistent with the comics. In the actual Marvel issue of X-Men, the Phoenix was an alien entity that was the sum of all life forces in the multiverse. It was the ultimate evolution - the God of Gods. In the comics (and cartoons), the Phoenix Saga began when the X-Men were coming back from an inter-stellar mission into Earth when something terrible happens. Jean Grey encompassed the ship with her telekinetic shielding and saved the crew. She, however, was considered dead. In actuality, the Phoenix heard Jean's death cry and entered her body. Jean Grey fell into the ocean and was found later. The Phoenix took on the shape of a fire bird for Jean (and rightfully so). This is how the *actual* Phoenix saga should have played on.Also, the class system they developed was very good at helping new fans of X-Men understand the power of others, but it did NOT accurately represent the power. Pyro, in no way, is on par with Magneto. Iceman was not given enough power in this movie as he is classified as an Omega class mutant (class 5 in the movie, if you are following).--SPOILER BELOW-- One thing I also don't understand is that Jean Grey was able to disintegrate the (until then) most powerful psychic ever to exist with ease, and yet she can't disintegrate Wolverine (who, if I had to place him in a class, would be either a 2 or a 3). Sure, he can heal quickly, but Jean's power is limitless. She could destroy planetary systems if she wished. I found it silly that she allowed Wolverine to get anywhere close to her. Could it have been possible that ""Jean"" was in control? Sure. Who knows. Just define it a little better and you'd have people following you.--End Spoiler-- Overall, this movie is absolutely worth seeing. Action, suspense, frightening power, great acting and incredible special effects make this movie a winner. Also, STAY FOR THE CREDITS! I won't tell you why, but trust me - you'll want to.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1055,sgt_pepper89,"Bryan Singer is Gone for this One, but Who Cares? =)",7,6 June 2006,"So, the guy who directed ""Rush Hour 2"" takes the helm of the latest X-Men installment. We knew he had big shoes to fill, but does he deliver? For the most part, yes.X-Men 3 is more blockbuster-y than its predecessors - faster-paced, more action, more excitement. I really enjoyed that.However, the story and plot got toned down. There's less of the drama and mutant anguish that were present in X-Men I/II. Ratner tries to develop it, but it never really fully blossoms. Maybe it's the fact that the movie was only 104 minutes long. If it had been a good two hours long (or maybe more, considering this was the last installment) there could've been much more character and story development.Now, the plot was mediocre at most. There was nothing really original about it or intriguing - it just kept the action going. It was built on the foundation of the action, and that's what blockbuster films usually do. I only wish Ratner didn't kill off so many main characters... it kind of made their deaths shallow, and left me unfazed... ""OH, ANOTHER ONE DIES""... that's kind of what went through my head...Anyway, this movie was highly enjoyable, lot's of fun, but it's nothing particularly deep or involved as the other two. Hey, it's summer! Let your brain rest a bit and enjoy a dumbed-down movie.By the way, stay at the end of the credits ;) It kind of makes you wish they'd make another one...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1056,candace-37,Good popcorn movie,7,7 June 2006,"At the start of the year, this movie, along with Pirates 2 and Underworld 2, was one of a short list of must sees, and possibly the one I was most excited about due to Dark Phoenix.I'll admit I never read the comics, but I did a little 'Net research on their back story a few months before this came out.They aren't faithful to original ""Phoenix"" story, so if that's what you are looking for you will be disappointed. IN some ways though, I find this Phoenix a more interesting one than the original comics character, who was an alien intelligence inside the body of Jean.The movie zipped along nicely, and I felt it was worth the price of admission. I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing, and didn't find the prior 2 to be either. I'd have to say this was about what I expected, and I enjoyed it.

X-Men III did, in fact, scrape the bottom of the barrel. Then they took the barrel and threw it at you, knocked you out of your seat, then beat you over the head with it! We actually saw this movie as an after-thought. We went to see ""The Break-up"" but it was sold out. My wife and I both want to go see this movie again.

1058,shafcrawler1990,"Overall, a great experience with a beautiful story",9,19 June 2006,"Well, the movie may be what some may call a letdown, but to true comic fans, the movie is a must-see. Brett Ratner has been able to catch the exact persona that the characters are supposed to have. True, most characters do not get such major parts in the movie, but whatever they get, you can rest assured that they will be behaving exactly the way you would expect them to from the comics. From the insecurity of Rogue, to the sentiments of Kitty Pryde, to the ferocity of Callisto and of course, the madness of Dark Phoenix, one gets exactly what one pays for. This is a trait that the previous movie (X2) lacked (especially Lady Deathstrike.....what was that?).Leaving the characters behind, the movie sports a good plot, showing the ultimate reason why Magneto and his new Brotherhood rise up for a final battle against humans. The Phoenix story is much clearer than from the comics. And this movie also shows the gruesome aspects of Jean's dual persona. One thing that seemed worthless in the movie is the Worthington plot. There was no need to bring Angel or his father into the movie. They totally messed that up. Instead, they could have focused more on Rogue or Iceman. The movie lacked a major character - Emma Frost. This was a movie that the character was designed to be in. Another character that was hardly introduced was Psylocke. While the plot was good, I couldn't help but ask, ""how did the X-Men know exactly what Magneto was planning and where he was going?."" Thus, the bringing of another Psychic after ---------------'s demise seemed fitting.The ending was quite abrupt and there should have been a bit more elaboration. But overall, this movie is something that you would want to see over and over again (I watched it seven times in the theaters in India).

The movie doesn't really capture much of the xmen story or world, and way too much of the movie is done with CGI. CGI take away all charm and elagence all emotion and depth, it turns it into mindless trash. I was also disappointed to see that night crawler wasn't going to make an aperance, they even went to to the church where he lives in xmen 2 the opening he was part of one of the most exciting action scenes ever, i was also disappointed in angel and the jugarnaught. the movie trailers also had promised sentinals, which is partly why I went to go see this movie, and was terribly disappointed to see that there was only 1 and it was in the danger room. I did like seeing and aperance of the danger room thou. I was not happy to see what they did with beast either, the ending makes me think they are going to make another one, possibly a prequel or a fourth one, considering this movie is called the last stand I would feel terrible knowing I gave them a box office sale contributing to them making another disappointment and to have them shame the xmen name once again.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The first two movies were for fans of the X-Men and film, whereas this movie was for fans action and special effects.Anyone who knows anything about the X-Men will definitely agree that this movie is garbage.

I hear everyone talking about the ""4th movie"". i dunno how they're possibly going to throw together a 4th w/ no characters. Cyclops, Professor Xavier, Jean Grey, Mystique, Rogue, Magneto....they're all gone. Sure, yeah if you pay attention to the end of the film they make foreshadow a 4th movie, but that guarantee's nothing. The main thing that upset me about the LAst Stand was during the final fight scene when Wolverine (or whoever...I could only sit through the movie once, so i can't remember who exactly said the line) ""We are outnumbered..."" What had happened to Nightcrawler? And what about the small appearances of Jubilee in the first two films? And was it really necessary to kill off Cyclops in the first 5 minutes of the movie? Lets just say, I was happy to be out of the theater once the credits started rolling. I give it a 5 for special effects but that doesn't make up for a poorly constructed plot, script, etc. If they do make a 4th, I hope Bryan Singer's backs at the reins.

1062,sirin-allerdyce,great,10,12 July 2006,"x-men 3 was great! although the 2nd might have been a bit better it was overall good. When MAgneto(a mutant who can control metal) plans on killing the cure(a substance for getting rid of mutant powers)the only thing that stands in his and his armys way is the x-men. Magneto would harm anyone who gets in his way, and as much as the x-men dislike the cure they have too stop him. well that is sort of a lie, rouge wants the cure to be able to touch people and thats what she did. If you've seen the 2nd one at the end pyro(john allerdyce) leaves with Magneto so now he's hot and a villain. JEan is also a villain. Yes i know she ""died"" but she really didn't & became the Phoenix. Jean kills Scott and the professor, but at the end wolverine stabs her to save humanity. Kitty Pryde is a new character. She and bobby have a thing going on. Thats the main reason rouge got the cure. So when magnetos army goes to Alcatraz(where the cure is made) to kill the source of the cure, a little mutant boy(well not so little) named leech. Leech can take away mutants powers, like rouge but without pain. Lucky for him the x-men go to Alcatraz to stop magneto. While bobby fights his old friend pyro, kitty goes to save leech. the beast is also a big help for the x-men. the beast is a mutant who is the secretary of the .U.S. At the end of the battle wolverine distracts Magneto and the beast stabs 4 needles of the cure into Magneto. when the x-men have the funeral for jean and Scott rouge comes back and can touch ppl again. the ending is very good that makes you want to see more at the end magneto is playing a game of chest by him self with chest pieces, just when u think OMG Magnetos a human he moves a chest piece without touching it and the chest piece was made of metal...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1063,BWeManX1026,"Great Concept, Rushed Execution. 7/10",7,13 July 2006,"Like it's predecessors, X-Men: The Last Stand has stunning visual and audio effects that leave you in awe. However, I suppose we'll start with the cons. There were only 3 major downfalls in the movie that I saw:1. It barely followed the original comics. 2. It lacked a handful of certain characters. 3. It felt like it was rushed at times.I don't know what happened to the character of Cyclops when X-Men hit the movies. He played a significant role in the first movie, which was good considering he's supposed to be the 'squad leader of the X-men'. In the second movie his role took a sharp dive and he netted screen time of about 10 minutes. Basically he goes with Prof. X to meet Magneto, they get captured, he disappears for an hour or two, he fights Jean, they make up, and that's about his role in a nutshell. By time the third movie rolls around, he's just dead. Just as your starting to grasp the opening story in the third movie, they just tell you he's dead. Somehow I thought the squad leader of the X-Men would have a slightly more significant roll in their 'last stand'.Another character that's randomly missing is Nightcrawler. They don't make an attempt to justify his absence or even mention him for that matter. He did great in the second movie so I was almost positive he would be back, but I guess I was wrong. I wish before the 'last stand' they could have chosen to not say ""There's only six of us."". I guess Gambit, Nightcrawler, Jubilee, and a few others chose their life over making a stand.I was very content with the scene where Jean was trashing the house up when Prof. X was trying to console her. However, other than that and a few minutes near the end of the movie, the Phoenix never really goes around on a blood-lust killing spree. This didn't take from the overall movie, but it would have been nice to see more Phoenix-effects. The biggest downfall was how short the movie turned out to be. There was such a great deal happening that the movie flies right by. The whole thing is action-packed and does a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat, but at times there is so much action going on it can be overwhelming and rushed. What - Cyclops died? The professor is gone?With that said, we can move onto the pros of the movie. Despite the lack of a few characters, many more have joined the fray. People like Kitty, Colossus, Beast, Angel, Juggernaut, Multiple-Man, and Spyke will enter the film. The list goes on but those were a few of the ones I noted. There are so many mutants flashing around at different times it can be hard to catch them all.If nothing else, the one thing the movie succeeded at was closure. *WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET* I doubt they'll make a fourth movie, but if they do I have no idea what it could possibly be about. Ultimately, Cyclops, Jean, and the Professor are dead. Mystique and Rogue are regular humans, and the once powerful Magneto has become a useless old man who can barely make a chess-piece wobble. (Although this does hint that he's getting his powers back, I somehow don't think Magneto will threaten the world with his almighty ability to slightly wobble a single chess-piece) On top of that, Beast has apparently succeeded at making Mutant-Human relations peaceful again. That just about wraps up every single conflict ever arisen in the X-Men movies. The Wolverine-Cyclops-Jean love triangle is gone, Magneto and the brotherhood are apparently dissolved, Prof. X is 'dead', Iceman and Rogue can have normal relations, and everyone's happy and peace-loving again. Doesn't leave a lot of leeway for a fourth movie.Again another great feature of the movie, as to be expected from the trilogy, is the amazing special effects. Early on you get to see Magneto crushing cars and throwing them out of the way like nothing. Pyro and Iceman have a short but sweet fight, and Wolverine fights a few bouts with Juggernaut, Spyke, and various other random generic mutants. Possibly the coolest effect in the entire movie was at the end. Wolverine's dramatic walk towards the Phoenix while being constantly pelted by her Phoenix-ness. His skin gets torn apart time and time again but it keeps regenerating due to his healing ability. On a side note I think people found it amusing that his shirt was blown to shreds in the first hit, yet his pants managed to survive around 20. Thank god for armored pants.Overall, it gets a 7 out of 10 for the new characters, sweet effects, and general all-around closure of the film. It loses the last 3 points for failure to follow the original story, the complete lack of Cyclops or Nightcrawler, and the rushed feeling of the film.",X-Men - The Last Stand

However, I just didn't feel very emotionally involved with the characters in this film. I felt the story just never allowed the characters to grab the viewer's interest. I also thought that some characters weren't given enough involvement while others were given far too much. I think the director spent more time on the special effects, which were excellent, instead of spending time on character development.

1065,tobiasreaper,Good Action - Bad Sequel,5,1 October 2006,"If you love action that's loud and that just gets bigger and bigger then i suppose you'd love this movie, then again, if your looking for closure on the first two X-Men movies then you might want to wait for another X-Men...It was a fun movie to look at but there's not much more to offer here. There are far too many flaws that just jump out at you. I'm an X-Men fan, so when i see something that just doesn't look right in a movie like this it just annoys me. Firstly, Cyclops, wasn't really important in this movie. He was in the movie a total of about 10 minutes and was just kinda pushed aside. Then there's Juggernaut, what were they thinking casting Vinnie Jones of all people to play him. He should have been WAY bigger also (about 12 foot tall). Even though he's the professors brother, they didn't even look at each other when their paths crossed in the movie, *cringe* not quite the reunion i had expectedI was also disappointed with the unimportance of angel in the film. He's on the DVD case large as life and they thought it important to make his appearance at the beginning of the film (before the credits) longer than the rest of the film. Nightcrawler was NOWHERE to be seen. One of the pivotal characters in the second film, although he survived, wasn't even mention once in the third.It was also far too short, 99 minutes for the 'last stand' just isn't enough time to end this kind of film series.And finally, there's the ending, we're left without the professor and magneto has lost his powers (it seems like it's over alright). Ten minutes later it shows magneto playing chess with metal pieces, he extends his arm and suddenly one of the pieces move. After the credits it shows the professor on a hospital bed (SOMEHOW) and we're back to square one... Either end the movie or don't!I expected a better finale than this, but it just seemed to go the way of the matrix revolutions and terminator 3...downhill",X-Men - The Last Stand
1066,flysea,this is a bad movie for comic book fans but good,6,10 October 2006,here is the problem with this movie. 1. to short 2. does not stick with comic books spoiler 3. the movie says it is the last film but leaves open for another 1 4. no character development here is the deal the movie is character driven like singers version. and if you have seen this film then you know what i am talking about. i don't know why they could not get Joss Wendon to direct he writes astonishing xmen(spoiler the cure is based on joss wendon astonishing xmen) there is no live this film like the others. i was giving Brett a benefit of a doubt. and xmen will end with the bad guy being apocalypses(he is not in the movie not a spoiler) but it is good film if you don't lick comic books and never read 1but don't take my opinion on this go see it if you want.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1067,mooselover34,X men 3 oddly good!,8,13 October 2006,"Now i'm not exactly an X-men fan, but when I saw this film i was surprised. Usually I don,t take too well to Marvel films, but this one gets 2 thumbs up. The action scenes are plentiful, along with decent special effects. All the acting was good, but the only real problem I had was the lack of screen time for certain characters, by which I mostly mean Angel. He has one short scene in the beginning as a kid, another short scene when he is about to take the treatment, and 1 or 2 other 3 second scenes.All in all, I think Brett Ratner was a good choice for a director, he delivered one of the few movies people can honestly say does not stop handing out action sequences. Recommended to any X-men fan.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1068,assasinno1,the best of the trilogy,9,2 July 2007,this is the best film of the trilogy..it has more action and better visuals than the previous x-men films ...Jean Grey is amazing as dark phoenix and storm is the best character in this movie..however i believe it would have been better if it was a longer film..the second film was longer..i would like another x-men movie although 3 important mutants have died in this one..and i don't understand why..in the anime series Xavier eliminates dark phoenix and saves jean ..if you want to have fun and enjoy great action this movie is for you..as a fan i'm not disappointed although i know it could have been a longer film with more Roque(she is an important character in the anime series),X-Men - The Last Stand
1069,yellow_voltage,great film!,9,6 January 2007,"OK so the movie starts off pretty well in the danger room in Xavier's school for gifted youngsters and ends with an amazing all out war in the end. with stunning special effects an amazing story this addition to the x-men films is quite incredible, wolverine is an amazing character(my favorite: the forest fight man that was cool and at jeans house vs juggernaut lol even though he got his ass kicked.)Scott dies right away which i found to be a disappointment, but w/e they had their reasons i guess. iceman is a pretty cool character and colossus also kitty and beast as well I'm glad they gave the students more of a role in this film especially since they were kinda ignored in the first 2. colossus didn't get much of a role though but he was OK iceman vs pyro was pretty cool and kitty vs juggernaut storm was better than ever, yup overall a good film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1070,arsx,Awesome Awesome Awesome,10,6 February 2007,"This was the best X-men movie so far! ~Wolverine is so hot.~ I was not really surprised when Jean Grey popped out after Scott pretty much blew up the ocean. I didn't like him in this movie because Scott is just a blubbery baby. I mean, sure, his wife just died. But still, he didn't have to be such a jerk to Logan just because he was in a bad mood. The make out seen between Jean and Wolverine is really long. They really do seem like they like each other, though. But was it really necessary when she, like, whipped his belt off? I am so happy that they didn't have you-know-what or else the movie would be rated R. The ending made me cry! The ending was so sad. I can quote the movie:Dark Phoenix: You'd die for them? Wolverine: No, not for them. For you. Jean Grey: (Starting to cry) Save me... Wolverine: (Sobbing) I love you... (stabs Jean in the stomach) Noooo!!!Isn't that sad, but beautiful? That's why I liked this movie. Plus, Bobby is hot.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1071,deron-7,"What an awful, awful film. We're talking Jaws: The Revenge awful here.",1,3 February 2007,"Brett Ratner is an American Uwe Boll with bigger budgets. This film has not a single redeeming quality, and you feel bad for the actors as they attempt to make such lines as ""Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut, b***h!"" and ""Way to go, Furball"" sound like anything other than the monkey pee that they are. No wonder Xavier seems to be smiling in his last scene -- it's his last scene. The miserable screenplay does its best to refer to story lines from the comic book, but they are treated like riffs rather than actual themes to be explored. Juggernaut is presented as being able to smash through walls -- except for one wall which knocks him unconscious -- except he'd just smashed through a wall of the same material a moment earlier. If God exists, S/He will strike this film from our consciousnesses and then have some real director make a real 3rd X-Men film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1072,qbwillia,Horrible!,1,27 May 2006,"Please don't believe the hype. This movie was horrific. I saw it on its opening night in Miami, FL and left the theater in disgust. At first I thought I was the only one that hated it until I stood outside of the theater and got to listen to some of the other theater go-ers.First, the plot was too convoluted. There was way too much going on and it seemed that the editor got way too happy slicing and dicing the movie into pieces. For one, you never got a solid answer on what happened to Cyclops. Yes, you could infer what happened, but it seemed like it was a top secret event as to what happened to him.Also, Halle Berry's role seemed a bit diminished in this film. I thought for an A-list actress, that she would get more lines or at least a monologue. However, once again, this movie was about Wolverine. I guess out of all of the X-men characters, he is the most entertaining (to some). Magneto spent a lot of time on the screen as well and Rogue, was (again) reduced to the sidelines. Bobby and Pyro got more lines than Rogue and Storm combined.I'm so sorry that the original director didn't stay with the movie. For if he had, we would have been able to watch a more tasteful movie instead of the drivel I got free tickets to peruse.See if it you want, but be forewarned--- your I.Q. will dramatically suffer.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1073,Chris_G_Parsons,X-men 3,4,26 September 2009,"This film was really bad, especially coming from X2 which was such a well paced, acted and directed film. Now we have Brett Ratner, the guy who directed the cheese-ball 'Rush Hour' series (which I am not a fan of) at the helm of X3. He somehow took the seriousness they managed to earn from the first two movies and pull a Schumaker on it. Everything in X3 was exaggerated and cheesy looking and the whole finale was underwhelming.It was definitely the worst in the series, if only they had picked someone else to direct this we would have 3 respectable X-men films,and possibly a fantastic finale. Even if the first one was boring, at least it's there to develop characters. The second film will always be the best in my opinion. I thought this was a worse 3rd part than The Matrix Revolutions.Ratner please stay away from comic book franchises, they aren't your thing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1074,dancouls,Xcellent film,8,8 June 2006,This is definitely the best X-Men film that has been made. It contains the right balance of surprise and the old elements from the other two films. There was even a hint of a forth film at the very end.There were a few surprises such as Xavier being killed off so early in the plot of the film and Jean Gray allying with Magneto but these were done very well. they also added to the film and left people thinking.It was good to finally see Beast in the series and I was surprised that he was left until now because he was an integral character in the animated series.The other new characters also blended in well and I was impressed with the mutant who could detect other mutants. It seemed like a mobile version of Cerebro.Speaking about Cerebro I was surprised it wasn't featured in this film because Xavier would have been able to detect Jean using that if her powers were not able to block it.There were hints for a forth film because of the end scene with Magneto and the chess piece twitching and the person in the coma who sounded like Xavier.On the whole it was very well done and a thrilling film to watch.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1075,tolkien_18,"Enjoyable, Satisfying Conclusion",7,30 May 2006,"I must be one of the few, it seems, who enjoyed X-Men: The Last Stand. I have been an X-fan for many years and my expectations were still met by this film. Do I think that it could have been a bit better? Certainly. The script seemed to pack too many elements into a short running time. With those issues solved I believe that it would have been fantastic. Still, I felt that X-3 was almost on the level with X-2's greatness. It has taken another viewing and some time to reach this point. At first, I felt betrayed at the many liberties taken with story elements. But after I left the theatre, I could not shake the feeling that I needed to view it again. After the second time, I came to grips with the film and now like it quite a bit. Contrary to some critics' reviews, I do not believe that X-3 became overshadowed by action. There really is quite little of it until the finale, which feels quite epic. There are excellent character moments sprinkled throughout. The acting is generally superb across the board. More Ian McKellen is always nice, and Hugh Jackman impresses again with Wolverine. Kelsey Grammar actually does a respectable job with Beast. The other characters all do well with what they are given. There are a few poorly written one-liners that reminded me of the ones in X-Men 1, but the script is mostly intelligent with powerful themes such as the Cure. Another difficulty is that the film cannot pay the proper amount of attention to the many characters, including the new ones. But they still all seem to contribute something to the larger plot movement in the film. Ratner's only obvious difference from Singer is his frenetic pacing and energy. X-3 really moves quickly, and this does not have to be a negative. I also enjoyed the emotion that was hinted at in X-2, and came into full force during X-3. I do not think that it reached sentimentality or was melodramatic; it really felt powerful. The stakes really do seem to be high for the final chapter of this trilogy. The viewer finds this out quickly concerning Cyclops and Mystique, later with Jean and Xavier (in a particularly awe-inspiring scene), and during the finale in a nice moment with Jean and Wolverine. I think that many of the problems people are seeing in the film resulted from the pressure the entire production team was placed under in order to develop and finish the entire film in less than a year. But all in all, I have really come to enjoy it as a satisfying film that met my high expectations. Look at it this way if you must. Try to see X-3 as not a stand-alone film but more as the third portion of one large story. The first X-Men had the difficult job of introducing a large ensemble cast of mutants and establishing a story and tone (other superhero films with one primary character have it much easier). X-2 had the most enviable position as most of the characters had already been partly developed and it did not have to conclude the entire story. It could work mostly on its own, just having to leave threads open for the next one. X-3 had the extremely difficult task of closing out the entire trilogy for good. I see it more as the third portion of one expansive tale, thus in the larger scheme it must move quickly toward a complete conclusion. In my opinion, the many actors under the abrupt switch in direction did an x-cellent job.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1076,feebles_,"Not with a bang, but with a whimper",1,27 May 2006,"If I knew where Brett Ratner lived, I would go to his house and demand a refund. And then I'd slap him, at least once. Why? I paid to see a movie. What I saw was a series of protracted, absurd special effects set pieces that were neither relevant nor interesting. There was no story, calling the characters two-dimensional would be generous and movie didn't even GO anywhere. Everything was completely unbelievable and boring. X2 had my heart RACING and I was on the edge of my seat within the first 5 minutes. This didn't happen once during this movie. Not even close.Every single thing was just ridiculous. For example, the big, super-important lab is on Alcatraz. ALCATRAZ. Not only is Alcatraz Island a National Park, but the place barely has power and running water. Secure facility my ass. It was a extremely forced and hackneyed setup for the bridge scene. Now, this bridge scene was cool, but the garbage with Alcatraz was completely unnecessary. Granted, the script was written by the geniuses behind xXx2 (yea, the one with Ice Cube), Elektra and Last Action Hero. But still, it was abominable.X3 was horrid. Abjectly horrid. It wasn't that it was objectively bad, I've certainly seen worse movies. But compared to the other two movies, it was garbage. Less than garbage. I'm really sad and disappointed that this series ended with such a whimper, and not a bang.X-Men and X2 were strong because they were character-driven films. Sure, there were neat special effects and such, but they were secondary to telling a story about PEOPLE. It's about xenophobia, racism, ethos and exactly what it means to be guardians of those that hate you. They were intelligent movies that had something interesting to say and a strong story to tell. X3, on the other hand, was a vehicle for another special effects spectacle, and the story was just an afterthought and an excuse for more fire, explosions and other garbage.The worst part is Bryan Singer said he would have loved to make this movie after he finished with Superman Returns, but Fox insisted on going on without him. I hate Fox. Loathe, really.All the interesting characters were completely transparent and marginalized. How many lines did Angel have? Around 5? About the same for Rogue, and Jean (and almost all of those were, ""BLAAARGHH! I'm craaaazy!"") and on and on... Characters who used to be interested and deep, I didn't care about at all. Any relationship that even start to be explored was completely abandoned. Angel's relationship with his father? NOTHING happens. Bobby-Kitty-Rogue love triangle? Just sort of goes away. In fact, the only character that had more lines was Halle Berry and what a joy that was. Her deadpan and banal eulogy was beyond painful to listen to. It's like she was talking about the president of the company, not someone who was as a father, mentor, role model and friend. It was painfully obvious that Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and the others were doing only what professionalism required.I'm not disappointed because this wasn't like the comics, because, honestly, the entire Dark Phoenix thing from the comics was beyond stupid. ""Not only is she a clone, but she's a clone from OUTER SPACE."" The other movies were good because they were grounded, and didn't have any of the outer space/extra-dimensional/other absurd crap going on.I'm disappointed because a phenomenal series that (along with Spider-Man) demonstrated that comic book movies can be intelligent, serious and mature has devolved into the worst Hollywood has to offer. I haven't been this disappointed in a movie in a long, long time. The only way this could have been worse would have been if Michael Bay had directed it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1077,mrowland,"Solid, Solid Movie",10,26 May 2006,"After hearing so many negative reviews and lukewarm ""positive"" reviews by the so-called experts, I went into the theater tonight with my wife halfway expecting to walk out disappointed. I can honestly say that this movie is just as good if not just a tad better than X-Men, though X2 is still, by far, the best of the three.What kept this movie from being as touching and hitting as X2 was that it seemed to lack the emotional intensity that X2 delivered. Now, the script had it's chances, including the climatic scene and the surprise towards the beginning that I didn't see coming, but I didn't feel ""stirred"" like I did in X2 when Jean sacrificed herself and Logan and Scott were losing all emotional control. Part of my theory is that music goes a long way in making you feel really emotional to a character: a la Luke's theme in Star Wars. The music that was playing when Jean was about to sacrifice herself was heartfelt, touching, and gut-wrenching; because you KNEW what was happening and the music's sad, mellow, and touching sound just tugged at you. That wasn't the case in X3.There was more than enough material here to make this a 140 minute epic. It had plenty of source material to do so. It will be interesting to see what the reason was that they decided to go with 104 minutes. Maybe then they could have beefed up a few rolls. I'm not complaining though; it was solid entertainment and I thoroughly enjoyed it.My favorite aspect of this movie is that it still showed the humanity of the mutants, especially Magneto. Those who have no empathy are left in the dust. It was especially nice when Magneto chastised Pyro in a particular scene. Sorry, can't detail it without giving a spoiler! This was a very good movie and a good way to send off this trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1078,surflou,A Comic Book Nerd's Worst Nightmare,3,29 June 2008,"With exception to the action scenes which were great, this third X-Men film should not have been made without Bryan Singer - although given the fact that he left this project to work on an equally bad movie - Superman Returns, maybe not...The storyline is good enough and the action and effects are top notch as I was expecting, but to fans of the X-Men comics, this was quite simply a sham.There is SO much wrong with this movie I don't even know where to begin! Leech isn't a young white boy, he is a small green mutant, Kid Omega doesn't have spines protruding from his body, that is quill, yet this guy resembles Quill more than Kid Omega but is credited as the latter. Psylocke isn't bad, she is one of the X-Men not one of Magnetos gang - although in one comic series she is a member of the Hellfire Club.There are a ton of other mistakes in the movie which makes it just plain disappointing for fans of X-Men like myself.

Brett Ratner did a very good job and i was a bit sceptical because Bryan Singer dropped out and then nobody else wanted to do it but this movie was awesome. All the characters were great although i was really gutted with the lack of screen time given to cyclops and the fact that he died along with other major characters. That is my only negative point regarding the film. If you are a fan of X-Men you have to see it and if you are not a fan you still have to see it. I thoroughly recommend it. Brilliant film",X-Men - The Last Stand
1080,x2OhSeven,New director destroyed the chance for a great trilogy.,6,30 May 2006,"First of all - this new director blew it. Not only did he manage to kill off a number of decent characters in horribly lame ways, but he also destroyed some of the most interesting stories within the X-men saga. The way he portrayed Phoenix - lame. Archangel - lame. Beast - lame. Everything - lame. It seemed he was just interested in tossing in as many characters and powers as possible in a short amount of time. Even the battle scenes were weak. Overall a poor quality movie and a very disappointing member of the X-men movie family. I would recommend seeing it on video if anything. I hear they are not going to make another film unless the old director comes back; good call on their part. Maybe they should have waited to do the film until AFTER superman was finished so they could have had the director and Cyclops back in it full time.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1081,Reilly_m88,Last Stand = SUCK,3,7 May 2009,"First off Brett Ratner is a good director i liked all the Rush Hours and everything, but for me personally as someone who loved the first 2 X-Men movies and have grown up with the series i have to say that The Last Stand SUCKED.Compared to the other X-Men movies this one is no good. the story was thrown together and did not really work with the rest of the X-Men universe. The most annoying thing that bothered me personally was how they took the character Juggernaut and completely changed everything about him. They also took one of my favorite X-Men, Angel and turned him into a EMO loser. There are a many more mistakes throughout the film, which i will not go into right now.As i said before Brett is a good director and everything but i don't think that he was the right choice for this film at all. But if you really don't care about the X-Men and are just looking for a action movie go right ahead and watch this but you have been warned.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1082,Applerod,"Low on drama, high on action/entertainment",8,27 May 2006,"First, I'll explain where I'm coming from. I did not grow up with the X-Men, though I did read a few comics here and there. More recently, I've started reading some of the original comic books. The interviews with the old director(Brian Singer) and the new director (Brett Ratner) revealed to me that Singer is an extremely intelligent and thoughtful individual. Ratner appears less thoughtful and more pretentious. The films reflect this difference in their character to a certain extent. I went into the movie with lowered expectations. Whereas the first two films were roughly 2/3 drama and 1/3 action, the final film trades most of the drama for action. In this way, the first two films seem much more ""realistic"" than the final film, which is more cartoonish. That's not necessarily a bad thing if you're coming to the movie to be entertained; and in that department, it is definitely successful. This is the kind of film that does well at the box office, but rather poorly in the reviews, because you can only go so far in analyzing the special effects before you have to turn to the plot and the acting.The first two films were character-driven; this one is not. The plot in the final film is really just a vehicle for the action. The humans have found a ""cure"" for mutantism (new word) and the mutants are once again divided as to how to react to this. That's about it. On a more personal level, we do get to to see a few plot twists, a bunch of new characters, and what becomes of Jean Grey. The main new character, Beast, is well played by Kelsey Grammar. Unfortunately, having virtually the only character in the movie that looks non-human spout extraordinarily intelligent lines doesn't translate perfectly to the film. -That is a lesser point; but overall there is no character development beyond that which is a fundamental part of the plot. I also would have liked to have seen Angel get more screen time. It's not as if there is zero drama. There is drama, and some of it is quite effective. It's just too sparse to maintain any real cohesion. You would expect to see the most action in the final film of a trilogy like this; but it's possible to interweave that action with drama--like Peter Jackson did fantastically in the final installment of Lord of the Rings.The film was better than I thought it was going to be, and I was tremendously entertained. This is the kind of movie you want to see on the big screen, because the action and special effects are so extensive and awesome in and of themselves. Just remember that this is the work of a different director.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1083,dantheman328,Enjoyable yet a little disappointing.,7,27 May 2006,"WARNING: SPOILERS!!! are ahead.X-Men: The Last Stand is an enjoyable melodramatic film but also a disappointment to the first 2 X-Flicks. The ""final"" product feels rushed and simply doesn't seem to be connected to X1 or X2. The reason I emphasize on the word ""Final"" is the fact that I believe there was more of a influence by the studio, Fox, in the final saying of what is put into the ""final"" product that is X-Men: The Last Stand.Remember Fox did the same to Daredevil. For those that don't know the film adaption of the comic book: Daredevil was butchered by the studio execs that 30 minutes worth of film was taken out. A Directer's Cut DVD of DareDevil is available and is worth checking out. I believe their was a lot more footage/scenes to this X-Men were left on the editing room and it shows with scenes that are shown in the trailers were missing in the ""final"" product. Hopefully these rumor footage/scenes are reinserted in a Directer'Cut DVD, with certain scenes in the film taken out of course. One or thousands of X-Men and comic book fans can hope can they?The Writers did their best to save Cycolps/Scott Summers from ""death"" leaving a option for him to return. A reason for the character for being killed off was due to James Marsden's(the actor who plays Scott) appearance in the new Superman movie. Fox again having their evil ways. :Sign:With all ranting aside...Overall did I enjoy the movie? Yes. It was enjoyable. I love Ian McKellen as Magneto, Famke Janssen as Jean Grey/Phoenix and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. I was hoping for something more though. I enjoyed the action and Kelsey Grammar as Beast.

1084,cammie352,Go muties!,6,31 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand had the action the first two never had, but lacks of the story the previous movies had. Still, it's a great movie... in its own way. There have been mixed reviews and I must say some of the negatives one are only negative because of Ratner (truth is, I don't miss Singer, at all). Now, in my opinion, I wouldn't blame the director for the movie's mistakes; with more time and a better script, this movie would top X2 (my favorite of the three), so, Ratner did his best with what he had and did it well.* What I loved - Phoenix, Magneto and the action. Phoenix rocked, truly rocked. She scared the hell out of me and that scene at Jean's house/Xavier's death was the best of the movie, probably my favorite of all 3 movies. It was so powerful, emotional and sad.Magneto - Ian McKellen was awesome, as usual. He looked even more powerful and determined in this one. I wanted to kill him when he abandoned cured Mystique, but also got sad when he got cured and excited when moved the chess piece.And the action - well, I don't need to say much, you can't see it for yourself. The lack of story didn't bother me as much as thought it would. We finally saw the X-Men fighting, the final battle blew me away.* What I didn't like - the running time and editing. Twenty more minutes wouldn't hurt, it'd actually be great for the movie. And the edition, well, it kinda bugged me in some parts, but nothing that'd deeply hurt the movie.As I give X2 a 10/10, I'd give this one 8/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1085,AnimeGirl918,Best out of the Trilogy,10,24 May 2006,"The Last Stand greatly surpasses the other two movies, which is saying something. I had to wait 2 hours in line to see the movie before it comes out on Friday, but it was very worth it. The movie wastes no time getting right into the plot. You stay on the edge of you seat the entire movie! You will laugh, cry and maybe even jump from fright! Several characters were never introduced, including Gambit. And Nightcrawler is no where to be seen. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that it kinda had a ""This happened and don't worry about how."" I think that they should have added about 30 minutes onto the movie to make it more in depth but I understand that that would have cost a lot of money.The movie has a very exciting plot that will make you hold your breath until the very end.

1086,trecool14,"If your not a fan already, steer clear.",3,26 June 2006,"I don't read the comics, I've only seen the first X-Men film, and I waltzed into my local theatre this afternoon with a very good friend of mine, having nothing better to do. My expectations of this film were consequently not high, my demand only for some light entertainment, something to pass the time. Oh dear.Credit to the actors, there were moments of tension and drama in this film despite an appalling script. My heart goes out to whoever played the president of the United States (again Hollywood plays it safe by casting a generic old guy in this role) who had to hold a straight face when introducing the latest American ambassador to the U.N. as a 7 foot hairy blue thing, and whilst delivering lines such as ""then God help us"". Another cringe-worthy moment was Hugh Jackman's admirable attempt at yet ANOTHER repeated two-word sentence, in this case; ""It's over....it's over..."". Poor Hugh. Who on earth talks like this in real life, and why does Hollywood continue to inflict this kind of plastic text upon its actors? Script aside, if you're not a member of what seems to be a near fanatical X-men cult following, you wont get this movie. OK, so perhaps its not a movie that you're supposed to ""get"", after all, one could argue the prospect of mutants being able to manipulate their own bodies and the elements around them to be too fantastical to be worthy of criticism, but for an outsider, unfamiliar to the X-men world, it all seems utterly ridiculous. I can handle the powers, the struggle of responsibility that goes with them, yadda yadda yadda, but why oh why must these powers accompany a daft hair-cut? A stupid costume? Why does Magneto, one of the most powerful beings in the universe and capable of moving the entire Golden Gate bridge with a flick of his wrist, feel the need to wear a plastic helmet that makes him look like the end of a man's penis? Wolverine has an EXOSCELETON MADE OF TITANIUM, but every morning gels his hair into two cute little wolf ears to make himself look that bit more gruffer. Though this may be a criticism of the concept of X-men itself, the film takes itself so seriously that one cannot help but point the finger and laugh.To the inexperienced eye, this is how the beginning of the film is interpreted (SOME SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW). Some guy wearing sunglasses goes to a lake where he mourns over his dead girlfriend, he goes mental for some unknown reason, shoots the lake with his eye lasers and she appears, unharmed. She kisses him. WE NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN. His death is utterly unexplained and we get the feeling the actor realised how big a career mistake he was making and deciding to pack it all in halfway through filming. The girlfriend is found unconscious and her mysterious reappearance is explained with remarkable speed in a singular sentence of jargon from a pained Patrick Stewart. She wakes up, and is inexplicably powerful and evil. The subsequent ""war"" that follows is confined to one singular showdown: a pub brawl in the car park of Alcatraz Island.And there you have it ladies and gentlemen, Hollywood whores itself to a special FX fest once again. Save yourself a trip to the theatre folks. This is a film that had a sickeningly large budget. I shudder to think what better things could have been done with this money. Instead it was wasted upon a film that is in every aspect, below average.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1087,christopher-bair,Definitely a Ratner Film,8,26 May 2006,"If you've seen Brett Ratner's other films (Rush Hour, Red Dragon, etc.), you'll see his usual techniques and flash-production of plot lines throughout. That's not to say it does not work for X-Men 3, as the rest of the storytelling makes it possible.In this, a pharmaceutical firm discovers a method to suppress the mutant gene, thus giving rise to a cure. Some mutants take this as an affront to their race and, with Magneto at the helm, form the Brotherhood of Mutants. Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast, Secretary of Mutant Affairs, tries to recruit the X-Men to assist in the diplomacy between humans and mutants. Their focus lies not only on the cure and how it may impact the world, but also the return of a familiar character to the X-Men franchise.True to its subtitle, X-Men: The Last Stand ties up loose ends and really makes the impact necessary to close out a trilogy. Though there are plenty of story lines to complete, including for the stand-alone Wolverine film, stay after the credits for a few seconds of one last denouement.Could have been better with less thrusting of sudden story lines and not so much on-screen adult situations. What's more, Romijn is one nimble lady! Not for the youngest fans. 8/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1088,Watcher87,X-Men 3: The Last Stand,4,10 June 2006,"OK, first of all, the only reason this movie gets such a high vote from me is because of three things: 1. Halley Berry, Kelsey Grammar, and especially Hugh Jackman gave such brilliant performances on their parts and in their scenes, 2. The battle scenes were brilliantly executed from a stunt/CG/all that video perspective and 3. The occasional jokes that make you laugh and go ""oh crap"".Otherwise, this movie was total crap and does no justice to the comics or the X-men cartoons and their fans. First off, as many people have stated, the pace of the movie is too quick, and there is too much going on to stop and contemplate individual perspectives. They introduced far too many useless characters, for example Archangel: flies in and out... thats it. Multiplier man: I like Eric Dane, but who he's a distraction.. thats it.Without going into much more babble I have to complain about the entire Phoenix arc: Phoenix is DEFINITELY far too powerful for the demise she met, for the minor role she played in the movie too... I mean c'mon! She was STANDING THERE THE WHOLE TIME AND THEN GETS STABBED!? And she just happened to kill off two of the main characters that are so important to the X-men universe for NO REASON.This movie sucked!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1089,CaptainAstro,"Not quite as bad as Fantastic Four, but...",5,1 August 2006,"This is not a good film.I'm not going to beat around the bush. I don't like it. Because I'm thinking that it should be compared to the movies that came before it. And therein lies the problem. This film has a complete lack of emotional gravity or character development.In the first films, we focused on a few main characters, Wolverine, Rogue, and a few others. Everyone got a few scenes where they developed, and there were arcs. Let me say that again: The characters went somewhere. Somewhere they couldn't have gotten in a half-hour episode of television.In this film, they emphasize the plot more than the characters. But the screenplay is not good enough to support it, and the director makes no attempt to make up for it with exceptional deliveries. All the characters we fell in love with have been completely tossed by the wayside. In the first films, Wolverine was an amazing character, an anti-hero, who did awesome things with his claws, and was struggling to figure out his past. Now, granted, he seems to have figured out what happened to him in X2, but there was a life before the procedure, and in X- Men 3, he's somehow come to terms with his past, and the internal struggle is gone. He has no exciting sequences, and no character development.I don't want to give any spoilers, but there are a more than a few characters who are set up for fantastic arcs and character developments, but these stories are forgotten and unfulfilled. That's the movie as a whole. It's set up for a great film, and the plot in itself has potential, but they do not collect on the potential.Now, make no mistake: I have seen worse movies. Fantastic Four jumps to mind. Elektra and Hulk are up there. But this was one of the worse blockbusters of the summer, and didn't deserve to open the summer movies. This film could've used about another year of working on the screenplay, another month shooting, and another half of a year on the special effects. (They're aren't terrible special effects in the film, but the whole film is rushed.)If you want to see a quality superhero movie, go rent X2. This film is nowhere near as good. It's one thing for a sequel to fall short, but this is ridiculous.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1090,manutd17117,Sometimes...change is good.,10,26 May 2006,"Last night at midnight, I went to see X-Men: The Last Stand with a bunch of friends because we were big fans of the comics and the first 2 films. All I can really say is that this film did not hold entirely true to the original comics, but that is definitely not a bad thing. This film had a lot of character development with just about every character and the story was told with such fast pace that you were never bored at all. I honestly think that this film is better than the previous two and Brett Ratner should be commended for his work. As a film major, I understand how difficult it is for a director to take over a project to make it his own after one or two other people have already tried to make it their own, but Ratner did a great job. I think the real question is ""Will there be a fourth film?"" because the ending really gets you thinking. Overall, this is a great film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1091,Steeny14,Great for comic book fans,10,26 May 2006,"I was looking forward to this film for ages as a comic book fan, seeing Angel, Beast, Colossus and all the other new guys. I was not disappointed, as a comic book fan. As a movie, it is probably the weakest of the three. It's the most action packed, and it has the most stuff that comic fans would love, it is the best of the three for X-men fans. But the new director doesn't take his time like Bryan Singer did and he found it hard to deal with all the characters, so the character development suffered. So if your a fan of the X-men comics you wont be disappointed, but this isn't the intelligent movie that we expect from the first two.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1092,Sinnema,The best in the X-Men series,9,27 May 2006,"While the first two ""X-Men"" films spent a lot of time on introducing characters, their back stories, and their powers, this third film assumes you know the characters and their relationships, and launches right into the action.The movie introduces new characters Angel and Beast, but it doesn't take much time to explain what their powers are, since it's obvious just looking at them.All the mutants' powers are utilized to good effect here, going beyond the brief displays in past films -- when an all-out war breaks out between mutants and the human military, all characters push their powers to the limit.Also, if you haven't seen the movie yet, be sure to stay through all the end credits for a surprise bonus scene at the very end. If you're one of those people who bolts out of the theater as soon as the credits begin, you're missing an important final scene to the movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1093,mouldy311,Why is this so bad?,4,1 June 2006,"I am not homophobic but I hated Wolverine in X3. Not that everyman who cries is a woman, but in the course of a two hour movie, what is supposed to be a purely animal character filled with rage took out his rage not by using his unbreakable claws, but by crying. Twice. One of the manliest characters ever developed a feminine side. What the heck? The sequel is gonna be X4: Gotta Dance where Wolverine goes to Broadway. As a fan and reader of the comics I know for a fact that Wolverine has testicles, so the movie is way off what it should be. But the movie, other than the numerous differences from the comic that the previous two films didn't make, this films was shoddily made with a terrible script. The writer, Zak Penn famed for X2 but also Elektra, Suspect Zeroand Inspector Gadget, shows that X2 might have been either a fluke or a testament to Bryan Singer's genius. The characters have no real depth in this movie, even Jean Grey who has a lot of time devoted to her, appears just to be a confused teenager. The movie tells us Phoenix, her alter-ego is the most powerful mutant out there, but she has two tirades and a lot of walking around looking angry and confused. The plot of the movie takes the Dark Phoenix tale from the comics and combines it with the threat of a mutant cure, a great idea from Joss Whedon of Serenity. When a wealthy owner of a drug company develops a mutant cure drug, Magneto feels threatened and assembles a brotherhood to fight it. He is joined by the now evil Jean Grey who's split personality broke out at the end of X2. The direction on this film is big and bold but fails as continuity of the simplest kind is ignored (one second its mid day, the next its night) and the effects, while done by WETA (Peter Jackson's effects team), vary from incredible to shoddy looking. While these mistakes could be overlooked, I wish Brett Ratner had been able to at least read the script before he started shooting or to work of figuring out some of the mutants. There are character mistakes from the comics and there is some terrible dialog. Possible the greatest mistake is how Professor X's character pulls a complete 180 turn from what he has been in the movies and books, and he becomes a condescending asshole. Really, I love Prof X but he acts like such a pompous dick in this movie, I started rooting for the Brotherhood. The addition of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut is brilliant as he was the funniest and most bad ass mutant in the entire film as he even gets the best line in the movie. And of course the addition of puffer boy lightens things up. The new mutants really made this film watchable. Patrick Stewart is good in his role as Prof X even thought the character is shoddy and Ian McKellen continues his run as a standout in crap films, continuing from Da Vinci Code. Mr. McKellen made me root for Magneto because he gave the character life, depth and some emotional base even though his lines where on occasion unintentionally funny. That's another thing about this movie that I hated. There were numerous times where lines that were supposed to be serious received a big laugh from the audience. The Juggernaut line was hysterical and some moments just got the audience laughing. I heard more laughs at this screening than I did when I saw Rush Hour 2, which was a funny movie that I liked! I really want Brett Ratner to making Rush Hour movies and leave the superhero stuff to either the professionals or people who have enough time to work on the script a little. My real highlight for this movie though was the Snakes on a Plane trailer which got a real big WHOOP from the audience. And also, don't leave until after the credits because there is a little bit of X-men: Brett Ratners's last stand, left. 4/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
1094,biglizardprods,Dumb fun,6,25 June 2006,"As James Cameron did with Aliens, Brett Ratner takes the X-Men franchise in a crasser, splashier direction. While Brian Singer is (thankfully) no M. Night Shamaylan he did invest the first two X-Men films with a gravitas that, to those of us not enamored of the comic books, seemed out of scale to such silly subject matter. Ratner has re-tipped the balance of soap opera to action in favor of plain dumb fun. Because what is the allure of this premise but the opportunity to watch people with super powers wreak havoc? He even does us the favor of killing off the dreariest characters. The script is clunky and obvious, and one feels embarrassed for the actors having to mouth such dreck. It seems pitched at the level of an especially dim and truculent nine year old, but that's as it should be with a comic book franchise. It's one of those movies that has so little on its mind that it has to state the obvious just to give the actors something to say. As Wolverine and Storm wander in a literal fog he says ""I can't see a thing"" (we know this) and she responds, ""I can fix that"" (we knew that). The movie's impatience with thought is wonderfully illustrated in a scene where Dr. Xavier's lecture on the philosophical implications of super power is interrupted by an outburst of more special effects. Later Beast drops an attempt to articulate a point in order to beat up bad guys. To every First Act action there is a predictably equal and opposite Third Act reaction. The Gay metaphor is strained to the breaking point, embodied by a kid with wings whose only role seems to be to save (forgive) the father who wanted to cure him of his mutantness. This is all to say there's a lot of splashy action which is mostly fun. The race between the giant Juggernaut, smashing through walls behind the little Kitty, slipping through them like a ghost, is a highlight. The beef/cheesecake factor is higher than before: Rebecca Romijn struts around in blue body paint for a few good scenes before she's neutralized, and Hugh Jackman takes his shirt off. It's all unpretentious, disposable fun, and that's as it should be.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1095,rebbert9797,A very disappointed fan,3,26 May 2006,"First of all I just have to say that growing up and to this day I have always been a huge fan of Marvel comics and their expanded universes, specifically Spider-Man and X-Men. I'm still wondering what to think about this movie about an hour after seeing it. I waited so long for X-Men to be made into a movie series, and after seeing ""The Last Stand"" I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy some of the film, for example the danger room sequence at the beginning, that was exactly what I thought the X-Men fighting the Sentinels should look like. However, the story, or lack thereof for that matter, literally angered me. How do you kill Professor X, Jean Grey, and Cyclops in the X-Men movies?! These people weren't supposed to die, what connected me to them throughout my years as a fan was how strong these characters were and how they were able to overcome the problems their world put into their way. ""The Cure"" as they called was hardly developed, the characters introduced in this movie lacked an introduction, and although it was nice to see Angel, Kitty Pryde, Colossus, and Juggernaut, among others, they may as well not even been in the movie. It was as though the entire thing was one giant spectacle, and disappointed me to the levels of the final installment of Star Wars. X2 left me hungry for more, and the original X-Men film had its problems, but at least stayed true to the foundations on which the story was based. This movie left a very bad taste in my mouth; Magneto and Rogue lose their powers (Rogue before she is even given any chance to shine), three major characters die, and the main character of the trilogy thus far, Wolverine, received the spotlight role among all of the other equally interesting X-Men, yet he gets his own film afterward and many characters we fans wanted to see, if for only a few minutes, never even made it to the screen. Like I said before, there were a few things I liked about the film. In my opinion, Beast was done justice. Seeing Iceman and Colossus reach their full mutant forms was also pleasing. Beyond these few things I have mentioned, I was not very impressed and thoroughly disappointed. The moment I heard Brett Ratner was taking over the project I began to worry, and this film proved me right. As a film student myself, long-time film lover, and X-Men fanatic, my hope for good art and good movies to be created from stories that had been around for so long just waited to be brought to the big screen was poisoned by this film. I know a lot of people will say that some changes had to be made to bring the comic to film, and I agree, but not to the drastic extents that this film took. The Spider-Man films weren't entirely true to the comics, but the changes were minute and fit well into the already famous and beloved storyline. Sam Raimi nailed those films and I remain thankful for his adaptations bringing my, and many others', beloved Spider-Man to the big screen. And as far as the first two X-Men films went, I was happy for the most part. But I have never been so disappointed in anything in my life as I was in this movie. To me, the X-Men took a creative and interesting spin on a problem that actually faces humankind, and all of that was lost here. There was really no resolution, no payoff, and no story. The film could have gone in a much better direction had the X-Men been forced to face one of their own, the Pheonix (Jean Grey), and brought her back with having her face the same attacks by the humans (Sentinels)that the X-Men faced. There would have been much more room to bring characters many wanted to see thoroughly into the picture (ie. Angel, Gambit, Beast, Psylocke, Colossus, Kitty, etc.) instead of bringing in many insignificant parties just to complicate things and provide for non-stop action. We could have easily got to know all of these new characters and then some if the story had been much better devised and the movie not been so rushed. This was also evident with the film's length; did they really expect to pull all of that off in less than two hours and have it work? The action in the film was well produced, but it seemed as thought that's all there was, action. They had enough to work with from the original story lines (ie. the rise of the Pheonix and the mutant-human war), they shouldn't have brought ""The Cure"" in to complicate things. Through all of my disappointment I still hold hope for a better X-Men 4 with the final scenes from this movie, and hope that the numerous X-Men fans finally get the pay off we so well deserve for buying all of those comics and keeping Marvel in business for so long.*I hope that this all reads clearly and concisely and that those of you who read this can understand my disappointment, after all it is 3:30 in the morning, and I'm a little shaken up.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1096,dirtynbl,great movie if you don't like X-Men,4,27 May 2006,"This movie was kind of fun if you know nothing about X-Men. If you've ever read anything in the X-Men series or seen the expertly done TV cartoon from the 1990s then this movie will just seem awful.Sure liberties must be taken when transferring to film. Backstories changed, but this movie does it Batman and Robin style, the way they wasted Bane. Juggernaut is apparently a mutant and not powered by a crystal, and Xavier has no idea that they are related... Colossus suddenly has no discernible Russian accent.Can you live with that? Maybe. Except the promise of the last film was a huge ending and this film is hollow. I won't say who dies, but Brett Ratner and the writers seem to think that killing characters guarntees that the audience will marvel at their bold story telling. And yet, with each major character they kill for relatively no reason it becomes obvious that the joy of these comics was lost on them.This movie was so disappointing. I can't reveal anything in real detail, but if its the end of the X movies its really sad to go out this way with the Phoenix wasted and lots of great characters just wasted.All they had to do was lift a great story from the comics. Dark Phoenix. Onslaught. Rise of Apocalypse. Something involving Bishop. Genosha and the Sentinals. The second movie lifted from the comics and guess what...IT WAS AWESOME.Save your $10 for a better movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1097,shojun,The summer block-buster is here,10,24 May 2006,"The Last Stand. The title had promise, the trailers looked ""epic"", and anticipation was high. But there were worries. Fall-outs in crew, directors changed, etc. None of that matters. The pop-corn entertainment is back, the very definition of a summer blockbuster. Not to say there weren't plot flaws, a few deviations for the purists, and some frustrations, but everything the audience wanted was there. Relationships, great acting (for the most part), Hugh Jackman at his angriest, battles that had been simmering for years, action after action, and of course taking place in America's back yard, as always ;) For only the 3rd time ever, and the first time DURING a movie, was there clapping in the cinema I was in IN NEW ZEALAND, this from a midnight audience full of sleep-deprived fanboys ready to rip it to shreds! :) And a final hint - this is not a spoiler - make sure you stay until the end of the credits.

1098,pumpkinsquashpaint,Sub-par movie. All that superb character development done by the actors and previous director buried under a pile of trite one-liners and snooze-inducing 'action' scenes.,1,26 May 2006,"There were just so many things that were not good about this movie.Dialogue was awful. Pretty much on par with 'Save the Last Dance.' i.e. you could pretty much guess what was going to be said by each character in each scene. It's like they had a book of common expressions and drew exclusively from that. There's cheesy dialog and then there's dialog that could have been written by any fourteen year old girl with an unhealthy obsession with teen dramas and daytime television.So much of the dialog was just painfully unnecessary. Seriously, if you show a family in a car pinned on both sides by two other cars *and* show them struggling and failing to get their doors opened you really don't need the characters to tell us that *beat* *beat* *wait for it* ""We're trapped!"" I think the audience figured that one out about 10 seconds ago.Nothing about this movie flowed or felt organic. Every scene was stilted and staged. Some scenes just dragged on and on and seemed to have no point at all. Well, other than to set up some gag inducing teenage melodrama. Those editors (along with the director) need to be taken out and slapped. All those pauses between lines and the ceaseless switching from Character 1 to Character 2 back to 1 and then to 3 and then to 1 to 5 to 2, etc--with no one saying anything at all. There's communicating with a look and then there's having a five way telepathic conversation minus voice overs and subtitles.Visually, it was no more dynamic than the kind of footage aired on the six o'clock news. If I were deaf (and there were points I was crying out to God to make me so) I still wouldn't be impressed by this movie. There were no striking images. No new effects. No old effects used with new and creative twists. And maybe it was just my theater but the colors were most unimpressive. There were no shots that made me go, ""Damn, that's on just this side of stunning!"" Or if they were they were quickly forgotten as I was inundated by more inane dialog. And don't even get me started on the 'Trashy Romance Novel' shot. Why, Brett Ratner? Whyyyyyyyyy?!The action scenes just didn't have any 'oomph' to them. Impossible you say? Not so, I tell you. You can in fact film a fight scene with Wolverine, Beast, and Iceman and still have it come out boring. But there were a few 'chase' scenes that were entertaining. Not so much for their action content but more for their humor.Sigh. I could go on but I'd rather just put this abysmally disappointing experience behind me. But before I do I'd just like to add that I had forgotten that the director was not Bryan Singer but instead Brett Ratner. I didn't remember until roughly 30 minutes before the movie ended. So I wasn't expecting bigger and better things nor was I looking to compare the two filmmakers' styles. But I am none the less less than impressed by this film, its director and its editors. It was not a good movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1099,Phoenixriseandfall,X-Men 3 Well Done Except.....,9,15 June 2006,"First of all I thought the movie was really well done and the acting was top notch. Beast played by Kelsey Grammar did a good job, better than expected. Because of him I could forgive the lack of Nightcrawler, who I never liked the movie version of him anyway (though still awesome effects in X2). I simply didn't like Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler, he has always been devilishly handsome in the comic book, and well....Alan Cumming is not. In the movie having Juggernaut be British was an interesting twist and the fight with him and Shadowcat was a memorable milestone in the movie. Personally I would have liked to have seen more of Jubilee, also in the movie credits is Psylocke who would have been a nice addition since the team psychic was the villain and Professor X dies in the first hour. My first disappointment was that Phoenix though mentioned as a latent personality of Jean Grey (great twist) never actually became the fiery Phoenix bird (key placement would have been when she arose from the lake) perhaps it could have been lack of funding but I think it was required. Second Disappointmen, why weren't characters properly introduced? I had no idea that the girl with super speed was Callisto since super speed is not one of her powers. Also, I thought Archlight was a strange mix of Rictor and Avalance in female form, I had completely forgotten about the Marauder Archlight, which after seeing the movie a second time I did hear someone in the movie quickly use her name. Third Disappointment was Angel....OK he was integral to the plot but Ben Fosters run out the window was a little sad...his arms were just too campy as and I think Angel should have been a returning student like Beast was and possibly been played by Ethan Hawke....Cary Elwes...or an unknown blonde pretty boy/man. Also having Phoenix actually fight the X-Men would have been nice, yes they had their hands full but having Phoenix throw Colossus around or did more besides trying to disintegrate Wolverine would have been cool. Losing Rogue was strange...I didn't like Anna Paquin as Rogue could have picked someone a bit more Southern if you ask me, but having her ""cured"" was a bit of a let down but I do understand her reasoning. FINALLY Iceman became Iceman (when fighting Pyro) I was happy and Beast's fight scene was awesome. I wish they would have used Multiple Man a little more (very cute actor)he was funny and portrayed Multiple Man well. Fourth and final disappointment Cyclops, Mystique, and Professor Xavier all got taken out way too early in the movie. Especially Cyclops. I can't believe they killed Cyclops (or did they? it would be a nice opening story line for X-Men 4). Having Mystique lose her powers angered me though I did give a chuckle when she got Magneto back by leaking information to the feds. Professor X dying (though watch after the epic credits and you will see him in another body with Moira-who by the way Moira was fabulous). Now despite my complaining I really did like the X-Men 3 movie I'll get it when it comes out on DVD. I Don't try to compare it (story line wise) to the comic book because that would be 40 years crammed into 3 movies and the X-Men have always been portrayed in ""alternate realities"".",X-Men - The Last Stand
1100,blonde20s,X-Men: TLS ; Not the best but damn good!,8,28 May 2006,"My first initial re-action to this movie, was ""OH MY GOD"", the second was, ""I can't believe Rogue sold out!"", but I'll explain in a minute! X-Men: THE LAST STAND is an amazingly fast paced movie, though not as fast paced as a lot have commented on! I enjoyed the action sequences, and introduction of new characters. MY likes and dislikes were as follows... *MAJOR SPOILERS* LIKES... FAMKE Janssen as THE PHOENIX!!! This had to be the best part of the movie, and though the scene in Jean Grey's House with Prof. X was controversial, I thought it was amazingly done.ELLEN PAGE as KITTY PRYDE! She was my new favourite character in the movie, the love triangle didn't bother me so much, because I believe it was to be more in Rogue's mind than in actuality.Wolverine's last stand: The way his skin kept burning off and regrowing really re-in-acted scenes (for me) from the comics.Kelsey Grammar as Beast: As soon as he said ""Oh my stars and garters!"" 'NUFF SAID! Dislikes... SADLY.... ANGEL... he had no part.. I realize he was the inspiration for the cure, and the inspiration to keep the school and Xavier's dream alive (I won' go into specifics), but he was in three scenes, had four lines... and by the end, kinda looked like a seagull flying through the sky.Jean Grey's lack of speech towards the end... why was she standing back and watching the World while the evil mutants fought?! Colossus... one line in the whole movie... but he's in soooo many scenes. HUH?! I was wondering if he was just standing there to look beefy and to hurdle Wolverine around?! The speech to the X-Kids before the final battle. In the trailer it's suggested that Storm and Wolverine are against't them tagging along, but an alternate scene was used where Iceman was nervous about fighting, and Wolverine gives him a speech about courage (in my opinion I'd have liked to have seen the former).And finally... Rogue's sell out. From seeing previews (TV spots) I know that they filmed an alternate ending where Rogue decides not to take the cure, but I guess it was to show fans that not everything can be ""Alls well that ends well"", though if the cure is only temporary then she will be back!!! *END SPOILERS* Over-all I like this movie, though X2 was my favourite in the series! I think Brett Ratner's direction was a little messy at times (not as sleek as Brian Singer's), and the CG was a little cheesy compared to the first two, and the script in some parts, well, there was a lack of a script. But I did enjoy this movie very much!!! Hopefully a GENERATION X/NEW MUTANTS movie is in the making!!! RAWK! 8/10",X-Men - The Last Stand

I went into X3 with expectations but not very high expectations. I was definitely surprised. Most had dubbed this as The Actual Last Stand since tat both writer and director had a string of several flops. First off, I just want to point out with this movie there is no way to screw up this series. This series has the best dramatic conflicts that I have seen in a comic book adaptation.The Dark Poenix saga culminated in a near perfect ending. I had read the comics and always wondered how they would translate the Outer Space Comicness into a movie. I thought that the solution was amazing showing a dual personality.

1102,miguelsardinha,The perfect climax of the trilogy,9,26 May 2006,"After the film ended, I didn't know if I had liked it or not. It seemed that the film was so much and at the same time so little. But after 10m, it stroke me as the best of the series. It is truly a FANTASTIC achievement by Brett Ratner, the film is action full, each character (and there were a LOT) had enough space, and come to think of it I thought superb the way he treated Jean Grey's character, she seemed alienated for the most part of the film, I mean, she was a second story in the main story, but as important as the cure theme, as the all prejudice and undermining of minorities theme. She gave the picture the depth of drama, with all the pain caused by her supposed death to the part where she is reborn and all the mess she causes after that. Although some of the characters have their storyline changed from the comics, with different powers and backgrounds, I, as a comic fan, am fully pleased with the outcome, I think it was Great! I hope the spin offs keep the same quality as the ones of the trilogy!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1103,mld2007,"The Good (Very Little), The Bad (Ratner), and The Ugly (The screenplay, written by the uncredited Mr. Simon Kinberg)",3,27 May 2006,"Bryan Singer, director of the first two X-Men films, revolutionized the superhero movie by delivering a thoughtful and personal character-driven narrative while shying away from the CGI-based form of storytelling that has plagued modern American blockbusters for the past decade. Brett Ratner, with ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", does exactly the opposite in what appears to be a middle-fingered tribute not only to moviegoers across the world, but to the film's cast itself. Brett Ratner has always been a fairly poor director despite his obvious talent with the camera because he can never get a good performance out of his actors. The returning mutants were obviously torn between playing their characters in the previous films and the concoctions Ratner especially created for them. Wolverine, while he retains some of the uncouth yet surprisingly gentle qualities that make him who he is, is emasculated into a hairier version of John Cusack. Similarly, Jean Grey transforms into a female stereotype of Agent Smith, and Storm seemingly possesses no personality at all. And it's not like these people are terrible actors, either. Any film in possession of Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, and Halle Berry should not be devoid of a lack of expertise. However, movies are both directed and written, and the writer of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is so inept that IMDb has removed his name from the film's main page. A quick Google search of the name ""Simon Kinberg"" + ""X-Men"" returns his bio page on this website from May 20th complete with his credit for the film. A quick visit to that page today will reveal that the title is surprisingly absent from his resume. Now, I don't blame Mr. Kinberg from wanting to disassociate himself from the film. After all, he still wants to work in Hollywood. However, I have no qualms about proclaiming to the world that Mr. Kinberg wrote one of the worst screenplays since ""The Core"". One of the reasons the story is so unbelievably terrible is because Mr. Kinberg's devotion to the X-Men pales in comparison to the extensive knowledge Bryan Singer brought to the table. As a result, the audience is put through a narrative with many inconsistencies, awkward plot twists, and starchy characters. For example, when Jean Grey lifts the cars off the ground outside her house in the opening scene of the film, the audience doesn't know if it's her or Magneto until 30 seconds after the event. While this example is fairly minor (I don't want to reveal any spoilers...as if the movie itself isn't spoiled already), it encompasses the utter incompetence of Mr. Kinberg as a writer for this film. Another major problem with this film is that it takes itself too seriously. Ratner includes the enjoyable thoughtlessness of campy visuals and dialogue, but because the movie tries too hard to have a higher moral message these moments become awkward. In fact, the film so awkwardly and explicitly states its themes (mainly about homosexuality, as if the angel-like mutant flying over the Golden Gate bridge wasn't enough to clue you in) that instead of creating an enjoyably mindless film, Ratner insults the audience's intelligence. If you're a die-hard X-Men fan, you've probably already seen the movie and want my e-mail address to tell me how I ""misinterpreted"" the ""genius"" of the film. However, if you enjoyed the first two films because of the well-developed characters and the moments of pure cinematic joy, stay away from this movie entirely.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1104,slade4ever,Extremely disappointing,1,19 June 2006,"I originally gave this movie a 6. But after thinking about it, and realizing how bad it was, I had to give it a lower score, after all, the only thing that saved this movie was the special effects and action. But in reality, that is not what a movie should be about, especially an X-Men movie.The first 2 movies were filled with substance, great acting, thought provoking material, and overall, a coherent plot. Yes, they were comic movies, but X-Men has always been more then just entertainment.This is where the movie failed to grasp the concept that made the first 2 movies great. In an attempt to make a ""great"" concluding trilogy, the director and writers decided to kill off as many characters as possible, believing that by doing so will add depth and emotion. The problem is that little time is given to make the audience actually care about the characters. Even a funeral scene for one of the characters becomes cheezy and horribly acted.In addition to killing off many characters, a decision was made to introduce as many characters from the source material as possible in order to ""please"" fans. It ends up coming off more like Mortal Kombat: Annihilation or Batman and Robin, because no time was given to properly introduce the characters.Also, it seems like the writers weren't sure what movie they were making by having many characters act as if they were someone else. For example, a character who was compassionate and caring in the first 2 movies becomes rude and inconsiderate in the third.In the end, the movie was entertainment. If the first 2 movies were nothing more then that, then this movie would have fit in nicely, but sadly, due to an obvious rushed schedule, and bad storytelling, what could have been a great concluding movie to an incredible trilogy ends up being a brainless action movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1105,cirrocco_jones,"Great action, good story...MORE PLEASE!",8,26 May 2006,"Possible spoilers below for those who don't want to know ANYTHING about the plot. But for those who don't mind knowing a little bit about it, read on. I haven't included anything that you couldn't gather from the trailers, my critique notwithstanding.The action in this film, while never quite reaching the level of impressiveness as the opening scene in X2 with Nightcrawler, was impressive nonetheless. You really get a sense of just how powerful any given mutant can be if his/her power is used cleverly enough.The story is a continuation of the theme started in X1, where it's basically Mutants V. Everyone Else. This time, though, Eric/Magneto steps over the bounds. If the writers were trying to remove sympathy from the character then they succeeded quite well. McKellen did an excellent job of turning a well-meaning man into exactly what he used to oppose.There is a possible ""cure"" for mutations, a serum that is capable of turning a mutant into just a regular human. As you can imagine, this ""cure"" might be desired by some mutants, but opposed and feared by many others. The X-Men try to follow a middle-of-the-road philosophy and stance, as is Professor X's wont, but of course Eric won't allow it. Thus, the conflict arises.OH, WHAT A CONFLICT! This is where that great action that I was talking about comes in. *POSSIBLE SPOILER HERE* In the end, nothing is truly resolved, as it is with most conflicts that are this complex. *END POSSIBLE SPOILER* And that's why I'm left at the end begging for more. What will ultimately happen to all the characters? Has anybody learned their lesson? Can there be enough grace and forgiveness on both sides to end the conflict? And who is on which side now that things have changed like this? If there's anything I'm disappointed in with this film it's that it's too short and I want more!

Personally, I thought I had seen in the actors expressions when talking, that they wished Singer was there. Very disappointing and an insult to true X-Men fans. Even in the action movie category, I would only give it a 6. I was also under the impression that we would see some major mutants, such as White Queen, Omega Red and Dazzler. I know Omega Red is supposedly casted, but there really wasn't a mutant that even looked like him.

1107,bretzon,worst movie i have ever encountered,1,28 May 2006,"Only one word can describe this movie: terrible. But what is there to expect from the guy who directed ""Rush Hour"" and ""Rush Hour 2"" possibly the only two movies ever made that are worse than X3. So anyway, the plot line is the same as every other action movie. The characters were lame, bland, and may as well have been deleted from the movie to make it better. There is an over-emphasis on computer generated action scenes, and not enough on character development, or explanation of the storyline, as to why it was completely off topic from the comics, and not enough good acting. The acting seemed half-hearted at best. As though the stars were just in the movie to make money off the pop culture view of ""YEAH AN EXPLOSION! WHAT A GREAT MOVIE!!! FORGET ABOUT ACTING AND Plot line AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT MAKES THE MOVIE, I WANNA SEE SOMETHING BLOW UP."" This movie was doomed to failure from before its first frame, all the way back to when some genius decided that Brett Ratner would be the best guy to direct it. Seriously, idiots like the director should become what they were conceived to be : garbage men.This movie redeems itself by 1/4 of a star by this one quote by the ""Juggernaut"" played by Vinnie Jones : ""I'M THE JUGGERNAUT B*TCH."" Then he proceeds to smash through walls.If there was a rating under a 1, I would vote it under 1. actually, I would only rate this movie 1/4 of a star, just because of that one line.

1108,Dcap4188,Spectacle Trumps Content,6,6 February 2007,"Fans of Bryan Singer's X-Men franchise may be somewhat disappointed by Brett Ratner's ""The Last Stand."" The reason is not that Ratner is incompetent as a director, but rather that his film simply suffers from a case of plot overload. Had the film been a little longer, then this problem may have been a non-issue, but for ""The Last Stand,"" at only 104 minutes, to achieve successful storytelling, convincing character development (of more than a dozen central characters no less), and extraordinary action sequences it would need a miracle. That being said, ""X3"" is still immensely entertaining and features some of the most eye-popping special effects of the year.When Ratner and his geek squad went about making and writing ""The Last Stand"" I can only imagine that they rifled through the comic books and every time they saw something they liked they said, ""We've gotta have that."" In the end, they decided to expound most upon 'The Cure' storyline and use their filmmaker's license to alter the course of events in the Marvel timeline.The Cure is an antibody produced by a young mutant (Cameron Bright) that suppresses the mutant gene and ""cures"" its ""victims"" of their powers. Magneto (Ian McKellen), fresh off unearthing the truth about Christ in ""The Da Vinci Code,"" staunchly opposes it and will go to great lengths to see it destroyed. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the Martin Luther King Jr. of mutant activists, and his X-Men, led by Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), do not support the Cure, but support Magneto's means of fighting it even less. This sets the stage for an all out war between mutants, their brothers, and the limits of computer graphics that hinges on the resurrection of Jean Grey as Phoenix (Famke Janssen), a being of limitless power that breathes fire and fury.What sets the ""X-Men"" movies apart from so many other big budget, special effects laden extravaganzas are the universal themes that almost anyone watching them can relate to. They are of particular interest to gay teens struggling with who they are, and who society tells them they should be. Sadly, ""The Last Stand"" trades in much of its substance for spectacle.""The Last Stand"" feels like a turkey bursting at the seams with stuffing. Trouble is, there's too much stuffing and not enough turkey. It seems content to simply throw mutant after mutant at us just to show off some neat powers. Consider a scene where Wolverine fights a mutant who can grow back any appendage he loses. How do you beat that? Kick him below the belt of course (""Try growing those back"" is one of the films many throwaway lines). I can, however, recommend the film on the basis of its incredible visual effects. One scene in particular, involving Magneto and the Golden Gate Bridge, is worth the price of admission alone.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The Mutant-X cure is only temporary, it doesn't work for long periods of time, 2. Scott Summers/Cyclops, isn't dead, Pheonix just planted the memory of killing him into Jeans head. and 3. Magneto will be back at it again in X-4, NO MORE FREAKING HUMANS!! But i do agree with some people, YES.... gambit should have been in this movie, and what happened to nightcrawler.

The reason it is only 9 out 10 is because there was tons of action and emotion, but not quite enough character development.

I say this because some people say that they love for the SAME reasons that others say they don't. Also, there are ""yuhuh nuhuh"" arguments.

But because X2: X-Men United ended with such a promising lead off to the third my expectations were higher. Brett Ratner did a good job directing. He has a different style than Singer, but still did a good job. I prefer Singer as a director but not to take anything away from Ratner he did alright. My main beef with the film is the script. The script was just mediocre. It was like it was made for a TV series finale. The effects were good, but not great. The story line itself had such promise too but they didn't capitalize completely on it. There is a lack of character development which makes the movie at times feel rushed and there are also some points in the story that are shown but are not addressed later on (for those who have seen it, I'm referring to Cyclops). The movie was good but not great by any means. I did enjoy it even though they got some of the characters wrong and didn't use its previous movie as a supportive backdrop. See it for yourself. Make your own judgement. It's disappointing for the end of a trilogy but still enjoyable and a good movie.

I was pleased to see that Storm at least had her abilities portrayed much more effectively but I was the opposite of pleased to see her spit out cliché and uninspired motivational speeches that stank of pure cheese. This movie attempted to pack twice the amount of characters and story of the first two movies into the shortest of the three. Perhaps if the movie were another thirty minutes than this film could have been one of the greatest comic turned film of all time. The story and the characters and incredibly compelling but are jammed into a movie that's nothing more than a showcase of visual effects. Multiple Man, Colossuss, Juggernaut, Angel, Callisto, Beast--- Do we even care????? What are their motives, personalities, and backgrounds? In short, who are these characters? Where is Nightcrawler???? Generally the first two movies found impressively original and creative ways that each mutant used his/her power. This movie seems to look for the most overblown and visually spectacular uses for their powers while ignoring whether or not it actually makes any sense. Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, and Hugh Jackman all manage to remain impressive in this film despite some completely predictable cheesy lines.

There will be some of the fanboys out there who will complain that things are different than in the comics, but those people have to realize that this isn't a comic book. It's a film. Things will be different because comic books aren't very realistic and a filmmaker can't tell part of a story in 20 minutes that took comics years to tell. Being a huge comic book fan, i always look for moments in comic book films where the writer can creatively add in moments from the comics, and X3 did just that.

1118,Simply_Jer,Disappointment,5,31 May 2006,"I have been a fan of X-Men for just short of forever. I read the comics, I watched the series, I collected trading cards, bought action figures, the whole nine yards. when I saw a movie was going to be made, i was afraid it wouldn't do the franchise justice, but it was very well done. When I saw a sequel, I buckled a bit because sequels are rarely as good as the first movie, but X2 blew me away. When I heard a third movie was made, I became quite excited and was anxious to see how they dealt with the open plot lines they left (Phoenix). I talked to people about it, read production notes, and waiting with held breath, went to a midnight showing and watched...and cried...I don't think I had ever considered that the movie would be such an atrocity to the franchise. I don't even know where to start. The plot line was entirely too stretched thin. The appearance of Angel seemed only to further the idea of Storm taking over the school (any scientist could have had the idea for the cure, it didn't have to be Warren's dad). The characters were given minimal substance, the plot twists were predictable (as soon as the professor expired, i instantly remembered the body Moira was taking care of, that had no other point in the movie except foreshadowing). Kitty Pryde and Colossus never really go into HOW they became members of the team from just students, they just are, and we are expected to just go with it.And Phoenix... Phoenix was played out more as a maniacal ruthless murdered instead of a cold calculating villain. I personally don't like Cyclops, but originally, Phoenix was tamed by love for Scott. That, in my opinion, would have been a MUCH better way to play this, leaving Jean and Scott open for another movie. Here, Scott was killed pointlessly (pointless except for his filming for superman started soon, i guess) and without context. There were so many better ways to do the Jean/ Scott relationship that would have left doors open for further expansion into the franchise. As many others have commented, the battle scenes were great with some of the most enjoyable choreography hat really pulled you in, but as soon as someone started to feel something, the scene changed.I felt like Ratner was told by the producers ""We don't want another movie, so make sure there is no doubt this is the last."" So characters were killed with reckless regard and the ones who lived were given shallow enough development where no one really cares. Poor showing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1119,assistanteditor,Civil Disobedience- When siding with the 'bad' guys seems the right thing to do,8,28 May 2006,"20th Century Fox and director Brett Ratner had the chance to end this film with a glorious special effects sequence that would have earned it the title of classic -- Phoenix (Dutch actress Famke Janssen) could have blown Wolverine away and been reborn. Ratner and Fox had the potential to do truly anything imaginable with the screen, an opportunity for the most spectacular special effects shot in screen history. Yet they blew it by letting the good guys - the president, the jerk who invented the mutant cure, the U.S. army, and the literate, patriotic mutants led by a domesticated wolverine - win.In 'Fahrenheit 451', which Ray Bradbury wrote in the 1950s symbol of the Phoenix is used as a metaphor to describe the nuclear holocaust which ends the world but leaves the good guys alive. The good guys ended up being those the world Bradbury depicted were considered subversive mutants - those who still deeply cared about reading and literature.In the Harry Potter series the Phoenix has played a role as a devoted pet, like Harry's Owl Hedwig, rescuing him in the nick of time in 'The Chamber of Secrets' and going through a very commonplace, non-earth shattering rebirth through flames.In ""Can Poetry Matter?"" in 1991, Dana Gioia wrote ""Society has already told us that poetry is dead. Let's build a funeral pyre out of the desiccated conventions piled around us and watch the ancient, spangle-feathered, unkillable phoenix rise from the ashes."" The image of the Phoenix is sometimes apocalyptic, sometimes utterly commonplace; and because it invokes apocalypse, X-Men asks us to read its characters and plot as allegory. X-Men is trapped by its inability to break out of the conservative ending, which denies us the pleasure to witness the awesome on-screen spectacle of Phoneix being reborn. The scene at the end in which Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) ""saves"" Phoenix and saves ""civilization"" -- may well be one of the most talked about disappointments in film history, and worth seeing the movie because of how deeply it disappoints. It shows us through it's beautiful denied potential that a film company with more imagination (and less Right-leaning corporate tendencies) than FOX could have changed motion pictures in a minute with one of the most talked about endings in film history. Instead, the X-Men put on their hometeam uniforms and save America. And I'll bet not too many people will see the film twice.Slow though it seems at times with it's long Shakespearean opening sequences with Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), there is a lot to say about this movie. The film is ripe with potential for subversive readings. Set in the ""not too distant future"" X-Men has as much to say about 2006 as it does about the world it imagines and the time during which it was originally published as a comic boox series.Superman is headed our way soon as well. The great white hero is back to rescue society. Lex Luthor definitely should not win, he's just too much of a fascist. But when Magneto spares civilian bystanders on the Golden Gate Bridge while preparing to attack Alcatraz, the audience realizes that his cause is just. That's the most subversivie moment in the movie, because then we're really on his side and want the army with it's plan to force the amazingly evolved mutants to become mere humans again. And when the audience is ready to laugh at the president on screen it limits his real power in Washington as well.In the film pir wondering about her true power and potential is what really sets us up for wanting to see Phoenix let her power take hold. We want to know just how amazing she'll be and if she can ignite and leave us good guys -- us liberal mutants and all the people protesting the government's fascist policies -- alive somehow.Instead, we're denied that by the film. Maybe if Hollywood went ahead and kept the white hero from saving ""us"" from apocalypse we'd get to see cooler movies. Movies that imagine what the world has the potential to become rather than those which depict what the patriarchy is afraid of.",X-Men - The Last Stand

It's not the worst movie I've ever seen - not that it deserves that recognition, anyway. I couldn't possibly see it trying to compete against such classics as 'School Killer' or 'Cradle of Fear'. But it does sadly break the mold, for all the wrong reasons.We have to admit it - though we have recently seen a few decent attempts to convert the essence of the original licensed material, 'Spider-Man', 'Sin City', 'X-Men', 'X-Men 2: United' or 'V for Vendetta' (despite what Allan Moore may have to say) aren't, alas, the average fare. Just a too lucky and high frequency of good deliveries, that just makes me wonder whether another age of half-hearted cash-ins may be coming.I want to make it clear - I'm a huge X-Men fan, and though I have switched American comics for Japanese mostly, I really loved how 'X-Men ' and 'X-Men 2: United' dealt with the original comic characters. This isn't the case with 'X-Men 3', but I won't dwell on how this movie is a huge disservice to fans of the comic books - I don't want to post a 2MB text file containing a thesis on how to treat intellectual property in a proper manner.Instead, I will only say what I really find to be worst about 'X-Men 3'. It's boring, poorly directed, and one in every three dialog lines feels cliché, corny and textbook-inspired. 'X-Men 3' is so bad that there's no real use for it, other than using it to, instead of making a negative critic on itself, making a positive critic on some other movie that deserves it far better.

They took something I remembered deeply in my childhood and destroyed it in this movie. One of the most memorable images of the comic book, Cyclops holding Jean when she dies and crying his heart out... that's the way it's supposed to be. It is not Wolverine. They just put Wolverine in there because they felt that he was the most popular hero of the bunch, and all the suckers would not notice. Wrong. True comic book fans would not even take the time to think this is a great movie because nothing is accurate. Everyone losing their powers, boring and predictable. There were hardly any characters that were developed in the movie. Angel is merely seen, he only had like 5 minutes of movie time. Rogue just gets cured and makes it seem like nothing is wrong. I read the comic book and even watched the animated series. Those are what made X-men the way it is meant to be. This is a travesty how ignorant the writers and director made this movie. This is a joke. I'm not going into more detail about what else is done wrong because they are wasting my time. You want a movie with action and special effects, go ahead and waste your 10 dollars. But after watching this and reading the comic, you'll be wondering like all of us, why did I bother wasting my time watching this crap?",X-Men - The Last Stand

However, while X-Men: The Last Stand was quite entertaining (the fight scenes were generally well-done), it was LAME. The dialogue was lacking. Anything that was meant to be a smart one-liner fell short. I think the only time anyone really laughed was when someone got nicked in the nuts. I was a little disappointed that the third X-Men did not live up to the previous movies' standards.Also, just as a little sidenote, in this movie, it always seemed to me that anytime anyone flew, they tried to build it up too much, with empowering music, and it just turned out...cheesy almost. So that was kind of a bummer.",X-Men - The Last Stand

It just felt generally rushed, and full of rough edges.ALL the characters were underdeveloped, save for Jean and Logan, who got waaay to much screen time and were too melodramatic. Too many new mutants were included, yet never formally introduced or developed in the least bit.And the final battle sequence was much too busy, with the camera jumping all over the place.It was, generally, a very scarring experience after the first two successes in the series.Woe, what hellish engine could produce such horrible directors as Brett Ratner and Uwe Boll?!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1127,aimee2618,Solid performances and a engaging story make this a trilogy worth remembering,8,26 May 2006,"overall I was very impressed with the last edition to the X men trilogy, i think that Brett Ratner did the job of completing the X men series rather successfully considering there was quite a lot of doubt he would be able to fulfil as good a job as Brian singers as director. I thought it was faithful in maintaining the essence of X men that had made the last two movies such a success, the special effects were breathtaking to say the least and i feel the relationship between the main characters were in fact even stronger then they had been in the last two films. for example I was never fully convinced with the chemistry between Logan and jean grey, however this film took full note of this and made their relationship for me not only more beautiful but heartbreaking too. my second congratulates goes to a much better performance of Hallie berry, who seemed much stronger in her role as storm. of course, though i am quick to point out the several pros of this film there are of course some inevitable cons too, such as, the film for me was too short, which meant it seemed in some scenes rushed with a feeling that almost half the characters didn't get as much screen time as they probably should of done, especially with being the last instalment each characters story should have been appropriately finished in a way that would satisfy the viewer, also in accordance with rushed time, some parts of the film didn't sink in well, such as that of cyclops death, which again seemed rushed and uncared about and mystique's turn to human form, it seems unlikely to me that a characters such as mystique's that has had such a pivotal role in the X men movies should be so quickly disregarded. other than that the film kept me entertained from start to finish and has made me an even bigger X men fan",X-Men - The Last Stand
1128,blacksmith221,wait for rental-Do Not Buy on DVD or Pay For A Ticket,4,25 May 2006,"Okay, so heres the deal: I am a casual X-men fan. So I dig the series, have read a few comics, but I don't really care if the movies vary from the comic. I only say this so you know that this review is not coming from a die-hard fan, angry about the costume colors being wrong or something.This was not a good movie. It was sub-par. The action scenes were unimaginative and predictable. The character development and plot were non-existent. Heck, even the CGI was obvious.No single character was on screen long enough to establish a presence, or a role. One of the reasons for this was the overwhelming number of mutants that the writers chose to showcase. The great thing about the first two movies was the light touch taken with the auxiliary characters, pointing some out so that those in the know can take notice, but maintaining a strong focus on the principles. But Ratner has the directing touch of a sledgehammer. Tens of mutants were showcased which is a lot in a movie thats only an hour and a half long. Each person was on too briefly to establish a life, too long for a minor role. The movie was choppy, mercurial and poorly assembled.I also think that when your movie is about X-men with names like Beast, Wolverine, Iceman, Mystique etc, you should be very careful with the humor you use, because you're already on the ludicrous border. But once again, old ham fist-Ratner comes to the rescue with dull and tired comic relief. The fight scene repartee reminded me of Rush Hour (unsurprisingly). That works with Chris Tucker, but not with Hugh Jackman and Kelsey Grammar.If you're smart you'll just pretend this one doesn't exist, like Godfather III. Never happened. It makes it easier to enjoy the other two.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1129,smith44,The goods keep on coming.,8,25 May 2006,"For anyone still holding their breath, you can give a sigh of relief, for X Men 3 doesn't disappoint. Nor does it exceed expectations. Similar to the Matrix series and numerous action films these days, X Men 3 suffers from a common sickness, symptoms include a great premise for the story, in this case intolerance and prejudice, and too much action resulting in a lost opportunity of greatness. X Men's notion of social exclusion and intolerance could have been a vehicle for social commentary, instead of the action orientated film that it is. This balance is a rare thing to achieve, it was achieved with Batman Begins. Yet X Men 3 is not a disappointment, unlike the Matrix Series with crashed and burned, the X Men Series has remained steadily good and X Men 3 is no exception.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1130,Vorn_the_Unspeakable,A disappointment at best...,2,26 May 2006,"and a horrible travesty at worst.Honestly, I have trouble knowing where to begin listing the problems inherent to this cinematic train wreck. All in all, this is rather fitting, since the film itself seemed similarly unsure of its own starting point. After a pair of unconnected and disjointed flashback sequences (both of which foreshadow events that are ultimately relegated to subplots by the movie's end), the movie launches into a superfluous action sequence, which then segues into a third, seemingly unrelated, plot.""Plot,"" in this case, means ""killing off main characters for meaningless shock value,"" as is rather easily discerned from the movie's multiple trailers. As is also readily evident in the vast assortment of media in the pre-release hype-blitz, several members of the established character roster make their cinematic debuts in this installment of the series. Unfortunately, their development as characters and their involvement in the plot never significantly exceeds that readily evident in two-minute teaser trailers.Therein lies the rub  I was able to pretty much extrapolate the plot of this movie in its entirety from a two-minute teaser trailer circulated on the Internet. It's not that this plot is necessarily all bad. Despite a somewhat rocky start, there were portions of the movie's middle stretch that I somewhat enjoyed, or at least didn't loathe. There were still frequent instances of hackneyed writing, technical inaccuracies, and infidelity to the source material that irked me a bit, but I was able to convince myself that I was being too harsh. After wading through the preliminary awkwardness, I was ready to sit back and enjoy the remainder of the plot, the portion that would diverge from the setups seen in the trailers and stand on its own two feet  and then that part never came. There were a couple of large, vapid visual-effects fight scenes which made very little sense, and the movie just kind of stopped.There was also a post-credit coda that added pretty much nothing to the debacle.In short, there are a couple of moments that might make this move worth a rental, but it's definitely not worth the price of a theater ticket. Here's hoping that Bryan Singer's return to the comic-movie forum later this summer makes up for it.",X-Men - The Last Stand

On a Sunday afternoon you can do much worse than tuck in to the under 2 hours of rampaging silliness that is x3. However, sitting in a crowd of many 12-16 year olds the biggest gasp of amazement came from the trailer of the new superman movie. The bullet in the eye moment of that trailer summed up what being a super-hero means than nearly any point of the x-man trilogy. The awe of the impossible.In a world of superhumans X1, X2, and X3 forgot to investigate fully the relationship between the power the mutants have any why feared by man. We have to assume that the position of the US government is again the position of all mankind.The existence of mutants in the X-men challenges all faiths. The Angel character alludes to this in part. He is god-like in manifestation, but cinematically becomes a soft by-word for a Christian-like redemption. Jean Grey becomes a God on Earth, and a bridge between good and evil. But ultimately none of this amounts to anything as really, it isn't explored.Hollywood can make good films, but like the Matrix, X-MEN fails to move above average by not clearly positioning the characters place in the world.Eat pop-corn, then leave. 2 days later you will struggle to remember the plot.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1133,mjkira_1987,I'm so disappointed!,4,26 May 2006,"I used to watch the X-Men cartoon when I was growing up, and became a big fan of the first two movies. I have been looking forward to X-Men: The Last Stand since I heard it was being made. I do not think I have ever been more disappointed with a film. This movie had so much potential, too. I won't give away any major plot points, but about halfway into the movie, there was a scene that had me in tears, and I continued crying for about ten minutes simply because I was so angry. One thing that I will rant about (simply because if you've seen the trailer or are even marginally familiar with X-Men, you knew this was coming) is the fact that Dark Pheonix was completely wrong. Her eyes just get black and her hair blows around. The last scene with Jean Grey in X2 was right on the money, but Brett Ratner just decided to ignore that I guess.The cast has always been wonderful, and prevented me from completely hating the movie. The addition of the Beast was a pleasant surprise. I wasn't sure if I would like Kelsey Grammar in the role or not, but he did well. The returning cast, especially Hugh Jackman and Sir Ian McKellan, deserve recognition for their great performances. I was sad when I first heard that this would be the last X-Men movie, but now, I don't see how there's any possible way the franchise could be saved.",X-Men - The Last Stand

One main one I noticed that most may of missed, is when Juggernaut is in the room with Leech and Kitty he goes to charge them and hits the wall to knock himself out. I know Leechs power is the capability of draining mutant powers however Juggernaut is not a mutant. He gained is ability from the Gem of Cyttorak. How was leech able to drain its power? And of course everyone that saw the movie was probably pretty upset about how 3 of the main characters got knocked off. It was kind of ridiculous. I don't believe this will be the last X movie. It has too much of a fan base and draws in crowds outside of the comic reader's world. There is 2 I know of in talks. Wolverine and Magneto.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The characters were not insults to their origins, only to their audience.I assure you, the bulk of positive reviews come from tasteless teens.

1136,carmelsevillino,The Worst X-Men Movie but still ENTERTAINING,5,17 May 2014,"This ruined the whole franchise not giving the first two movies justice and mangling the probability of making new X Men movies already ruining one prequel and two spin offs. The movie plot circles in the not too distant future after the events of 2013's The Wolverine. In the movie you could notice some very big mistakes that will ruin the X Men franchises in the future like X Men First Class. First movie mistake is Charles and Eric finding Jean Grey for the school of mutants which is impossible because in X Men First Class Charles and Eric parted ways even before the the school for mutants was made. Second is in X Men First Class, Hankfoot made the Cerebro and not Charles and Eric. Last mistake I noticed was when Hankfoot told Wolverine he was older than him telling him he was a mutant even before he got the claws which is very false if you saw X Men Origins Wolverine he was a mutant since 1846, Stryker didn't make him a mutant he just changed this whole skeletal system, adamantium. If you won't agree watch X Men First Class you could see a cameo of Wolverine who was tr acted by the young Charles and Eric as a mutant. Well overall is a saddening movie for a lot of mutants died and lost their powers like Charles, Scott, Magneto, Mystique, Juggernaut, Rogue and many more. The only thing that makes the movie worth watching is the final fight scene. I look forward in seeing X Men Days of Future PAst to see what Bryan Singer did to fix this franchise and the mistake Brett Ratner made.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1137,stardancer385,This film had so much potential to be the best,6,28 May 2006,"You would think that the final installment of the X-men would be the best out of the trilogy, and you would walk away from the theater feeling complete. Sadly, I wasn't. This film had so much potential to be the best but it failed. Although it does have some exciting and entertaining action moments, some cheesy one-liners and elements of the storyline can't be ignored that contributed to its failure.Let's start with the good. Storm is my favorite X-men character so I was glad to finally see her take on a more important role, as well as see her use her powers to the max, combined with some fist-fighting action. I loved the opening scene where we see Prof. X and Magneto as friends, who have come to Jean Grey's house when she was a child. It showed another side of their relationship that made you understand Magneto more, especially after Prof. X died and Magneto scolds Pyro by saying he regrets that Prof. X had to die for their dream to live. The way he says this line is more mournful rather than evil in my opinion. I also enjoyed the battle between Iceman and Pyro, and seeing Iceman become all ice was thrilling. The scenes with Angel were great as well but I wish the character was used more in action scenes, instead of just flying across the sky (although these shots were beautiful).But while these scenes were fun to watch, the film lacked emotional value that made the first two (especially the second) so strong. With the premise being that there is a cure for mutants, and what mutants think about it, the emotions should be the strongest out of the three but it was weak. You see hints of it but it is then never completed. For example, at the last minute Angel doesn't want the cure and he quickly but strongly counters his dad, before flying out the window. Storm explaining how mutants are not a disease, and that they shouldn't get the cure also are small glimmers into their emotions.The real character who should be the strongest in all this is Rogue, but her crisis seems to rushed and predictable. Of course we know she would want the cure the most...so she can finally touch people without worry of killing them. There's more added pressure because she has a boyfriend (Bobby/Iceman) and he seems to be begging for something more intimate, especially as we see him become closer with another mutant Katie, and the skating scene says it all. It is that scene that sparks Rogue to leave and get the cure. But even a small talk with Wolverine (her first mutant friend) can't stop her or rethink the situation. She still gets the cure. Yet even at the end, Bobby isn't all happy or excited. Does he even love her or respect her decision at this point? In my opinion, the film might have been better if Rogue didn't get the cure because being a mutant is who she is (no matter what their power). Additionally, her power could have been very useful during the final battle, especially when Phoenix seemed to be going on a rage destroying things. As a result, I was really disappointed I didn't get to see Rogue in more action scenes since she didn't have many in the first two.Other disappoints were the character Night-crawler was completely absent. I don't know if they couldn't get the actor who played him but Night-crawler still should have been in the film, continuing from the second. Same for Cyclops. Why did Wolverine have to be the one who saves Jean when Cycops is the one who loves her, and Jean loves back. Cyclops was barely in the film, and his only role in the film was that Jean killed the man she loved because she couldn't control her powers (the Phoenix). Hope, faith, and love were values made apparent in the first two and hardly developed in the third. Sure, Wolverine killed Jean because he loves her but why couldn't Jean overpower the Phoenix within herself because of her love for Scott/Cyclops? Just a thought.While the film was still enjoyable and raises a lot of questions and issues, it had so much potential to be the best in the trilogy but in my opinion, it wasn't. At least X3 isn't the only comic book movie this summer, so there's still hope for a good one.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1138,Donodadd,Getting a bad rap.,8,26 May 2006,"X-Men 3,while nowhere near as great as the Bryan Singer directed previous titles,was not entirely a lost cause. Having seen it twice now on back to back evenings,i will admit to enjoying it more the second time around. The reason,most likely was because i knew what i was getting and not focusing on what was missing. There appears to be some editing holes throughout the film and some of the cast didn't seem to mesh as well. But,considering some of the major events that do occur, one could argue why they were in that state of being. I really wish they would have fleshed out Angel some more. Especially since he was a big part of the advertising campaign. Also considering he was one of the original X-men in the comic they could have given him his dues.Kudos to Kelsey Grammar. I have always enjoyed the Beast and for the speaking parts that he had he was brilliant. Also have to give a bow to the great Vinnie Jones. Again a character who was limited in verbiage, but, when it was there was great. Katherine ""Kitty"" Pryde filled into the desperately needed role of a young female on the team. A lot of people like Rogue but i for one found her boring. Sure her ability to absorbs people's very being is wonderful but not terribly useful. Especially when put into a movie role. Kitty's phasing ability and youthful charm were a great addition to the family. (Note:Also in the comics,Rogue had absorbed the abilities of Ms. Marvel,giving her super strength,invulnerability, and the ability to fly.Making her more interesting in the comics) Unfortunately Colossus is limited to few scenes and almost no dialog. But can we say ""Fastball Special"".If you are a fan of the comic series as well as the movies then you know that there were times that the stories and the characters seemed bland. In almost all of these cases when the storyline was done, and all the plot points put together,you ended up with something great. The most standout set of this for me was the period known as ""Disolusion(sic) and Rebirth"". If someone was to pick up any single one issue from this time they would almost certainly be disappointed. Yet if you read it from the starting issue and follow it through to its climax you would be amazed. (Believe it was right after Uncanny#226 or 227.) Go into the film with the knowledge that you already know the main characters. Try to get a feel of the new ones. And lets all hope that the real conclusion to these movies is still to come.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1139,hungro2,My Popcorn Was Fresh,5,26 May 2006,"X-men 3 is a standard comic book movie sequel. It's more of a toy commercial than a movie. It's worth the matinée price of admission (Famke Janssen and Halle Berry wear tight stuff) but not full price. The writers force character cameos that annoy fans of the comic book and make no impression whatsoever on the rest of the audience. They kill MAJOR characters without explanation and without drama. The movie would babysit boys between ages 6 and 9 for an hour and 45 minutes, but there is gratuitous bad language that earned the picture a PG-13 rating. The director didn't know if he wanted this to be intense or to be a cartoon, so he tried to split the difference. I don't think it worked. I hope they bite the bullet and put this series to bed. There is absolutely no need for X4. Since everybody on the planet went to see this movie -- twice -- there will be a fourth. I know they won't do it well, so I hope they do it as badly as possible. If Patrick Stewart won't do it; Jonathan Frakes will. If Ian McKellen wants too much money; Daniel Radcliffe will work for scale just to avoid being typecast.

The deaths were a bit too random and fast and for comic book fans its made into its own story so forget anything u learned in the comic books. It seemed to me they were just trying to throw as many superheros as possible in with no real explanation.Many cool things that are in the comic book that are not in the movie destroy the plot somewhat and a lot of understanding is lost to watchers.

But then after seeing this movie, there is no way any director could have made this good. The story went so far away from the original storyline that it became almost funny to watch. *Spoiler* When i saw Cyclops, Professor Xavior, and Jean Grey get killed, i litterly started laughing. If they are going to kill off the three most important characters, why not kill everyone and just get it over with? I was shaking my head while watching Magnetto and Rouge lose their powers. Whoever decided to write a screenplay that deviated from one of the best story lines in comic history, should be shot. The dialog sucked. The only thing i liked about this movie was that the included Beast and Angel. Kelsey Grammar did an amazing job of bringing Beast to life. I say that i liked Angel being in the story, i didn't say that i liked the way they used him. He is one of the original X-men, and could have been one of the coolest, but they blew it and decided that he was a worthless character. I absolutely hated this movie. Everything about it, including the very end when you see Xavior come back in the body of someone else.. What the hell??????? If you are going to kill him, just kill him.

1144,JMoscovitch,Where's Nightcrawler?,8,31 May 2006,"I just saw The Last Stand and I have to say, for all of the little blunders and inconsistencies, this was a fantastic movie. It gripped my attention from beginning to end with compelling drama and powerful action. There's just one thing that bugs me. Well, two things. But the studio would never let an X-Men movie come close to three hours in length, so I'll not complain about the brevity of such a jam-packed movie, and move on to my main point.The plot strays from the comic books, and I'm fine with that. However, within the context of the world set-up by the movies, the events of the first lead directly into the second. The same can be said about the second leading into the third. That is to say, these movies don't exist in a vacuum- Jean's ""barriers"" are somehow effected by the mutant radiation device at the end X-Men. In the second, she makes reference to this. Then, at the end of X2, she apparently dies. This is a crucial plot point driving into The Last Stand.I guess what I'm trying to say here is this: All of the characters grow and change throughout the trilogy, some quite dynamically (Jean Grey, Pyro, etc.), and some less so. But it all...fits.And then, we have Nightcrawler. This guy is introduced to us as a victim of shady government mind-control, and when the X-Men first find him, he's hiding out in an old church, afraid for his life. The X-Men give him a home, a purpose, and a family. They give him an opportunity to make amends for his unintentional attack on the President. Hell, they even gave him a lucrative spot in the official game of the Last Stand movie!!! And in spite of all of this, we are led to believe that NOT ONLY has our little blue buddy has decided to bamf on down the road (just when the X-Men need him most), but in very little time at all it seems the X-Men have forgotten him entirely.So, did I miss that all-important line explaining his absence? Was Alan Cumming disinterested in reprising his role? Did the studio execs feel they had reached there quota of blue-skinned characters, perhaps? And did they feel it was easier to ignore his absence rather than explain it, perhaps, banking on the poor long-term memory of the average movie-goer?Madness, sheer madness.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1145,larryfilmmaker,"bad film-making, bad acting, bad movie",2,25 February 2007,"So, let me get this straight? Cyclops, Xavier, and Jean Grey are all dead and Wolverine and Storm are the new leaders?! WHAT?! I know Hugh Jackman is the producer and Halle Berry won an Oscar so they can control whatever movies they work on but this is ridiculous.This movie is the biggest waste of time I experienced in 2006. My advice: GO SEE SUPERMAN RETURNS. X3 was filled with bad dialogue, cheesy one liners, horribly awkward wirework, and too many enormous plot holes (exactly WHY was Jean killing everybody?! and for somebody called PHOENIX where the heck was the fire?!). Now, anybody who grew up on X-Men for any reasons other than ""Wolverine is really cool"" knows that you can't kill off ""the big 3"". But they do. Do you know why? Because of this: $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. Of course big names and popular characters make money, but it's still frustrating to watch all tradition and great storytelling thrown aside in the name of marketing and pop culture. Hopefully somebody comes along one day and makes an X-Men movie that leaves you speechless like ""Casablanca"" or ""Cool Hand Luke"" did to me.

(However by X-men I mean Wolverine, Beast, Shadowcat, Iceman and Storm) As you all have heard by now ******SPOILER ALERT******** some idiot thought it would be a good idea to kill of Cyclops and Professor X in the early part of the movie. Who the hell runs this idea by whoever is in charge of approving things for Marvel and they said yes???? I have a bucket and a bat I would like to introduce them too. But even so I understand the Professor X death.....its mainly to show that Jean Gray has returned as the Phoenix and has no control. However they simply got rid of Cyclops because the actor decided to follow Bryan Singer and go help him with Superman......now thats just childish and immature to kill of an entire character simply because an actor decided to further his career and go make another superhero movie.Anyways my rant being over the movie is decent, has really good special effects, had a few moments that brought a smile to my face and others where you get into the action....although another gripe I have is instead of bringing to the screen other characters we like they decide to bring in unknowns to help Magneto (he simply recruits at mutant church meetings) why not introduce Scarlett Witch, Quicksilver, re-invent Sabertooth to the way he is suppose to be, Blob, Avalanche hell we have had to stomach toad in the last two might as well keep him here, instead of adding porcupine man, a transvestite shock-wave type character, and a quicksilver female that can detect mutants.....Same goes for the X-men it turns out that 6 X-men can hold off all of Magnetos forces....they should have had Nightcrawler return, KEPT Cyclops (at least till the final battle if they MUST kill him) brought in Havok, Gambit, Rogue (instead of simply writing her off give her super strength and flight already), Psyclocke etc.They could have salvaged this movie easily since some of the plot is OK, but instead of seeing unknown mutants fighting on screen show us those we like from the comics brings this one down and it just seems like a missed opportunity.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1147,xxxx2736,great movie,10,27 May 2006,"This was an excellent movie. I think it's the best of the three.Non-stop action from beginning to end and we finally get to see mutants using their powers to the fullest. Magneto rocks! Despite Halle Berry and her super-ego, I really loved this movie. Kelsey Grammar as beast was an excellent choice. he has just the right amount of charm and plays the part of an intellectual so very well. The running time of the movie was kind of short- of course I would have loved for this movie to be three hours or more. That would have been great.Bottom line- this is a good movie.A very good movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1148,boomdoggin,Fascinating reaction to a bad movie,6,26 May 2006,"I've just left the theater on opening night of The Last Stand, talked to a few people about their reactions to the film, and read several reviews on it as well. I found the third film in the X-Men series to be a major let down--not because it deviates from the X-Men comic book continuity (although it does), but more because The Last Stand is simply a bad movie. However, most people like it; despite myself, I'm awestruck and stunned.The first X-Men was a good movie, though perhaps too hasty in its transition from realism to fantasy. The second film was VERY good, and built upon the world of the first film admirably while still maintaining a grip on the real world--which is something most comic book movies benefit from, since, in a world over-saturated with fantasy, things like mutant superpowers aren't nearly as impressive as they are in a world grounded in realism. Brian Singer's vision of the X-Men franchise was sizing up to be one of the best comic-to-film adaptations on the market.But something's wrong here. Many people flatly liked X3, and understandably so, since it offers an abundance of pure spectacle (much of it extremely amusing, like Jones' Juggernaut, Jansen's phoenix moments and Iceman's final transformation into the blue-skinned persona familiar to comic fans) as well as many conventional, tried-and-true (ie, clichéd) plot points and themes. Beneath this circus of special effects and loosely tied-together subplots, though, lies an extremely weak screenplay. The marvelously patient pacing of the first two films is absent here, as X3 jumps right into the action and never lets up from it. The depth found in the characters developed in the first two films is not recreated in the new characters Beast, Angel, Shadowcat and Callipso, and in the case of existing character Pyro, is simply forgotten. The strong bonds formed between characters are not developed well in this film and appear forced, as in the case of Shadowcat and Iceman, Beast and Wolverine, Magneto and Dark Phoenix and many other cases. An unnecessary rabble of mutants is introduced to very little effect except for the purpose of spectacle, and other, more important and interesting characters from the first two films are ignored and left behind (who wouldn't want to see a Nightcrawler vs. Toad battle, a blooming affair between Storm and Nightcrawler).The dialogue was chiche. Too many opportunities in the heat of passionate, dramatic moments were wasted, where additional dialogue could have added strength to the characters but was simply left out in favor of some crappy line a dozen other movies have already used. Timing was too compressed, this film would have benefited from some scenes being beefed up and drawn out, especially during the first act. Characters looked fake when in flight, and Beast looked ridiculous in the heat of battle (whereas, for example, Nightcrawler, Wolverine and Lady Deathstryke all managed to put on a great show in fight scenes in the second film). That cop-out ending with Professor X winding up alive after the credits was a yellow move too.The more I think of it, the more it bothers me. Not so much that the movie was bad, because, as has been proved time and again, studios are all but uninterested in making a good movie when a blockbuster spectacle will suffice. What bothers me is that NOBODY REALIZES HOW BAD THIS IS. Maybe I just care too much about plot, and I can't accept that the public thinks its trivial.But I have a dream, of a world where blockbusters can be both spectacular and well-told... *sigh*",X-Men - The Last Stand
1149,herofourzero,You always want more with X-men,9,30 May 2006,"Regardless of whether you are a movie fan, comic fan, or a fan of the animated series what matters is that Brett Ratner has put together a movie that invested fans will appreciate. We all would have loved for it to be longer or to include more characters, but the fact of the matter is.. X-men delivers. This time around relationships are tested, lives are on the line, and tragedy is imminent. This time around viewers care about our heroes' futures and understand that (yes like the tag-line) it is the last stand. Should there be another sequel? You bet, Ratner leaves the audience wanting more... and like any good movie... he does.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1150,kendall-thomas,I did't want it to end!,10,28 May 2006,"Ratner has taken the challenge to direct this new edition of the X-Men Franchise and has officially hit a home-run. Visually amazing, great plot twists, incredible fight scenes, and a final touch of humor. If you are a a Marvel fan or just a fan of the movies, then you will not be upset with X3. I could't turn away from the screen and I found myself hoping that it wouldn't end. I recommend to anyone remotely interested, go and see this flick. However I would be wary of taking the kids, this is rated PG-13 for a reason. Also a small tip, stay past the credits. I give X-Men 3: the final stand a well-earned 10 out of 10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1151,iggysub-1,Disappointing,4,26 May 2006,"So many cheesy moments, bad dialogue, and melodrama. I just couldn't believe it. Its a shame what they've done with this franchise. Bryan Singer's influence is sorely missed. This movie may be worth watching for all the action. But if you're a fan of the first two like I am, its just painful to watch all your favorite characters act out so many bad scenes. This movie was just horribly put together.There was also a lot of mindless carnage in this movie which made it seem... less classy. Yet somehow it almost has a Disney-esquire feel because of all the melodrama. This often made it comical.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1152,cloudynow,A major disappointment (with spoilers),7,20 September 2006,"I really can't believe how they did such horrible movie with enormous richness of X-Men universe. It seems very clear to me that they wanted to end the series. That can be understandable in some regards but to end it with such crap is unforgivable. Xavier, Jean Grey and Cyclops dead? Wolwerine trying to arrange the battle lines, acting like what, Cyclops? A mute Colossus? Angel only flying a little and saving his father? Rogue giving up her powers permanently? Just small cameos of many characters to keep the fans happy? What is the rush for? God! Seems Marvel people themselves wanted to end it too. If they were not in it, I would say no one working on this ever read an X-book. I am very sorry to say only the Beast's battle scenes (not much though) and CGI were pleasant. This movie is an insult to X-fans!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1153,osborne_trent,"truly unique, climatic and unforgettable superhero film (Warning possible spoilers)",10,20 September 2015,"X men the last stand is the follow up to X men United which set the stage for the introduction of Dark Phoenix which would lead into the iconic comic saga while also leaving the conflict between humans and mutants up in the air. This movie picks up where the other left off introducing two stories each mostly focusing on a different part of the cast. Warning there may be some spoilers ahead. The first is the discovery of a controversial cure for the mutant x gene leaving mutants a choice to give up their gifts or maintain them this is quite the deep and meaningful plot as the moral ambiguity surrounding this situation is explored through numerous ways rather it being one desiring the cure because they see their powers as a curse or another rejecting it because it's what someone else wants rather than them. We see mutants protesting in mass while others line up in mass. The cast focused on in this plot are Bobby, Rogue, Kitty, Beast, Pyro, Magneto and to an extent Angel and Mystique.The second plot deals with Jean's return and her transformation into Dark Phoenix. this plot reveals the back story of not just the film but the movie mythology in general giving us more information on Xaiver and Magneto's history together.This arc is very emotional up until Days of future past this was the most emotional story to ever come out of the movies it's also the most intense and still is to this very day featuring several scenes that are both heart wrenching and nail biting this arc moves fast cranking up the emotion and tension with each scene it also explores the morals of the misuse of power especially when trying to control power beyond you. The whole arc shines and is undeniably the highlight of the movie it focuses on Wolverine, Storm, Xaiver, Jean and Magneto. Comic fans will have to accept that isn't the comic story especially what happens with Cyclops which is a central reason this movie is as hated as it is which is just not right as the story is still incredible rather the main character is Cyclops or Wolverine. The cast deliver solid performances Hugh Jackman delivers his most emotional performance in the trilogy and Halle Berry really shines Patrick Stewart gives his best performance in the franchise especially during a climatic scene at Jean's house but the stars of the movie are Ian Mckellen and Famake Jenson. Ian delivers his best performance in the franchise and probably the best Magneto performance period he really does shine showing that he is Magneto showing his calm collected and intelligent side while also showing a lot of humanity this is a performance he should be proud of. Famake on the other hand is a completely different league she only has a few lines all throughout but she delivers them perfectly portraying a disturbingly accurate portrayal of multiple personality disorder shifting from one to the other and her near lifeless spaced out expression is unnerving showing someone who is truly lost and confused and certainly not in control her performance is incredible stunning really and in my opinion near Oscar worthy especially a scene in the middle between her and Hugh. The rest of the cast does well though it is Kelsey Grammar who shines his performance as Beast is spot on and is given numerous great scenes he appears all throughout and is probably the most prominent character in the cure arc. The action is of course great this film is the only X men film to truly have large scale battles the final battle is the largest scene to come out of any X men movie and is a truly climatic showdown to conclude the trilogy though the best scene is the face off at jean's house the scene is intense and is probably still unmatched in the franchise. The visual effects are also great rather it be The Phoenix levitating her entire house or Magneto moving the golden gate bridge the mutant powers are on full display here but fear not the visual effects while great never overtake the story. Finally what makes this film so unique is the fact that it defies all the comic book expectations this film was called the Last stand and that is exactly what it is the end of a story and indeed it does wrap up nearly every characters story arc some very definitively. (spoilers lie ahead.) This movie is controversial it does unthinkable things in most stories the cure would be seen as unethical and taking would be wrong not here a main character takes it and is depicted as being right because it's what they wanted. Three main characters are stripped of their powers the first which happens a third of the way in a moment that screams all bets are off but this pales in comparison to the devastation that is Dark Phoenix never before has Dark Phoenix been this impacting in fact many people perish by her hand even more shocking is what happens in the half way point spoilers don't read further) When one of the most beloved characters in the franchise is obliterated by Phoenix in one of most memorable scenes in any marvel movie the death is a true turning point in the film. The scale of the story is ambitious and the deaths are shocking but all are meaningful in no way is this film rushed with both plots getting about as much focus as the Stryker arc from the second. X men The Last Stand a truly unforgettable super hero film that goes beyond so many others defying expectations and taking true risks that it is not only the best in the trilogy but one of the best superhero films period. Fight on X3 and stand tall you always.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1154,fireworkz2k,Very Lazy,4,25 May 2006,"Considering this was meant to be one of this summer's blockbuster's, i found it to be a lazy attempt compared to the other two films, which were a lot better.Most of the characters were given so little time, you don't care about any of them, and a few of the characters disappeared completely without explanation. This was obviously Hugh Jackman's and Halle Berry's film, who weren't even that convincing themselves.And who can forget Vinnie Jones' 'memorable' character 'Juggernaut'. What was that all about.The whole film was obviously trying to cram in far too much story for it's own good, as a lot of detail was sacrificed for random cameos.All in all I walked out laughing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1155,matthewjgeary,X-Men: The Last Strand: (Of Stan Lee's Self Respect?),3,8 June 2006,"As an Australian i am perhaps somewhat biased. As such, i am the first to acknowledge that perhaps the only substantive, redeeming factor of this movie is Hugh Jackman (aka Wolverine). His hair still sucks, he can't really smoke a cigar and his super hero skills ( 'adamantium' and healing himself) are quite unimpressive. However he can act - just, in this movie.Compared to the rest of the cast, however, Hugh Jackman's acting skills are acceptable. The problem with this movie is that it is like a bad sequel - a deformed and retarded creation that should never have seen the light of day. Halle Berry is clearly disinterested in what she is doing and Patrick Stewart is as wooden as ever: (Yes, he is bald, and speaks with a slightly gentrified English accent but that never made him a good actor in Star Trek Generation - and it does not here either!). The script of this movie is awful. That much is beyond contention. However, as always, one would expect an action movie, particularly one involving super heroes to rack up some brownie points in the special effects department. This movie does not. The 'special effects' are singularly unimpresive. The explosions look like something you would see on a tour of Universal Studios and the CGI is basic at best. The effects displayed in the 'explosive fianl battle' of the movie barely rate a comment. As was demonstrated by Apocalypse Now - the best way to depict the destruction of buildings for the purposes of a movie is to drop a few napalm cannisters on a village while the camera is running. Decent special effects are certainly lacking in this movie.I enjoyed X-Men and thought X2 was impressive and interesting. I am a comic collector and enjoy watching special effects on screen. I also enjoy watching decent acting. However, I found little to enjoy in this movie. Those that should be major characters are relegated to bit parts, while the acting skills of accomplished actors such as Ian McKellan are not utilised at all. Script: predictable Special effects: underwhelmingWhile i sat through this movie with the dignity not to complain excessively, upon exiting the theatre i wished i was man enough to demand a refund. Don't make the same mistake, see ""V for Vendetta"" instead and watch a movie with substance (and explosions, lycra and killing).",X-Men - The Last Stand
1156,morgan_peline,What a disappointment,1,26 May 2006,"I went to see this on the day it was released and I don't think I have been so disappointed by watching a sequel in a long while apart from being really upset by watching Matrix 2 and 3 and Star Wars 1, 2 and 3...other cinematic worlds that have been ruined by scripwriters who wrote by numbers with little care to what they were doing all for a fast buck.Considering, the scriptwriters have written some really good screenplays in the past including X2 and Mr & Mrs Smith...I don't understand what happened...of course Last Action Hero, Fantastic Four and Inspector Gadget also figured in their credits...They took what was a truly well made series of films: X1 and X2 that oozed dark subtext within the cineplex blockbuster action genre and completely ruined the ending, with complete disregard to good dramatic structure and most importantly, with a total lack of respect for their characters. Characters we as the audience had grown to love.Whereas in the first two films these characters had real motivations and interior lives especially Wolverine and Rogue and lived in a world that true resonance in the real world. Now in X3 they have become cardboard cut outs that only seem to fight a lot, talk tough or give rousing American style pep talks. What happened to the subtle charcterization from the first two films? I am very unhappy. The production team, especially the writers should be shot for producing such rubbish when they had the potential in terms of established cinematic world, characterization and underlying audience support to create a true action0-film / political-thriller masterpiece. And how could Marvel let the production go ahead with such a scant shoddy script in place? All for a fast buck...nobody seems to care about what they create anymore",X-Men - The Last Stand
1157,arkizx,The scriptwriter and director don't know x-men,2,24 May 2006,"I was very disappointed with this movie. My expectation was very high but the movie is the worst of the trilogy. The director and scriptwriter seems to be not familiar with x-men. They don't seem to be reading the comics or watching cartoons or perhaps they don't know the previous parts. The story is very poor. They should be fighting an army of sentinels or some other super villains. Some very important characters were missing like night-crawler and gambit. I was hoping for a fight scene between juggernaut and colossus would be great but they seem to miss that. There are many casting mistakes and questionable characters. Why not put quicksilver instead of that speedy woman? And if everybody is a mutant, it's no fun anymore.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1158,inflator1,"good, not great, but good...",7,29 May 2006,"A couple quick thoughts... This was a good movie, and therefore, I was a little disappointed. Every time I was a trailer for the movie on television, I burst out in applause I was so excited, and I had so hyped it up that it disappointed me. The whole movie was just too rushed. This was something I suspected going into the movie, when I learned that it was only an hour and 44 (or was it 47) minutes long. It seemed to short to me, and it was. For the amount of stuff that was in the movie, it could have been, and should have been a 3 and a half hour movie. This would have lead to better development in the plot lines and to a better movie over all. This had all the makings of a once in a life-time movie, but left short. Like I said, I think this is primarily due to length. Still a good movie, and you should definitely see it.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Nothing but talking, figuring out, talking and more figuring out. Do yourself a favor, save your money, and DO NOT watch this terrible end to a good first two movies. The mutants have misconstrued roles and the movie does not stay true to the comic book, especially w/ characters like Beast, Phoenix, and Cyclops.

1160,boom_e85,"As a movie trilogy, decent. As a comic-turned-movie trilogy, completely off.",4,26 May 2006,"First of all, this particular installment is best viewed if you go into it with NO EXPECTATIONS. The storyline is established enough to give the characters something to work off on, but it is weakly developed and supported.Angel's role is limited in scenes (something that was falsely advertised as him having a bigger role in this movie). Jean Grey's Phoenix entity is explained in a way that doesn't agree with the comic's explanation (and she's barely referred to as ""Phoenix"").Effects and action scenes were fantastic, but there isn't depth to it.I think this movie is best viewed as separate from the comic world. What you think you know about the X-men world doesn't get honored or acknowledged much in this movie.I liked it for what it was, but I hated it for what it wasn't.",X-Men - The Last Stand

As far as the movie industry/box office goes, the numbers have been great the past few weeks. The movie industry has been bouncing back as of late. X-Men 3 has broken a couple of records at the box office. I work in the movie industry, I know the numbers. Yes there are some horrible movies that come out of Hollywood, but there are also some great films too. The movie business is a risk. A director and producer don't know if a movie is going to make a profit or not (do well or not) until they release the film. So yes there are crappy films and great films.

I have to say the people who didn't like this film because it was missing Gambit or because you felt that there was little character development are nuts. First off, this is a movie, not a comic book or a cartoon. Each character that is introduced costs the studio more money.I know thats may be a week defense for that argument, BUT remember that this is a film. And for a film to make money it not only has to appeal to the original fans of the comic, but it also has to make new fans and those fans will have to like the movie otherwise the movie will fail. With that being said you don't want to confuse the non-comic book fans by complicating the story.I thought the story was excellent. It followed the other 2 MOVIES very well. Yes the story did not follow the X-Men universe from the comic, but where not talking about a comic we're talking about a movie.I think the special effects where top notch and so was the direction. Don't listen to the nay sayers, this film was excellent. If you liked the other two films you'll love this final installment in the series.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I've got a kind of rule. Be always prepared for a crap when going to see new-substitutionary-director-of-old-great-movie-sequel. It always comes with a pleasant surprise. Last Stand simply couldn't be compared to Singer's two movies. It's not a saga or drama anymore. It's a nice, full-action-packed comedy. I laugh a lot. But I also was very annoyed with two moments:  Rattner made Wolverine to cry both times Xavier and Phoenix-Grey died. It's stupid! There would be more drama in those scenes, if Wolverine cut professor's empty chair in pieces! Crying beast? It's a bul---it!  ""There are no mutants higher than 2 level, except you two"" (Callisto to Magneto and Pyro, I've heard it in Russian only, so translation may be incorrect).

1164,pookeebear,Good for movie..and that's about it.,6,1 June 2006,"*** This comment does contain spoilers so read with caution***** First of all, if you are a COMIC book fan of the x-men series read no further; the movie will definitely leave a bad taste in your mouth. Second, if you are an action sequence fan, and just love the X-Men period, then read on. How did I feel about this movie? I felt off-shifted if that's an emotion. I liked the beginning sequence with the 2 opposing forces joined as one unit to seek out a young Jean Grey. I liked the danger room sequence incredibly, I felt though that this was a ""days of future past"" scene and expected to see a Bishop cameo but when the training sequence ended and saw it was actually images from the Danger Room I was relieved. Some fans will be wondering why they didn't introduce the ""Danger Room"" explicitly but any X-Men fan, new or old wouldn't need an explanation of what the Danger Room is used for, plain and simple. So people...stop complaining! you don't need a scientist to understand that a training sequence is just a training sequence, and there is no need for a ""reason"" why the danger room trains X-Men, c'mon give us a break here! I didn't like that Professor X got killed. I mean...technically his telepathy is, should be, stronger than ANYBODY's including Jean Grey's no matter what 'mutant entity' is taking over her persona. As far as the storyline though, when Proffesor X explained to Logan that he inhibited Jean's power because she developed that alter ego she called ""the phoenix"" then he got what he deserved. As Logan asked the professor or commented to him ""you didn't give her a choice?"" I also like the respect that Eric Lenscher gave Professor as he snapped back at Pyro saying ""Charles Xavier has done more good for the mutant cause as you will ever imagine"" Those two will be bitter enemies and true friends for a very long time. Okay now, for the action sequences...OUTSTANDING. Everything I wanted to see as far as special effect in the first 2 movies are there in the third. Storm flying..I mean really flying..shooting off lightning bolts from her hands instead of a far off cloud in the sky...Kitty Pride! Oh just a note...Kitty Pride is the young, inexperienced version of ""Kitty Pride"" she wasn't ""SHADOWCAT"" until she got a little older and after she's gotten more experience...so don't throw a temper tantrum if you don't here her codename being mentioned in the film..get over it! I felt the Beast was done justice and Kelsey Grammar as the fur-ball was an excellent choice...I couldn't picture anybody else looking or even sounding the part. I was disappointed that there was much hype for ANGEL during the previews but he really isn't necessary in the movie..just mutant eye candy, if you could picture it. He totally is a newbie in this movie and there is no reference to him or any part of him being an original member, so die-hard-fundamental-X-Men fans..beware..you'll be disappointed. There is a good flashback sequence of a young Warren Worthington III that should have deserved more airtime..but..after this is a Ratner film, so no real storyline there, just flashbacks. Very disappointing. A chance of a sequel? Yes, quite possibly, especially when you see the end. Oh and by the way...If any movie execs from the film might be reading this just a small request...BRING BACK NIGHTCRAWLER...his comic antics was greatly needed in the X-3 so called ""last stand"" If Allan Cummings won't do it again then ask Zach Braff from ""Scrubs"" I could picture him being Nightcrawler..same body type.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1165,iamnotafish,An explosion is worth a thousand lines of character development,6,26 May 2006,"So I finished watching this movie and I can honestly say that it didn't work for me. One problem a movie of this size (in terms of cast) has is that you can't focus on anyone. Therein lies the problem - by the end of the movie, you don't feel anything for any of the characters. There are some scenes I didn't see coming, but they're dealt with quite heavy-handedly and don't have the shock-factor Ratner must have hoped.The story is pretty straightforward, but it all seemed like they got into a room, went ""Okay guys, we want this scene, this scene, this scene and this scene. How can we fit it together?"" The story doesn't really flow, and none of the characters are particularly well fleshed out. You can tell Halle Berry got her wish for increased screen time, and she was incredibly annoying, delivering a robotic performance in stark contrast to some of the other roles she's done.On the plus side: there were some nice references to the comics. Certain phrases and actions were straight out of the comics (Beast's entrance, the Fastball Special) which was good for me as a fan boy. Kelsey Grammar did an awesome job as Beast - he conveyed all the intelligence Beast is known for in the comics. Yes, he sounded like Frasier in a blue furry suit, but thats exactly who Beast is. So that worked well.I make the movie sound like a disaster, but it really wasn't that bad. A problem most trilogies face is that by the third movie, they've developed a good fan base, and the first two movies must have been well received. X-Men 2 was phenomenal and following up an act like that would be difficult for even the best directors and writers.I look forward to the directors edition. The addition of a few more scenes might flesh the movie out better so my above criticisms would be be moot.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I didn't find anything wrong with the movie at all and actually didn't expect it to be as good as it really was. The fighting scenes were very well acted out and the suspense of the fight was present as in the other movies in this series. I love super hero movies and watching this one was just as thrilling and I would probably have to say it is one of my favorite super hero movies. It also heads more into the personal lives of some of the characters and a couple surprise deaths that keeps the movie from focusing a lot more on the violence. I give it 2 thumbs up, 10 stars. Great movie!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1167,hellshock-1,An enjoyable film for people with open minds,8,27 May 2006,"Let me get this out of the way: I loved this movie. And, before anyone makes the claim that I am some sort of non-fan, johnny-come-lately, only here because I liked the first two films kind of guy, I've been collecting comics since the eighties and have read many of the old books from the sixties and seventies. So, no, I'm not some poser fan.This movie is just fun. After the cerebral and somewhat slow paced first two films, it was fun being able to just enjoy the action.Yes, the movie lacked character development... and much, I imagine had to be due to the short running time. But in the end, I wanted to watch it again.Many people complained that the characters were somehow misportrayed. I'm wondering if I saw the same film as them. Magneto still as motivated as always... Cyclops driven to act the way he does by grief... Wolverine finally coming to grips with his role as member of the family. Jean showing the conflict that she struggled with to maintain (and ultimately losing) control.I do wish that they cut back on the amount of mutants and tried to focus on a smaller group... but oh well.BTW... I've been seeing people complain about the lack of Nightcrawler... play the new video game and you'll find out why the character didn't come back.Comic fanboys really need to lighten up and just enjoy the spectacle. Too many people complain that it doesn't follow the comics closely enough (in terms of story and/or character) and some even feel that it doesn't follow the previous movies enough. To them I say: HUH? Not even the first two movies followed the comic books... even remotely. And yet somehow fanboys all over the world rejoiced at the ""acurate portrayal""? HAH! And how can one complain about the movie continuity. Last time I checked, the story picked up right were the second one left off. Really, fanboys... you stay any tighter about this and you'll pass a diamond.To the work of Brett... sure it lacks the visual stylings of Bryan Singer... but you know what, I liked it. Some of the FX were lacking (Colosus didn't look as cool as his brief cameo in the second film) and the movie could have stood to be longer, but the pacing and action were excellent. (and people really need to stop blaming him for the story... he directed it. People need to complain to the script writers) Go in and watch with an open mind. You'll have fun.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1168,christothefrantz,"Best action of the 3, worst story",6,7 August 2006,"I had the weirdest feeling after I watched this movie. I didn't know how I felt about it. I loved it and hated it at the same time, so I'll break this review up into two categories.First, the bad. The movie is only 1 hour and 44 minutes long, which is way too short if this is truly the last X film (which they make very clear). Also, the way death is handled. The only person who seems to care and acknowledge the fact that Cyclops may be dead is Wolverine. Even though it is only implied that he died, and it is never made clear, they never mention it again in the film. Also, couldn't Professor X just read his mind and find out whether he was or not? On top of that nightcrawler is gone with no explanation; Rogue is absent from most of the action even though the first film is told from her point of view, Collossus only gets a few cool scenes (he has a larger role though), and Angel has about 10 total minutes of screen time.But the movie does has some redeeming qualities. The second movie was by far the best, but this one has THE best and most rewarding action sequences out of the series. Storm kicks so much ass throughout the film, the fight scenes are well choreographed (Esspescially the scene in Jean's house), and Kelsey Grammers Beast is excellent. And fans of the comic will love the amount of mutants packed into the film. Kitty Pryde is surprisingly cute and entertaining as well. The final battle is explosive and very emotional. Anyway, it's not as bad as a lot of fanboys say. It would be impossible to make a movie and follow the comics to the letter, especially with the PHoenix saga. Hopefully the DVD will incorporate some deleted scenes.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1169,lunachild,Hollywood dips into comic book realm to pull out a winner.,10,27 May 2006,"Once again Hollywood dips into the comic book realm to pull out another movie. It paid off for them again in the Xmen franchise. This movie was a lot darker than the other two, with a lot more killing than had been in the first two. There was a lot of raw emotion floating around too, with everyone still reeling from Jean's death in the last movie. There are a few new mutants, some with some pretty awesome powers, and of course there are the humans who don't want people to have mutations, ie, the person who develops ""the cure"". In all, it was an awesome movie, with great action, some really great one liners coming from Hugh Jackman as always. Halle Berry doesn't seem very believable in this one, but then again, she was still reeling from the bad reviews from Catwoman, so you cant really blame her. I say its a movie worth seeing again, but seeing how I ticked off my babysitter last night by having to see the late show since EVERY other show was sold out, I will have to wait for it to come out on DVD. It was a good movie, worth your 8 bucks for admission. I think guys and girls will both have a good time with this one, since not only is it an action flick (for you fellas), it has a love story undertone (for you ladies...or you sensitive fellas). Not only will you love it, you wont be able to stop talking about it after you see it. GO SEE IT!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1170,kem0141,Rats,4,26 May 2006,"I was real excited as I'm sure many were and are to see X3. The only comments on here so far that i have seen have praised the movie for its intelligence and such. This is what i felt the movie lacked. Sure there were some decent special effects and so on, but the story lacked in a major way. I loved the first two and my suggestion is only that you be wary. Wait until opening weekend is over and don't force yourself into a crowded theater for this mediocre finale. My personal opinion is that Ratner is responsible for ruining the final film and although i have liked several of his previous films, I feel he simply didn't take the time to make this movie as great as it should have been. Singer, thank you for taking Superman on because Ratner would have just ruined it like he did your glorious X-Men.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1171,jeroen-98,Disappointing,5,16 June 2006,"I went to see x-men 3 with high hopes. X2 was better than the first movie, and it ended with a huge bird looking figure in the lake where Jean Grey was last seen.After the movie ended i left the theater unsatisfied. No huge phoenix, no fire in Jean Grey's eyes, like she had when she was battling scott. More than that, she was the only level 5 mutant (when did they start giving powerlevels to mutant powers anyway) with a wicked mind, but was only displayed as a weapon for magneto to take down the human opposition. She should've been more than that.Another thing that bothered me was the introduction of Beast, Hank mcCoy. I remember a scene from one of the first movies where you could see a TV show on which Hank could be seen before he was mutated, arguing on behalf of the mutants. In this movie we see him fighting along side wolverine pretending to never have met, yet claiming he had been with the x-men before.Finally Juggernaut was pictured as a normal random mutant, without any relations towards Xavier, or hate against him. Couldn't they have used some other mutant with less potential story line for this part? He didn't add anything to the movie.The movie did have his good points. I loved the way Archangel rescued his father, from falling to his death, catching him in full flight after his father wanted him to be the first to be cured.The Golden Gate scene was awesome. Some might claim it was too much, and totally unbelievable, even for a comicflick. But hearing about how much trouble they went to shooting that scene with a 2500 foot model, i could do nothing else but smile.I must say i loved the easter egg after the end credits. It made me believe there will be a 4th movie. Let's hope that one will be better than this one.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1172,ProtossX,X-Men Movies have all failed (including X3) next to great films like Spiderman + Batman Begins thats a fact,5,31 May 2006,"Brett Ratner did pretty good job considering the the original x-men director Bryan Singer left and took all the people who worked on first films with him to go make superman returns. (which looks actually pretty good) Most of the problem's about X3 were out of Rattner's control because you take all the former writers/sound that did both of the previous movies things aren't going to sound an look the exact same as the first two.Do you think it helped that Cyclops is the star in the the new Superman film? It forced them to have to kill him off early in X3 or it would have delayed the film to get him in more scenes.Anyway here is some reasons though why X3 fell short and isn't as good as other comic movies.Rogue - the worst character through all three movies does absolutely nothing at all in this film...She was one of my favorite characters in the cartoon, could fly, had super human strength, yet in movies she was completely worthless an didn't fight at all, and was tight cast to be the movies mutant pity character who made you feel sorry her so that people might see the cure could be used for good.Gambit - one of the best x-men is nowhere in this film :\ yet they make room for ice-kid + some new kid-chick an of course fire-boyBeast - sucked horribly, he did one fight scene for about three seconds where he kicks a few mutants, he only talks five times in the movie an doesn't sound intellectual when he speaks. He makes no connection with any characters...he really just doesn't ever fit in the movie at all or the x-men...while in the cartoon I remember he actually is very useful and has good idea's and gets crap done by himself. In this movie he was politician an offered nothing really at all to the team.Wolverine - Hugh Jackman acts even worse then Halle berry in X3, also not only is the actor not good but the script for him is awful.... he makes out with jean Grey even tho he knows she had gone crazy and killed cyclops....yet he makes out with her for like 5 minutes right after that scene where he found Cyclops vanished and his glasses floating around yet all that doesn't seem to have wolverine bothered at all once he sees her boobs !!!???!?! (doesn't make sense) Angel - Trailers made him out to have a much bigger role basically he speaks twice in the movie and you only see him for about 5 seconds both times, could have just not had him in film at all and made a mutant we already knew fill in for him insteadWorst part of the film is when the army started using plastic weaponry with cure needles I know they can't use metal but it just seemed very cheesy like they were shooting mutants with super soaker's....this kind of stuff you don't want to see in a movie of this budget.I also laughed when magneto started throwing cars off the golden-gate bridge an the flame-boy decides to flame them up beforehand. (Basically the director saying how can we make things explode, oh lets just have the flame-kid throw some flames on magneto's car like some kind of fantastic 4 ending battle rip off)X-men on fox-kids being my favorite cartoon I knew from the start that they really dropped the ball at making the movies any good. How hard would it have been to find actor's that portray the characters? Find someone who's grittier then Hugh Jackman, easy. Get someone who's less attention whoring then Hallie berry, is it that really that hard to do either? Please understand these people don't fit the roles, the worst possible choice was the magneto actor who looks like hes 80 years old when magneto is only in his 50's and his costume design's seemed way off, the villains were not developed enough especially toad that was the worst character ever.The first x-men film was a really cheesy and trashy movie IMO compared to x-men 3 if your going to compare which movie gave me better bang for the buck an more entertainment people will always pick x3. Overall I think they all were like mediocre movies in there own waysId rate X1 5/10 X2 6/10 X3 7/10 spider-man 9/10 spider-man 2 10/10 batman begins 10/10See how all the x-men movies especially the first ones don't stack up to the competition? Both directors failed not just Dan Rattner, both of them don't compare to the director's who did batman ran returns an spider-man so don't blame one or the other blame them both for not being able to bring x-men to the movies on the same level.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I went to see the movie sat down and the first bit i was like OK why is little jean angry. so i forgot about it and then saw Juggernaut thought yay its gonna be cool, then something happened just then... HE TALKED!!! ""HE IS A POOF!"" i thought to myself then juggernaut walks right past professor Xavier why didn't juggernaut react to his brother being there!! Then all of a sudden they mentioned that the Phoenix is jean being all skitzo! i tried to make myself like it but i couldn't this movie is terrible they don't show what half of the mutants they put init what they can do. Finally why in the hell did Brett Ratner direct this what the hell does he know about comics. i could have never got Brett Ratner to direct this film and not let the writers write it. to conclude this argument against the film the only good thing about this film is first the effects were pretty good and second the concept art they never used!! was good but oh no stupid Bretty never used it.

1174,i_kant_spel,X-Men through the eyes of a comic fan,9,29 May 2006,"If you are a fan of the X-Men comics, you will love the little details that are just for you. In fact, the little details really make this movie. There are some story lines and ""wrongful use of characters"" that will make you cringe, but I must say that the actors and writers really stayed true to the main characters.I was so happy will all the developments except for Storm, Ice Man, Rouge, and Kitty Pride. My problem with Storm is basically that she is my favorite character and so I don't think I will ever be happy with anyone who plays her. Hally Berry is a great actress, but she will never be Storm for me. I just have a problem getting my head around the changes in the story for Ice Man, Kitty, and Rouge.I have to say that I am so happy with the original five being in the movie, even if the story line is weird. At least they are there. Kelsy Grammar is Beast. He will amaze you beyond words. He is perfect. As perfect as Patrick Stewart is for Professor X.The Phoenix story line is a little off, but I've been thinking about it and it could work with what really happened. After you come to terms with the fact that the movies are not going to follow the comics, you should really enjoy them. They do stay true to the characters and the spirit of X-Men.I was happy with the movie. The special effects, acting, and writing were awesome. I squealed with delight many times.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1175,astone87,"Save Your Money, Wait for the DVD",6,16 June 2006,"The movie starts off well but never seems to keep it's ground. When major characters die throughout the film, whom you've come to know and love throughout the previous two (even comic book fans), there is no emotional effect because, quite simply, the film is rushed. The strong points to this film are Wolverine, Beast, Magneto, and the ending. The rest of the film isn't that great. It is entertaining, but frustrating. You're never really told when one of the major characters die, it's hinted. When the second one dies you have no time to react because just as soon as he/she dies, you're past his/her funeral. The only real time you feel even a small bit of emotion is during the final scenes of the film. Anna Paquin's acting as Rogue finally shines in this film, however, she's only on screen for five minutes. You never get to see Rogue's potential and are disappointed with what they do with her. Also, Halle Berry's negotiating for a stronger role in this film hurts the film because although Halle Berry is a good actor (and nice body), Storm's voice is also interjecting ideas like the person who always plays devil's advocate which in turns hurts the other characters and their dialogue throughout the film. Furthermore, you never really get the big epic fight you're expecting from the bad guys such as Pyro and Juggernaught. They're hyped up throughout the film but finished fast. The ending to the film, the big battle, is a good part for two reasons. One is that you finally see the x men do their thing. Go all out and fight. Secondly, you get to see the Dark Pheonix do her thing. Destroy everything that exists. My biggest problem with the film is how the pacing is rushed. This isn't merely Brett Ratner's fault, because he did what he could with the script and deadline he had, but rather Fox's. If Fox had let this film grow, mature, and let Ratner go into the minute details without having the deadline of coming out before Superman Returns to start off the summer, the film may have been with par with the other two.This is one film I recommend that you go and just rent it when it becomes available on DVD because it is not worth the admission ticket at the theaters.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1176,Geekboy325,Excellent,9,26 May 2006,"I just came from a midnight showing, and if you're skeptical at all about going and seeing it, go see it. It's simply a great movie: great storyline, great action, great acting, etc. There are, of course, a couple drawbacks. I wasn't going to mention them because they're not a big deal, but apparently this has to be 10 lines long to post. First off, I don't think the actresses picked for Jean Grey and Rogue quite fit the part, but that's completely just me. They weren't that bad or anything. Other than that, the main drawback is simply that if you're a fan of the comics, don't expect it to be anything like the comics, because it's not. At all.

Although I felt the first movie was one of the worst movies ever made, the 2nd was a vast improvement and as an xman fan as a child I was hopeful for their portrayal of several of the xmens best storys including the dark pheonix saga. After about a half an hour I realised that the poor special effects and unbelievably bad acting were paled when stood against how badly pieced together the story was. My brother, a total neutral said to me on the way out that Cyclops death was explained when they said to jean what happened to scott when she simply answered she didn't know. He laughed out loud at that one, he himself a literary scholar. The professor shattered just after walking past his half brother and not being recognised? I don't know where to start with the bad.

1178,felipecobos,If you don't know about Xmen,6,28 May 2006,"I went to see this movie, with my expectations to the ground, everyone told me it was a failure, the rating wasn't to high, so I think that's why I give it a good rating to the movie. I was after all, surprised for the quick twists in the plot of the movie, there were many things I didn't see it coming. Think of the movie as an OVA, if you don't know what it is, is when the Japanese pick a series, pick up the characters and do pretty much whatever they want with them, the final result a movie with the known characters but with a very different drama, and they do just the same with the franchise xmen. As huge fan of the Xmen comic, and in this very moment I'm writing this lines, I'm devastated what they do with my characters, nothing to do with the original idea, I hope one day someone wish to do the original series, but it's going to be a shame, because I personally think that the actors chosen for these movies were great.

1179,logan_nalliah,"A disappointment,but not terrible",5,26 May 2006,"So i saw X-men the Last stand today, I must say it did have some moments, but was definitely lacking in the character development department. The previews that i saw before seemed very promising and actually was starting to respect Brett Ratner as versatile director. But after seeing X-men the Last Stand, I think Ratner should stick to the Rush Hour Films, because this film was definitely rushed. I am I completely blaming Ratner?No, because he came on last minute, but there is no excuse for movie like this to be under 2 hours. The problems starts with the lack of character development and caring for the characters. I understand there a lot of mutants in this movie, but if the movie was like half hour longer,they could of wrapped up all of the subplots really nicely. The Iceman love triangle seemed more mentioned than naturally unfolding thru out the movie. When a certain character, which i wont say, gets killed off, the other major characters didn't seem to care, which is a major problem. Because if they don't care, the audience wont care. The only character that seemed to have some depth, was beast, but even then it was still lacking.The second problem, is that they had a good plot, the cure, but never really get into as much. They should of made the audience leaving the threatre and talking about the idea of the cure,but they didn't. The cure seemed more of a catalyst to move the movie forward. The worst part about it, it really didn't go into the depth of how it is to be a mutant like the other two did, the good and the bad. Also,I don't think the final battle should of been at Alcatraz but instead should of been at the heart of the U.S government, Washington D.C, showing how close Magneto got to seeing his dream come into Fruition. Alcatraz should of been in the movie, but should of been wiped out by the brotherhood, including that stupid mutant, leech. It would also emphasize how powerful the brotherhood was and how big of a threat they were to U.S Security.What i really liked in the movie, was how they showed Professor Xavier is as flawed as anyone else. The fact he was purposely controlled Jean thru most of life kinda of makes him as bad as Magneto to a certain point. I also liked how Magneto isn't just a pure bad guy in this film. I like how he defends Charles after Pyro makes a threat to end Charles life. I also liked how they melded the Jean Grey/Phoniex into the Story into the cure story. I like the fact that she sides with Magneto without being controlled, but instead by her own choice. What was really great were the action sequences, they were the best out of the three movies, but what brings them down are the lack of story or character development that would of helped drive those scenes home.The Bottom line, if your not expecting much from the movie, you will prolly enjoy it because of the cool action. But if you are fan of the X-men movies, you will definitely be let down, as I was. I honestly think they should of waited for another year to develop the story more, because the movie felt too rushed, this movie should of been over 2 hours long. I was really hoping for Brett Ratner to prove me wrong, but I realize he is not really good with dramas.I really wished that the producers would of worked things out with Matthew Vaughn instead, but we will never know",X-Men - The Last Stand
1180,FisherMysticForever,Not as good as the first two films.,10,27 May 2006,"In 2000, a young man named Bryan Singer gave us a movie based on what is probably the most well known superhero story of all time. The XMENThe film was a great introduction to what would become a large scale franchise. The movie set up the characters well and showed that a successful transformation from comic book to movie is possibleIn 2003, Bryan Singer followed up XMEN with its sequel. X2 XMEN United. With more creative freedom, Bryan Singer made X2 one of the best sequels ever. A rare one that outshines the original. Better story, better acting, directing, and more action. Everything was higher and the running time was 30 minutes longer. Many characters were developed and given their spotlight.Now 3 years later, we come to the final film in the XMEN franchise. XMEN The Last StandOK, let me get to the point. XMEN 3 is a big step down from the first two films. It is not as good and there is little character development. Many characters die in this movie and aren't developed well enough for their deaths to be effective and move the audience.The acting by the stars are great. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian Mckellen, Patrick Steward all give fine performances. Kelsey Grammar rules as Beast.The directing by newcomer Brett Ratner to this franchise is well and inspiring. The man honors the first two films and manages to make the movie look authentic. Each scene looks like it came right out of a comic book.The problem with this movie is the 104 minute running time. It is simply far too short. It needed to be as long as XMEN 2 to wrap up everything. The whole story goes by too fast and in certain emotional scenes, the direction feels rushed. The screenwriters need to realise that the first two movies were so great because they took the time to make the audience car about the characters. We knew what made them tick, and why they choose the side they were on.Killing off Professor X, Cyclops, and Jean Grey is a big move to make in a movie thats supposed to be the biggest if all 3 films. 104 minutes is not enough. Needs to be longer.With all that gotten out of the way, let me talk about the positivesThe action scenes and special effects. The last 40 minutes of this movie are worth the price of admission alone. Such amazing visual effects and battle scenes highlight this film. The Golden Gate Bridge sequence is truly a sight to see.Xmen 3 is the first real summer blockbuster entertainment. It is far better than Mission Impossible 3, Poseidon, Davinci Code. But it just isn't as good as the first two. Don't go in expecting it to be the best of the 3 because you will be disappointed. If you go in expecting a lot of character study, you will be disappointedGo in expecting a lot of kickass action and special effects and you will be entertained.It could've been so much better.XMEN A+ X2 A+ XMEN 3 B+",X-Men - The Last Stand
1181,ericnasariosoto,X3 was good.,9,27 May 2006,"X3 was a really good movie. It had a lot of cool action sequences. All of them were cool. I finally got to see Iceman in his ice form. Juggernaut kicked ass and exceeded my expectations. At first I thought, WHAT THE ---- did they do to Juggernaut. Now that I've seen the movie, I thought he was awesome. Angel and Beast were excellent. Pyro, Magneto and Mystique were great. Pyro looked like the Pyro I see in the comics and he had a cool flamethrower or a modified version of his lighter. Wolverine, Storm and Prof. X were great as usual, with a few retouches here and there. If I was to comment on Jean, I'd never look at her the same way again.It was sad that there was little of Cyclops. Just for the record, he's my favorite member of the X-Men. He looked cool as usual. In his moments of the movie, he was excellent. I enjoyed the moments he was in the movie, I might add. Marsden played him great. Though he ended up being with Jean, he died a tragic death. At first I thought, what did she do to him? When I found out that he died, I felt sad. SAD!!! To make things worse, she killed Prof. X. It was interesting that Logan killed her at the end.

1183,mrhouse1842,prequel to X Men 4 - The Apology,3,3 June 2006,"What a convoluted mess! The plot to this movie was very weak. Trying to mix the Phenix and ""mutant cure"" plots was a mistake and the whole film felt clumsy and almost plain stupid. I don't mind killing of characters if it helps the plot and makes the movie more dramatic but X3 had way too many key people either die or be ""cured"" way too fast. Cyclops dies in the first ten minutes and with next to no fanfare or explanation, they don't even show what happens. Only later do you hear Wolverine say that he is dead and even then I wasn't really convinced, the movie made it seem like he was going to come back in the end with some sort of explanation. Professor Xavier get blown up shortly thereafter with a dumb smile on his face, then we cut to a ridiculous looking bust of his face on the side of his memorial. The body count picks up from there and gains momentum. I think one of the things that made the first two movies work were that they felt episodic. Characters were introduced slowly and developed over time. The stories were self contained and left just enough possibility at the end that you felt that even if there were no more movies the story still had someplace to go. In X3 they were trying to make it a final climactic ending but they failed miserably. No sooner was a potentially cool character introduced they were killed or cured. As an example I am told that Psyloke was in the movie but if she was she certainly was not recognizable and apparently she dies too so there is no hope of that character ever getting a fare amount of screen time. Another problem was that the characters just didn't seem to act the way they were supposed to. Wolverine lost almost all of the edge he had in the first two. By the time the last battle rolls around his fierceness just isn't believable. Up until the part were he is incinerated Prof. X is a real jerk to everyone, Magneto seems more like a fanatical brainwashed terrorist than the visionary leader he is supposed to be, and Storm ... well just wasn't very good.At this point I get frustrated because I keep thinking of ways in which this film is just so wrong and I don't want to be here all day. I gave this film a 3 because it wasn't a terrible movie. If it wasn't an x-men movie I might have given it a 5 or 6 but the feeling of sheer disappointment I felt leaving the theater (that's $8 and 2 hours I'll never get back) and the fact that this mess of a film is the third and final chapter of a previously awesome series warranted a 3. I am going to try really hard to forget that this film exists so I can still enjoy the first two.PS: Where is Sabertooth? Where is Nightcrawler? Where is Gambit?",X-Men - The Last Stand

Ever since i saw the first teaser online i have been dying for this to come out. me and a group of my friends went to the midnight showing and i was so excited to see, what i thought, was going to be an X-men movie done the right way. but of course i was wrong. this movie was really short and the story line suffered because of it. there was so much more they could've done with the characters. i am glad they finally included juggernaut and colossus, but for the xmen to have made a final stand i wouldve expected more then just 6, and i also would have expected them to have Cyclops (actually I'm just mad he was killed off so quickly) and Rogue and Nightcrawler. where was angel in the final fight scene? i mean seriously, hes a powerful mutant who shows up at the mansion right before the final battle and he only saves his dad and doesn't fight. i can say that i am really glad they went with the dark pheonix aspect of jean grey's powers. that was what they shouldve done. i was also impressed with beast, and i don't think that there could've been a better actor to play the role. another scene in this movie that i was really looking forward to was the fight between iceman and pyro. ya i guess it was cool, but there just wasn't much to it, another disappointing aspect. overall i wasn't happy, as I'm sure you can tell, i know they say that this was the last xmen, but I'm sure there's gonna be more and I'm sure ill go see every one.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1185,sdlehman1,"In a way, I'm sad it's over...",10,4 June 2006,"...But in another way I am glad it ended with this magnificent movie! The special effects were top-notch, the acting decent in most places (I think Halle Berry is dreadful; fun to look at though), and the story moved fast and never dragged for a second. Of course, it never had time to stop with its 97 minute running time (I didn't count the credits). The action is fantastic and the effects are breath-taking. I was very worried that this third installment couldn't live up to X2 because of its running time of 30 minutes less. But, I think that X-Men: The Last Stand surpassed its prequels. I am no comic reader, but I am very sure that there are dozens of cameos that X-Men fans will look forward to seeing. The mutant battles are spectacular, especially the ones with Pheonix. Go to the last paragraph to skip spoilers.MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD: There are parts of the movie that I did not like though. These are really just nitpicking, though. I can't stand Storm. I never could, I never will. She first bothered me with her phony accent. She has always had some poorly written lines (Like the one with Toad in the first movie. Ugh!), but for some reason one of her lines really bothered me. Storm and Logan land on Alkali Lake and it's foggy. Logan says, ""I can't see a damn thing."" And then Storm says in the most sickening cheerful voice, ""I can take care of that."" Why didn't she just do it? I think they put it in there just to bother people like me. But, no big deal. I just hate her. But then you've got your ""Don't get your panties in a bunch"", ""Who's hiding, dick-head?"", and my least favorite line: SPOILER ALERT Mystique changes into a little girl on a prison truck and begs a guard to let her out. When he refuses she says (still as the little girl), ""When I get out of here, I'm going to kill you."" Then later they crash and she snaps his neck with her legs and says, ""I told you so."" Again, not a big deal, but I don't like it.MAJOR GIGANTIC SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!: There were parts of the movie that shocked me. Even though I had been hearing that Cyclops dies at the beginning of the movie, I still half expected it to be a rumor. But 25 minutes into the movie he travels to Alkali Lake, sucks a little face with Pheonix, and then all that is left of him are his red sunglasses. He was never an important character, but this caught me off guard. Then about halfway through the movie Prof. X is turned to dust. It was a stunning CGI effect, but again it caught me off guard. I thought with so many mutant deaths going on, this would be a dark and depressing movie. But, I was wrong. The movie is much too short to focus on such things.This movie is nonstop action. It is a perfect conclusion to the X-Men trilogy. But, as expected, they leave the door open a crack. I don't think there will be an X4, but I'm not sure I want one. I was very satisfied with this ending. It was the best movie of the three. Oh yes, a few more matters to address. John Powell's score for the movie is very good. Also, Brett Ratner kept his promise. It feels like a Singer movie. The movie does open slightly differently, but it is very similar to X-Men and X2. X-Men: The Last Stand will not disappoint, unless you are looking for character development, which is not contained in the movie. That's what the first two movies were for.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1186,fromthoughttofinish,Okay... sort of.,6,29 May 2006,"Not as good as number 2, this film seems to suffer from a lack of focus. Main characters (and potential new villains) are killed off with little imagination because the writers couldn't figure out how to use the actors in this film - Cyclops death seems more like a footnote in the movie.Jean Grey/Phoenix does not seem like the incarnation of reckless abandonment and evil as she was portrayed in the comic. The actress has maybe twenty lines in the whole movie. The film never appears to sure if the story is about trying to save Jean Grey or about stopping Magneto. It's not clear or convincing why Jean Grey went over to Magneto's side.All in this film is up there with Batman 3 and 4 and Return of the Jedi. Entertaining but disappointing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1187,ryanagsalud,Better than the other two combined,10,28 May 2006,"I am a true X-men fan and I've got to say, though the movie wasn't exactly close to the comics, it was definitely a great movie. For all those ""fans"" of the comics, you need to realize that this movie is an ADAPTATION SCRIPT BASED ON OTHER MATERIAL. The key words are adaptation and based on. Obviously there's going to be errors in the original plot but it doesn't mean we have to get all butt-hurt at it. It is a movie, not the comic and we should take it for how it came.I enjoyed every moment. The direction was so much better because of: 1.) The many fight scenes- Every other scene had either great action, great dialogue, and great special effects. 2.) The new fighting moves- Storm can now create lightning from her hands and can create a human hurricane, Bobby can no become solid ice, and Logan's healing powers are even better. 3.) The great script 4.) The great actors 5.) The final fight scene where the six last X-Men formed a line to protect the cure gave me chills. It was such a moving and exciting moment. I especially enjoyed their actual fight scenes. I loved seeing Beast's transition from being diplomatic to being an animal fighting machine. I loved Wolverine's fast moves and claw attacks. I loved the showdown between Bobby and Pyro. It was so good and so satisfying to finally see Pyro get what he deserved. I loved how Kitty ""fought"" Juggernaut, and the fact that she fought at all. And I ABSOLUTELY loved Storm's fight against Callisto! I loved how Storm became more physical and was able to punch and throw Callisto around. And I especially loved when she shocked Callisto to death with her lightning bolts. It was SO good!So as you can see, it was a great movie. It may not be the comic book but it exceeds any of our imaginations in just a running time of an hour and fifteen minutes. If you ask me, it was a better script, better special effects, better casting, better fight scenes, better direction and overall better than the other two combined!!! If you want to be geeks about it then go ahead and complain. But as a true fan of X-Men, I enjoyed every single moment of the movie starting from the moment I bought the ticket to the end of the credits!This was obviously a 30 out of 10 (if it were possible on the scale)",X-Men - The Last Stand
1188,zamfir_the_great,What a disappointment (From a lifelong X-fan),4,6 June 2006,"Does anyone who's seen this movie really know what exactly was the X-Men's ""Last Stand?"" Me neither. That kind of continuity flaw and logic hole plagued the ""final"" installment of the X-Men movie franchise. Apparently, Magneto and his Brotherhood of mutants plan to blow up Alcatraz, now a center for mutant cures. Is THIS what the last stand is about? Defending a medical facility? This is what caused Phoenix to nearly destroy San Francisco? It's baffling if you sit back and try to piece this story together logically.I have to believe there were so many re-writes of this script, what remains was a hodge-podge that resembles a buffet breakfast than a trilogy finale. The movie starts with the recruitment of Jean Grey twenty years earlier, indicating the movie will come full circle with Jean at the end. The next scene shows a young Angel trying to cut his developing wings, setting the groundwork for the mutant cure storyline. This probably was due to the studio and Marvel deciding that the Phoenix and mutant cure issues would be the main plots in this movie, no matter how convoluted mixing them would be. Of course, the next scene, in the ""very near future,"" featuring Sentinels, is of course, a rip-off, because they are only a figment of the Danger Room, and of course, they aren't purple. Apparently, the only color schemes mutants or their enemies can have in these movies are black leather, metallic gear, or blue skin/fur.If you are new to the X-Men, or are a casual fan, you might enjoy this movie more than a die-hard X-fan. The treatment of Mystique as this unbeatable super-spy was always a bit much for me, including the ridiculously shabby security precautions used in handling her. Then there's the Storm issue. Way back in '99, when Halle Berry was cast for the part in the first movie, she bad-mouthed the genre by complaining ""this is the only role"" she could get, then two movies later, she grandstands that she won't be in the third one unless her character ""is more like her comic character."" (read: has a bigger part). Berry admitted she doesn't really know what the Storm character is about - a serene Buddha-like voice of wisdom, embodying harmony. Her snippy, know-it-all Storm in this movie is a sharp contrast to the once-mohawked team leader in the comics. Berry's ""move it or lose it"" speeches in the movie were real groaners, and definitely brought the movie down a notch or three. For a team movie of a very popular comic book, especially one focusing on the Phoenix Saga, there should be no way Berry should get listed second in the credits.Magneto's goals were never really, well, Magneto-caliber. He was angry, he was taking a stand, and he was going to gather a bunch of leather-wearing mutants - almost all of them tattooed teenagers - in a forest, and they were going to go invade San Francisco! Sounds like the Burning Man Project or maybe Mutant Woodstock. Why wouldn't he just drop a bomb or an EMP on SF, rather than making his gang WALK to the place?For those familiar with the epic ""Dark Phoenix Saga,"" you know how Jean's transformation skips entirely over the ""good Phoenix"" aspect of Jean and goes straight to the dark side. If the movie makers are going to hint for the first two movies this aspect of Jean, it would have been nice to develop Jean a little fuller, perhaps extending into a fourth movie, but that would cut into Ms. Berry's screen time, wouldn't it?Speaking of screen time, for so-called final chapter of a superhero team trilogy, a 1 hour, 44 minute running time is a little sparse. Marvel really didn't seem willing to give this an epic feel and shortchanged the franchise and the fans in the process. With the renewed popularity of superhero films, the remake of Superman, and the future Marvel releases, there remains hope that someday the X-Men movies (X-4 perhaps, Wolverine) will be done right.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1189,jsnyder-15,"Why Brett Ratner, Why?",4,27 May 2006,"I remember a time when most in the mainstream thought it was ""un-cool"" to read comic books. They were the pinnacle of geek-dom (well, maybe not as bad as LARPing), something only short, fat, pimple-faced unintelligent kids looked at. But things certainly have mut- I mean, changed. Comics have suddenly obtained cool status and are a part of pop-culture. And now they have crossed over into other mediums, most notably movies. It seems that every month we get a new comic book adaptation to look forward to - or dread (see: Ghostrider). How did this all happen? It all began in 2000 with one little movie - ""X-Men"".Fast forward six years, skip a sequel (one that's actually better than the original!), a bazillion comic adaptations later, and here we are  the end of what started it all. ""X-Men: Last Stand"" is the final chapter in the X-Men trilogy. Set not long after the events of ""X2"", ""Last Stand"" shows us a very different world, at least on the political end. Not only is our government more accepting of mutants but there is also one who is a member of the president's cabinet  The Beast played by Kelsey Grammar. It seems that mutants and humans have finally found a way to come to terms with one another and they are all living happily ever-after. That is, until a pharmaceutical company has discovered a ""cure"" to the mutant gene. This news sends shockwaves through the mutant community and divides them in two. This sets into motion a series of events that will culminate in the ultimate showdown between the X-Men and Magneto's Brotherhood.First let me get one small point out of the way. The Beast is awesome. Not once did I find myself chuckling under my breath whenever Mr. Grammar delivered a line or two (OK maybe I did, but it had nothing to do with how he looked). I was greatly relieved when I saw how wonderfully they pulled him off. In fact, the CGI in general is top-notch.Unfortunately, Halle Berry was NOT CGI, thus ruining every shot she was in from start to finish. It may be just me but I never liked Storm - especially Halle's Storm. So it goes without saying that Storm is given more screen time than almost everyone else in the film. Her lines are terrible and delivered well below the level of poor. And I swear that if I had to see her eyes do the whole going-white-to-signal-a-storm thing (which isn't even that menacing) I was going to rip my eyes out! And whoever choreographed her fight scenes needs to be fired  they were easily the worst in the entire trilogy. All the hard work they put into The Beast was cancelled out by Halle's terrible ""performance"".So, we have one great character and one horrendous character to start this movie. And how does the rest of the rather large cast add up? Sadly, they don't fare so well either. You know a movie has a weak script when even Sir Ian McKellen has a hard time delivering his lines. There is no excuse for talent like that to utter such trashy, stiff lines with no emotion. And it's not just him  the whole cast gets their share of terrible one-liners and plenty of time to act like a 2x4. Everyone (save Kelsey ""Beast"" Grammar) puts in a weak performance this time around and it's enough to make you want to scream. I would also like to add that it takes talent to mess up Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut but Mr. Ratner somehow managed.In fact, I think you can attribute all the mishaps in this movie to the, um, ""talent"" that is Brett Ratner. With a portfolio that contains such hits as ""Money Talks"" and ""Rush Hour 2"" how could he mess up ""Last Stand""? Well let me tell you how Ratner took the impossible and made it reality. Hands down ""Last Stand"" has the best story in the entire trilogy to tell. The cure for the mutants, the rise of the Phoenix, the final confrontation between both sides of the mutant world  all the ingredients for best comic book movie are there. The problems start when Ratner tries to cram a movie that should be, at the least, two and a half hours in length into one hour and forty-four minutes. With so many new characters and so many established ones taking different paths there is no way this story could be told in such a short period of time. Every scene feels rushed through and each one is given a sudden quick cut with a horrible transition to the next rushed scene. It feels like watching a DVD when you're playing it at 2x speed  you hardly have any time to catch what is going on before something blows up and people die. Honestly, there is not one saving grace when it comes to the direction of this movie. The best that Brett manages to pull off is so-so cinematography. The rest of it reaches lows that I never though the X-Men franchise would ever hit.In the end the thing that disappoints me so much is the potential this movie had. What could have been such a great thought provoking movie (and an excellent way to end what was once an incredible series of films) is reduced to a brainless cheesy summer pop-corn flick.Bottom line: Brett Ratner ""directs""  enough said.Final Score: 4 out of 10",X-Men - The Last Stand
1190,Necros_hun,"Great movie, the best in the series!",10,29 May 2006,"I've watched the movie not long ago. It's great, amazing and very moving too. The actors are great, Brett Rattner proved one more time. SPOILER! The only thing that saddened me, was the death of Xavier, Jean Gray and most likely Cyclops too. :( But there is hope! When Xavier ""vanished"" he smiled! I don't know what it means but he knew something that we don't. So if there will be X-men 4, and I really hope there will be, they can return. Jean Gray became Phoenix, so if the name stands, she can resurrect herself. Cyclops? I don't know, they didn't show us what happened to him. So, the hope lives.This is a very, very good movie I recommend it to everyone, either X-men fan or not. This is a great movie!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1191,blackbirdassasin,An insult to any X-men Comic/Cartoon fan!,3,31 May 2006,"***WARNING*** This comment will contain spoilers! The story is the point I will judge upon, making this necessary. ***WARNING****Technical Aspect*The movie was great, considering the SFX alone. It looked almost life-like, because the animations were superb. The camera's were good, they really showed the essence of the action. 7/10 *Script Aspect*The script flawed unbelievably, the only good thing about it was the stability... The dialogue for one, was very poor, the best way to describe it, is an avalanche of cliché's dropping on top of you. The character development was abysmal, 20 years of history put in 5 minutes... I think a world record has been set here! 4/10*Acting Aspect*The acting overall was not bad, some characters were played awesome, while others were and insult to the character. Overall, all the actors did their best to make something of this sad movie.... 6/10*Casting (this also goes for the other X-Men movies)* Summary of the best: Beast, Wolverine, Storm, Callisto, Charles Xavier and Pyro.Summary of the worst: Juggernaut, Rogue, Phoenix (not to be mistaken with Jean, Famke plays Jean outstanding), Collosus, Iceman and Cyclops 5/10*Storyboard Aspect*Finally, the point where I almost wanted to kill someone during the movie. The point were I almost shed in tears due the errors... This element is the worst part of the entire movie... Horrible! Here is a summary of all the flaws...Within 15 minutes, Scott Summers aka Cyclops (key character in the defeat of Phoenix), gets killed by none other then Phoenix... Juggernaut, not only looking like a circus clown, was a huge flop! Was Goldberg busy? Couldn't you just animate him or something, this was terrible! And since when doesn't he want to kill Xavier, his stepbrother whom he hates beyond measure? He now actually listens to Magneto, a friend of his mortal enemy, his stepbrother?! Is this a joke?! Charles Xavier dies? WHAT?! That's like killing Mr. Fanastic in Fantastic Four... That's like killing Captain America in Captain America and the Avengers... And afterwards he comes back, WHAT?! What were Brett Ratner,Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn thinking for god's sake! Rogue loses her powers, because she wants to touch Iceman?! Are you kidding me, Rogue wants to lose them yes, but never achieves this goal!Mystique loses her powers? Mystique shouldn't even be with Magneto let alone stand losing her powers for him... Magneto loses his powers? SAY WHAT?! Magneto cannot lose his powers, you can't just do this! One of the key characters overall in entire X-men! One of the strongest mutants in X-men! I think they were joking here...Angel does he even play a role in this move? One of the original X-Men only walking around 10 minutes on screen in total? All that advertisement in the trailer, for naught... Phoenix... The Phoenix Force from outer space comes and revives a dead Jean Grey, granting her the power of the Phoenix Force... The only mutant able to wheeled it's unbelievable power... The only being to even come near her is Apocalypse... The only way to defeat her was, Scott Summers, her love for him makes her kill herself... Now that is the story that was told... Who was responsible for this INSULT?! Why did the Phoenix have a split personality? Since when was Jean schizophrenic? How can she kill the only one that can stop her? WHAT?! She dies due Wolverine's claws?! WHAT?! Where was the Phoenix bird of flames, the sole purpose of her name?! I can't believe my eyes... It's like someone stabbed me in the eyes, that is the pain that I'm feeling after seeing what they did with the story... Of course before I forget, were the hell did all these mutants come from out of nowhere... Why not take the time to explain things, instead of rushing 10 hours of material in a 1 hour 40 minute movie? -10/10 (Yes a - 10, I refuse to give it a 1, a 1 indulges that it sucks, this was far beyond sucking, this was a huge lie and an insult to anyone that knows the story!)*Final Thoughts* Overall the movie is stable and for anyone not into the comic or cartoon, it's an excellent movie... For the rest of us it's and insult to our intelligence... They ripped off too many important features and killed off too many important characters! Of course you can't make a literal translation of the comic, but this is ridiculous. This movie destroyed a franchise bearing a great name... From now on, I refuse too see any sequels, if they may come...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1192,harri-yli-pirila,Too much,5,29 May 2006,"X-men 3 looks hastily done. No amount of good acting can save it. Too many characters, too many flaws, too much effects put together with a super-glue and high hopes it will held for hour and a half. Instead of giving the trilogy a good and logical ending, movie left me confused and wanting. It wasn't an end. It was middle part from several other X-men movies to follow. And since there's no intentions for more sequels... X-men 3 was kind of pointless. I'm fan of the movies, not familiar with comics and their world, but what I have seen from other posts and rewiews, characters were somewhat flawed.

X3 had their plot outline right, characters, and actors right, they did good. I'm an X-Men fan, usually movie like: Spider-Man 3 and Shrek 3 I thought that they would do good for a third installment, but they didn't. After I saw X-Men 3 I was thinking to myself was X2 better than X3 or was it the other way around. X2 did okay for a movie. I thought that X3 was going to do bad on the movie, like the others (Shrek 3, Spider-Man 3) but I thought wrong.

1194,Zwarrg,My vote for most f*%$ed up movie of 2006! Bar none!,6,7 June 2006,"Hahaha...where to start. Well lets just say that this is the best spoof I've seen of the comics and cartoons....ever. If you know the actors and their lifestyles and history, you'll get all the in jokes and appreciate it more.I had to walk out a few times as the film was just getting far to annoying. It worked best at a faster pace where the editing was done very well. But some of the clichés were wearing thin, despite a great performance from Hugh Jackman, as I can relate to Logan/Wolverine quite a lot and I loved how sexy Famke Janssen was as Dr. Jean Grey/Phoenix.I feel it is mirroring what is happening in the world today. I feel more women are becoming stronger and dominant over the weak minded men and exploiting that, as well as rising to power and authority where women are much needed to help sort out the state of the world. Jean is a perfect example of that.The actions and special effects were second to none, very impressive...didn't spot any visual mistakes first time round.I noticed Ian McKellen looking into the camera a few times heh and I'm sure there's more goofs out there to be found.I did enjoy the dialogue for the most part...but the political side of things were what bored me to death.All in all, a fun, but sometimes painful movie to sit through...but a mediocre experience and hence the mediocre score!

Its like Brett Ratner read the comic, watched the cartoons and decided to do the complete opposite.Two things saved this movie from reaching IMDb's Bottom 100 List. First, it's Hugh Jackman. His acting is flawless and hilarious as Wolverine. Second, the special effects were perfect. The scene with Magneto at the bridge was probably one of the most awesome things i've ever seen.The screenplay was a dismal failure. Brett Ratner had no right to take a comic-based franchise and make it unrecognizable to its fans. Anyways, if you've watched the cartoons and/or read the comics i would advise you to steer clear of this movie. If thats not the case, you are going to love it.3/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
1196,seanlpickering,Below average,4,28 May 2006,"This movie first of all completely goes away from the comic story line. Which is after all where these characters and events have so much weight with the core audience. I am not a huge fan of comics but from talking to people that are it seems that the best comic book movies are made from the original source. Like Superman, Batman, Spiderman. Others that depart from that source seem doomed like Hulk, Batman Returns-Batman and Robin, Superman 3 and 4 and this piece of junk. Basically they seem to kill off major characters to bring some ""drama"" into the story line and it just fails. The entire time they are killing these guys I was thinking that maybe the actors portraying these characters are just trying to get away from a sinking ship. The new characters are nothing special, however the newly added Kitty Pride proves the exception to the rule. In conclusion it is a huge step backwards where X2 was the opposite. But hey when it's all said and done you either like it or not. Just don't say I didn't warn you.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1197,jbucher24-1,"Heavy on the action, light on actual substance",5,31 July 2006,"Definite spoilers herein. Do NOT read if you have not yet seen this movie and would like to do so.For all you fan boys out there who have commented on this movie: We honestly don't give a crap about what happened in the comic books. The movie adaptations of the X-Men are designed to appeal to a far wider audience. Their purpose is to entertain, not to re-create frame by frame stories from the original books that could not possibly be done justice on the silver screen in ninety minutes. So if a character doesn't act or look like he/she does in the books, or if a certain plot line doesn't go exactly like you think it should, do us all a favor and go commiserate with yourselves. Leave us alone. We're too busy having lives.Having said that, the writers for X-Men: The Last Stand would have done well to heed this advice and ignore the comic books, too. They seemed intent on cramming every character or plot line that had been introduced in the comic book series into this final incarnation of the franchise. The cost of this quantity is the overall quality of the film. Characters who we already know so much about are swept aside without much thought; Charles Xavier doesn't even make it through half the film, which is more than I can say for poor Cyclops, who makes it about ten minutes of the way through. We barely see Rogue or Mystique, and Nightcrawler, one of the most intriguing characters from X2, doesn't appear at all. Instead, we're given a steady diet of new characters without being privy to their individual histories or personalities; examples include Kitty Pryde, the Juggernaut, Multiple Man, and Archangel. Beast, played by Kelsey Grammar, is a new addition but is reasonably well developed. I actually enjoyed his role.The characters from the first two movies that happened to survive this one do so with mixed results. Wolverine is reduced to spewing cheesy clichés and catch phrases; ditto for Storm, although we get to see a bit more of her mutant talents. However, the conflict between Ice Man and Pyro was riveting, especially given the brief amount of time spent on it (to be sure, no character gets too much attention here). I think I would be roped into seeing a spin off movie that featured the battle between these two if it were set ten years in the future. And Ian McKellen is masterful again as Magneto, to the point that his performance helps save the film. Finally, we see his character bring his dream of a war with humanity to fruition. As his dream becomes reality, Magneto transforms from terrorist nuisance to frighteningly powerful.As far as plot lines go, the writers bit off more than they could chew. Two plot lines are stuffed into one movie: the aforementioned war with homo sapiens as touched off by a new cure for mutants, and the resurrection of Jean Grey incarnated as her alter ego, the Phoenix, whose powers are both limitless and uncontrollable.I can't help but think how much better this movie would have been had they just kept Jean Grey dead. First, we wouldn't have been subjected to the tired comic book device of bringing back dead characters to sell issues, especially considering Jean dies again at the end anyway. Second, the characters Jean kills with her ramped up powers (Cyclops and Charles Xavier) presumably would have stuck around for the rest of the movie. I would have loved to have seen the ongoing conflict between Wolverine and Cyclops in the wake of Jean's death. And the final scene would have been so much cooler had more of the actual X-Men been present; given the setting of the final battle, Cyclops could have used his powers with breathtaking effect (seeing Rogue unleashed would have been great here as well).Instead, we are asked to process both the rising war against humanity and the growing instability of the Phoenix while some of our favorite characters are blotted out. It's just too much, and the result feels rushed and thrown together.On the plus side, the effects were outstanding from start to finish. The final scene, though it could have been done better from a character standpoint, was pretty freaking cool. The lasting image from this film will undoubtedly be Magneto's moving the Golden Gate Bridge to Alcatraz. It was apparent that no expense was spared when it came to this aspect of the film, and ultimately this is what kept me entertained throughout.Final grade: 5/10. Very entertaining, but a shame that my concern for the characters that carried over from the first two movies was disregarded.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1198,garretbyrne,What a waste of funds,1,25 May 2006,"Hello all, got to say how bad i taught this film was. I'm an X-men fan to the bone. And i really really hated this film. It was so, disappointing, some shots the camera was bad also. You can tell it was crashed together not taught out because a lot of the stuff was like o my god, lol. Sorry but i do hope they make up for this pitiful movie by making a few more that are good and not jokes. 1 & 2 very good. 3 was not. I did liked Beast (Looks great), Storm (More of storm was good also liked the way she had a good position in the film). But the rest was a big disappointment. Sorry for being so negative, but i and my friends have been waiting for this for a while and the wait is over and feel so let down. But enjoy yourself seeing this movie because when it's over you'll be like us all. Very Peeeed Off",X-Men - The Last Stand
1199,currituck7,An insult to the first two movies,1,9 June 2006,"Warning: major spoilers ahead.Decades ago, Marvel Comics showed that for comic books to be more than the lightest of entertainments, they needed to focus on real, complex characters and well-thought out stories. The first two movies did just this. The 3rd movie is so awful as to insult its predecessors as well as its audience. It's so bad that the depths of its failures cannot be adequately addressed in a 1000-word review.The movie takes two potentially fascinating story lines -- the discovery of a ""cure"" for mutation and the resurrection of Jean Gray as the tremendously powerful but out-of-control Phoenix, and squeezes the life and sense out of them. The story lurches and jolts along to a predictable and needlessly violent ending, featuring mutants murdering each other willy-nilly in a festival of showy, senseless explosions and second-rate wire-flying and special effects. Whereas the X-Men previously tried manfully to avoid killing others, humans or mutants, now even the most morally upright of the group, Storm, seems to take vicious pleasure in killing for the sake of killing.The setup is tossed off: suddenly, in a complete and unexplained turnaround from the first two movies, mutants are living openly and with apparent acceptance by the majority of the population. Such a condition was hinted at with the end of the second movie, but such a sea change needs more development than a simple ""here's how it is now"" presentation. Seeing hundreds of mutants peacefully protesting for their rights turns them into just another interest group and guts the entire thematic heart of the series.And what was done to the characters is sheer tragedy. Scott Summers, an interesting if underused character in the first two movies, is killed as an afterthought in the first few minutes; Jean, his murderer, seems barely aware or concerned that she has killed the man she supposedly loves. Professor Xavier is killed almost as cavalierly; the exploration of what will happen to the X-Men and the school is handled with no depth or feeling whatsoever. (It's almost good riddance; the deeply philosophical, ethically driven Professor of the first two movies becomes a pontificating blowhard here, saying nothing of interest except to tell the audience what it needs to know about ""class 5 mutants"" and a tissue-thin, mindlessly stupid explanation of Jean's mental condition before Jean blows him into atoms. Even the amazingly talented Patrick Stewart can do nothing with the character as written.) The handling of Mystique, a powerful and fascinating villain, is a slap in the face to the character -- in the first two movies, she is tremendously capable and endlessly inventive, but here she is at first a mere thug, then a sullen traitor to the cause, babbling all of Magneto's secrets to the people she has spent a lifetime fighting against. The subtleties of the other leading characters -- Logan, Storm, Magneto, Bobby -- are lost; instead we get mindless rants or cheesy tough-guy asides. Only the character of Hank McCoy is given any development whatsoever, and his ""transformation"" from glad-handing politician into violent mutant combatant is abrupt and inexplicable; all the credit belongs to actor Kelsey Grammar. Logan is as two-dimensional now as he was complex and compelling in the first movies, jumping from father-figure and protector to thuggish murderer, with no thought except how to kill as many ""enemies"" as possible. Magneto, once a deeply sympathetic antagonist whose methods are as wrong as his ideals are laudable, becomes a cardboard villain, a bobble-head Hitler, forgetting entirely his defining experiences as a Holocaust victim even as he displays his number tattoo to his gang of thugs. And Jean...perhaps her treatment is worst of all. Instead of exploring the depth of her transformation into the unstable Phoenix, she becomes a two-dimensional schizophrenic, either lashing out in gleefully wanton destruction or dissolving in tears, begging Logan to kill her (when he does, her death is neither shocking nor tragic, just overdue).Rogue is virtually ignored; though her decision to become an ordinary human could have been explored in all of its dimensions, she comes across as simply a mealy-mouthed whiner. Angel, a linchpin of the early comic stories, is thoroughly unnecessary; apparently his entire character was included merely so his winged dive out of a high-rise window can be used in the commercials. Bobby's dilemma -- coward or hero, or merely teenager? -- is discarded in favor of a quick, meaningless battle between him and Pyro, whose own complexities have been forgotten in his transformation into a sulky thug. The lesser characters are wasted entirely. Colossus's entire function is to throw Logan into his enemies like a slingshot. Juggernaut becomes a leering, easily defeated idiot. The child whose blood is used to transform mutants into ordinary mortals merely sits in a room watching television until he can be rescued -- we find out absolutely nothing about his feelings at being used as a tool. A dozen other mutants, many favorites of the readers like Jubilee or Arclight, merely walk on, throw a mutant effect, and disappear.As far as I'm concerned, this series stopped with the second movie. The third movie is an object lesson in everything that can go wrong with a movie made from a comic book. I honestly think I put more work into writing this review than the writers did in their script. Director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn should be ashamed for the hateful disservice they have done to the X-Men and to their loyal fans. The last scene, which hints at a return of Magneto's eradicated powers, points to a possible fourth movie. God, I hope not. Ratner, Kinberg, and Penn have killed this series. Let it stay dead.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1200,abe_cipriano,lack of story but good effects,7,29 May 2006,"As the 2nd sequel to the X-Men movie franchise, I was expecting a lot out of this movie. Although I left the movie totally entertained, I thought the movie tried to put in too many subplots or themes (some from the comics and some new ones) that it was a mix of suspense-filled moments and a number of dragging, trying-to-be-dramatic-but-ends-up-being-silly-or-boring parts.I don't know whether the story-telling was affected by director Bryan Singer's leaving and replacing him with Rush Hour 1 & 2's Brett Ratner, or maybe the script was flawed to begin with, but the movie had too many ""busy"" parts, too many ups and downs, so from a story standpoint, X3 was also disappointing (the effects, the action made up for it, I guess). I guess I was expecting more with a deeper story and more character development (but within realistic terms from a comic book-based movie). While this had the best action of the 3 X-Men movies, but this also had the worst story.Go see it, enjoy and be entertained; expect nothing more than action with a shallow, maybe silly story.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1201,djvillain,For a selected audience,4,28 May 2006,"X Men: The Last Stand, is a film that shifts the movie franchise from story driven, character based entertainment to a popcorn film of grand CGI effects and humorous one-liners.If you don't know much about the X-Men, never read or saw the Phoenix and Dark Phoenix Sagas, don't like a lot of ""talkin'"" in your films, and love bloated CGI sequences, this is your film.If you are a core X-Men fan, know and love the Phoenix story, like the characters you're watching to have some ""meat"" on them, or prefer an even emotional flow to your movies rather than a mish-mash of scenes, this is not your film.The movie's first twenty-five minutes is a steadily building mix of sadness, fear and powerful performances. However, this all reaches a climax early on and is not brought back until the very end of the film. What should have been tragic felt empty, perhaps due to the lack of emotional build up over the last hour to this final confrontation between a man and the woman he loves. Most of the rest of the movie is comprised of scenes that don't necessarily flow together, one-liners, and huge special effects.Character development is sorely lacking in this film as well. Unlike Nightcrawler, Iceman, and William Stryker from X2, the new characters in X3: Angel, Beast, etc. are not developed nearly as well. Where you may be able to relate to Iceman, become entranced by Nightcrawler's personality and understand the motivation behind Stryker ... Angel is not much more than a cameo and Beast comes off as a replacement for Xavier or Cyclops (if you see the film, you'll know why they need to be replaced).On the positive side, the special effects are fantastic and the one-liners are hysterical. Again, if that's all you care for your movies to have, then this is the movie for you.In the end, fans of the X-Men mythos might feel cheated. The Phoenix Saga, a promise hinted at the end of X2, is a classic, proved, beloved and heralded storyline that after thirty years still holds a high place in the hearts of those who've read or watched it.For the average movie goer, this is your big budget popcorn film. You will have a wonderful time watching odd characters blow up things and fight each other while delivering the most base dialogue imaginable (think pro wrestling).For the rest, to have the core of the story changed so much (I'm sure no one expect space ships, aliens, and crystals, but did want the essential emotional Phoenix story to stay in tact) is a bit of a let down. Not getting to know the new characters and seeing beloved favorites dismissed may also be unnerving. No, X-Men: The Last Stand will make you leave the theatre without a sense of wonder, but perhaps a sense of disappointment in knowing what ""could have been"".",X-Men - The Last Stand
1202,phardacre,watch about first ten minutes and gave up how boring,1,3 October 2006,just got in to about ten minutes and thought to myself i have better things to do with my life so took it out the DVD player and put mi3 in and that was so much better. so what happened? well it just didn't seem interesting nothing really happening that hasn't been there in the previous films if later in the film it gets exciting well i will never know just feel i wasted my money on the DVD it had no excitement or action just seemed boring to me bland would be a good word at least the first film got straight in to the action but this no sorry i guess its just to make money in the fact that people who came to watch the others would come back and part with there cash. sorry not for me thanks.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1203,Holmwood,Just not very good!,5,26 May 2006,"In comparison with X-1 and X-2 its just not as good. Its as cheesy as a spy kids movie, with over hammy acting and a pretty poor screenplay. Yes i understand its a Marvel movie but X-men has always been one of the better Marvel movies because it wasn't afraid to get gritty and a bit violent. Brett Ratner should not have been the director of this. THere are no doubt some good action sequences. But on the flip side there are countless movie mistakes. In a certain unnamed scene it is broad daylight then in the next camera angle it is complete night- time. And another when the bridge cracks and while the camera is in a crane shot a small CGI figure is seen to be leaping across an at least 20 foot gap and then land like a frog. (No it was not a mutant.) X-men is not a kids trilogy yet Ratner makes it just that. With tacky and predictable love scenes and little to none character development X-men just doesn't compare to its predecessors. I f your looking for a good Marvel movie see something like The blade series or daredevil.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1204,kgammon-1,not that good,5,30 May 2006,"Let me start with if you have ever read any of the comics about the X-men you will not like this movie.The Phoenix story is legendary in comic book history and they took it and raped it.(1)They kill off to many of the main characters, like cyclops. He is jeans love interest not wolverine. She marries cyclops not wolverine in the comics. Cyclops should have saved her(by killing her)in the end, not wolverine.(2)Where did night crawler go?He was the main character in X-men 2 but he just disappeared in x-men 3. They did all that background work on him in the second movie just to not even mention him in the third?(3)This is the thing that peeved me off the most. They made the juggernaut a mutant. For all of those that read this that don't know HE IS NOT A MUTANT. He is a man with a magical crystal inside him and he wears a helmet that gives him the power of the juggernaut HE IS NOT A MUTANT. So the part when he gets to the boy to kill him was just stupid. The boys powers should have had no effect on him. The juggernaut could kill him in a heartbeat.(4) Like i said in the beginning if you have read any of the X-men comics or even seen the cartoons you will be greatly disappointed.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1205,kaosboy192000,"Overall satisfying, but has some definite flaws.",9,24 June 2006,"To begin with, some of the characters were stunted in the way they were used, and despite the ending leaving it open for a possible sequel, I can't believe Professor X and Cyclops had to die.According to the comics, Pheonix is NOT part of Jean Grey, but rather a cosmic force that possessed her because she was so powerful.What happened to Juggernaut's relationship to Professor X? I don't recall even seeing them together, never mind any reference to their family bond.Multiple Man and the kid with the anti-mutant gene were little more than plot tools, along with Angel. That annoyed me, considering that Angel was in the trailers, and he ended up being little more than a bird with a human body. Also, Multiple Man must have beaten himself silly to make himself into a crowd around Magneto, since he is supposed to copy himself only when struck.There had better be a fourth movie, with Gambit, Apocalypse, the rest of the Four Horsemen, and a good sentinel battle. And for the love of Stan Lee, keep the characters more in character and use major characters in more than a few minor scenes (Angel)!Props to Mystique's betrayal of Magneto after losing her mutant ability and getting throughly dissed.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1206,Zanahade,Off the beaten path,8,26 May 2006,"Well, the movie is out and in a world of Hollywood corrupting story lines for the sake of making a bigger, better movie, there is only one question you have to ask yourself... Where do you stand? Story line Fidelity or Bigger, Better Movie.The Movie Broke away from the traditional X Men story line, leading to some harsh outcomes that may be difficult to deal with if you are a hard core X Men Fan. However, this movie starts out at a medium pace and accelerates until it hits full speed and then it goes faster. Packed full of great one-liners, Action, and some bittersweet plot twists, this movie is well worth the time and money. The movie is very possibly one of the best comic book movies ever made.Oh yea, and when the lights come up and every one stands up and heads for the door, SIT DOWN!

The fight between mutants and humans was told greatly!! Great Job!! I feel as though the movie was great from kids and adults alike. Having lines from the comics book and things of that nature left room for the comic books fans and also introduced the characters and such to someone who might not read them...While standing on line for the movie, even a mother of a young boy was excited to go to see this movie..Fnatastic!

Seems like all the X-Men are Wolverine, Storm and a bunch of kids...The Death of Xavier is one perfect example for ""Please! Just write me outta this crap!"" and so it seemed to happened. Prof. Charles just to the ""pop! goes the weasel"". Hail to the founder of the X-Men...Lets not even forget about that fuzzy love-wannabe-story involving Grey and Logan.

1209,hollywood_brat,Heartbreaking,8,31 May 2006,"There is a saying in Hollywood, ""When you do something that inflames passion, you're going to p--- people off."" That is the best way I can describe the negative reactions from fans and non-fans alike. I went to see this film after hearing scores of them, so my expectations were somewhat lowered. However, I didn't have many of the same expectations because I didn't know what to expect with a new director.Brian Singer never impressed me completely as the director of X-Men 1 and 2. Though I loved Apt Pupil, and his bringing Ian McKellen into the franchise, Singer's 'screenwriter' failed to deliver anything in the way of a good script. So, when I learned the director of the Rush Hour franchise was signed on to replace him, I thought, cool. Change would be good. But can Ratner pull it off? I just saw this movie, and after careful deliberation, my opinion is unchanged. Yes he did.Brett Ratner was an absolute perfect choice as director of an action-filled comic book movie. He brings so much more from so-so actors, and gives such controlled freedom to the great ones.There are sub-story lines that go in many different directions, but they're all focused around one central plot all the way through.The accusations that this film didn't stay true to the comic books seems a little reaching. Given that the comics cover a range of different story lines and interpretations that never maintain a state of total continuity. I was a little caught-off-guard that they didn't go into the Kitty / Peter dynamic, favoring a triangle between her, Rogue and Bobby, but that probably made it a more interesting sub-plot that carried back to the main one. I'm not much of a comic-book fan though, so remaining true to certain relationships concerns me little as a fan alone. Though I do recognize that canon is important to maintain out of respect to the creators (by the way, nice cameos, Mr. Lee, Mr. Claremont). Oh well, explore it in the next one.Many times I noticed how X-Men: The Last Stand had lifted a lot of its plot and dialog straight out of a range of the series from Claremont's to Joss Whedon's. The parts that worked anyway.Though improved dramatically from the previous films, Halle Barry's performance was still a bit stilted. But they wrote her into the storyline as a more useful character and this helped a great deal. Ben Foster was another actor I had some problems with (maybe it's just the cheekbones, I'll get over it), but I absolutely loved his character. And he made it real.The way they played Angel's storyline. His relationship with his father, and his father's motivations for pushing the ""Cure."" Those lines when Worthington II insists, ""I only wanted to help you."" Followed by a biting, ""Does it look like we need your help?"" and just as he goes over the side of the building, well, I won't spoil it anymore for you. But it is awesome.Everything about this film is absolutely perfect. My favorite of the 3. Another aspect I was drawn to was the complex relationship surrounding Magneto and Phoenix as the teacher / resistant pupil. The connections between them, the chemistry between them, as well as the friendship / rivalry between Magneto and Charles Xavier, oozes off of the screen.The complexity of Magneto has never been more thoroughly explored. Though motivations and acts of violence are definitively silly, the conviction with which he and Phoenix seem to do it makes it absolutely real.Great comic book film. One of the best so far. Brings so much reality to the science fiction genre. That's always been the appeal of Marvel Comics, I think.It's brutal. It's violent. It's good, family viewing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1210,underwun,Exceptional Action/Special effects,10,25 May 2006,"First up I must declare I am NOT an X-Men zealot and have never read the comics.Secondly having seen the first two I was dragged kicking and screaming to see this one and I have to ask myself why my view is so different to the 'critics'.I felt the power generated in the characters, particularly Pheonix who I thought swallowed the audience whole.With so many special effects movies around these days it was particularly enjoyable to find one that actually achieved 'suspension of disbelief', I found myself totally into the movie and couldn't wait to text friends with my find.If I had one criticism it was the casting of Kelsey Grammar, to see him in a sincere role was too much of a leap for me.In contrast to The Da Vinci Code which I found a waste of time X-Men has my vote without reservation.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1211,gshock99,all I could do was laugh after a while...,1,22 June 2006,"I admit, I'm an x-fan. Despite that, I respected the changes Bryan Singer made in the first 2 films and I thought they were done very well. I loved them. Sadly, the third film let me down in so many ways that after a while, I could only laugh at the absurdity.Everyone else basically named the insane plot twists(not good ones at that)... such as 3 main characters dying(not to mention so... horribly and just retardedly), so I won't go into those. But I agree with the problems everyone else had.what's worse is if you go through the credits, you'll find a ""psylocke"", ""kid omega"", ""omega red"" and other random characters.... who in the film, are nothing like their comic counterparts. It basically looks like the director decided he needed more character names for all of the random mutants he put in the film. For example, Psylocke was reduced to being one of Callisto's lackeys... that can apparently be invincible. Kid Omega was the random porcupine mutant in the movie, in the comics, he's nothing of the sort.I tried to just enjoy this movie as just... a movie. I couldn't even do that.Basically, the only characters they did an okay job with was Wolverine and Beast.Simply put, this was like an experimental alternative universe gone totally wrong.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1212,Mia-33,Big Disappointment,6,16 May 2006,"I saw the film in the premiere in Mexico City last night, Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry were here and all we could hear was how we would see it even before Cannes.Anyway, first I want to say I like X-Men and X2 a lot, and it was very disappointing to see how Brett Ratner couldn't deliver a good and believable movie the way Singer did for the first two.There are a lot of dead characters from both sides and lots of them lose their powers over 'the cure' which is sad because you stop seeing the great characters almost from the beginning of the film.The story is filled with gaps, no continuity. The special effects are amazing but sadly it's terrible to see a flying house and a flying Golden Gate Bridge in an X-men film. The new characters aren't really important and we don't see them much, and Famke Janssen gives her worst performance ever.I give it 6 out of 10",X-Men - The Last Stand
1213,ayellen,Betrays the spirit of the comics,2,26 May 2006,"This film completely betrays everything that the X-Men comics and even the first two films stood for. I don't care that the plot points have been changed or even that some very basic premises have been violated. What bothers me is that the moral fiber and spirit of the characters and the story have been completely compromised for the sake of a supposed demographic response. Even if they came up with a completely different story that has nothing to do with the source material and betrayed the nature of every character, I would have accepted it if the film had been well executed but even there it failed. There are some cool effects and the big fight scene is great, but the characters are poorly developed, the story loose and wandering, and any real sense of objective and accomplishment are lost. Mostly it's the characters, by the end I really don't care what happens to any of them. As a great fan of the X-Men in all their forms, this film saddens and disappoints me. Superman had better be fabulous to justify Bryan Singer departure and this resulting disgrace.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1214,krysana,BIG snoozer,2,8 June 2006,"I give this movie a 2 instead of a 1 because there were 2 funny parts in the movie. They were also the only interesting parts of the movie. If anyone really likes the comics and the first two movies they will probably HATE this movie. The story is choppy and you don't really get to get to know any of the characters. Angel had total time of maybe 10 mins, if you count the beginning of the movie when he's a little boy.The special effects is about all this movie had. Even then it wasn't that well done. The story was bad, the characters came out bad, and a lot of the acting was bad. Yeah, a lot of the main characters die or lose their powers, but why? The story really sucked. If you were to believe this story and follow it then why did Wolverine kill Jean?? If he loved her so much why didn't he just give her the cure instead of shoving his claws in her. Really if she was that powerful she could have stopped him.This movie is a waste of money and even at an hour and 40 minutes it feels like three or four hours of your life that you will never get back again.I would have been more than happy to wait a few more months if it meant we would have had a good story that went well with the first two.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1215,plstubblefield,An outstanding addition to the X-Men franchise!,9,26 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand is an excellent movie that meets or exceeds the standards set by its forerunners.I have never read any X-Men comic books (or ""graphic novels,"" for you puritans). Before the original movie came out, I had heard of Wolverine and the X-Men, but knew very little else. I was blown away by how well the first movie held up as a tremendously entertaining action film while simultaneously introducing new viewers to a complex universe of characters. The second movie was even better, deepening the characterization of the lead roles even as continued advances in computer graphics provided impressive visual effects.That brings us to the third movie. Wow! Visually, the film is stunning, but what really surprised me were the unexpected plot developments. I won't spoil any details, but I will say that I was astonished when several major characters were eliminated before a third of the movie was over. Fortunately, in a franchise the size of the X-Men universe, there's never a shortage of new and interesting characters.In addition to loads of action, there are moments of comedy (thank you, Juggernaut!), tragedy, drama, and wonder. I'm especially glad the movie makers didn't take the easy way out with a ""Hollywood"" ending where everything turns out peaches and cream. To paraphrase Professor Xavier in X2, this is a war between good and evil, and there are casualties on both sides.As for the stereotypical complaints of plot holes or stilted dialog: Relax, people, it's an *action* movie! Certain story elements are always going to be influenced by what looks cool on the big screen, and a certain style of dialog is almost de rigueur in superhero movies. Have you ever actually read the dialog in a comic book? Fortunately, neither issue becomes distracting.Does the movie stray from the X-Men canon? Apparently so, but get over it! The movie industry is unlikely to cater to those hardcore fans who are, after all, only a small fraction of its viewers. As a Tolkien fan, I was concerned that the Lord of the Rings movies would distort the complex, interwoven stories for the sake of viewers who didn't know the difference between an Orc and an Ent. To my relief, the changes were carefully thought out and never detracted from the grandeur of story. Never having read X-Men, I am in a poor position to judge the movies, but it seems that the major characters have retained the complexity of conflicting emotions and motivations that make them three dimensional.All in all, X-Men: The Last Stand is a fine action film to lead us into summer. ""Take a Stand!""",X-Men - The Last Stand
1216,TSTKE,Not Pleased. Not Pleased at All!!,7,27 May 2006,"This is easily the worst of the X-Men movies and it may be the comic-based movie that has done the most damage to a franchise ever.High points: Kelsey Grammar is fantastic as The Beast/Hank McCoy. That was a great piece of casting. It was also nice to see at least the head of a sentinel (and a nod to Days of Future Past). Bobby Drake/Iceman has a nice moment near the end that should please fans of the comics. Halle Berry as Ororo/Storm is absolutely gorgeous. I've never seen her look better. Hugh Jackman is excellent as usual. There is more use of Kitty Pride/Shadowcat and Peter Rasputin/Colossus (although the look of Colossus was far superior in X2). It was nice to see Angel. Finally, the effects are outstanding.Unfortumately, the story leaves much to be desired.As much as Bryan Singer did a good job of brining the X-Men to the big screen, I have always been upset with him (to put it mildly) for his treatment of Rogue in the movies. It gets only worse. As much as I hate the story, because I'm an X-Man fan from way back, the movie was FAR, FAR TOO SHORT to tell it properly (which MAY have helped a little). While I can accept the changing of the Phoenix storyline to fit the events that have come before in the movies, (this is nit-picking, but I still waited for it) the lack of a ""Phoenix Effect"" in the sky was disappointing. Also, Xavier is, frankly, a jerk and a$$hole in the movie.I could go on and on. I can only hope they don't screw up Wolverine and Ghost Rider as badly (although using the original series as a basis seems to lend credence to my fears for GR).Bryan Singer should be strung up by his ankles for leaving the franchise in apparently incompetent hands.It gets 5 of 10 because the few things it does right, it does very well.TSTKE",X-Men - The Last Stand
1217,Cinema_NET,When you just can't get enough,6,19 May 2006,"On May 15th Mexico City held the World Premiere of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" at the Auditorio Nacional. A little over 8,000 people (the place capacity is for 10,000) saw the movie, both fans and press alike. Guests of honor were Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman, who walked the red carpet, talked to press, signed autographs and made a brief speech prior to the movie. Halle was impressed with the amount of people and said that this was the biggest premiere she ever attended. Hugh Jackman said a few words in Spanish, mainly thanking the fans, and asked the audience to sing the Mexican equivalent of ""Happy Birthday"" (called ""Las Mañanitas"") for his father 70th birthday. He videotaped it.THE MOVIE (SPOILERS AHEAD). There's no way we can think of this film without the previous ones, which are highly regarded. Instead of Bryan Singer, it's now Brett Ratner, considered a fair enough Director, a guy that has experience with his own sequels (""Rush Hour 2"") and particularly with Hannibal's Lecter prequel ""Red Dragon"".The movie is action packed from beginning to end. I mean, really action packed, with both great and not so great moments. The avid comic readers will delight with the Danger Room sequence, the presence of a sentinel (or at least it's head), lots of fights, and Ororo, Phoenix and Magneto flying. Providing the drama factor, are either the deaths of several of the main characters (such as Professor X) or their lost of powers due to the so called ""cure"" (Mystique).The script is way too ambitious, and it finally fails to provide the always well received sense of reality for a genre flick. The back story just doesn't hold, the dialogues are poor and the editing and music just don't help. Among other things, the presidential figure is one of the weakest that Hollywood has ever showed, and the crowd scenes with protesters look way too fake.One of the main problems could be the fact of too many characters involved. Most of them lacked the depth the previous films provided them. It kind of gives you the impression of a TV show, where you just want more and wait for the next episode to focus on any particular of them. Of course, the next episode never comes.About the much expected ""new"" mutants on film, Beast is the only one that works because he has just enough screen time to get to know him.All in all, I was disappointed with the movie. On the other hand, if you just want lots and lots of fights and special effects, you'll just love it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1218,teknimage,Left a little disappointed...,5,26 May 2006,"I found this film rather disappointing after the build up from the 1st and 2nd movies. Unlike the first two, everything in this film seemed to be rushed. Interactions between the characters seemed truncated and there was a lot of incongruous scene progressions. There was even a glaring timing oddity leading up to the big finale where Magneto and the Brotherhood were crossing the Golden Gate Bridge in full daylight, yet, upon reaching the other side, it was night. There were some threads that didn't quite seem to pan out. Angel seemed poised for something important in the film, given his special introduction scene, yet nothing much happened with him. And some characters exhibited traits either too superficially ""characteristic"" of themselves or rather oddly contrary, such as a strange ""attitude"" adopted by Profesor X toward Wolverine. Aside from this, the characters of Storm and Jean Grey/Phoenix were much more fully realized than previously so. There also seemed to be QUITE a few more Brotherhood mutants than surviving X-Men. Not even some of the good-guy characters from the last two movies made appearances in this film, most notably Nightcrawler. In this sense, I think the movie misses a basic plot idea: that mutants are just like everybody else, only different. Some are bad, most are good. And they deserve the same rights as everybody else. This film seemed to contain an overwhelming number of those to hate, with a surprisingly small number of those you could love. It all seemed far to trite, too contrived and far too ""tidyed up"" at the end. And while the special effects were robust without being overpowering, the film seemed to lack a certain genuineness that made the first two so much more endearing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1219,yeehaahoo,This Movie Is A Massive Let Down,3,27 May 2006,"As a huge X-Men and superhero film fan i was really looking to the third instalment of this so far cracking series of films. I was a little surprised to see that Brian Singer had left the series just a few weeks before filming started, but just put this down to the fact he was doing the up coming Superman film. Having seen the film I think he realised what he had to work with and bailed while he still could. Don't get me wrong, as always the special effects were awesome but the casting, script, direction were all poor. I mean Vinnie Jones just what were they thinking when he was cast. Brett Ratner was also a questionable choice as director as he hasn't made many films to date, with the pick of the bunch being Rush Hour. From the trailers and hype i saw and read concerning this film i assumed it was about the emergence of Phoenix and Angel, they were both introduced but nothing much more. We saw a good deal of what Phoenix is capable of but it was just used as an excuse to abuse the special effects budget nothing more and Angel must have amassed all of about 1 minute of screen time, every second of which he was pouting at the camera. I was thoroughly disappointed by this film and it has annoyed me because of this. I was actually bored sitting in a packed cinema and its the first time i can genuinely say that.",X-Men - The Last Stand

All I am going to say is don't blink in the last 5 seconds of the movie, you will miss something!! A must see for every X-man fan you will not be disappointed! The only complaint I really have is the fact that Jaggernaut was not a mutant in the comics. His helmet was magical and he was also Professor X's half brother. I would have liked to see a little more of Angel or ANY of Gambit. Kelsey Grammar was at his best. I really could not believe my eyes when Pheonix did what she did to...well everyone she came in contact with. I think that this is an excellent movie to end a great trilogy.

They were very convincing. The old actors as well as the new actors were very convincing. I love Hugh Jackman in anything, but in this movie especially. He really shows wolverine's human side. Kelsey Grammar's role as the beast was so cool, even though he was a villain. Ian McKellen is my favorite villain, because he's not just a flat out villain. He is the type of villain that you are secretly routing for. This movie had me sitting on the edge of my seat. I was really sad when Cyclops died it was so unexpected. All in all this movie is really good. I would pay my money to see it any day of the week, and I would advise anybody who loves X-men to see it too.",X-Men - The Last Stand

It was an action-packed thriller, that threw me off on a lot of scenes I couldn't even imagine. It was great seeing some new characters I have never seen before be in the movie. The actors and actress played their roles very well. Although, it was fun to see the movie have it's third continuation I thought there was too much harsh drama and the director should of explained more problems within the characters. For example, what ever happened to Nightclawer, wasn't he suppose to be in the movie? If so, he sure didn't make his appearance which was too bad do to the fact that he is such a great actor and the director could have explained his history. But, this movie did come out with a message which was, to be true to my self no matter what happens. Over all, great movie good job!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1225,ragnarok_character,Magneto + Pyro = Catapult? (Possible Spoilers),9,25 May 2006,"It was a dark and stormy night at movies and while I awaited to watch X-3. Okay scratch watch, I was hoping for a view at the Clerks 2 trailer (which didn't appear) I was really skeptical of the idea that there should have even been a third flick in the series; especially one directed by the cop comedy champion of this decade, Bret Ratner! As my disappointment faded on the whole Clerks 2 thing I found myself engaged in what was the slowest X-men opening of all time.Not that this was a bad thing but it definitely left me with the impression that the movie was definitely going to be at least as long as X-2. Then enter the plot line. (From here you go and watch the movie, cause I'm not telling you what happened, thought the title of my review might or might not give something rather humorous away!) The first thing I noticed Bret definitely honored what Singer started with X-men back in 2000. While Bret does lend a lot of his own styling's to this, such as viciously witty one liners which was a trademark of the Rush Hour series, he definitely holds true to the characters. The acting doesn't seem forced or over acted, shy of Anna Paquin's performance which really disappointed me; and the major thing here is the, film as a whole, just plain works.The special and visual effects help the story rather then hurt it, and the drama from the comics definitely takes a strong hold even over the really well scripted action sequences. For the most part the actors did a really good job with their characters.Most fan-boys of the comics are probably crying foul as yet the movie does yet again deviate greatly from the comics, but the story as a whole is a great alternative to the stories I remembered reading. The important thing here is the characters are well carried over and work well with this story line, even if its not directly ripped from the comics.It's fun to watch, it concludes? the series well, and it leaves you feeling like you marched into the battle field of mutants vs. humans and voyeuristically got into the minds of all the important players. Would I watch it again, most definitely back to back with the rest of the series as it is, while most will disagree, my favorite movie of the franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1226,photoplayfilm,Get ready for the summer of less-than-stellar Blockbusters!,3,22 May 2006,"Watched a press screening of ""X-men: The Last Stand"", and before commenting on the film, let me mention that I am a huge fan of the previous films and the franchise... Now let me commence with the bashing. First thing tomorrow morning, Brett Ratner should apply for a teaching job at USC film school... because as the saying goes ""those who can't DO, TEACH"". Why is this guy working? I mean come on... look at his resume! Sure, he's responsible for the ""Rush Hour"" series, but seriously folks, was HE RESPONSIBLE for it's success, or was it the great script, casting and chemistry of Jackie Chan & Chris Tucker? Helen Keller could have been at the helm and it still would have worked. Brett should be putting his ""Rush Hour"" D.P's kids through college, for the doors that film opened for him. The guy's a hack, plain & simple.. and has not one artistic bone in his body. I mean, come on, he's dating Linsey Lohan and partying all the time?!? When's the last time you read about Lucus out on a binger? Anyways.. the movie was less than stellar. And as I've noticed with most of the ten-pole blockbusters coming to a local cinemaplex this summer, they whiz by you and you're well into the third act before you realize that there was no substance at all. Then the credits roll, the lights go up, and the usher is laughing cause you paid 15 dollars to see this crap! The movie itself has NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, NO GREAT DIALOGUE, NO SENSE OF URGENCE... it just revamps what has come before it and with little success. Sure the special effects are cool.. (note. not special!) and if you are truly a fan of the franchise, you root for the point at which it's going to get interesting.. but it never happens. Hollywood thinks we are morons that will shell out our hard earned cash for trite entertainment... and this summer might be the tipping point where it comes back to bite them right where they notice it most.. The Weekend Gross! Overall, this was a mildly entertain movie, but not what you'd expect and I put the sole blame on Brett Ratner. Singer probably would have done a great job and required a re-draft on the script. Ratner was too worried about if he had bottle service at ""Hyde"" last night... Check it on DVD!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1227,enchantedbear-1,What were they thinking?,1,27 May 2006,"!Warning! many scenes are talked about in my comments that could be considered spoilers, and reveal plot lines and spoil this already bad movie.This movie sucked so hard, on so many levels I think I need therapy. Let's start with continuity. In the last fight sequence on Alcatraz Island How did it turn from complete daylight when magneto moved the bridge to the island to complete darkness when they attack the soldiers on the island? Please tell me that outside of Phoenix killing off all the characters we love, that she did something more than just stand there? This movie was an insult to the first two. Every character that was established as a foundation, and had meaning was pretty easily done away with and disrespected. Mystic who is the backbone of Magnetos group lost her mutant ability and was cut off? Scott's emotional outburst and death just disrespected his character, and he went out with no glory, it took two movies to establish Rogue as someone who was learning to work through her challenges with her powers, but I guess her progress didn't matter any more.Outside of Beast corny witty lines during fight sequence that tried too hard to be reminiscent to that Frazier kind of humor, and a whole back-story on angel who doesn't really do anything except save his father, they really couldn't get anything right. And at what point did Logan really start to care? By the way was Nightcrawler too busy praying in churches to help? When Magneto attacks the island did the X men really have a plan? And how could 6 X men stop everyone else? After Magneto saw mystic get shot with one of those darts that turned her human, don't you think he would have made any precautions to protect himself from the darts since he knows what kind of weapons they have? They tried so hard to establish all these powerful mutants, yet in the end did anyone really do anything? All these interesting and powerful mutants that convoluted the story just died, what a distraction, what a waste.Here is the real problem outside of the writing and directing; after Professor X is killed do you really care what happens? Again the movie is called X-MEN not Logan's men. It was completely anticlimactic killing off the heart of the movie, and they can try to appease us at the end of the movie that Professor X is still alive, but for me, 2 little 2 late.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1228,apollolancer,"""The Last Stand' couldn't hold a candle to its predecessor!",5,25 May 2006,"Why wasn't the third installment of the X-franchise rated 4 stars like X2 - I tell u why... Besides the SHORT runtime, and introducing too many characters in the movie, the movie somewhat fell backwards by 2 notches, I should have expected it to be more brilliant than X2 in terms of character development , it was otherwise... Apart the fact that new character BEAST, gets a lot of screen time... the rest like Kitty, Colossus & Angel are just simply mere cameos. From the start of the movie, X3 kinda lack the continuity of what normally Prof X would be narrating before the titles come out. Ellen Page displayed a good reminiscent of what the real Kitty's like in the comics. FYI - the photo about Bobby & Kitty kissing and Rogue saw them - that was FOX's lie to cheat us fans of our feelings!!! It did NOT happen in the movie!Ben Foster's display of the hunky Angel/Warren is pretty dyslexic - shouldn't he be the one that takes control of the Worthington corporation? I felt the comics version of Warren's vain, conceited, impulsive personality isn't shown on the screen but rather display of him being the daddy's boy. I felt Warren should be the one that insinuate the cure instead of his father cos Warren has always been vain of his looks and his physical deformity should be part of his drive to insinuate the cure, not the father!!! Even the final battle seemed too rushed for me though I can't deny that the effects of Dark Phoenix send chills down my spine. I begin to understand why no fire-bird effects though there's a slight tinge of fire in Jean's eyes momentarily, I am glad, otherwise the whole thing would have make it look cheesy!Luckily the writers did not make the standoff between Phoenix and Storm, otherwise for sure, Storm will NOT stand a chance of survival against Dark Phoenix! No one can survive against her, except for a certain clawed- mutant. (What's with HIM always having a finale fight against female mutants??!! First it was Mystique in X1, then Deathstrike in X2, now Dark Phoenix in X3?! But the final fight between Wolverine and Dark Phoenix is more emotional than the first 2 because of his love for Jean!)As for Magneto's fateful ending, it is a question of doubt whether the cure is permanent, or NOT? Same goes for Rogue who finally able to touch at the end of her moment with Bobby. Oh course if u would wanna stay throughout the credits for the surprise scene... oh well, in my opinion u can miss it, cos it is only a 20 sec clip... what a bummer... Otherwise i clocked the whole movie in my watch which says 1hr 43mins, which is 103 minutes including credits... bigger bummer!!!Overrall, i wish Bryan Singer should have come back to direct X3, but because of FOX's impatience and stringent attitude about die, die must release X3 on May 2006. When they got Ratner to do it and though he did an overall good job... It is no match for Singer's magic touch of X2... If only the runtime is longer like 2hrs or more... perhaps we will get to see more establishment of the characters - perhaps audience might wanna know how Cyclops disappeared.. Brace yourself at the end - the tombstones we saw at the still picture posted at SHHboards weeks ago wasn't fake, it is real unfortunately... sigh...Oh well, at least the ending of Magneto moving a chess piece and Moira hearing Charles' voice might prove there's definitely a sequel... A well-closed chapter of the trilogy... But treatment could be done better... For those u who wonder if Jean dies again, all i can say is, Ratner stay true to the comics... GO READ PHOENIX ENDSONG and u mite find the final scene of Jean & Logan are pretty much re-enacted from PHOENIX ENDSONG! That's all i have to say for now!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1229,IrishPlayer2009,"A Great movie , but it could have been greater",7,3 June 2006,"This movie starts out great with a flashback and jumping right into the action, and the action sequences in this movie were unbelievable. If I had to rate this movie on stunts i would give it 6 out of 5 stars. They were that incredible. There were some downsides to this flick however. Parts of this movie seemed very rushed and some characters were not as well developed as they should have been. Another thing i disliked about this movie was the killing some of the best characters early on such as Charles Xavier( P.S. stay tuned till after the credits to find out the real fate of Dr. Charles Xavier). But even though there were some disappointing factors in this movie I still feel it was one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. But if you were not as satisfied with this movie as I was there's still hope.

I knew before entering the theater that this X-Men movie had a different director than the first two, and had my suspicions that it wouldn't be up to the level of the previous movies, but I had no idea how lame it would be. Now, they DID throw some money at the special effects, but this director found a way to make them look lame nonetheless. Also, you know how a good director can make even a mediocre actor look better than he or she actually is? Well, no such luck here. Basically, all the seams were showing in this movie. And the story sucked, too! I have read some of the other reviews written about ""X-Men: Last Stand"" on this site, and it amazes me that half the people hate it, while the other half love it. It makes me wonder what is wrong with you people who love it. Will you just watch and love ANYTHING with the X-Men name involved, like the trekkies who will swallow anything with the Star Trek name on it and love it, despite how crappy it might be. I decided to see this movie cause I was kind of feeling bad and needed to get my mind off of things; ""X-Men: Last Stand"" did get my mind off of my problems, and on to the problems with the direction, the plot, the badly developed new characters, etc...To sum up, WHAT A STINKER OF A FILM!!!!!

1231,Troyan6,It is the last?,8,3 June 2006,"X men: The last Stand is not the best movie of x men.The story is good, but not excellent. As the end of a trilogy it should be the best of all, and it isn't. X men 1 and 2 are much better. Besides the visual effects, this film haves almost nothing. And what I didn't like is that it is short. It should have been longer, much longer. But I don't say that is not fun. My opinion is that it is not so good, that it should have been better, but that doesn't mean that you are not going to like it. What I say is that, they had enough material to make this film the best of all, and they wasted the chance. Look at The Lord of the Rings: The return of the King. One of the best films of all. Why? Because the producers and the director didn't waste the opportunity to make their film the best of all. See? The last of the trilogy, and the best of the trilogy. In Starwars happens the same thing. But not in X men.The only conclusion i can take is that this film is not the last one. If it is not the last, then it is acceptable the way it was made. But the big question is: It is the last? Or they made a mistake and didn't make the last film the best? We'll have to wait to know the answer to that question.The actors were very good. Ian Mckellen (Magneto) was extraordinary. Patrick Stewart was too. But if the production and screenplay are not good, no matter how hard the actors try, the film won't be so good.But, at least, it entertains you.

Brett Ratner and the writer's in my opinion did a horrid job.Cyclops being killed in the first 10 minutes,Mystic losing her powers and then Magneto just leaving her,the Professor being murdered by the very much different Jean Grey. it was all pretty cheesy,like the writing.It did follow the comic book fairly well though. Like the danger room with the robot.and how bobby/Iceman made ice all over him.that was good. but then Rogue/Marie doesn't have her power(for now...) and neither does Magneto...(?)and then Logan/Wolverine has to kill Jean cause she's out of control.

When I saw this movie, I knew that since it was Brett Ratner, it would be a different style compared to how Singer did it. Now I know Ratner has cheesy lines in some of his movies, but nonetheless his movies are good, like X-Men: The Last Stand.There are some scenes that, let's say, happen too quick, I won't list any. Now I don't know how Ratner could have done better, but it should have been more dramatic and surprising when we found out that Jean is in fact alive, and evil.Over all, X-Men: The Last Stand was a great movie, and a good movie for a final episode. Nice cliffhanger ending for a final episode. Brett Ratner may not be a Bryan Singer, but Brett Ratner is a good director none the less.

1235,gk_studios,X men 3_contains 1 spoiler not real spoiler though,1,29 May 2006,"Sorry, I didn't like the movie truly. I know that they have to bend some marvel rules and all, but how can you say that by doing that they can make more fans. As if everyone knows the X men and people are expecting a good story, even without breaking the story you can make it appealing and make people ask for more but what do they do. They create a bogus story which makes it less interesting the real PHOENIX was much better. The story about jean in the movie is not the real thing and less interesting then the real one the real story could have made more fans. I think the studios did a poor job, not on the visual effects though. But they lacked the fantasy to make the movie a real marvel movie. Spiderman is much better, X-men is just so bad really it disappointed me and I didn't even had high expectations of the movie.And how come the Juggernaut is a mutant? it's more of a mystery to make him not a mutant people will ask questions and more fans will appear about stuff like that.Really stupid that the Juggernaut is Mutant he was made so weak no real character.Studios have enough money to produce high quality movies. And next to Lord of Rings everyone knows X men how come they budget that movie to the max.X men 3 not worth your time even the visuals have been kept to the minimum.

""Wow"" This movie had some great action and had so many twists and turns, that it could have been a coaster. Unlike many other sequels or action flicks, you can not tell where this movie goes. It had me glued to the screen from the beginning until the credits. Later, I found out. That I should have stayed until after the credits for another twist. Arghhhh...The only down side would be for the die-hard comic groups. The story definitely doesn't stick to the story line, but I can live with a little re-direction.

1237,LBradfordhome,"Enjoyable, but a wasted opportunity.",7,25 May 2006,"This is, without a doubt, the worst of the 3 X-Men films. But I don't think that would come as a surprise to anyone. With Brett Ratner in place of Bryan Singer, I honestly had pretty low expectations of this, the third installment and supposedly the last. Truth is, for the most part, those low expectations were met. But I still enjoyed it. It certainly isn't a complete tragedy, but is a wasted opportunity. This could have, and should have been the biggest, and best so far. The action is decent. And there is plenty of it, which will not disappoint. But the first two movies had something this doesn't, and that's heart. This more feels like a bunch of scenes thrown together that Ratner just really wanted to do. Lots of action, minimal feeling. While there are moments that are meant to be emotional, as there is little to no time spent with each character, we are left disconnected, its as if we are expected to already feel for them before the movie begins.But Ratner's strength isn't in dramatic moments, and the X-Men films aren't exactly where you'd go for drama. This is pure escapism. And it works on one level, but its just not nearly as fun as the previous films. Performances are what you'd expect, strong from the stronger actors and everybody plays their part to provide some good support.Finally, this film is drenched in special effects. It's very big on the razzle dazzle, but relies on it too much. With the first two films each time a mutant revealed their power it was exciting and awe inspiring at times, wowing the audience each time. But this one is built on effects, rather than the human element, and it suffers for this. It tries to show off new characters and their powers and never gives us a moment to get to know any of them.All in all, it isn't a waste of time, but sadly is not the movie that it should have been.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1238,MexicanJumpingBean,X-Men 3: The Last Stand,10,24 May 2006,"X3 IS 3X THE FUN I am awed that director Brett Ratner knows movies, how the elements should blend, what cinematic entertainment is all about. As a nod to his predecessor Bryan Singer (nothing wrong there), he took the best elements from Singer's storyboard, and combined these with his own beliefs about what a real X-Men movie should be.More than an action movie, his X3 had emotional depth and literary tightness, plus movie clarity, character development, superb visuals, excellent timing.There were many highlights: the Juggernaut/Shadowcat chase scene, Phoenix vs. Professor X, the Building-a-Bridge scene, Wolverine vs. Spike, the Danger Room scene, Beast in Battle, Angel in Flight, and the climactic scene with Jean and Logan.I am impressed by the script logic. i.e. how Professor X explained the origin of the Phoenix phenomenon.I enjoyed Halle Berry here more than in the past two films. She is a stronger woman here with fine leadership qualities. Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine shines throughout the movie. Mr. Jackman is the best thing to happen to Hollywood action since Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones.The only thing I didn't appreciate was Famke Janssen's makeup as Dark Phoenix. The cosmetics was meant more for the role of Regan in an Exorcist remake.There was emotional resonance in X3, without the need for corn. I cried twice while watching the film. Several X-Men died here, whose names I can't tell you for the sake of the element of surprise.Congratulations, Mr. Ratner. Terrific juggling act. It was definitive MOVIE MAGIC.X1 was a 9.5.

Really little thing annoyed me about the first movies (ie. no mention of Wolverines and Sabretooth's immense background, no mention of Wolverine and Yurriko's (Lady Deathstrike) love story/background, changing the whole Yurriko character, no Gambit/Beast/Sentinels/Jubilee, changing the whole Rogue back story to some whiny little kid.) These changes are OK and i've dealt with them over the past 6 years. X Men 3: ""The Last Stand"" crosses major lines. 1. Professor X- DEAD dumb twist after credits with Moria MacTaggert (hopefully we see Banhsee in X4) 2. Cyclops- DEAD 3. Jean Grey/""Phoenix""- DEAD 4. Psylocke- DEAD (if you call that person in the movie Psylocke (I didn't know until the credits)5. Juggernut is magically not related to Charles Xavier and IS A MUTANT 6. NO SHI'AR EMPIRE 7. NO M'KRONN CRYSTAL 8. Let's introduce as many characters (Multiple Man, Leetch, Callisto, Spike,Psylocke, Shadowcat) as we can and lets see how fast we can kill them off 9. Let's totally mess up one of the greatest plot lines in the X-Men universe (THE CURE). 10. Let's turn Msytique into a normal person11. Let's turn Rogue into a normal person 12. Let's turn Magneto into a normal person Although the last three might be negated by a not potent enough or not tested enough cure. Let's hit Magneto with 4 darts with the Cure in them, but lets leave it open for a sequel so we can make 11 of these like the Friday the 13th series. I hope Bryan Singer makes his own X-Men 3progression from Jean Grey--->Phoenix--->Dark PhoenixThe Shi'ar Empire and M'Kronn CrystalThe ""cure"" turn the mutants into slaves of ApocalypseDon't kill of the X-Men's leader like he's nothing. (I know every one LOVES Wolverine in the movies, but Cyclops is still the leader and not a pawn)Let's not neuter three great charactersAt least if Singer doesn't make an X-Men 3 or direct X-Men 4 and clean up this mess......and Brett Ratner continues the series.............. I still have 5 seasons of the animated series from the 90s to satisfy me",X-Men - The Last Stand
1240,fy-11,Blah Blah Blah X3 was Terrible,1,26 May 2006,"I am sorry but this movie was horrible compared to the other two. The director did a horrible job. There were not even any creative and well thought out camera shots or anything like that. X3 was all seriousness, all drama, all emotional, all the time. Barely any action and during the ""final battle"", the mutants that magneto so aptly named ""pawns"" ran out to fight they did not even use powers. It was pretty much a bunch of guys running at soldiers with crappy looking weaponry with the cure. No one but the main characters actually used their powers. I could have done the final battle in my backyard. This new director really dropped the bomb and it is really disappointing to see this once awesome franchise turn into a money making scheme, just like so many good vg franchise and movie franchises have done in the past.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1241,P-Adaley,:(,5,27 May 2006,"Not that the movie isn't worth going to, but if you have any expectations at all, be prepared for disappointment. Like everyone's been saying, Ratner took a good solid concept and hacked it to bits.I'm really interested what Singer would have done differently; no doubt his version would have blown Ratner's to pieces. Now Halle Berry won't play Storm anymore, what a sad sad day for X-men.Instead of a Wolverine sequel, they should pay Halle a gazillion dollars and make a Storm sequel. Who cares if there's no budget for effects, she could probably carry the movie all by herself with crappy lightning and such; just so long as the story is good.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1242,jclark5121,X-3: The Last Stand is the greatest Sci fie/comic book movie made to date,10,30 May 2006,"I have no idea why people are getting all upset and angry abut this movie. First off it is not like the critics gave it 1 out of 5 stars. On average it got 3 or 3.5 out of 5 stars. You shouldn't base your option on whether to see this off of some guy who thinks it is a bad movie. Honestly this is the best X-men movie yet made. The acting is great, the effects are great, and the action and fighting is awesome. It is a magnificent way to end the series. And not only that, it adds surprises and shocking scenes. A couple of mutants die that you would not expect to die. This film has a darker more evil look to it then did the other to. With the edition of some new mutants, and the ones who now become a huge part of the series really helps. Brett Ranter takes some x-men from the other movies and gives them a big part, showing more of them. They play a huge part. But not only doest his movie defy what critics have to say, it proves them wrong. It brought in over 120 million here in the US. WOW!! This has the most fighting of the three, with the final fight being a group fight instead of a one on one fight. The fight is about 20 minutes long. Not only that the writers added in some funny lines. Overall this deserves a 10/10. Best sci-fie movie to date.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1243,gchavaccord,"Listen to no one, just go see this!!!!!!",9,28 May 2006,"this movie was the ultimate in super-hero movie making. Although there were a few things that contradicted the x-men universe, those things were easily overshadowed by the incredible story line and dynamic action sequences. before I saw the movie I heard nothing but bad reviews, luckily I only take my own advice when it comes to which movies I go see. Hands down the best action movie of the last year, falling behind of course only to star wars episode III : Return Of The Sith. Like I said though their were a few holes in some of the character profiles, which only the comic geeks will notice. Mostly though, the bad comments I heard about were from people who only knew about the stories of the x-men the the cartoon. All I have to say if you are not familiar with all of the x-men universe, series, or story lines then you really can't speak on anything that is done in this movie.

1244,Kuma1080,"Good Movie, could use some work, still loved it",9,26 May 2006,"yo there may be some spoilers in this unstructured review, please excuse the poor writing and the spoilersWhen talking about an x men movie there are a million things to consider, having just seen the movie myself i can make several key points that i enjoyed about the movie and parts that i didn't. First off when comparing this movie to the previous x men movies you feel the drama, tension and controversy about the mutant ""problem"" from the characters just as much from the first 2, this is only compounded by fact that a cure is found and that escalates a war. Secondly this movie is much shorter then the others which is a little disappointing because there could off been much more character development and the subplots could off been explored more with a longer movie. And finally this movie had a ton of action, much more then the others with intense stunts and vivid CGI keeping me hooked and excited through out the film. While i loved the film, there are several points that i would like to make, in which i think the movie could be better, firstly what happened to Rouge, her part was minimal in the movie which was disappointing because she was an essential character in the first, and had a significant role in the second one. for those who saw the movie you know what i mean when i say you were hoping for a climatic end similar to the x men evolution cartoon where she would return and absorb leeches power and help defeat the brotherhood. That would off been cool but then again I'm a nerd and not a film maker, but you all know that would off been really sweet and made for a better ending then the one we got plus i liked here story the best, I would off also liked to see bigger character development and a larger more complex subplot between the love triangle between off iceman,rouge and shadow cat. Also there's night crawler, what happened to him, with all the extra useless characters that had a limited role in the movie other then to look cool like angel and colossus, they could off thrown him in. seeing him in the opening scene in the second was sweet and seeing that in this one would off made for much better action sequence especially in the final scene. Wolverine was cool in this movie, but like i read in other reviews he didn't have that lone wolf quality, i wont get into any further, but many off you who saw it understands.Ian Mcallen playing magneto was sweet, he is an excellent actor and really made the character. Beast was cool, Kelsey Grammar did a good job, and Ellen Page did a good job as kitty pride, angel was useless, his only role was to bridge the gap between mutants and humans and provide a reason for the cure. Like i said, and i will say it again, character development is the key, which is something we got very little off in this movie. I can go on and on about the movie, and things that i would off like to off seen in the movie, but i didn't write it, and probably couldn't off done a better job then the current writers did, but they could off used some constructive feedback from comic books nerds and even Brian singer when making this movie.In conclusion like i said a million times, a longer movie with more character development and deeper plots, that pull us further into the story and characters would off made for a much better movie, especially with the action i wouldn't off gotten bored. I loved the movie, but its no better or worse then the other 2, if you combined the action added by Brett with the story brought by Brian you would have a hell off a movie. If they can find someone who brings both to the table, a awesome 4th movie it would make, and lets face it, even though they said its the last who are they kidding they so left another open ending.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1245,towissie22,who are these characters based on?!,5,29 May 2006,"As far as major blockbusters go, X3 is a success. (that is, to someone who's never read a single X-Men comic in their lives!).trying to squeeze four different stories into one film just doesn't work, stick to one storyline and keep to it. the film could have been a lot better, had only one story arch (such as the dark phoenix saga or juggernaut) been used.some of the major problems i had with the film: 1. multiple man, psylocke and callisto part of the brotherhood?? 2. rogue actually going through with the ""cure"", if i remember correctly, she destroyed the machine in the comics. 3. cyclops, jean Gory, professor x and psylocke getting killed off as well as magneto, mystique and rogue getting depowered, why don't you just kill every last mutant?! 4. juggernaut is such a push-over in this film. did no one actually tell the writers he's supposed to be unstoppable and not a mutant. why the hell would leech's power affect him. oh, did i mention he's supposed to be professor x's stepbrother?? 5. why does rogue still not have all her powers? 6. rogue and iceman being in a relationship? when did that happen, or did i just so happen to miss that particular comic? 7. phoenix is one of jean's other personalities... i didn't know jean was a schizo... 8. where is colossus' Russian accent? 9. why was pyro ever part of the X-Men??? and where is his Australian accent? 10. when did mystique and magneto, and for that matter, magneto and pyro ever work together?? 11. Colossus and shadowcat are supposed to be together. 12. archangel, beast , jean Gory, cyclops and iceman are professor x's first five students, so why does archangel have such a small part in the film? 13. where did nightcrawler go?? did he just disappear off the face of the planet?? the writers could have at least try to explain as to why he's not with the x-men anymore. 14. the phoenix is called phoenix for a reason!! where are the flames??? it was hinted at in the second film, but never used in the third. 15. could they not at least give colossus and rogue a bit more screen time? they didn't do much... 16. when i heard moira mctaggert would be in the film i was extatic, she's such a good character, but she's barely in the film, about 3 seconds if i'm not mistaken!!a few things did actually make sense, however. callisto and storm's battle scenes, for example, an age-old tradition in the comics as well as wolverine and colossus' ""fast ball special"".a total flop as far as character development and storyline goes!!! the film-makers should know that what makes the x-men great is the characters and their relationships and views and not what powers they possess. it certainly adds to the characters, but should not be the main focus of the film!!where is Bryan singer?????????",X-Men - The Last Stand
1246,PresidentJuggernaut,So Underrated.,10,13 August 2006,"People like to put this movie down, but I find it very underrated. Bret Ratner did not hurt the X-Men franchise. If anyone hurt these movies, it was Brian Singer, with his first two movies that ended without resolution. Ratner had no choice but to wrap up the ongoing plots, and had only limited space to carry the story further. He did do a great job bringing in new characters like Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut and Kelsey Grammers Beast. There was also a seamless interpretation of the Dark Pheonix Saga. The shocking deaths and demutations of popular characters work fine in the context of the movies. It made a great compliment to the fist two X-Men movies, and is a fun film that exceeded its predecessors.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1248,nukey-1,"This film is good, when it could have been great...",6,25 May 2006,"I went into the movie with trepidation about the choice of Brett Ratner as director, and unfortunately I believe the direction in X-men 3 fell short of the first two instalments. Despite decent and genuinely spirited performances from the vast majority of the actors, I felt the third movie simply failed to reach the benchmark of the previous films.Maybe I was victim of self-driven hype but with the sea of potential available to this film, the securing of additional respected actors and unlimited financial backing I don't understand why this film just didn't have the oomph. The fight scenes weren't as creative as previous films, the dialogue was more sentimental and with so much plot activity, the overall focus of the film was lost in a spiral of unrestrained amateurism.With all that negativity out of the way, nonetheless the film was not bad. There are a lot worse films that I could have spent a £5.90 film ticket on, and as is becoming a pleasant standard with the X-Men movies, there were gasps, laughter, cheering and a real connection with the character development of some figures (namely Mystique, Storm and the cleverly crafted Hank McCoy). I'd watch it again, if anything, to mutate this initial review of the film, but whether or not in future viewings I change my mind, if there are successive X-men films, I hope Mr Ratner has nothing to do with them.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1249,CybernoidLevytron,"X-Men Comic fans, prepare for a wild ride...",9,27 May 2006,"I've been reading the X-Men comics since I was 10.I'm 23 now. I watched the cartoon in the 90s, and bought the action figures and cards. I'm telling you all this so you can get a sense of who I am. We all sort of need to realize going into this third installment of the X-Men movie list that what sort of X-Men fan you are might sway your opinion on the movie.First off, the basic plot of the movie continues off where Singer left it. Jean Grey's Phoenix character rising from the ashes. Second off, it involved a mutant cure that was created and proved that it works. Ratner does a strong job of telling the story accurately and there are no plot holes or points where I was left going ""What?"" except for the secret ending after the credits, which everyone must stay for. All I can really say is watch carefully.The movie moves at a very quick pace, but not so fast that it loses moviegoers in the dust. The action is jam-packed, and for fans of the comic book, you'll enjoy this change of pace from Singer's drawn out, gloomy bits. However, as I'll get to in a moment, Ratner's job is much different than Singer's, and I think he did it well.Acting wise, there were strong points and weak roles that weren't explored. Hugh Jackman had the humor down pat, but also could maintain emotion and trauma when it was needed. Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen continued their roles, and it's even more clear that these two were born to play Charles Xavier and Magneto. Stewart is much angrier in this movie, but for good reason. Magneto's big scenes, while action packed and illustrious, were not as jaw dropping as his prison escape in X2.Anna Paquin's character was not explored enough, and Daniel Cudmore's Colossus is strong willed, but tight lipped. I am a huge fan of Ellen Paige's Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat/Sprite, whatever you'd like to call her. Juggernaut's character was a bit frustrating to watch, just because he's not a mutant in the comics. Kelsey Grammar as Beast was just, amazing. I loved every second of his on-screen time. The character of Callisto needed to go. I liked how Iceman not only had a bigger role, but he felt more evolved. Of course the love triangle was fairly apparent, Iceman kept his (no pun intended) cool, and completely balanced an evil, almost enjoyable Pyro. Halle Berry's Storm was stronger in this movie, and for good reason. I liked the change they made with her character. She feels like she believes in being a mutant and wants to fight for it, and I easily forgive her for X-Men and X2's ho-hum attitude. This time around it feels like she wants to be there, and she does a great job of giving life to Storm's otherwise timid presence from the first two flicks. As you can see, numerous characters were present in this film. This was a major gripe I had, but at the same time, her scenes were entertaining. Psylocke, while never really named, is easily spotted by comic fans alike. That is the biggest problem with this movie. Comic fans will get more enjoyment then everyday moviegoers. But it's the sort of problem that is understandable when you think about it this way.The movie feels more sugary and action packed for a reason. Change needed to happen. In fact, it was forced. Singer started the phoenix saga in X2, and there was no way to avoid it. Zak Penn's script was strong, with the appropriate twists and turns. Watching this as a comic fan, you're used to the movie's rapid procession through various sets. It's understandable to see all these mutants and not get their back stories. This movie was more about a war going on between mutant supporters and mutant loathers. It does a fine job of placing characters on sides. I really enjoyed it for what it was: an energized, high tension, emotional roller-coaster of a film. Does it have it's faults? Sure. One or two. But this was quite good, on par with it's predecessors in terms of strength, but not in terms of strong characterization. I'll be seeing it at least 2 more times.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1250,khirth3,huge letdown,4,3 July 2006,"This movie was a total letdown for me.. It didn't really add anything to the series and it was really unfocused.. I wish they would have just stuck with the Phoenix saga(or whatever the heck their version was) and just developed that more instead of trying to throw the little kid on top of everything. The movie is just too many different characters trying to do too many things just lumped together..SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS What was the purpose of Angel? To see him fly? Beast was completely underused as well.. Nice effects, but movies get boring when there doesn't seem to be much purpose to all the action.. Ugh, and the Juggernaut costume was really bad, a lot of them were. Horrific dialog - BAD MOVIE! Plus, everyone dies! Cyclops dies and no one cares. Storm's accent dies.

By killing off the people they do and rushing through 10 years of comics in a worthless hour and a half movie, they ruin the marvel that is the xmen legacy. I nearly walked out of this movie, as a true fan of the comics, this movie just made me angry. How can you change the way Phoenix is created? how can you change the way that the prof dies? other then the fact that the guy played cyclops wanted out, how can you kill him so easily? the makers of this film didn't use the characters they already developed in the last two movies, such as nightcrawler. Big disappointment. And they didn't really use angel at all. he was there and his character could have been sweet, but they didn't use him at all.

As afaithfulday noted, the first two movies were good, the third was mostly clichéd Hollywood crap. The only thing it had going for it was a little bit of suspense/tension, but that was not enough.In the first two movies, there was a resonating story, strong themes woven throughout. In this one, it seemed to be all about cramming in as many witty one-liners and special effects as possible. There were a few weak attempts at stringing a story together, but it was so choppy and rushed there was almost no continuity. I left the theater thinking that there had to be a super-extended DVD release in the works, because what I had just seen couldn't possibly have been release-worthy.What a shame.

1254,dancingpokemons,Too Much on Ratner's Plate,2,26 May 2006,"Okay....I will not begin by bitching about how the movie strayed far away from the previous two installments, or the comics in general. Wait a minute....I think I will. This movie began as being The Halle Berry Movie. She whined and complained during the previous two films about her character's lack of involvement. Well, she was able to hog all the camera time she wanted but was still a disappointment. Storm was still basically useless and Halle overreached WAY TOO MUCH! It seemed she wanted her character to be Halle Berry, not Storm and it was crystal clear to the viewers. Secondly, Professor X did nothing but wheel himself around and was inept to handle any situation. I thought he was the most powerful telepath in the universe. At least he is in the comics and it is the phoenix force that allows Jean Grey to surpass him (which was strangely absent in the film). Speaking of Jean Grey, she may have been reborn in the film, but her character had little change that I will not discuss. Don't get me wrong, I felt that the film had some excellent scenes but were given by CGI and not Ratner. Even people who know nothing of the X-Men except what they had seen in the previous two installments agreed that this movie was as fulfilling as a gimp winning a race. Ratner had way too much on his plate and was only able to finish a small portion of it. For a movie based upon a book with intricate plots and loved characters, this is unacceptable. I could rant forever about the disappointment I felt after leaving the theater and my rage would still be unsatiated.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1255,specialkstender,Good for Sci-Fi/Action Buffs; Bad for X-men Enthusiasts,10,30 May 2006,"I was very excited yet hesitant about this film. In short, you can tell that Bryan Singer did not direct it. It is not as smooth or as well put together as the past X-Men films. However, with that said, there are enough ""Wow's"", emotional moments, and character quirks to make this an excellent film, especially for sci-fi/action film enthusiasts. This film introduces us to a lot of plot and a swarm of new characters in a short period of time. You will miss the characters you've come to know who are not in this movie for very long or at all. I enjoyed the new characters but felt we did not get to know them well as Singer had done with characters in the past. However, the visual and emotional track they took in introducing The Phoenix was simply amazing. If you are not a huge X-Men fan, you will probably find the movie interesting and entertaining but a bit scattered and over the top. Being a fan, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1256,mtd02038,Too many sub-stories,6,28 May 2006,"First of all: A quite good movie. But it couldn't top the previous two parts. If you watched part I and II and you really liked'em, you'll like this one too. But you'll also notice a difference in storytelling due to the new director. X-men 3 comprises much more action than the previous movies but also much more story. Too much for my taste.I really appreciated the fact that mutants slowly discovered their abilities and first were confused by them while learning to control and use them under the supervision of the professor in the first two parts. The characters were drawn very finely and the different sub-stories crafted together seamlessly. The spirit of the original comic strips was conveyed well and I'd recommend the first two movies to every cineast, even those who don't like fantasy films. In the latter part the case is different. While the spirit and the stories of marvel's x-men are built in well, there are too many sub-stories, each told well on it's own, but having no grave meaning for the main two stories: ""phoenix"" and ""the cure"", which themselves would be better explored in two separate movies. But this way too many characters got a raw deal and too many story-lines are left undone.The play and the balance of powers among the different mutants are another special aspect of x-men. Again, in the first parts, each mutant could contribute his power to give the story a different turn, and each ability was shown in full activity, like for example the ray-eyes of Cyclops. X-men 3 features dozens of new mutants, whose abilities are shown on a small spectrum, contributing rather to the action and the spectacle of the film than to the story. That's a pity, as I believe.All in all, it's a well done picture with the spirit of the original comic strips, but craming too much story and too much pure action in one movie, not topping the first two x-men films.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Some of the x-men who were sort of ""glanced"" upon last movie, have much bigger parts, and the brother hood grows significantly, with new mutants that have some very cool abilities. Magneto also rocks out; Ian McKellan's performance was, as always, superb. The battle scenes are fantastically done.

After she whored herself out in Swordfish to show some skin, and let Billy Bob go freaky wild on her so she can get an Oscar, she decided to use that Oscar clout to convince Ratner to screw up the whole movie by killing off such immensely KEY characters so Storm can have a bigger role and not have to share the screen with (holy crap) THE TWO LEADERS OF THE X-MEN.You're a tool Ratner.You had great opportunities for...1. One CRAZY epic battle between Iceman and Pyro that had been built up since the beginning of the first X-Men movie. (instead he opted for a headbutt and a smarmy line, ""you need to chill out"") 2. And this one REALLY bugs me...You introduce Juggernaut. The most badass character in the X-Men universe. You cast Bullet-Tooth Tony to play him (Not who i wouldve picked, but nonetheless, a good call). But the whole time I was getting up to walk out of the theater, I couldn't help but realize that the most epic one-on-one fight of the movie was Storm vs. that fast chick (once again, Ratner being a whore).

While Singer didn't quite get the characters right (at least not the way they should be been from the comics) Ratner does. However, he doesn't really develop his characters properly. It's missing the subtlety of X-men 1 & 2. It's still amazing, but I wish it had taken its time more.Of the new characters, Beast in spot-on and had just enough screen time to really get to know him. Angel, on the other hand, despite being set-up for decent characterization is really shortchanged.

1260,gcanders1,A poor ending to a great trilogy,7,1 June 2006,"I was disappointed in the movie as a whole, but some parts will stay in my X-Men movie memory for a long time. The action sequences were seemingly flawless, but the storyline that fell in-between explosions was very weak. Wolverine's lines were G rated and stale, while some of the new cast members were spewing off curse words left and right and even they had little impact or momentum to move the plot or give it flavor. The story was lost, and I think it was because it was trying to do too many things. Phoenix was fighting for her storyline, several characters were fighting for their storyline to end, and then there was the main storyline trying to fill the empty spots, but there wasn't any available.As for the new characters: Beast was a better character than I expected. Juggernaut was a very small role, but effective, Angel was anticlimactic, Calisto was nice to watch, but said and did little of importance.This is the first X-Men movie I wont be going back to see in the theatre, but I will buy the DVD to complete the set.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1261,mads3000,"X3: The Last Stand entertains, but is further more quite easy digested.",6,26 May 2006,"Poor Bret Rattner. Everyone has been so skeptical about him directing X3. And yes, I'll admit that The Last Stand doesn't get marvelous during the modest running time of 104 minutes. However, I will not blame it all on Rattner. He does his job very fine. More I would like to criticize the writers, Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn who deliver quite a weak story. Simple with no actual twists, no specific moments standing out, which I think this movie definitely misses. Something extraordinary is not there. Yes, you are able to feel when the climax rises, but still it's like it is not really there. To all this, especially the one liners seem to lack importance. Lots of them just appear to immediately vanish in the haze. Therefor my vote mainly goes to the exposure of the characters and their astounding skills. Utilising the amazing CGI effects, the film, however, does achieve some beautiful moments, where you cannot hide your satisfaction and have to critically acclaim it. So don't go in there with the highest expectations, but prepare yourself for 104 minutes of entertainment, where you most likely are going to miss something, but where you at least don't start to nod off. My verdict: X3: The Last Stand entertains, but is further more easy digested.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The film after watching countless trailers was looking awesome, the fight scenes, Jean Grey storyline and new characters all made this look to be the best X-Men yet and it was, the sad thing is that it could have been so much better.The storyline featuring Jean Grey was very good, it was great to see Famke play the good and evil part, I mean she had to quite literally switch personalities and the beauty of it was Famke could be good, evil or in between. Patrick was like his other performance flawless, you really felt for him when you needed to and it was truly a pleasure watching him act. Literally all the cast was excellent, Ian McKelen who lit up the screen, even James Marsden showed off his acting talents in the shortime he was on-screen.*spoiler* The bad thing about the film was the deaths; yes it was good to finally see a film that wasn't scared to kill of the main characters, but I hate Scott Summers, I hated him in the first and second films and yet watching being removed from the film in a sense removed part of the X-Men and so in the final scene it just didn't seem right watching the X-Men fight without Scott. The same is said for Charles, a gut wrenching death which I thought was very brave by the film makers and pulled off perfectly, but in the aftermath it seemed like something was missing from the film without Xaviers presence. *spoiler**spoiler* Also another bad point was the fact that 50% of the brotherhood seemed mortal, yes they were all mutants, but because we never good a good look at each mutants it just seemed like a big bar fight between the soldiers and 'pawns'. I would have also liked to see a lot more of Angel, I thought he was awesome and would have been awesome in the fight if he was actually fighting (also I noticed in an X-Men 3 film poster he had an X-Men suit on, yet he didn't in the film). Also despite me not liking Anna Paquins acting I would have again liked to have seen her in the final fight scene. *spoiler*Overall I think the film is a must watch, a 9 if not 10 out of 10 film, I would have just liked to see some more of the mutant abilities and seen bigger roles for Angel and maybe Scott coming back to life. 20 minutes more film would have opened up more questions and would have truly made this film an epic movie.Oh and I also note everyone saying this is a trilogy, well they have to make a 4th, not only did the final after credit scene show this, but also the final scene with Magneto or Eric Leshnerr as he appeared to the audience in those last moments of the film.",X-Men - The Last Stand

As a long time fan of the comic I thought this was a good addition to the trilogy. I was puzzled by some of the creative decisions that were made to keep the story moving. The use of the Juggernaught (who is not a mutant), the lack of mutant powers being used in the final battle (6 x-men against around a hundred brotherhood, the fact that Jean Grey would Never Kill Scott summers even accidentally, the overuse of profanity, and small things like the absence of main charters like Nightcrawler to name a few. Many of the non-comic fans that attended with me thought it was a great stand-alone movie.

Kellsey Grammar was perfect to play Beast and Vinne Jones as Juggernaut was just awesome. I even laughed at some particular parts. However i wasn't happy with some parts of the movie and i hope that Brett Ratter DOESN'T direct another Marvel Film.

1266,duba046,the worst x men movie,5,27 May 2006,"to tell you the truth, I'm really disappointed...i think this is the worst part of the trilogy, due to the new producer. What I dislike : the first part of the movie is nothing more than quick change of scenes and different ways of the main story, and under quick change i mean really quick, one minute about Magneto, than half minute about Jean Grey, some seconds about the school, and so on. You can see the character of Phoenix in the rough, i didn't know how is it possible, he =SPOILER= kills Cyclops without betting an eyelid, but Logan survives every meeting, although Jean refused him in the second part. I didn't understand why Professa X must die as he did, what happened with Rouge at the end of the story, OK i know she lost her abilities but thats all, not obvious what really happens, does she stay at the school, does she stay with Iceman, or whatever. The Pyro - Iceman duel was boring and unimportant, too quick and out totally out of importance, i thought it will be better so summa summarum : bad producer, cool design and cgi effects, but too muddy story",X-Men - The Last Stand
1267,kirkebyenator,Too many questions!!!,6,28 May 2006,"I really did like X-Men: Last Stand. The film hooks you in the first frames. Seeing Xavier walk is aweing and the scene with young Warren mutilating his wings is heart-breaking. Unfortunately, the plot was scattered from there on. The reason that the first two went so smoothly was that a few characters were chosen and then the movie followed mostly them. Last Stand, however, followed almost everyone without following anyone really. Often story lines were begun but never finished.Much of the story happens off-camera as well. Many times we are just told that something has happened rather than actually seeing it happen. We never see Cyclops die but it is implied that he does. We don't see Rogue take the mutant antibody but we see her holding Bobby's hand. Mystique's betrayal is,again, verbally explained by a television screen and the cliché line of ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" Last Stand also leaves a lengthy list of questions at the end of the film. So many questions in fact the viewer leaves the theater confused if not annoyed. Did Bobby really accept Rogue's choice? Did Warren's father accept his son as he is- a mutant? The boy who is the source of the antibody, Jamie, is seen with hair at the end of the movie. Does this mean he took the cure himself? Is Cyclops really dead? Since Magneto's powers came back even with the antibody does that mean that other mutant's powers will come back? The list goes on. Also it seems a little off that Phoenix, susposedly the only class five mutant, could be killed by mere claws which leaves the question of ""Are Jean and/or the Phoenix really dead?"" Cliffhangers are one thing, not finishing the story is another! The story is written as though another movie is coming out soon or that the movie is written with only readers of the comic in mind as the only target audience. Without knowledge of the comic the scene after the credits as well as other scenes do not mean half as much.Another flaw is, also, perhaps a good aspect of the film. Last Stand foreshadows future events and leaves clues very nicely. Although maybe not discreetly because in hindsight it seems a little obvious. In one scene, Xavier is lecturing his students about the ethical applications of certain powers, specifically psychic powers. He talks about the idea of taking the soul of say a terminally ill patient and putting it into the body of a comatose patient allowing the once terminally ill person to live out their life albeit in a different body. The scene after the credits involves a doctor looking over a body which suddenly wakes up and speaks in the professor's voice. He speaks her name and she speaks his in shock. Her expression denotes someone who does not expect that voice from that body. The scene is too fast to see if the face is actually Patrick Stewart's or an, until recently, dormant patient, perhaps the same catatonic person from the video from Xavier's lecture. However, without prior knowledge of the comic book you would never know about the past history between Xavier and the Doctor.The problem of the this heart-wrenching scene and countless others is that there isn't going to be another film so we will never know the answers to the questions it poses or know the truth of Xavier's miraculous reemergence.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1269,ejc-6,Not worth the bad reviews,8,27 May 2006,"Not as bad as everyone says. I really like the final battle at Alcatraz. I was pleased to see more of the Logan a as a smart ass, some good and well suited jokes to break the tension of the more serious moments. There is some pretty serious moments early on that make you think that the last hour may feel very long. But overall it is well shot and edited. As usual Hugh Jackman is excellent as wolverine.And who'd have thought that Frasier would have been so good as beast.It's not as good as the first one but an improvenment on the second one, which was a bit disappointing. I think it's worth a look. And if you think it's a waste of money you don't appreciate action films",X-Men - The Last Stand

This is meant to be the last X-MEN but i doubt it because... Right what happens is they find a cure to kill the mutations (what this does is it removes all the powers from the mutations) as you may already no, and towards the end of the film Magneto gets stabbed with the injection (which is the cure) 4 times by the Beast and right at the end Magneto is sitting by a chess table and he tries to use his power to move one of the chess bits and it slightly moves then straight away the credits come on so you have to be quick when it happens and Don't!! take your eyes of the screen or you will miss it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1271,teneniel2,Liked it but wanted more...,6,26 May 2006,"I have waited for this sequel to come out ever since I heard they were making it. This past week was like waiting for your baby to be born except with a baby you are never left wanting for more. My expectations kept lowering after each review I read but my eagerness to see the movie remained strong. I have watched X1 and X2 on DVD so many times I've lost count so wild horses couldn't keep me away from seeing this movie.As soon as the movie starts, your attention is held and never waivers. There are weepy moments. There are shocking moments. There are moments where you are holding your breath. Then there's the moment when you realize the movie is over and you are wanting more and more.Yes, there were some disappointments. The movie was too short for the story. It would have been nice to see more of the abilities of the ""new"" mutants. I wanted to see more of Phoenix. I wish there had been more action sequences involving all the X-Men together as a team. I also wondered what happened to the scene (this is not a spoiler since it was not in the movie) I read about in STARLOG magazine where Wolverine is spun around by Magneto. That would have added more drama.Please don't judge the movie too harshly before you see it. It is still worth viewing. My only hope is that when it is released on DVD, there will be about 30 additional minutes of footage included as well as deleted scenes.Someone mentioned in a review that you should stay until after the credits. I decided to do this and was surprised to see others waiting as well. After the credits end, you will be surprised. Please take the time to wait. It's well worth it.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Disappointed.The new characters in the film are introduced minimally, angel has no reason to be there, just a mere muppet to fill some time and space in the plot, some terrible mistakes the day to night in like a second thing, and just the overall feel of the film, it should have been epic, dark phoenix was pathetic, everything about this film was overblown, not good enough, bryan singer showed how they should be made.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1273,vodjick,nothing like the comic book,4,14 June 2006,"All I have to say because I do not want to ruin the movie is that if you really loved the original x-men this movie is not for you. This movie is completely different from the old days. I would have really enjoyed it more if it was like it was before. The movie stresses wolverine's character, but he is not the only one in the x-men. I feel that Cyclops needed a bigger role he was a main character before why isn't he now. He was a great character in the past and I feel that he should have been given a bigger role. Another character who could have been it more was Angle. Be fore I went I expected to see a lot more of him than I did. I was a little disappointed. I can say the movie was jam packed with action from beginning to end. It was good in the sense of action. I enjoyed it because I kept you on the edge of your seat. I just feel that they should have stuck more to the original x-men than this whole new breed.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1274,xmanconti,Terrible Let Down of the Year,1,23 May 2006,"I just left a sneak preview for this movie and I could not be more disappointed. The only people that will enjoy this film are the ones that know absolutely nothing about the X-Men. Shame on Avi Arad and Lauren Shuler Donner for allowing this terrible representation to be completed and released. After watching the first two X-Men films, I was positive this would be amazing, mind-blowing, and above and beyond any fan's expectations. Instead it did not even try to meet those expectations. Please do not continue to read if you do not want to read about details of the film.There is one redeeming quality for this movie: Storm is actually powerful. Took them long enough to use her character properly.I don't know whose idea it was to try and cram everything they possibly could into one film, but it really should have been reconsidered. The Danger Room finally appears, but only for a few minutes and there is no mention of its name, or purpose. In this scene a Sentinel is destroyed, but again no mention of why they are fighting a giant robot, or what it is called.Next, the entire Phoenix story should have been ignored for this film. Jean Grey returns only to be a fireless Phoenix that resembles a psychotic demon rather than an all-powerful goddess. Not only is her return repulsive, but she kills Cyclops almost immediately in the film. Although I understand this cannot follow the comic book exactly, something that should not change is that Jean Grey's love for Cyclops is what gives her the strength to overcome the Phoenix and ultimately take her own life. In the film, Wolverine kills Jean Grey/Phoenix, even though in the comics his character's love for Jean Grey prevented this action. Not to mention earlier in the film Phoenix tossed Wolverine around like a rag doll, but could not take him down at the end of the movie. At least they could have pitted Storm against the Phoenix in the finale, but instead we are left with another stabbing.This movie attempts so much, but accomplishes so little. It introduces Angel, whose part is almost nonexistent. Why did I see him in a million promo shots of him wearing a X-Men uniform, but not once does he wear it in the film? They should have just killed Rogue. She is the only X-Men member that seeks out the ""cure"". It's bad enough her character's powers resembled nothing of her comic book counterpart, but did they really have to take away what little power she had? Does this film ever say Shadowcat, Colossus, Psylocke, Angel, Beast, Danger Room, Sentinel, or Multiple Man? If it does it is very quick and quite lacking in explanation. It's oddly insulting because you have to be a fan to know who the characters are, but the story and world has been altered so much it creates frustration knowing this will be the best representation of these characters in the film world.The only way this film would work is if another one was coming out next week to portray Phoenix correctly, reconsider who lives and dies, reverse the cure, and actually identify key characters and elements by their names. This could have been one of the best movies ever made. The stories of the X-Men are identifiable, spectacular, and emotionally charged. This falls flat as just a summer special effects film with some creepy parts.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1275,primedoug,X-Men: The Last Stand falls short of previous movies,4,24 May 2006,"It's difficult for a new director and writing team to take over a spectacular franchise, but the new crew missed the mark on a lot of details. Without giving away plot, it is fair to say that there were a lot of disconnects between the characters and the plots in which they were - or were NOT - played. Where a character should have been integral to plot (Rogue and Beast making choices, for instance), we saw none of the inner conflict that should have existed - either prior to or after the decision made.Another area in which this movie lagged far behind its predecessors was in ""Easter egg"" background characters. The previous movies offered identifiable glimpses of supporting characters known within the overall X-Men universe; Last Stand instead used generic characters that could have just as easily been at home in the background of any Star Trek television episode.Expectations for Last Stand ran high, but ultimately weren't met. The movie may have been great for a lover of action films who was totally unfamiliar with X-Men lore, but for anyone who enjoys any of the monthly comic series or previous movies the result had to be disappointment.I guess my main hope - if indeed another X-Men movie is even optioned, that is - is that the next movie start out with Cyclops waking up in bed and stating ""I just had the weirdest dream..."" which would basically remove X-Men: The Last Stand entirely from movie continuity.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1276,tuwhakaroa,True To The Title,10,24 May 2006,"I think that X3 is by far the best comicbook based movie I have ever seen and now one of my all time movie favourites!When I first heard the title of this movie I thought it would be a huge battle where Xavier and Magneto sort out their differences and after seeing the trailer my ideas didn't really change. However after seeing the movie all I can say is that they couldn't have chosen a better title because in hindsight it makes so much more sense and it is so much more than Xavier and Magneto battling it out like they always do.What I enjoyed most of all in this film was that there were a lot of mutant powers being used and demonstrated, there is no hardcore romance (you know the kind that seems uncalled for and you just think ""where's the action at?"" (but not the sexy kind)), there were some incredible surprises so reading any spoilers what-so-ever will lessen the impact of some happenings, and I liked how at times you really felt for the characters, both good and bad (I don't know about you but I wasn't really expecting to empathise or sympathise for characters in a movie like this but I couldn't help it or maybe I just like X-Men too much). Oh yeah and it's not as Wolverine focused (for me a big plus).What I didn't like about the movie were things like characters looking too different to the comic versions or mutants having the wrong powers (again this could be due to me liking X-Men too much). There were also some pretty cheesy parts too which would probably have been better edited out (you'll know it when you see/hear it as the cheese is pretty hard to miss). The other things I didn't like seem to be concerns only I have, my friends who I saw it with said that I shouldn't take it so seriously or over analyse the small things however I only tend to do this with things I really like. In terms of the good and the bad the good totally outweigh the bad. Fans of X-Men will enjoy the movie and like me the things that you don't like most will have to do with comic differences. On the other hand if you've seen the 1st 2 movies but haven't read the comics or seen the original cartoon then you'll enjoy the movie too but you'll either like it more or like it less (due to lack of emotional attachment). So go see it and see it at the movies as special effects and action are always more appreciated and better enjoyed on a big screen. All in all there is awesome action, dramatic drama and carnage galore (but the bloodless kind because after all X-Men: The Last Stand has an M rating, it does in New Zealand anyway).",X-Men - The Last Stand
1277,filmsarethefuture,a fun film but don't go looking for depth,5,8 June 2006,you can instantly tell singer has left the project. X3 is the worst out of the trilogy. the new characters are shallow and the best characters are killed off. brett ratner has pretty much ruined what could have been a great film and the best out of the lot. there are a few moments in the film that are good but it doesn't make up for the rest of the film. the fantastic cast are wasted and the acting is spoilt by ratners direction. a fun film but don't bother looking for any depth.,X-Men - The Last Stand

The movie surprised me, made me laugh, and had really good morals. The movie starts out, very exciting, with explosions and much much more. Apparently the Government has found a Mutant who can cure mutation. Strange huh? I think what surprised me was when Cyclops died at the very beginning, or did he? We don't really know. It doesn't show it. We can only assume that the Pheonix killed him, but since it was not seen, I don't believe that he is dead. Also, the Professor, that was extremely shocking. I was in awe afterwords, so much in shock, I couldn't believe it. But the end (after the credits) it clarifies everything. And for the cure, well Magneto proves that it isn't actually lasting. They will get there powers back. I am sure they will make a sequel, besides the Wolverine movie and Magneto movie, there will be others. So Rogue and Bobby are screwed...lol Also, Jean and Scott will come back, I am almost sure of it. It will be great.

1279,pashek,I must have gone to some other movie,5,24 May 2006,"In my opinion, this was the weakest of the 3 movies. I had hoped for an awesome experience that the material of the Dark Pheonix saga could deliver to the big screen. All the elements were there and ready to roll. It never happened though, it just wasn't delivered.The story focuses on 'The Cure' which, if thought through and developed could have been a great movie on its own. However, the attempted mix of these story lines detracted from both and failed to keep me interested for the short time it was on screen (1.5 hours).The start to the movie seemed good and then all pacing was lost and we seemed to just go through the motions to get to the end point with few highlights in between.This should have been 2 separate movies with much more care and attention given to character development and to telling an actual story.Various characters are introduced and left as a bit part where there was a greater role to be played. Witness Angel, Moira and Colossus (Yes, I know he was in the second instalment but he's actually part of the team now). There was hardly any point in actually having them there.The deaths seemed random and I have to wonder why the Scott was even featured at all. They could have just had a big sign at the start saying, ""James is off filming Superman"". I hope he has more screen time in that.I can only hope this was an effort to set the stage for further development in the next movies. I'm not sure who is to blame for the lack of enthusiasm I feel for this movie. Do I feel that Bryan Singer would have delivered a better movie? I'm not actually too sure that the script was there to allow any director to make this good.I will concede that the movie had some nice Special Effects but that does not begin to make up for the shortcomings of the story telling.The X-Men franchise could have done without this. It felt rushed and unfinished and there was no real reason for it to be this way. I'm sure it'll do well in the box office but the introduction of many unexplored elements will leave a bitter taste in the mouth of X-Men fans.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1280,GaAnMo,Forget the comics before seeing X3,8,24 May 2006,"Just saw this movie and there are certainly mixed feelings about X3.While the movie was excellent as a stand alone action flick, any X-Men fan should forget all about what you know from the comics. This movie was so far from the comic's history that you might find yourself muttering under your breath about all the details that were obviously omitted.Some blatant examples were the non-existent relationship between Xavier and Juggernaut, Colossus and Shadowcat (Kitty). Also since when was the Phoenix a suppressed personality? The super nova was a separate being that possessed Jean at the moment of her death.On the other hand, the characters were well portrayed and justice was done to capture the personalities as we know them. Kelsey Grammar was a perfect fit for Beast and Juggernaut was exactly the reckless, smash everything in site unstoppable force. Angel was okay, but I really expected a bigger part or at least more screen time on him. He was kind of a secondary mutant as though it was an after thought to include the character.Overall, the movie was good, not as good a parts 1 & 2 but a definite must see.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Bryan Singer should have finished this movie before he went to superman returns. What we have now is a action movie without any ""feel"" of the characters so everything revolves around the action.The things that happen in the middle of the movie to Mystique and Xavier should have happened at the end, because it really takes the suspense away.There's is no character building so the new characters like angel and beast have no meaning in the story. They want to tell so much in so little time that nothing really captures you're emotion and you don't care what happens to the characters. Jean Grey (aka Phoenix)is so powerful the fight that happens before she gets into action is useless. And since when is Juggernaut a mutant?",X-Men - The Last Stand
1282,mjno7,Last Stand Comments - Spoiler Included,4,25 May 2006,"I saw the movie last night and feel compelled for the first time ever to write. I'll try not to give too much away, but there are some things that I need to address. I'll start by saying I was filled with much anticipation pre-movie and much disappointment post movie. I'm not here to bag it, I think parts of it were great (The house scene with Phoenix and Professor X, brutally confronting. The climax to the Wolverine/Jean tryst, had to end that way. Vinnie Jones/Juggernaut kudos must be given for a casting coup) but I have a few points I want to mention. I'd be interested to hear other thoughts. Were my expectations too high or am I near the mark? 1. The demise of Scott-While I found Scott a bit of a dick, I thought his role as a main character deserved more of a send off than a few misery filled lines and then gone. I have no problem with killing off main characters, just give them a deserved send-off. 2. Mystique-I loved the Mystique character. So deliciously cynical. Again, another example of doing away with a character so central to the core without a fitting dispatch. 3. Nightcrawler-What happened to him? So much time spent building him up and then gone. Remember, in the oval office at the end of X2, he was going to be one of the ones watching. Maybe he was watching. From the seats of the cinema thinking what the hell happened to me? 4. Colossus-Got a bit of airtime in X2, thought we might see a bit of development. Nup, just a bit player in the background. And for that matter, where did Kitty come from? No explanation, no development just there, accept it viewers! 5. Beast-I love Kelsey Grammar and thought he'd be perfectly cast, but I just couldn't warm to him. 6. Angel-One of my favourites from the comic, thought he'd be a great inclusion and we'd see more of him than we did. In fact, except for the scene where he busts from the Worthington Labs, he resembled nothing more than a giant, camp Albatross. A shame, because he could've been great. Actor perfect to play him too. 7. Magneto ripping up the bridge-Looked great but come on. If he was hell bent on getting at the leech, wouldn't he just load his motley bunch in a bus and lift that to the island? That would also do away with those pesky soldiers running across the bridge that he'd so helpfully placed for them. 8. Phoenix' demise-It was great that Logan did what he had to do, I loved it but answer this. If she was so powerful and could keep everything away, how was he able to crawl to her? 9. Magneto's repentance-What? He gets stuck with a needle and so then everything he fought for was suddenly wrong. Gimme a break. 10. I'm no scientist but it's a four hour flight by jumbo to San Fran from New York, right? Unless Angel snuck aboard the x jet, how the hell did he manage to fly that distance in time to arrive just after the x jet and catch his papa? Overall, to me it appears that they bit off more than they could chew by adding so many new characters. I dunno, I just didn't feel that we got the chance to form strong feelings about the characters like we did for the first two movies (Even Toad and Sabretooth elicited emotional responses). Maybe losing Singer took the movie in a different direction that I would have hoped. Please don't think I'm bagging the movie as I'm pro X-Men, just airing the thoughts that have perturbed me. I welcome any comments from others.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Not cool, Halle Berry! Then she goes and makes that corny speech about making the world a better, more peaceful place.No fooling us, Halle Berry. We know it was you who done offed Cyclops.Early in the script, Xavier turns to Halle Berry and says, ""We're looking to expand your part in this movie, Halle."" And disingenuously, so disingenuously, she answers, ""Oh, who? Me? What about Cyclops? Because I wasn't planning to off him or anything."" And Xavier's like, ""I'm not really fooled, Halle, because I can read your mind and know you want Cyclops out of the story. And don't worry, girlfriend. The fact that you won an Oscar cinches it. We're going to arrange it. And we're going to pretend like it wasn't your idea. But deep down, everyone knows, WE ALL KNOW, it was you.""

1284,deathbyfilm-1,Could the X-MEN make a better last stand?,8,19 July 2006,"Well, this is the final movie in the trilogy. Following the great success of X-Men and X2, X-Men 3: The Last Stand tries to live up to the other prequels with some of the recurring actors and characters such as, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Magneto (Ian McKellen), Professor X (Patrick Stawart), and Storm (Halle Berry). However, it is not short of new characters like Juggernaut, played by Vinnic Jones, or better known as Big Boy from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Callisto played by Dania Ramirez also starred in 25th Hour as Daphne. Last but not least, my favorite new character, Beast, played by Kelsey Grammar, (The leading star in Frasier) really pulled off playing a furry blue monster. Those are just a few of a long list of new mutants, but I will leave the surprise for you. With the introduction of so many new mutants, the hype for this movie started a long time ago, and message boards all over the Internet grew with people guessing what this movie was going to be about. Everyone knew this was coming because, in the end of X2, it left room wide open for a sequel. I have been an X-men fan my whole life, but don't let that make you think I was going to favor the movie no matter what; because I'm a fan, I am going to reviewing it a little harder than the non-fans. I ended up seeing the movie twice, one time with friends, and the other with my 16-year-old sister who is not too familiar with the whole X-men craze, so I was able to see how both sides reacted. The first thing right off the bat that made me a little upset is that Bryan Singer, the director of the first two X-men movies, dropped out on this one to go make Superman Returns. So this made a different type of director take his place, Brett Ratner, best known for the Rush Hour movies. After seeing it and looking at the other two, this one doesn't have that many new and creative shots. Don't get me wrong, there is some great cinematography, but when held under the light with the other two, it has a different feel. X-men3: The Last Stand is shot just like other big budget Hollywood movies, in my option because it is based off the comics and is dealing with super heroes, it needs to have a little creativity in the cinematography. Putting that to the side, I thought the story carried itself, knowing that Fox wanted to end the X-men trilogy. I think by introducing so many new characters it was like a double-edged sword. The fan wants to see more mutants, but because the movie could only be so long, the story could only go so far in character development. But, overall, I think it was balanced pretty well. The one thing people go see the X-men movies for is the fight scenes, and this movie is not short of them. The way the screen play is written is that the first half of the movie is story builder, and the other half is concentrated around the final battle. For the people out there who are like me and love the battle scenes, then you will get a kick out of this final battle. With every mutant holding their own, it makes you feel like a kid again, playing with your action figures. But by sacrificing half the movie to this battle scene, I feel like the story was a little rushed. It almost seemed like they didn't want to leave any loose ends, so they tried to wrap it up as quickly as possible. I was some what disappointed about this. The one thing that got on my nerves was the one-liners that some of the actors had that this movie could have done without. Just when something amazing happened, it seems like they throw these cheesy lines in, which I believe came close to wrecking some of the scenes. This isn't so much the directors fault but the new screen writer. Overall, that was pretty much the only problems I had with the film. After seeing it with my friends, who keep in mind, are fans of the X-Men as well, they really enjoyed the movie with just some dislikes. On the other hand, my sister who doesn't follow the X-Men movies, ended up being a little confused, but over all it kept her entertained. For those families out there with kids under thirteen, I do not recommend it for them. The movie is rated PG-13 for bad language, brief nudity, and violence. My final opinion of the movie is that I think it was a great installment to the trilogy, but there are some things the movie could have done without. I believe X-men fans will enjoy it and non X-men fans will be entertained, but I strongly believe in watching the first two films before this one. One last thing, MAKE SURE you stay after the credits for a nice surprise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1285,svenpopelier,perfect,8,25 May 2006,"This movie is so beautiful! It begins calm but then the action begins. The special effects are fabulous and the cast is so good. This movie is one of my favorites ever! The humor is so cool and some scenes are so terrible. I also like the new characters. Beast is just what I expected, Shadowcat, Rogue and Bobby have a cool but sad dilemma. Huggernaut is very funny, Pyro is mega now he can use fire all the time. Eagle is very good. His wings are like real. It's a poor thing about Mystique, but you have to see it. I'm very sad for Cyclops to. It's a bit unfortunate that Nightcrawler does not return. The powers of all the characters are very well found and the make-up of Magneto in one of the first scenes is very good to. He so young! When I buy him on DVD, I will watch him loads of times.

1286,Turbo0019,X-Men 3 is AMAZING!!!,9,25 May 2006,"This movie was amazing! I was a little worried at first to hear that Brett Ratner was the director (Face it. Rush Hour 1&2 don't even register on the action/effects scale that X-men is measured on.) But I do feel that Ratner was a great choice to direct the 3rd installment of the series. Most movies have points where they drag a little but I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. There was absolutely no down time. The only negative thing I have to say about the movie is the choice in casting of Jimmy/Leech. I've seen that kid in Birth, Running Scared, UltraViolet and he just gives me the creeps. I just want everyone to make sure that you stay through the entire credits because there's a little surprise at the end. Trust me, you'll be sorry if you miss it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1287,theredpox,"Devastated, traumatised and kicked in the teeth",1,25 May 2006,"I was very, very disappointed because everyone died and there should have been more of a Wolverine storyline to tie it in with the first and second x men movies. There were too many sad things and soppy Logan storyline and it should have been called ""Depressed men"". Gutted that Mystique was wrote off early and horrified that Magneto lost his powers never mind all the death. Where was Nightcrawler? Why was Wolverine not as charming as usual and at the end of x men 2 you could see the shadow of a phoenix flying across alkali lake. Hellooooo????? Get the original director and crew back and remake this film properly. No justice was done to x men fans.The above paragraph was written by my 8 year old daughter who stormed out of the cinema disgusted with the whole movie, tears pouring down her face, she was shouting for the manager so she could complain and ask them not to show the movie to anyone else because it was too crap and that it would break peoples hearts. While I was trying not to laugh at this angry outburst I noticed my partner was equally infuriated and utterly disappointed. To me it was just another crap film but to these two die hard x men fans it was devastating. I had this horrible realisation that I might actually have to get this pair some sort of counselling!!!!They spent the whole week longing for this day to come, even dreaming about xmen, it's all they talked about for ages. It was all very exciting until they both came out feeling like they got kicked in the teeth. Poor little darlins, the only way to make up for this let down would be to totally remake the whole thing, staying true to the characters that made it great!

I grew up on Comics and Xmen was one of my favorites. This movie unlike the previous two that simply combined a few story lines and exercised a little liberty, Totally IGNORES the Character development that was established during the comics. I mean since when did Jean Grey Kill Scott?? and when did she turn and kill the Prof??? ITs like the Pheonix Saga on acid. I can say I enjoyed watching the special effects although they could have showcased a few more characters when the mutants (bad) started on their campaign of terror. And not to mention MAgneto and how his story turns. This would definitely be a rental, I went to see it at a midnight showing and the entire theater was booing.

1289,robina_mehilba,"this movie is the best, u should see it : the discovery of a cure for mutation causes an up rise in the mutant community....",10,4 June 2006,"X-men: the last stand is by far THE best movie I have ever seen. Considering acting, plot, story, screenplay, scenario, action and special effects it excels in all. Though it has one thing missing in it which is night crawler. We haven't seen enough of him in the second movie and I was hoping he would have a role in the third one. Angel's appearance was also cut short, he is one of the original five and he deserves to have more action in the movie. I think this movie deserves a part four and it would be even better if Brett Ratner is the director as he is talented and one of the best directors out there. Beast's appearance in this movie is really superb as he is not introduced to the x-men as a new comer (like angel) he is considered an old member of the Xavier's school for gifted youngsters. Storm shows more independence in this movie as she proves her strength both in battle and in mind as she stands against the idea of the cure and shows her bravery and leadership in the attack on Alcatraz. as for Logan he becomes more of a leader than a loner, first he helps out in the danger room and tries to teach the x-men rookies, then he shows leadership when its time to take the last stand for what they believe in. ice-man also grows stronger in this movie as he shows how he has mastered his powers since the X2, as for his x-friend Pyro... well they do resolve their problems in their own way in the end. at last kitty pride gets the chance to show herself in the movie, though I would have liked to see her hooking up with colossus as it is in the comics.

1291,skywalker6705,"Written 1 hour after seeing, and posted 2 hours later",3,26 May 2006,"This movie was horrible in so many ways. When I was done with it, I had to call a friend to talk about it, because I couldn't get over how bad it was for more than 10 minutes. X-Men 1 was good, it focused on characters, developed a bit, and had action. Magneto was trying to change humans not kill them all. X-men 2 had Cameos, but they were focused and deliberate cameos (like the much more Badass-looking armor-plated Colossus, as opposed to the crappy T2 liquid Terminator ripoff in X3). X-Men 2 had a decent incorporation of the original story lines, with alterations of course, but nothing too far off from the original intent or purpose of the character. Magneto then decides to kill all humans. That's wrong in so many ways, but it works for a movie, and it didn't muck up much else up. So what's the verdict on X-Men 3. Well, lets see... people liked plot development... what develops plot... I know, death! What else does well.... oh yea! Cameos! So, first 20 minutes, kill one of the most important main characters of the comics for dramatic effect: Horray. Oh, but don't miss the Massive list of Cameos and their messed up/non-existent powers. Oh great! Omega Red, Psyloke, Jubilee, oh wait... that's right, they didn't DO ANYTHING! OK, so the cameos aren't getting it... h'm, OK high-budget fight sequence, but the audience still isn't responding... I know, lets KILL ANOTHER CHARACTER! (I'm a genius). Now, we've kill most of our most powerful leading characters, and taken them out... h'm. I know! Magneto needs to re-affirm his commitment to enslave all humans (oops, I meant KILL) by ABANDONING his most faithful assistant! Holy Plot Holes Batman! So... 2 characters down, Tens or so broken, lets keep writing.... so.... X-Men United. Together. Oooooh, OK, so they need to symbolically UNTIE, and be AWESOME... h'm, a (large) army of Brotherhood mutants vs...... ah hell, 6 X-Men are good enough, it's not like the Brotherhood has.. OH WAIT, the ARE supposed to have awesome mutant powers. Oh well!! Guess what we do for a finale... Oh? Use the mutant-neutralizer to neutralize Jean... wow... that makes a lot of sense... writers didn't seem to think of this obvious peaceful resolution... but it seems too.... not-martyr.... hows about instead.... WE KILL HER! (Here's where you hand me my Best Writer Award!) I hate this movie. Storm fights awesome. Beast rocks. So does Wolverine. So does Jugernaut (best line of movie. Guess... bitch!). But having good fights does NOT make up for this. It's like watching Terminator 2, but outside of the awesome car chases, the Terminators play cards or something. It's that bad. I'll make a YTMND of the Jugernaut's scene, the single best scene of this movie, and NEVER NEED TO SEE IT AGAIN!!!

The start of the movie is great, but then it seems to get bogged down in slow paced dialogue which in certain parts which does nothing for the progression of the story, then it gets back into the action. In addition, I felt let down about the killing of major characters in ways which seemed like the film makers were just trying to unload the huge salaries, those actors commanded in order to make X-Men 4. Not that I'm complaining, I'm not a big James Marsden fan, but he was in the movie for what felt like 2min. (What was the point in having him at all???) All in all I do think Brett Ratner did a good job, but I feel Bryan Singer understood or ""felt"" the X-men series a little more.

The severe lack of any decent dialog is atrocious, not to mention the gigantic plot holes that are left in the wake of this, this monster that they call a movie. Characters die, others simply left out (apparently forgotten or maybe they just decided to run away?) while others are sporadically introduced with no background story other than a hint of some long past history with another character... oh yes, and who can forget the characters who seem important,when in reality they have 2 lines and then disappear for the rest of the movie leaving one to think that they either died or just got bored out of their minds of the movie itself and decided to go home. The fact that none of the newly introduced characters have any background to speak of is, well, less than satisfactory. Charles Xavier... oh my how you've changed. Stern? Yes. Self-assured? Duh. But angry and judgmental? Never. ***Biggest Let Down: Do not introduce or allude to a character in previous movies you do not intend to include in the next you frigging idiots.

Oh yeah, and in X2 on Stryker's computer screen there is a file called Gambit.... do we see Gambit in X3? No, of course not. And Mystique? Just abandoned by Eric. And, of course, Cyclops, who has 6 lines and then dies after the first 10 minutes of the movie... brilliant guys. Really brilliant. That's not to say that there aren't any good points to this movie.

Twists are few and very, very weak. Once you're actually watching it if you can forget that it has anything to do with X-men (in much the same way as Catwoman had nothing to do with Selena Kyle), it's quite an enjoyable action movie.The only happiness I can get from this experience is that since Ratner directed this movie he hasn't gotten his dirty mitts on Superman.I won't say any more for fear of including spoilers.

Wolverine, Jean Grey, Magneto, Beast, what parts Mystique did have, Iceman, and somewhat Kitty. Huge never fails to amaze with his great portrayal of the beloved Wolverine. The last scene of him and Jean was just like New X-men. The great chemistry between him in Jean in the lab was great. Along with the Jean Grey's house scenes with Magneto, Jean, and Xavier. I loved Mystique even if her part was short-lived is was very memorable. While his part was too small Ashmore's portrayal of Iceman was very true to the character. The action sequences were all pretty good, loved the Kitty-Jauggernaut scene, the Danger room sequence, and the final battle. Wolvie needed a little more berserker fury, but otherwise he was great. The Phoenix story was simplified, but sensible except for her killing Scott...Now the bad... 2. Halle Berry is so not believable as a strong African Goddess that my beloved Storm should be. She sounds like a weak pathetic baby, with too much perk in her voice. She also likely ruined the movie by demanding more screen time and requiring a large paycheck. That money would have been better spent on a better Storm actor, and additions like Emma Frost, Gambit, or Psylocke. 3. I also could not stand the killing off of Cyclops, I hope he is not dead, because they never really showed a death scene. I missed him and Wolvie's love-hate relationship. Those are the main two things that ruined this movie for me! 4. Also disappointing were the small non-Russian accent part of Colossus (good looking actor, but underused). I also really hope that purple haired girl was not supposed to be Psylocke, because they really screwed that one up, no strong British accent and the girl couldn't hold a candle to the Betsy Braddock of the comics.Now the what could/should have beens... 1. They should have brought in Gambit, Rogue could have been running off, but went to a café/bar and there she runs into our Rajin Cajun, and he convinces her not to get the cure and instead be with him... 2. Emma Frost, she picks up an injured Scott Summers (not dead) and nurses him back to health; either that or the Brotherhood joins forces with the Hellfire Club (I mean they had the Worthington's why not the Hellfire Club too?) 3. Betsy Braddock the English ninja, joins up with the X-men (not the Brotherhood, what was that about) and perhaps a scene with her and Angel, who was very underused. 4. I wish Nightcrawler had been back, because his has the most fun persona and could make any scene fantasticI know they do not have time/money for all of this, but just one of these scenes would have made the movie so much better (maybe if they had cut out the Halle Berry crap scenes and added something the true X-fans would enjoy, I would want to see this movie more than one time in the theater). I do not want to bash Halle Berry, but I can't stand actors who don't just feel privileged to be a part of something as powerful as the X-men, and instead of graciously accepting the roll have to make great demands. I could ramble for about 24 more hours of what could have made this movie epic, but I will just have to hope that a fourth movie will come and redeem this bad apple in the trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I wasn't convinced that they were actually mutants, but I found myself repeatedly having to redirect my thinking from, ""I'm watching a bunch of actors run around in silly costumes."" That wasn't all the actors' faults; it had to do with the editing and the direction of the movie as well.The music in the movie felt very cheap. In fact, much of the movie did. It felt like it wasn't very thought out and almost thrown together. At one point in the film, the Golden Gate Bridge is moved at about (I've only seen it once so don't quote me on this) midday--at least a point in the day where there is plenty of light. Some trixy camera work happens, and in the span of about 4 seconds the scene becomes night. Now, I didn't get confused--someone actually tried to pull the wool over my eyes. That was silly.The special effects were good. From what I recall, better than the first two movies. That was surprising in and among the rest of the movie, but almost all the SFX were seamless. Weird. They spent some money there.The movie lost me at the beginning. The first two scenes felt contrived--from first ""20 Years Ago"" and then ""10 Years Ago."" We are given an introduction to Gene Grey back when Magneto and Professor X were still friends (aww), and then given an obvious set-up for a later scene where we meet some inconsequential scientist's (governor? public figure?) son. We're all glad we got to meet him then so that we could feel for him more later in the movie when he -a- defied his father so that he could be who he was born to be (a winged man) and -b- saved his father from dying with the very wings his father would rather had disappeared. Looks like daddy was wrong. I think I'm rambling on that one. Sorry. The point is, the movie started to lose me then, which is unfortunate.And then the first scene we see in the ""Not-to Distant Future"" was on a holodeck--for lack of caring to come up with a different term. A training simulation. Surprising idea. Luckily, Logan was able to show his recklessness in that scene by lighting his cigars off of fires in poorly-shot ways. Wow, I'm ripping on this movie. Oops.The point is, I didn't like it. If you see it and do like it, then I'm glad you have this review to look back on and say, ""That guy was a jerk. This movie's good.""

This movie was nothing like the other movies it took off on a path of its own and this was a path of awfulness. if you are not a fan of the comic you might like it but if you are this movie might offend you. so to sum it up BRETT RATNER DIE IN A FIRE you helped to tarnish some prized childhood memories well i guess there is always superman please excuse me i have to cut my wrists because of this movie,X-Men - The Last Stand
1301,andrewdaniel,"X-3, the movie",7,26 May 2006,"Okay...just watched the movie. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the film. I just don't know what to say about it, I feel the movie was rushed, and never really tied up some of those loose ends...what happens to Mystique. Some of the deaths (while awesome...and you know who I'm talking about) just seemed unnecessary, especially when they are extremely important characters in the film (as a whole). In my opinion, this film is good but bad at the same time. Phoenix looked absolutely/ stunningly evil. Angel...no real role in the film towards the end, just a random add all together. If I had to chose from the trilogy, I would definitely pick the second film. Do you think there is going to be a Fourth film? They did leave the ending open.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1302,brandnew00002,one big spoiler,3,26 May 2006,"This movie was by far the worst Marvel movie mainly due to the director. How can someone that directed Rush Hour and Mariah Carey's Heartbreaker video direct a marvel movie after? This movie was incredibly cheesy for the one liners and sound effects. Why was their bowling pin sounds when Juggernaut bashed through the gaurds? And when professor X says to storm,'you of all people should know how fast the weather can change.' OH MY GOD THAT WAS SOOOO WITTY! She controls the weather and xavier made a witty comment on her life and the weather. Oh man. That's HILARIOUS! After that HORRIBLE one liner I didn't pay attention to the others, which were plenty but, thank God, I don't remember them.Why did they have shadow cat? she was never a popular character to begin with. Granted I did like her for a lot of her parts but a better character choice would have been to have Gambit. He was an actual xmen in the comics. Not an avenger. They could have still had the horrible love triangle cr*p but it would have made more since.In x2 they did have Gambits name right above magneto's when Mystique looks up where he's located on Strykers computer. They could have easily made him one of the bad guys which would be better than not having him in there at all. When Mystique said 'he robbed 7 banks' i was so excited cuz I thought it MIGHT be him but no, it was multiple man in the truck.Rouge is another part I hated, they could have so easily put her in the fight, drain someone's power (someone along the lines of Ms Marvel) completely and make millions of Xmen fans happy in the final battle scene. Given, that's not how it happened in the comics but with Mystique taken out... there's not really any other choice.Another part that was horrible, Psylocke. They could have played her really well instead of giving her one scene where she just appeared in the hallway. Then Angel, who had NO part in this movie except being his father's reason to create the Cure, could have battled her which would make a intro to a X4. And where was Jubilee? From the beginning they should have made Jubilee the intro mutant instead of Rogue. That's how it was in the comics.Colossus played NO role in this movie. It was really disappointing. Afterall, they could have made him fight Juggernaut and lose and THEN had kitty pryde do her little race thing. (oh one part that was awesome was when she sunk him into the ground and Juggernaut said something along the lines of 'do you know who i am? i'm Juggernaut you b*tch, that was awesome.) The president was just plain retarded in this movie. Well, I guess that's pretty accurate. Maybe Bret was doing a shot at Bush in which case, he's not half bad.There was blatant advertising for the new Mercedes GL which was just... again tacky.The part that REALLY bugged me was that Pheonix/Jean Grey, killed cyclops and if you ever read the comics, he was the only reason she 'defeat' the Phoenix. Brian Singer did a great job in X2 building her but Brett Ratner did a HORRIBLE job portraying her. She was so inhuman looking. That would have been okay if she was the dark Phoenix but the Phoenix was suppose to be jean Grey, just with a big Ole fiery phoenix around her. THAT would have added to the end. And another thing, why the h*ll was she killed, and by Wolverine for that matter. Sure she can toss him around without even trying in the beginning when she's not p*ssed but when she's at her full power AND is p*ssed off, she can't prevent him from walking towards her. Come on, so somehow Wolverine beat her 'unbelievable' power? Well that's impressive.the things I do have to give X3 dues for are, Storm actually has the correct eyes in the movie. They're FINALLY fully white. I did like that Callisto and Storm fought, I thought that was accurate but in the movie, the contents of that fight was WAY off base. Storm fought Callisto for Cyclops. And it was cool that Iceman finally reached his full potential i guess you could say. And lastly, Beast. Kelsey Grammar is most likely an Xmen fan apart from being a great actor. He was the only reason this movie got a 2 instead of a one.Marvel is really starting to sell out now. I don't get why Stan lee is allowing this. they could have waited until Brian singer was done with Superman to direct this movie. Sure they it would have taken another year but at least the quality and continuity would be there. And if Marvel wants to sell out more they should just make an X5 and use the BMW x5. It's due for a model change and that would be a good way to debut it.The only way Xmen could redeem itself is if they have an x4 and Cable, Bishop, and Forge are in the future and they need the power of the Phoenix and all the other telepaths, that they killed off in this movie, to defeat Apocalypse and travel back in time before they butchered all the xmen and make an impressive Xmen movie again. Then angel can play a vital role, the whole love thing with psylocke would have worked and the 3 most important xmen would be alive still.Just a note: stay at the end after the credits. you'll see professor x isn't really dead. for those who don't get this, when he's talking to the students about ethics and putting one man mind that has terminal cancer into another, vegetated, body... well... there ya go.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1303,jfichebin,Finally excellent,10,26 May 2006,"A 10 might seem really high but I think it deserves it. While this movie still does not respect the real X-Men history lines perfectly and some mutants previously presents are not in this movie anymore, not only the scenario but the action scenes are also so much improved anybody will enjoy the movie. In this movie, people seem to have a brain, which is pretty cool since they seemed so stupid before for most of them. The dilemma mutants are facing is also a good point and it leads the different heroes to a different path and while some are now closer than ever, some just fall along the way because they can't stand what they are (true enough that for some, it's just that ""accidents"" happen...). The only problem is this one : Halle Berry. Not that I dislike her. It's just that how Storm is supposed to have such a big role in the storyline? Alas, that's what happen when you have a ""A-class"" actress in this kind of movies...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1304,tyrelbennett,Worst movie of the year,1,26 May 2006,"OK so I went to watch the new x-men movie tonight (X-men ""The Last Stand""). I was so disappointed in it. The first two movies were pretty good. But this third one sucked ass. It is the only movie that has ever made me want to go on a killing spree after watching it... I will give it some credit though... There were a few good parts, and some funny parts too. But in general the entire movie sucked.In the movie most of the crucial characters were killed off. (Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Professor X.) I have never liked Cyclops, but the way he was killed in the movie is just wrong... He deserved to at least be killed in a fight... They didn't show Cyclop's death, but you know full and well that it was by The Dark Pheonix...Of course all those who watched the second movie, know that Jean Grey was to come back in this third movie as the Pheonix... Well that did happen... Though she came back as the Dark Pheonix... She was totally crazy... She was the one to kill Professor X... Which is completely wrong... Not just because Professor X should not have been killed, but by his most prized student... Someone he cherished as a daughter... Professor X was torn of his skin, and disintegrated... And at the end, it was Wolverine to kill Jean... which again should not have had to happen... She could and should have been saved... And Wolverine loved her, you should never have to kill your loverThe basis of the movie was that a scientist had found a cure to turn mutants normal... The cure came from a mutant that was being held hostage, being used to create the ""cure."" Of course the cure was used as a weapon against the ""bad mutants."" The first mutant to be stripped of their powers was Mystique... She did not deserve that either... She was way to cool in both of the other movies to be exterminated so easily... And in the last fight scene, Magneto was stripped of his powers too... Magneto is to strong and powerful of a mutant to have been stripped of his powers by trickery...Another sucky part about the movie was they didn't have Gambit in it... But I won't go there...Kelsey Grammar made his appearance in the movie as the X-men ""Beast."" He was not the right person to have played that part... He looked terrible, though his voice matched pretty good... Also Juggernaut made his appearance in the movie too... Though he sucked just as much as the rest of the movie... He was way to tiny to play The Juggernaut... I might as well have played his part... It would have added some comical relief to the movie...The movie will get a little bit of credit from me for a couple reasons (just as long as they make a 4th one)... At the end of the movie, they showed Magneto regaining his powers... And if you watch past the credits, it shows a clip that leads you to believe that Professor X is still alive... Also if they make a 4th movie, they better have Gambit in it or I will raise HELL...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1305,Hutch86,Perhaps lived up to it's standards.. barely,7,26 May 2006,"I was thoroughly impressed with this movie.. although it went right off storyline and absolutely shocked me in parts. The imagery and effects really have to be seen to be believed, & the integration of popular characters from the animated series added a little bit of spice to the already tense mixture between the Brotherhood and X-Men. I found the deaths of Xavier and Cyclops to be simply dumbfounding.. it was very effective but still slightly distracting.. like these are possibly 2 of THE most important X-Men and to cut them off so abruptly is somewhat disrespectful. As I said before though.. this proved to be very effective in shocking the audience because NO-ONE saw it coming. I was very happy with the role of Beast in this movie.. I found Grammar to portray him very convincingly and his role in the fighting scene was exceptional - much like the Beast we have grown to love from the comics. Once again Magneto was amazing, and although taking up a lot of space, Storm was simply incredible to watch. Her character and powers received a lot of credit, credit which was lacking in the first 2 films. I found Phoenix to be very convincing, and the Exorcist-type costume & make-up design really emphasised her powerful & otherworldly nature. I was disappointed with Angel.. purely because he played little or no role at all in the movie. If anything he is symbolic, but such an interesting character should have served more purpose. Colossus also suffers from limited airtime, and Jubille (although appearing in the movie briefly) is given less time then an even more minor character in Kitty Pryde (it can be argued that Kitty's role in the movie is simply to provide tension between Bobby and Rogue, & to provide the basis for Rogue's taking the mutant cure). Much can be also be said for the villains of the movie, for example Juggernaught and Multiple Man. Both their roles appear to be purely comical, and although the scenes in which they appear are vital it simply was not enough airtime. The omission of Gambit purely because an actor refused to play him is ridiculous, & the omission of Nightcrawler after he played such an amazing role in the previous film is simply a crime. The actual X-Men ""team"" consists of Iceman, Wolverine, Storm, Beast, Colossus and Kitty Pryde, but only 2 of these take the spotlight. Gambit and Nightcrawler would have added authentication to the team & would have been welcomed by loyal X-Men fans such as myself. Overall I think the film is trying to provide for both die-hard fans and those who know very little about the X-Men, and so therefore cannot please everyone.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1306,jeremycl,Would rather it ended with a sequel,1,26 May 2006,"Unbelievably disappointing. The rumors about the director made me nervous but I though surely with the same writers and producers it couldn't be that bad. It was. I noticed things going terrible wrong when I realized that I had been sitting in the theater for ninety minutes completely bored out of mind and knew that there wasn't enough time for this movie to have any type of resolution or redemption. As excited as I have been in the build up for this movie about the new characters and just more X-men action, the new characters were underdeveloped and a waste of the short amount of time of the movie. The story was boring, slow, and had no respect for the fan base who grew up on the comic books and the Saturday cartoons from years ago- Actually it had no respect for someone who walked in off the street with nine dollars to pay for a movie. It seemed that the actors who had grown ""to big for their britches"" and wouldn't be involved with the movie anymore decided to hold the writers at gun-point if they didn't get rid of their character in some form or fashion. Even the action in the movie (which all five minutes of actual action made it into the trailers) was mediocre at best. If I wanted to watch a drama I would have bought a ticket for a Lindsay Lohan movie. We wanted to see characters that we have grown to know and love in an action movie where good wins over evil. I'm still waiting for that movie. I have loved X-Men since I was a child, I think I would rather watch ""The Hulk"" again than watch this disappointment another time. Thanks for letting us down Marvel.... and ""Rush Hour"" director guy, go play in traffic.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1307,JSorenson,XMen3 review,6,26 May 2006,"As a huge comic book fan, i tend to watch movies based on their properties on two levels, one as a fan of the original source material, and two, as a fan of film itself. On many comic themed message boards, director Brett Ratner has been accused of not respecting the original XMen comics, which i found to be completely untrue. Nevermind that Ratner is a self-professed X-Fan, the entirety of XMen3 is a massive Fangasm payoff for fans of the comic. The whole movie is chock full of fan geek out moments, and a couple really good ""Holy @#$%....I cant believe that just happened"" plot twists. Thus, X3 gets my whole-hearted recommendation for fans of the comic. But as most of the movie going public are not comic book readers, they might find this movie somewhat disappointing. The first two XMen films were sci-fi/action masterpieces, the third film in the trilogy (im reasonably certain the series is intended to be a trilogy) is an out and out comic book film, So expect a few hokey and over the top moments. I think that the overall story was great, but the plot itself felt a little rushed through. The filmmakers were trying to cram a lot of material into an under 2 hour film and unfortunately it shows. I surmise that the DVD will have plenty of deleted and extended scenes. For this XMen outing, the cast has been extended considerably, allowing for a lot of great scenes, which unfortunately come at the expense of any in depth character and plot development. Also, though we've seen many of these characters in previous XFilms, little or no explanation is given as to how they've found themselves in the spotlight so suddenly. I almost felt as though i was joining the movie already in progress. The movie left me wanting more, but what I wanted more of should have been in the self-same movie. So, in conclusion, X3 gets a 6.5 out of 10. It's good, but fails to live up to the high water mark left by Singer's films. If you're a long time XFAn....definitely see it, if you want a big budget, popcorn munching good time, go see it. But if you want a worthy end to an epic science fiction saga, you may find yourself disappointed.",X-Men - The Last Stand

For whatever the reason, they just do not follow the actual story lines of the comics at all in this movie. Its almost like they just took a bunch of X-Men comic book characters and just rewrote stories for all of them opposed to using the stories in the comics. The movie even gets to a point towards the end where you sort of go ""why don't they just do 'this'"" I won't say what happens, but lets just say I was really disappointed with they way they handled some of the main characters in this movie. The only plus is that they had a lot of new X-Men brought in that most of us would be familiar with, however, once again, their story lines don't match up with the comics.

1311,e-hodges,...what can I say really...,4,26 May 2006,"To put it simply it's an OK film. Lots of new characters, a lot of content and some really big explosions but it all seems like they've only done it for the sake of having lots of new characters, a lot of content and some really big explosions. If this was the first in the trilogy it would seem a lot better, but they've really taken a step back with this one.The weakest link in all this is Simon Kinberg. He shouldn't be allowed to write screenplays, I mean given the fact that his previous work includes Mr. and Mrs. Smith and xXx 2. If anything he should be charged with crimes against cinema. Plus you can really tell that Brett Ratner wasn't anyone's first choice to be director. It's not that he's bad at what he does, he just doesn't do it very well either.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The story was absolutely horrible, and the fact that they strayed so far away from the comics was absolutely gut-wretching.I want my money back.

Though largely true to the comics, the plot takes a decidedly depressing tone that had movie-goers in the showing I attended exiting the theatre before the credits had even rolled. Those expecting a film that would showcase the X-men at the height of their strength and heroism were shocked and angered to see that the movie focused more on the organization's inevitable decline, trotting out tired clichés about how ideals survive their creators. While the special effects and action scenes were noteworthy, this was not enough from a series whose hallmarks have long been the sharp social insight and poignant personal narratives of the main characters. Lacking all the crisp one-liners and thought-provoking ethical conundrums that made its predecessors so much fun to watch, X-men: The Last Stand is like the proverbial train wreck  though you'd like to look away you feel compelled to keep watching through its inexorable end.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1316,Amaranth005,I cannot believe this!!!!!AKA I did not like the movie.,7,26 May 2006,"This movie, as my vote indicates, was absolutely awful. I cannot believe they would go this way with the story. I cannot recall much of this new storyline in any of the parts of the show or the comics that I have seen, heard of, or otherwise have in any way experienced. It very much seems like they were trying way, way, way too hard to make this movie different from most anything in the X-men world whatsoever. There did seem to be some times where they tried to be traditional, but over all, there seemed to be only one scene that was in anyway resembling traditional X-men style. I may be a little old fashioned, but all in all, I was just flat out excited about this movie, but I left being excited about telling all of my friends how I couldn't believe what they had done. Granted, if this movie is gearing up for another X-men movie with some kind of futuristic storyline spin-off where the third movie turns out to be one of those crazy alternate realities that cable or bishop lives in, then I guess it could redeem itself slightly, but don't use the whole third movie for that. I must agree with many of the comments that I have already read as well that state that many of the characters were unjustly tampered with.

I will have to go watch the old Fox cartoon episodes to make up for the stuff I have seen. God please save Brett Ratner. I hope they make a fourth to redeem this third installment. I thought Juggernaut wasn't a mutant? He got close to that little boy and lost his power. They should have tried to keep it around the same storyline as the comics. It took years for people to evolve into mutants and mere seconds to change them right back into normal humans. It's like watching Terminator 3. It was better off without a third.

They have said this is the last movie and I hope it is. Ratner decides to trash some of the best characters in the series. I found it very offensive that he could come on and just destroy characters that he is probably completely clueless about.SPOILER*** He kills off Cyclops (very early on) and Professor X (about a third of the way through). Trashes Mystique, Rogue, and then delivers a really STUPID ending. The government is trying to ""cure"" mutants, when Magneto threatens, the President decides to eradicate any mutants that oppose them. Then Magneto and his brotherhood kills a ton of soldiers, destroys the Golden Gate bridge, then it's like okay, all is forgiven, everything is peaches and cream. Right. So when the mutants blow out a couple of windows the President decides to stop them by any means necessary. The mutants then kill dozens/hundreds of US Army personnel but then it's over and apparently everyone kissed and made up. So the Brett Ratner theory is blowing out windows is bad, killing a hundred or so members of the military is no problem.I really, really hated him killing off Cyclops and Professor X. For no apparent reason. All he had to do was read a few comic books to figure out how you can accomplish things without killing off main characters. It really bugs me that they take a property like X-men and put it in the hands of a hack like Ratner then let him flush it down the toilet. If he wanted to make a movie and kill off a bunch of people why didn't he make an original movie? Why take a group someone else created and just squash them.I hope this movie bombs, I hope Ratner never gets near any story I have actually read or heard off.

1319,mhargett13,this movie was bunk,1,26 May 2006,"The director tried too hard to make a blockbuster movie, and instead made blockbuster flop. He relied to heavy on special effects to drive the movie. The basis of the story hinged on the shoulders of Wolverine, who is an awesome character played by an awesome actor. But the movie should not have been carried by him alone. there were several other characters that could have been rounded out better and had a more central role. IceMan for instance, should have IceManned-Up and confronted Pyro in the last battle scene instead of having to be told by Wolverine to go take care of his old school chum. That fight scene was horrible in and of itself. so much more could have been done with that. The saving grace of the movie, if there is one, would be seeing Kelsey Grammar as Beast. He did a wonderful job and was even believable in the fight scenes, if it was him and not a stunt double. All-in-all, i will not be buying this when released to video.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Many said the cure was only temporary and i believe it was definitely true and the real villains haven been appeared yet! for example the sinister and spocalypse... the 1st 3 movies is about confrontation and mutant rights X men in comics have made their marks of superheros so they haven got a chance to display their superhero acts... X men is a forever thing you cant just make it history and Hollywood shouldn't have the tradition of stopping at 3rd movie there is still a lot more that the 3 movies didn't cover i hope this will be the end of a trilogy and the start of the new one i know wolvernine and magneto movie are already in the planning i really hope fox and marvel will start discussing on X men 4!

It had many surprises in it that I never thought could have happened and the action was great, not to mention it was much darker than the first two. This movie was more like the comics than the others, which may have been why I liked to so much. The characters had been developed enough in the first two movies that they could be thrown into a plot and not have to worry as much about developing their personalities. I thought Wolverine was more like the comic book Wolverine in x3, which was nice to see, and their explanation for the Phoenix was reasonable. All in all, it was an amazing movie and gave me shivers at many points.Oh yes, watch to the end of the credits. There's a surprise there. ^_~",X-Men - The Last Stand
1322,blue_eyes17,what were they thinking,2,26 May 2006,this was the worst of the three movies as a matter of fact this was the worst movie that I've seen all year i was looking forward to this movie for 2 years now and i see it in theaters and it was a piece of garbage... what were they thinking making this movie like this the plot was so stupid it does line up with the comics and i wouldn't really care that much if it was a good movie... but its not... i didn't like this movie but i encourage everyone to see this movie so you can decide for themselves obviously some people liked it but i did not enjoy the plot or the details or the directors change... i did like the fact that they used storms powers a little more and i thought the beasts part was played very well... thats about it,X-Men - The Last Stand
1323,kingjer151,Very nicely done.,8,26 May 2006,"Well there was so much doubt about this movie and it is finally out. In my opinion they did a good job. We start the movie with Charles and Eric going to Jeans house to bring her to the school. We then skip to the future and it seems that the X-MEN are training. Awesome indeed. Scott seems to be a depressive state and is also getting messages from Jean. He leaves to go to the lake where she died. We also find out that a cure has been produced. Magneto has found out and is furious. Cyclops gets to the lake and Jean is still contacting him. In a furious rage he blasts into the lake and wakes Jean up. He seems ecstatic but well -------. Back at the mansion Hank informs them of the cure and in storms word ""Theres nothing to cure. Nothings wrong with us."" Xavier feels that something is wrong and tells Storm and Wolverine to get to the Lake. They find Jean and get her back to the mansion. Then we learn what the truth is. To protect Jean from getting out of control Xavier needed to put psychic blocks on her. Unfortunately she has broken free of them and he needs to put them back up. Before he can do this she gets away. I think this is where I will stop. The movie gives us a good character development with all the mutants that were there before. There really is no sense in bringing more mutants into the equation and getting us confused. No matter what people say. I think seeing the mutants that were in the movie was fine. Everyone get their fill. Of course the movie didn't follow the original story of Phoenix merging with Jean and going into space and everything. I think the reason why Ratner didn't do all of that was because of budget and it would have been way too CG'd and taken the quality away. I am a believer of the comic book I know the stories. This was a good adaptation.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1324,jonathan_addis,"Too much material, too little time....... LOTS of filler no thriller.....",4,26 May 2006,"I want to keep this short. I have been a fan of the past two movies and own them in my DVD collection. Now, films must be really good to make it to my collection. -- Opinion granted -- On with my take: I sat through a standard ""Good vs. Evil"" battle scene for one hour and forty-five minutes. Lots of crashing and bashing and fire and ice and people running and screaming and lots and lots of....nothing. Not substance in any of the characters. Do not expect to be entertained with an explanation of a new character. No history of how they became the way that they are. No real story here. Just a bunch of previously introduced characters and a lot of simplicity. I would state that the entire movie was predictable but I'd be lying. Only 10% of the film wasn't predictable. (for instance the scene AFTER the credits) Screen Play: just that ""screen play"". It's almost as if this third installment was simply a ""filler"" or a ""bridge"" (no pun) to keep X Men alive.Maybe the forth installment will bring respect back to a great comic series.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1325,phatalphie,disappointment,1,26 May 2006,"I was bored. I didn't like the character developments, one of which where the character was the brother of the other character and they didn't even acknowledge each other. It was a waste of time for me. I also didn't like the ""horror-like"" look of Phoenix. It made it almost scary and in doing do limited the viewers(younger children) who became fans with Xmen2.I know Xmen 2 contained violence. But overall, I feel the family could watch it. This one was the opposite. I am not a comic book fan but I did follow the cartoon. The director said every scene came from the comic books, but I am not so sure. Especially with the people who died.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1326,triquetra_1329,This Movie Was THE BEST EVER!!!!!!,10,26 May 2006,"OMG I loved this movie sooo much. I'm so happy to see Storm with some more action. It wasn't one of those where the good guys always win which I thought was awesome it sort of ended with both sides losing. Pheonix was AWESOME. I'm happy to see Cyclops out of the way in this movie, he was in it to much in the other ones which made it no fun because he is so boring. I thought it was cool how they had the sentinels in it along with the danger room all together. I thought it was kind of bogas though that Rogue gave up her powers. Over all it was a great movie especially how they ended it with Magneto still having his powers right at the end. Which opens it up for another movie!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1327,frogger581,"Yes, the line can be crossed well",10,26 May 2006,"This only has spoilers for the insightful. I just saw the film after sitting on my hands for about 2 years aching for some closure. I saw, and after texting my sister in a mass freakout, i came to this site and was appalled by all the nay-saying. Anyone who simultaneously loves the x-men empire and loves cinema would have to realize that this movie could not have gone any other way. It was building, something had to happen. Yah people you like would have to die. No you can not understand the all of the personality facets of a cast this size, including the principles, in the meager dialogue during an action film plot progression. yes some things will change. No some things will not gel with the characters we grew up with in the cartoon and the several comic incarnations. To get it all right there would need to be as many films as comic books and none of us have the wallets for that. for those who have yet to see the film please keep these points in mind. this is how you make a harry potter caliber series (or LOTR for those who need that parallel), not a scary movie series. if anything consider the film series as a spin-off, as Venom to spider-man. this movie is not another ewok f-up, as some have tried to paint it. you just have to realize that movies make you happy, films may or may not. So quit looking for the happy sappy perfect bow tied ending in a film that illustrates the natural conflicts of life in a supernatural setting. its as useless as trying to smile at the end of Schindler's list.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1328,Joshblade1,Another Batman and Robin worthy sequel.,1,26 May 2006,"Not as bad as bat-nipples...but this is still the ""Street Fighter"" of X-men movies. I swear this is just too much ""awful"" for one movie......Just breath....::breathes deeply::..Ok...Let me just state that there were really just three things wrong with this movie...two REALLY BROAD things: -First, lack of continuity with the source material(be it the movies or the comics). In super hero movies, the source material should be at least respected. This movie took a crap on it. I'm sorry but killing Cyclops and Xavier in the first 25 minutes was NOT a good move. To the X-men of the comic universe, these are probably the two most important characters EVER to the storyline. I don't feel like going into why because if you're not familiar with the X-men comic you won't care and if you are then why do I have to explain it. This movie was a poorly cut hodge-podge of random 2 dimensional characters with the same names and powers as their comic book counterparts...but w/ little more in common. Just an example, the juggernaut...although I did enjoy his one-liner, is not a 6 ft British guy for comic relief. And even worse, even Xavier's character was completely off. -Second, even as a stand alone, the script was garbage. The script writer's need to be shot. I hate them...and I hope they read this. I know one of the two guys also helped write X2, but he clearly was the bad one. The script was 2 dimensional, the characters were like shadows of their former selves in the previous films.... You know what? I'm afraid I just can't do justice to how bad this was. At best this was a B film that tried to make up for the loss of character depth with flashy explosions. The idiots thought that by killing off important characters and trying to stick to this whole ""mutant cure"" thing that people would be touched emotionally. They wanted to get the audience riveted by taking out characters they had come to like. It failed. If you're going to make a cruddy comic based movie...make sure you don't peeve the fans off. And if you don't care about the fans..at least try and tell a decent story. In conclusion, you guys who made this suck and I hope bad things happen to you.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1329,grilled-cheese,Horrible Rush and Story Butchering,1,26 May 2006,"I just got back from watching this movie and had to rant somewhere.Do Not Go See This Movie!! Marvel allowed this movie to be a travesty to the entire x-men series. The movie was poorly written, didn't follow very much of the X-men backstory, and seemed to be aimed towards just making a third movie to make a third movie to try and wrap the entire series up. For those of you who know about the Phoenix Saga and after seeing the Phoenix in the second movie, you will be horribly disappointed as they ignored that backstory completely and butchered it. The only thing the movie had going for it was that it is completely action packed. Problem with that is their obsession about trying to put so much action in it ruined the story. I'm trying hard not to spoil this for anybody, but just to warn that this movie is not worth the money.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I mean maybe i'm a bit of a marvel nerd but um... if you know who and you know who die then what abt their kids Nate Grey, Nate summer(Cable) and the others, and what Havoc(I forget his real name oh yea Alex) will he never meet Scott, more confusion the Pheonix burned ppl and things yet i saw no fire, and urm basically no not even the outline of a bird, oh they completely ignore the fact that Professor X and Juggernaut are brothers or half brothers. its really a good movie but have soo many questions, oh well maybe they'll make a part 4 where some how the important ppl how dies come back and life goes back to normal x-men story line or something.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1331,vaan6,unhappy in hotlatanta,3,27 May 2006,"i have collected this book ever since i was 7 years old. i spent every dime i had on all of the back issues and eventually ended up with every book and parallel book they made. this to say that they are more like people i grew up with, more so than characters in a book. to make these series of movies, and blatantly change the history, time line, as well the characters is a travesty. for example, rogue had much more spunk, storm more of an edge etc... i can appreciate them making a story to bring to the screen for all of the people who were not particularly fans of the book but had seen the cartoon, but why should we have to conform to them, they should have had to conform to us! you make a movie for those who are loyal to it, meaning they should have did everything the way it really was, we would have been forgiving for a little mistake here and there but after x3 i literally sat there a whole half hour, stuck in my seat, disgruntled about the horrible storyline. they had the ability to set up the making of 3 of the best movies ever with the phoenix saga, which would have equaled everyone wanting to see annakin grow into darth vader, but they have ruined it for true fans like myself and others like me. please please please, do not see this movie if you are true to the xmen u will be verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyy unhappy. however, if u are some sap who just wants to take your date to another good action flick, this is your movie, just wish someone would have told me ahead of time... love ya self",X-Men - The Last Stand
1332,KEnshinhimuraxxx,why this movie sucks,10,27 May 2006,it ruins all that is and ever will be X-Men. Jean dieing is OK since it happened like a billion times in the comic but she kept somehow being revived and then eventually cloned. but Scott no that never happens and prof. X that was the most F$*%ed up thing i ever saw. screw the movie. since when is Juggernaught a mutant? he is a god damn human who used the magic of the Cryotax or whatever gem to become a human with immense durability and stenghth That is known as the Juggarnaught. AND HE IS Prof.X's Brother who is out to get him. IF only i could lower my score to a -50. the plot it is horrible and needs to be killed. YEt people still like it and that is cause them do not know any better. They never read the old comic book or know anything about X-men the is cause people will watch anything with good special effects. but that does not matter if the story sucks beyond all belief and is horrendously stupid and makes no sense what so ever....,X-Men - The Last Stand

1334,bmagada,Like burning the Mona Lisa,1,27 May 2006,"Cyclops dies in the first ten minutes. They kill Xavier. They chastise Magneto. Kittie beats the Juggernaut(whom is now a mutant somehow). The only thing Colossus does is throw Wolverine. Angel does nothing. Wolverine and Jean are the only characters that get any real face time. Oh yeah they make Logan cry like a bitch. All other spaces in the movie are filled with melodrama. I miss Bryan Singer. Excuse me while I go try to find my soul, because this movie ripped it out. This is why trilogies suck. I went in with so much hope for this movie. As a movie it was good but it felt off when compared to the source material. If they were just gonna make a Wolverine then they should have done so. It seemed like the only X-men they focused on were Wolverine and Jean Grey. Lets not forget about Cyclops dying. Nobody on the team seemed to care. The only time when anyone cared is after Jean dies and you see his headstone at the end. They even have the Xavier's funeral without even saying anything about his death. As said earlier if you like movies with death and pretty fx it's alright. If you are truly an x-men fan in any respect you will never see this movie. Oh yeah and after the credits they show Xavier come back from the dead in the body of some comatose guy they were talking about earlier in the film.

How could anyone directing or editing a movie with such a built in rabid fan base let something like that slip? And to kill off so many characters... it just seemed like they made the movie to put some sort of closure on the franchise. How DARE you reduce Magneto to an old man playing chess in the park and Mystique as a whiny turn coat!!! It seemed like this movie totally crapped on the characters and the fans of the X-men universe. The special effects were great and I loved that Storm got more chances to let loose, but it didn't make up for a bad story and a horrible ending. Also, 6 X-men going to fight a bunch of Mad Max rejects seemed really tacky. Brett Ratner should stick to making movies with funny black men and incoherent Asian men.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1336,phatboi22,Ruined,1,27 May 2006,"Xmen was a great comic and a great cartoon. I grew up like many people loving this awesome show. I understood why you couldn't follow the history of the Xmen exactly, but the story you came up with was just crap. Killing Jean Grey, Cyclops and Prof X was uncalled for. The comics and cartoon gave heaps of great story ideas that could easily have been adapted to movie format. Now there is no chance to redeem yourself, because you killed some of the main characters. Anything in the future will be hollow - fruit of a poisonous tree. I loved the first two movies. Although not ""historically"" correct, the essence was there. I have never posted any comment to anything, ever. But this had to be said. You unnecessarily ruined Xmen. I wish money was not the only motivator. There are fans that love this stuff, and I know I could have written a better storyline myself - and my self-esteem sucks.

1337,Tylers_tardis,x-men 3 the last stand the movie of the year,10,27 May 2006,"I just don't know of to sum it all up, maybe like Director Brett Ratner has done in the final movie of the trilogy. Well i went to see it on the first day it came out and how glad i was i did that. The effects are super and well crafted and there is action after action in every scene. The actors played the roles with character especially storm who character was not expressed in the last two films as well as this one. The story kept you at the edge of your set for the hole movie.However one point I would want to make is why they killed of some of the main character in the X-MEN like Professior X and Jean Gray and Cyclops, but this bought new character into the x-men like Shadow Cat aka Kitty Pride played by Ellen Page a great young actor.This was the best film out of the three of them which bought this great series to a fantastic end and this movie is a must see, so once you read this review run out where ever you are and go to the nearest cinema and watch X-MEN 3 the last stand now to trigger the war to end all wars!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1338,AllardiusMaximus,A great movie,8,27 May 2006,"Okay. Before I saw this movie, I had read numerous reviews on it. Some said that it was bad. Some said said that it was good. I had to make my own assumption. After seeing it, I can honestly say I loved X-Men The Last Stand. Yes the story was kinda simple and the characters weren't as fleshed out as in the other two X-Men movies, but it was great nonetheless. It did have some other downsides to it. The main one I think was that it didn't follow the comic book closely. But don't be nitpicking the entire movie otherwise you're not going to have a fun time. Just go there and watch the movie. It also left way for maybe a sequel or two (I'm not going to spoil anything. Just watch after the credits). It was a fitting end to this X-men trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1339,alisonbambury,A great movie-as long as your not an Xmen freak!,9,27 May 2006,"X-Men 3 is so worth seeing in the theater. I have no idea why other people are so terribly upset. If you don't mind seeing a movie for a movie then go see it. Remember this is a movie based on a comic book which means it doesn't have to be EXACT! The special effects were great. It was awesome to see a lot of wolverine and who cares if he's got some corny lines. Things now a days are so serious it's nice to laugh-even in an action film. I must say though everyone assumes Cylcops is dead. Did we actually see that happen? Did we see anything that would indicate 100% he's dead no. So for all of you comic book nuts.. just because someone ""dies"" without seeing a body or knowing for sure- you never know. I hope they do make a next X-men. I will be first in line to see it. Anyone reading this, please if your not an Xmen comic book nut, please see the movie, I promise you won't be that sadly disappointed!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1340,slayer201277,Excellent Third Installment!,8,30 May 2006,"I have read a lot of reviews on forums and on websites and a lot of negative comments were that there was no heart in the film - well this is dead wrong! Although Cyclops was terribly underused and I think a lot of Wolverines scenes should really have been him, the few scenes show a lot of emotion and showed a lot of passion for Jean. I was a little concerned therefore when Jean does what she does.After that it was a roller-coaster of thrills and even genuine chills as the Dark Phoenix emerges - at first I was disappointed at the lack of Phoenix Effect but the effects they used for Phoenix were great - Very Dark Willow from Buffy!! And all I will say is there were a number of sniffs at the end of the Grey residence scene in the cinema.Storm was much much better in this instalment and although I still feel Halle Berry is too weak a personality for her we do see some of Storm's steel in her - especially in the second fight with Callisto.Other characters didn't really develop and this is the only real negative I have - I think Colossus says something like 2 lines, Mystique and Rogue both were pretty much bit parts - although apart from Kitty calling Vinnie Jones a ""Dick Head"" Mystique had one of the best lines when she is being interrogated. Other mutants came and went more as tips of the hat for comic fans rather than bringing anything to the story.The Last stand will have you covered in goose bumps as the X-Men draw a line against the brotherhood in the end scenes and when Dark Phoenix finally goes completely postal all I will say is WOW! The soundtrack I was excellent and the scene in the house gave you a sense of urgency and even after the second time of watching it and knowing what was going to happen it still made me sit on the edge of my seat! Comic fans may be upset at the fact that the original story was changed so much, but I am a massive Phoenix fan and I am glad that they took such an excellent fresh approach to Dark Phoenix. I just wish they would have been braver and kept Cyclops instead of opting for the more popular Wolverine.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1341,GimmeShelter92,Ups And Downs,5,27 May 2006,"This movie is incredibly inconsistent, the story is quite good but the dialogue is terrible, mainly because of the cheesy one-liners. Some of the acting is good, (I think Kelsey Grammar was perfect as Beast), but some is bad (I'm not going to mention any names). The movie seems to rely on the visual effects and incredibly loud soundtrack to keep it afloat, whereas the screenplay drags it down. The majority of Brett Ratner's directing was alright, though in some places I think it could have been better. Despite it's flaws, the movie is strangely enjoyable, probably because it has been so long since X2, if the movie were released any earlier, it probably would have been less enjoyable.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1342,vvenk002,"good CG, awful story",6,27 May 2006,"ALthough the special effects were quite mesmerizing, that can be only expected from the third installment of a hugely successful franchise in this day and age. Being a huge fan of the comic I think it was awesome that we could finally see characters like beast, angel and colossus in live action, still i don't think the film highlighted their powers enough. Kelsey grammar was perfect for the role of hank McCoy, but i think the movie took away from the key elements of x-men (multi-cultural characters - couldn't colossus have been Russian instead of American? the cold war is over you know...) and deviated from the comics WAY too much in terms of storyline. the direction was shitty too; i know Hugh Jackman's wolverine wasn't exactly the bad ass he was supposed to be in the last two movies, but he's a real wad in this one, total wuss. this film also lacked some of that zingy humor that was present in the previous two. whatever that was supposed to be funny just came out lame and sounded like it should have been in a Van Damme flick. I think Brett Ratner was an awful choice for director, considering that he owes his career to Jackie Chan and didn't really make anything that great aside from the rush hour movies (which were only good because Jackie's the MAN and tucker is naturally a hilarious). I understand that you can't cram in decades worth of comic book storyline into a feature length movie, but the last two movies definitely did a better job. On the whole: cheesy and lame story, good choice of characters (maybe more interesting baddies would have been nice, the good choices were Juggernaut and shadow cat).",X-Men - The Last Stand
1343,johndangelo86,X men 3 opinion,5,27 May 2006,"X-Men The Last Stand was a good attempt to bring the Marvel super heroes to the big screen. Of the three it contains the best acting and finally some of the mutants fly. However the sequel, X2 X-Men United remains the strongest of the trilogy. There were some very good things about the movie such as Famke Janssen's performance of Phoenix, Storm was a lot stronger and some of the mutants looked like their comic book counterparts (Iceman who appears fully in ice!). Kitty Pryde rocked in the movie as did Beast. They finally did get one character right and that was the Beast, he was awesome during the fighting scene. The Phoenix was really the saving grace of the movie, the scene in her childhood house was brilliant and Storm finally flew and used lightning through her hands (very exciting!) However there are some problems. If they wanted to give Storm a edgier new hair style why not just give her the mo-hawk. Also, they put second rate villains from the comic into the movie such as Arclight and Callisto. Since this is the last movie why not use Emma Frost and Omega Red or Quick Silver and the Scarlett Witch. Psylocke the mutant with psi blades was just a joke. She absolutely did nothing and they didn't even show her true powers, what a waste of a fantastic character! Why didn't they put her on the x men team, I mean she could have been an older student of Charles Xavier's like the Beast was. And the running time of the movie was just too SHORT! I am a huge fan of the comics and though it seems like I didn't like the movie, I was happy with the final product. Lastly, since this is the last movie, this should have been the time for mutant cameos. Mutants like Emma Frost, Gambit, Polaris, Sage, X 23, Bishop, Forge, Cable, Dazzler, Dust, Stepford Cuckoos and Apocalypse should have been shown in at least in one scene and why didn't they put Jubilee on the team, I mean the character was in all the films and she did nothing, you don't even see her powers (that deleted scene on the X2 DVD does not count!) The mutants cameos they did just plain sucked! I mean who really likes Spike, and some guy who can grow his arms back and a guy listed in the credits as Lizaed Man.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Considering all the hype and media play on this movie, I was quite disappointed in the 3rd sequel to X-men. Granted I have been a X-men comic fan since the 1st issue arrived. I understood the plot but I did not like the development of the existing and new mutants on the scene. The dialog was weak. I am uncertain of the individuals that previewed this movie and decided to give a good rating. They probably were not your die hard X-men fans. I must say at least the fighting scenes were OK with a few laughs here and there but nothing to indicate it was worth paying your money at the cinema.

It was only 104 minutes, it should have been longer, and in that extra time they could have explained more of what was going on. I loved the first 2 movies, but I thought they could have had more battles in them, and once i saw the third one, i saw that they were better, because without all the dialogue, it's too jumpy and instead of telling you more about it, they go into a battleThings they could have done better 1.) introduced kitty a little better, she wasn't even a minor character in the first 2, and now she is bumped up to fight on the team 2.)WHERE DID NIGHTCRAWLER GO???? he never died in second one, he didn't show up at all in third, there's a problem. 3.) whats the point of having angel in the movie when he doesn't even fight, all he did was save his father at the end and disappeared. 4.)Why did Rogue do it, i don't think she should have gave up her powers, she would have been cool in the final battle. 5.)Cyclops dies??? he was barely in it before he died, disappointing 6.)Mystique, I like the fact that she saved magneto, but she shouldn't have lost her powers, and magneto just left her, not nice!I did like the intense rivalry between Storm and Calisto, there battles were real good, and amazing when storm fried her! - Jug was a good ad in to the brotherhood - I was upset that Xavier died, but they did it in a good way, and they clip after credits was shocking! - Colossus role was goo, because he didn't play a main character, and he shouldn't have had, since he isn't that known to marvel - Liked how they tricked Magneto, and took away his powers - Liked the battle between Iceman and Pyro and that Bobby finally got to the cool looking iceman, the one made of ice. -Liked how Storm stepped up and this movie and finally kicked ass and flew!!I am also skeptical about how those run-offs of wolverine and magneto will do, i don't think they will be that good, i think if they want to do another movie, make another xmen, number 4. And if they did, Mystique rogue and magneto should all have powers back and Xavier should be alive.

Knowing that I liked the Rings trilogy, Spiderman, etc., my daughter suggested the X-Men series. I loved the first two, so much so that I saw The Last Stand on opening day. In a nutshell - I LOVED IT. I'm sure that if I was a comic book geek (sorry, a comic book die-hard), I would find plenty to criticize. I've read some of their negative comments and must admit that I watched the first and second installments this weekend to gain some insight into their discontent. While these are awesome movies that do take plenty of time to develop the characters and the plot lines, I had no problem being able to get up from time to time to take a break to attend to nature, etc. (just as I did in the movie theater when I first saw them). However, when it comes down to hold onto your seat, non-stop action, there is no comparison between the first two and #3. OK, as a former post so pointedly points out - when they are on the bridge, it is daytime and then several scenes later it appears to switch to nighttime - silly me, I thought it had to do with the power of darkness! Guess that's what happens when you just enjoy the movies for what they are - a lot of fun. I'll be going back to the theater soon to watch #3 again.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1347,pooh3811,Hated it,1,27 May 2006,"Jean Grey kills Scott? So they are in love, she dies, he is falling to pieces, she comes back to life, they kiss, then she kills him??? Why? Just to get rid of him so she can have Wolverine? I thought she was a medical doctor, so in addition to killing the guy even though she loves him, she goes against all her medical training to kill him. Oh wait did Ratner think he had a Hannibal Lector thing going? Okay so they wanted to get rid of him, but then why does she kill the Professor? She doesn't want him trying to ""help"" her okay, but why not just turn him into a bloody mess, or knock him against the wall so he winds up in a coma? Instead she turns him into confetti? What the heck was that? Then after the mutants tear up the city, the president just changes his mind and the mutants are okay again? To the point where the guy with wings can just fly around in the park and no one even looks up? Some how I don't think most the presidents we have had would just live and let live. If I was a resident of San Francisco I wouldn't be too happy that the terrorist who tore up the city where allowed to go on their merry way. Was Ratner trying to suggest how Osama Bin Laden should have been dealt with? Just kiss and make up? I don't understand it. I don't understand why people could think this is a good movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1348,quatre03-1,Great Stuff for an X-men Fan,8,27 May 2006,"First off, if you're hoping it would follow the comic. you're going to be disappointed. Still a great story, especially if you look back and take all 3 movies as part of the story. There were a few things i didn't like about the movie. #1 the juggernaut is treated like a mutant, and he's actually very anti-mutant. so when he gets near leech, just like any other mutant his power dissipate. #2 the story is left very open ended possible for future movies, or a new comic series, i don't know, but some of the characters that died have keep parts in the original time line, and by killing them it's ruined all of the rest of that. #3 there was no solid character development with any of the new characters, i would have liked to know where multiple man was from and the juggernaut(even though i already know). #4 the scenes seemed very fast paced probably due to the lack of character development. and finally #5 I'm not really sure if i saw any one die in this movie. they hint at it, but the clip post credits keeps me guessing.It's still a great time, worth seeing. lots a great cameos. don't be overly critical, they've ruined the comic time line and story line since the first scene in the first movie",X-Men - The Last Stand
1349,binsanfran,Movie was freakin terrible,2,27 May 2006,"I loved the first two movies, and I'm sorry to say this doesn't compare. While the plot line seems like it may have been a good idea.. the actual content is rotten. The writing of the storyline and characters was worthy of a third princess diaries movie. The actors did the best they could with what they had. There were several things concerning the characters and mutants in general that suddenly changed with this movie. I can't stand it when a director changes the rules after two movies established them. Topping it off were the holes. This movie was FULL of them.. at any given moment you could say ""why would they do that when any idiot knows they should do this?"". For someone who didn't give a crap about the two previous movies and just wants an excuse to go out on a Saturday night.. more power to you. Anyone else though, prepare to be disappointed.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1351,luveternty,"Xmen The Last Stand, A disappointment",4,27 May 2006,"Where do I begin?? I was looking so forward to this movie coming out and here it is and I've finally seen it. Needless to say it wasn't worth the wait. I am very disappointed with the movie, and was ready to walk-out of the movie 30 minutes into it. Without giving away to much 5 main characters in this movie either die, or lose there powers. Most movies know you never kill off a main character especially ones that the movie franchise depend on. Yet they it, with not one not 1, not 2 but 5 mutants either dead of powerless, those left powerless might as well have died. On a different note the effects were very good, with tons of action. We finally see Storm/Ororo Munroe (Halle Berry) use her powers in every way imaginable, I guess they figured might as well since Halle has made it public even if the series continues she will no longer play the role. Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman) is still the mutant that gets the most air time in this trilogy, lucky for him since he is currently shooting a spin-off. Notably there are tons of new characters Like the Sexy Angel played by Ben Foster his shirtless scenes alone are worth entry to the movie. However just like the 1st two and now the third my favorite character and in my opinion the sexiest is Iceman/Bobby Drake (Shawn Ashmore). He is the perfect Iceman and If we are lucky he will get his own spin off.Over all the movie is action packed and worth at least seeing once. Kelsey Grammar playing Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast is enough reason, who would of thought he could pull it off. In the end seeing it once is by far enough. And thank the director Brett Ratner for destroying the trilogy with this final Stand..Grade = C",X-Men - The Last Stand
1352,jordanbromley,Excellent,10,27 May 2006,X-men 3 is the best in the trilogy although some parts were quite confusing like the bit after the credits when Charles talks out of the man after he had supposedly died (Charles) but i thought that the part with Juggernaut chasing after Kitty was quite funny when juggernaut called kitty a little b*** and kitty called juggernaut a d*** **** me and my friends couldn't stop laughing. It was a very enjoyable film and I am hoping that they will make X-MEN 4 but with apocalypse. :-) The Best Film In The SuperHero Industry also and excellent performance from all the actors and actresses. And Jean scared me when she was getting angry!!,X-Men - The Last Stand
1353,x_oyranoy,Disappointing... Last stand!,7,27 May 2006,"I just saw the film and I'm Bummed out :( First of all Phoenix killing Scott doesn't make sense, second she's supposed to be indestructible and she gets killed?! Also the professor?! That spoiled it for me. Though there were two hints leaving my imagination to guess that there is going to be a 4th movie? At the end Magneto after being cured is trying to move a Chess pone and he does it! so... And at the start of the movie Prof.X is teaching Ethics to the kids talking about transferring the conscience of a dying man to an ""empty"" mind-body (clinically dead) so I presume that when Phoenix started killing him he made the change as there was already an empty body (shown at the begging of the movie).I hope that a 4th movie will come as a Saviour for us fans!

1354,stellar_sojourn,New Fantastic Foursome& Then some--X-men,10,27 May 2006,"I beg to differ that ""X-men: The Last Stand"" is ""The worst of the X-men movies."" This film picked up, similar to the Back to the Future, Underworld, and the Star Wars series films, right where the last one left off.Jean Grey is dead(?), Magneto pushing for the supremacy of mutants over all ""normals,"" or Homo sapiens sapiens. Scott Summers is lost without his fiancée', and Wolverine isn't much better off. Professor X is still teaching though grieving over Jean, and student Rogue is jealous of Iceman/Bobby Drake's new-found friend, Kat/Kitty. And a possible ""cure"" for mutancy could prove more deadly in its application, than its cause.The details and spoilers are too much to list--you need to see the first two films to get in the point of view of this film. But once you have the background, sky is the limit in the telling, fast pacing and sheer fun of the story.Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Famke Janssen all stand out (though Phoenix's appearance and stay are all too brief). This is an ensemble cast film and all get their little moment. The best performance next to Storm (read more below) was Ian McKellan's Magneto. He simply is of award-winning caliber in this role, though like Gandalf, he will likely be awarded only fan immortality, in appreciation for his superior performance here. Sad to say that Mystique, Juggernaut, Pyro, even Spike and the absent Nightcrawler were either under-used or gone. My one beef with the story is that the President of the US didn't have domestic terrorism contingencies in place, including calling in other groups or superheroes in the Marvel universe (i.e., the Army's Damage Control Corps, Canada'a mutant group Alpha Flight, the Avengers; or by themselves, Iron Man, Thor, etc.).I am pleased though that the plot included a very big role for Halle Berry's character, Storm. This is crucial in the back story of the X-men, as Storm did indeed become the head mistress of the Xavier School, and leader of the X-men in the late 1980s, in the comics. Berry gave a balanced, even understated performance, leaving any doubts from ""Catwoman"" and other genre films aside. Her dignity and anchoring for Wolverine/Logan and Xavier's students was shown with respect, and didn't dumb things down for the action's sake. Halle Berry WAS Storm. Period.I look forward to the prospective prequel film ""Wolverine,"" and the rumored continuation of this fine series, which tops even Spider-Man for the best of the Marvel Films to date.Thanks for your attention and hope to hear from you on this fine film. Till later--stellar_sojourn.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1355,rmac1264,Third times the charm they say? Best to have left it at I and II,3,27 May 2006,"With X-men being marvel's first major comic blockbuster I'm sure they felt invincible with the release of this highly anticipated film. The franchise was great and we all know that and much like The Juggernaut nothing could get in its way. Unfortunately the harsh reality of the matter is X3 failed to deliver in so many different ways. I'm not here to come and bash the movie because I am absolutely LOVE X-men. I grew up with the comics and I watched the shows. Despite the storyline changes along the years this has to be the worst of them all hands down. How so you say? strap on your seat belt because I'm about to take you for a ride.((SPOILERS))-From the get go the story really never elaborates itself about what is happening. We get bits and pieces from Xavier about what's going on but by the time the story begins to warm up they kill off Xavier. To top that they kill off Cyclops in the first 10 minutes of the film. It seemed as if the none of the writers had time to pick up comic book. How do you kill off 2 of the original cast members of X-men and not even give it a second thought?-The main story in itself was flawed. Mutation was a change in the persons DNA, yet they have a supposed ""cure""? You can cure something that is ailing like a disease or a tumor but you can't if its imprinted in the person's DNA. For example babies who are born with mothers that do drugs while in term are born with withdrawals and unfortunately they have to deal with that for the rest of their lives. They can't simply go out and ask their DNA to be changed! Same can be applied to mutation, you can't CURE mutation in a person genes because it IS their genes. You can't change the DNA without the changing the person. -Majority of the dialog was straight forward but the witty and quirky remarks were somewhat absent at times. Believe me there were those moments that brought the house down (those who have seen the juggernaut know exactly what I'm talking about ) but it just didn't have the style charisma of X-men and X2. It looks like X-men but it doesn't FEEL like X-men and die hard fans will know exactly what I mean. With this movie being the ""LAST STAND"" and all you would assume that Ratner would introduced some of the more powerful mutants but none of them even show! I guess we'll have to settle for ""The Flea""Halle Barry herself said she would not sign on for X3 if Storm didn't have a more dynamic role in the movies. Her character does in the comic so I would assume with X3 they would finally be able to show some of storm's potential as a leader. Unfortunately she does pretty same thing in the other movies, change the weather and shock a couple of people. Unfortunately Storm is still portrayed as weak character. Though perhaps SLIGHTLY more stronger than the previous films but still weak none the less. In the comics Storm was almost considered godly, but this storm pales in comparison to her counter part.overall the movie is definitely watchable and enjoyable to certain extent but personally compared to the previous films it was a big let down and I hope they bring back Bryan Singer if marvel decided to release and X4. In a nutshell there wasn't enough story to prove that this was supposed to be ""THE LAST STAND"" or even close to it. Don't even get me started on the continuity errors. Only thing I truly enjoyed about this movie was the way they brought in the role of Juggernaut, despite him not even being a mutant in the first place.PS stay for an extra scene after the creditstill next time, game over for now.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1356,user-2465,True fans do not watch!!!,3,27 May 2006,"I am sorry for giving this movie such a bad review, but I feel it is my duty as a true fan of X-Men to tell how these directors and screenwriters got it wrong...Firstly, the character Rogue: this lady has been depicted throughout the entire trilogy as this sad and pathetic person, but in the comics and series she took another mutants powers (superstrong and able to fly) permanently and she was just this kick ass cool gal... Centuries apart from the rogue we meet in the movies. She decides to give up being a mutant? You must be joking!!! Secondly, the fact that some mutants goes all homo sapien on us, and the rest do the dance with the Grimm reaper: I truly don't understand why you would do something like this. Magneto is this awesomely powerful being, and I refuse to believe the plot about a drug that can cure mutants, it's just NOT believable! I can however believe you that this was the last movie, because everybody is dead, or they lost their powers??? Who is going to star in X4, maybe Kitty who will be running through walls the entire movie...Phoenix: I don't have words - killing Xavier and then turning everybody into little bits of atoms... can you say ""someones been smoking marijuana"" !!!! Marvel, please send out a notice distancing yourself from these people who made this movie, and if you had a real big part in making it...shame on you for disappointing all your true fans! at least the 15 year old boy sitting next to me enjoyed it, and he was ecstatic at the end when ""THE OLD GUY WHO BENDS METAL IS GETTING HIS POWERS BACK"".....",X-Men - The Last Stand
1357,tomaxamot75,A little disappointed,8,27 May 2006,"(Lot's of spoiler warnings)This was a good movie, but i was a little disappointed. Magneto was great as always, but losing Mystique was a bad idea because they were so good together in the first 2 films.. Storm's abilities were better than before except for the spinning. They also missed a great chance at having the original uncanny X-men (Cyclops, Beast, jean Grey, Angel and Iceman)fighting together. That would have made the comic fans proud. Juggernaught never had the x-gene (he became a mutant or abnormal later in life)so i don't see how he lost his powers when he was around Leech. The killing off of Cyclops and professor X made the movie less enjoyable. Iceman turning icy all over was really great and the scene with Juggernaught chasing Shadowcat was really awesome. Although opinions do vary i would recommend anyone to go see it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1358,Belong1993-1,this movie kills your favorite characters,7,27 May 2006,"This Movie in my opinion is my favorite in the series, it was exceptionally good.I likes the scenes with Logan and Jene in the ""hosptal"" room and when Mystique was on the floor of the truck. The end of this film sets up a sequel kind of which I didn't understand. Like everyone else I also liked the part on Alkatraz, the big battle scene. But I want to know why they made kitty an X-Men soldier. All she can do is walk through walls. Make someone more powerful take her place. Kitty is cute i'll give her that but come on she killed like 1 guy this girl is insanely weak. overall i'd give this movie a 7 because it had all my favorite battle scenes but it was kind of hard to follow. I would strongly recommend this movie to people who love action.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I think that many paths with this film were created only for about this thing, I's good because x-men are about this thing. The sentinel head throwing by wolverine was Damn imbecile... about the figure itself or just the size of it was not nearly enough ! And also the juggernaut costume WAS PRETTY STUPID!... Well else of this film was pretty good judgment's from comic -> film.. and I DID ENJOY IT 150% ! (Waiting or so in about next 10 years the proper ""Byrne"" saga about the future to be come...

1362,john_q_001,X-men3 = X-Nazis,1,27 May 2006,"We just got out of Xmen-3 and demanded a refund. The moral message was terrible. The message of the movie is that it is acceptable to commit genocide as long as it is a government sponsored genocide. Maybe a child who watches this will take its message to heart and invent a virus to ""cure"" African Americans of their race? Or maybe his victims will be white? ...or Asian? ...Or who knows what? Will the US become the next Nazi Germany? Director Brett Ratner seems to hope so!If you like Human beings, you will hate this movie.***Warning Spoilers***Prof X decides that he is allowed to tamper with other people's minds even though he has already damaged that same mind before. He states that he is not accountable for his immoral behavior.Wolverine murders people for being minorities (Mutants). This is not self-defense. He randomly murders people before they even know that they are under attack. instead of knocking his victims unconscious, he chooses to disembowel them without provocation.The entire X-men choose to support the government's genocide campaign without even discussing the moral ramifications of genocide. At first, the government's moral stand is vague, but when it is revealed that they have been mass producing a variety of viral weapons to cripple, maim, and kill a specific minority group of human beings, not one X-man finds this questionable. They even choose to use these viral weapons themselves.***End Spoilers***I was shocked. The X-men comic always supported equal rights and opposed racism, but in this movie there was no moral consideration on the part of the X-men, they simply sided with evil. For decades, Marvel Comics has led the industry in advancing social and ethical issues. Apparently, this does not apply to movie adaptations.It was definitely NOT a movie for children to see, unless you want your children to murder people of other races. Maybe your child could be the next Adolph Hitler? ...Or if the children have already seen this movie because their parents were expecting the X-men to act like the X-men, there has to be a lot of damage control.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1363,gotenks2424,It has it's ups and downs...,4,27 May 2006,"I will defend as well as thrash this movie, and I will also explain why I have given it a 4 outta 10. First things first, the good things about the movie, and some of the following stuff may contain spoilers, but I must say them nonetheless. As a fan of the comics and cartoons, I will point out what I feel and know are wrong out of the movie. Moviegoers that are not fans, you will probably enjoy it, because it delivers in many ways like the other two did. Anyway, to the good things: The battles were intense, full of many mutant powers and massive carnage. ( Especially where Wolverine goes somewhat berserker on some Morlocks) Vinnie Jones, who plays the Juggernaut, does a pretty good job, minus having a British accent. Juggernaut was not British. Despite being not tall or wide enough, he was still large enough to be believable.Kelsey Grammar does quite an impressive job as Hank McCoy/Beast, he has that intellectual quality in his voice, and has the look and feel to Beast.Multi-Man, although not in the movie minus two scenes, was quite funny. Also was kind of interesting to see him as a baddie.Magneto moves the Golden Gate Bridge to connect the Morlocks to the Worthington facility on Alcatraz Island, which was really really awesome.Iceman finally goes Iceman! If you're a fan you understand that. (In other words, he goes full ice form of body.) Now, for some of the bad things: Magneto would not sacrifice other mutants and call them pawns. They are his brothers and sisters, and he cares for them, consciders them equals. Even if they had no power, and it was simply a physical mutation.Phoenix was all freaky deaky demonic and a personality disorder, instead of being Cosmic Being-ness. I found this completely retarded and felt like in that part, as well as all the bad things, the director just took a dump on the original comics and cartoons.Storm actually killing someone would never happen. She's an X-Man for God's sake! I'll let you see and find out how that goes.Spike is also in this movie, but he's a Morlock, and thus a bad guy! What the crap?! Spike was X-Men Evolution only, and yet he's like in his 30's and fighting Wolverine. Good lord.Callisto is for some reason fast as Quicksilver, and can 'read Mutant's power rating.' This made me go ""...What?!"" Also, she's got both eyes and is black. I don't mean to be racist, but she's never been black as far as I know.Juggernaut is British, and he's conscidered a Mutant. He's thus affected by Leech's 'power absorption', and loses his power and knocks himself out by ramming into a wall. Now -THIS- is a crock of crap, because Juggernaut was not a mutant. He did have the X-Gene and whatnot, but he got his powers from the Gem of Cyttorak, thus he would be unaffected.Colossus is American, and pretty much does nothing but the Fast Ball Special with Wolverine and beats up some humans. Such a big role for the Russian Mutant that's turned American.Gambit is not in this film, because the guy to play him was a dill hole and decided that since Gambit was too similar to his character from Lost, he wasn't gonna do it. I hope he chokes.Angel's nothing more than a winged angsty teenager, like Multi-Man and only having two parts in the movie.This movie flies through scenes quicker than water evaporates.Mystique sacrifices herself to save Magneto, taking a bullet of 'The Cure', thus losing her powers. Magneto leaves her. MAGNETO WOULD NOT DO THAT! I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY, SHE'S TOO IMPORTANT, EVEN AS A HUMAN, TO LEAVE ALONE!!! There's plenty more, but I'll leave it at that. I've ranted too long. As an overall movie, I'll give it a 7 or a 7.5. But, comic and cartoon referencing and actually being factually right to the X-Men genre, it gets a 4 at most. I felt like giving it a two.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1364,martinmcgrath87,Viewer beware,1,27 May 2006,"As a child i was always a big fan of the X-men comics and cartoons. They had limitless possibilities for characters and yet they never got repetitive. When the first X-men movie came out I was a little skeptical but for the sake of loyalty I went along anyway, and I wasn't disappointed! The movie was good despite a few minor things like the appearance of wolverine who really shouldn't be in any X-men movie until we reach about 5 or 6 but he was there to get fans and was played reasonably well. Similar story with X-men 2 until right at the end where we see phoenix under the water. This is where the spiral of stupidity begins. On to the final installment and the final straw.There is little I can say that hasn't been said by other reviews so I guess I'm going to have to repeat them! Certain characters ended the film, not quite in the way they really should have (to those who have seen it you know what I'm talking about). Basically the entire film was a farce that totally ruined all other X-men related information and I strongly recommend either not seeing it or gouging out your eyes and severing your head just before you go in to the theater if there is no way to avoid it.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I mean with Scott gone, and jean dead... wow, That means the future of the X-Men is gone, since their son basically runs the darn thing. Come on people. That was my first and major problem with the movie... and while Scott was on the screen he was a little crying *****. I mean Scott has emotions but come on, he is still the team leader in the field. They completely butchered McCoy's Character, he went from being a brainiac, to being a war mongering mutant, he would have felt more at home in the brother hood than in the x-men. Magneto was no longer the king of the chess board, he was just a ... I know it isn't a piece but a jester. It is like they went Hi, you were brilliant in the first two, but ya know what, Your just a little to good... we need you to be stupid and sacrifice your whole team just to try to win. I mean come on people. I could complain about this movie for hours, but I definitely wont, I am going to close my eyes and try to get the past hour and forty five minuets of my life back. The only thing I did feel that was some what in place, well at least at the beginning of the scene was the fight on Alcatraz, mutants flying around beating each other with the ugly stick. Then after the initial attack wave, my interest died out completely in the scene.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1366,TomFoolio,The sacrificing of one of the potentially greatest series for a quick buck.,2,28 May 2006,"X3 Has thrilling action scene after action scene, along with several interesting new mutants who also bring along interesting new powers. Sir Ian McKellen, and Hugh Jackman play their parts to perfection. Not to mention the performances from Patrick Stuart, Kelsey Grammar, or the other ""main"" characters who seemed to be cast into the shadows. The special effects work wonderfully, and the movie is truly appealing to the eye.That being said what is appealing to the eye is not always appealing to the mind. Imagine a beautiful man or woman who is flat out breath-taking, but sadly you would rather talk to a rock than share in two sentences with them. As a long time X-men fan, to me X3 was a disappointment.Yes the action was great, but the story was awful. Yes the new mutants were interesting (when you got to see them) but why shamelessly kill off old ones we love and then go on as if they were a hiccup in the characters lives. And frankly the only thing worse than killing off a character in such a fashion, is flat out refusing to put them in. To anyone who is a hardcore Nightcrawler fan and has not seen this movie it is sad to say that you are in for a great disappointment. And finally yes, each character performed beautifully. I can say in all honesty that there was little to no error in the casting of this movie. However, even a great actor/actress can do nothing when the story fails.Were this movie standing on its own, without the expectation, and hype created by its predecessors, I would give it a 7 or 8/10. However since it is part of what used to be a grand story, it as a whole is a flat out flop. I would recommend that people see this movie, and if you are an X-men fan you will not be able to resist watching it as much as you cannot resist being let down by it. I would not however, encourage people to spend the money to see it in theaters, or even buy your very own copy of it. Best to borrow from friends, rent it, or figure out some other way that you can watch this without allowing the people who made it to line inside of their pockets with the almighty dollar.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Story, music, special effects, character development (lack thereof) and just everything about this movie is plain awful.In every single aspect this movie was a total letdown and I wish I would have saved the money (or could get it back - hell the director should give me some money for the pain I'm still suffering!).Mentioning the director: I had a bad feeling about Bryan Singer not being with X-Men 3 anymore and next time I'll trust my feelings (and read the IMDb ;-) ).",X-Men - The Last Stand
1368,snowhite04,Well well well,1,28 May 2006,"There's not really much i want to say here, mainly because i cant be bothered and partly because i might start to get angry.To start of i want to say, Brett Ratner you should be ashamed of yourself. I would also like to add that the actors in this film all did fantastic jobs as they are all very talented but why they didn't run a mile from this i do not no.I spent my (boyfriends) hard earned money on going to see this film and i thought it was going to be amazing because how can you go wrong with X Men when there's so much to work with, the possibilities are endless yet this film managed to destroy my hopes and dreams of finishing up with something spectacular, instead you get a half assed job from someone who seems to no nothing about the X Men.Now i no that changes have to be made to certain things to make it more suitable for the big screen or to tie in with the plot more, but there seems to be no plot or point to this film ***SPOILER WARNING*** First of all as many people have said, since when was juggernaut a mutant? Despite the fact that Xavier and juggernaut are step brothers they don't say a single word to each other or even make eye contact, hmmm, its as if they don't know each other. Juggernaut has always hated and wanted to destroy Xavier, so what happened here. Maybe juggernaut has seen the error of his ways and will be a good bro from know on, but its not very likely.Second of all, you don't kill two of the MOST important characters, along with other extremely important characters losing there powers (though there is something to suggest that ""The Cure"" doesn't really work). I really am just so angry at this guy.Thirdly, why even bother to put put Jean Grey/Phoenix in this film?? She spent the whole film standing around doing NOTHING. She's supposed to be this all powerful mutant goddess yet doesn't do anything. Why? They could have made this film amazing if they actually did something with Phoenix (and the other piles of characters that made random appearances). Throughout the whole film i kept saying to myself ""Phoenix is gonna do something in a second and its gonna be amazing"", but sadly that moment never came, not even any flames or the slightest connection with perhaps... a Phoenix, just nothingness, and then to kill her in the end. I'm so confused and slightly distraught.I know i said i would make it short, but I'm just getting a bit carried away, but i'll try and finish up quickly.Fourthly, where was night Crawler? Why was Angel in this film? He was in it for all of two minutes yet in the trailer they make it seem as though he is an important character to this film when in fact he does nothing as well. Why has rouge never been developed in to the awesome character she is? Instead she just whinges a bit more and takes ""The Cure"" which shouldn't happen. Still no Gambit which was upsetting as he is a favourite of mine, though i already knew about this before i wasted my money.Lastly i want to say that Bryan Singer did a great job with the first two films. Brett Ratner has obviously decided that he wants to be remembered and take credit for the x men films so he destroyed the characters that Bryan Singer had built up and developed so well, and then tried to build other characters up instead, as well as trying to stick as many characters in as possible in 1 hour 40 minutes.Well Brett Ratner, i certainly will remember you, but i can assure you it wont be for bringing what started out so well to a great end.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1369,tpnameless1,Expect the worst,2,28 May 2006,"This movie was an extreme disappointment. A slap in the face of X-men fans everywhere. Any and all previews were tainted to show only the best. Now, while I realize this is the intent of trailers for every movie, take my advice. Stick to watching the trailers and imagining in your own mind how the movie plays itself out. Save your $10 for something more useful, like Pepto-Bismol or Tylenol.The fight scene between Iceman and Pyro was my major gripe for this movie. Said scene lasted perhaps a minute, if that, and was one of those simple ""i'm going to throw a ray of power at you, you throw a ray of power at me. our two rays of power meet in between the two of us, and the one who is stronger wins"". I'd rather watch firefighters going after the infernos in California on the news than watch that crappy fight scene again. Where'd matter surfing go? What about the fire-shaping and the like? Oh, we'll have Magneto throw cars and let Pyro turn them into big ol' Molatov ""cocktails"" but when it comes to the Pyro/Iceman fight, we'll let it end with a head-butt. What the world were these people thinking? As for the other characters, I understand why Nightcrawler wasn't in this movie. An entire video game was released to explain him going off on his own to accomplish ""something"" and he's not back yet. OK. I can deal with that.Angel, aka pretty boy with wings that has 3 minutes of on screen time, and a flashback (oooh that'll draw the fans in).Juggernaut's part went completely afield from the comic series. (Let's make him a natural born mutant, we'll forget about the gem entirely, no one's interested in that. Oh and his family connections? bah, forget about'm) He seemed to be more of a whiny wanna-be than an accomplished warrior. ""I'm the juggernaut, b****."" (Edited to maintain IMDb's guidelines) i could go on and on about the characters and their crappy parts, their messed up psyche and the like but i won't, i'm sure there are many, many more reviews which can tell it in a much better frame of mind than myself.i do however feel obligated to bring up this point. The assault of the Worthington Labs on Alcatraz was probably the worst deployment of troops I've seen since Bush started his little war in Iraq ( but we won't go there) ""I'll just throw away all these little unimportant men here. No matter that they're fellow mutants, they're pawns. Let'm die."" ""Oh, now that most of them are dead...NOW i'll use this mutant here to knock away the plastic weapons, no matter that i could use the surroundings against the soldiers, I'll let others do my work for me..."" ""Oh look, it's Wolverine. I'll just beat him up and...lose my powers thanks to Beast. Urk...urg."" ...and that was Magneto's part in the assault in a nutshell.There was too much disorganization in this movie. Trying to accomplish too much without thinking of the consequences of putting such a hodgepodge film on the open market. Will the director get rich off of this film? Probably. Will any self-respecting comic book fan ever watch another movie made by this loser? I hope not. I really really do As stated before, save your money and instead go buy yourself a carnival mirror that makes everyone that looks into it appear skinny or fat. It'll be a much better use and probably more entertaining too",X-Men - The Last Stand
1370,rsinotte-1,X-Men Never Truly Die...,6,28 May 2006,"I didn't have any expectations of this movie due to the fact that Bryan Singer was not involved (OMG if you went to this movie thinking the same team was working on it, were you in for a nasty surprise). Lauren Schuler Donner made her point, that they could still make this movie without Singer, but they surely could have chosen a better screenplay. Rattner did OK with the direction of the actors, but he seems to be the one getting flak for the plot. Blame the editors and the writers! Without Singer, Donner should have brought in Chris Claremont as content expert (he's in the fricken' movie, did they listen to anything he had to say or even bother asking!). I get the feeling that this movie was heavily edited, I hope that an extended version is released on DVD (this movie should have been 30 minutes longer). The language is dirtier, but the claw action was toned down far too much in my opinion. Cyclops' mysterious ""death"" is a ridiculous departure from the comics, however more on that later. Plus side: Dark Phoenix was terrifying! She should have done more at the end though and had more abandon and evil laughter (like in the comics). There's no way Magneto could have controlled her like he did in this movie. This was also the best Storm and Iceman that we have seen so far. Leave out the Juggernaut!!! Or else spend some proper time developing him and show some childhood scenes of him and Charles in the Marko household. He could still be Xavier's step-brother in the film, the subject wasn't approached one way or the other. So, with all the deaths, who is that surprised, after all this is the X-Men where the characters die and come back to life all the time. We never saw what happened to Cyclops, and the Phoenix always rises again; Xavier is still alive on the astral plane, he'll come back with the ability to walk again - come on, this has already all happened in the books, so it can happen in the movies. If there is an X4, it can salvage the franchise, provided that a good screenplay is written (why they don't get Claremont or Whedon to write one is beyond me). I also don't care how much they edit the crap out of movies for the theater, just release the ""real"" version on DVD (a la Daredevil). SHAME ON SCHULER DONNER and Avi Arad for letting this happen!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand

1372,TheIcemanBloggeth,"Noisy, trainwreck ending to the series....",6,28 May 2006,"The third and final installment in this iteration of the big screen X-Men is easily the most disappointing. It is a fair movie, but not up to snuff with the other 2 entries, and for easily identifiable reasons.First,direction. Bryan Singer is out, Brett Ratner is in. When Singer defected Marvel's X-Men to helm the DC Superman project, all fans of the series instantly got a bad feeling in their gut, and it can now be confirmed as justified. Ratner hit gold with the Rush Hour movies, but has also screwed up Red Dragon, After the Sunset, and Money Talks. But, Ratner didn't mess this movie up all on his own, he got himself some really bad writing to boot.Next, writing. David Hayter begged off after doing 1 and 2 with co-writer Zak Penn, but Penn is beginning to look more Garfunkle than Simon. Penn contributed to the scripts for Elektra and Fantastic Four, which alone should have disqualified him from ever making another superhero movie, but until he was separated from Hayter on an X-Men script, his lack of writing chops remained at least partly hidden.In Hayter's place, Ratner signed on Simon Kinberg, a British screenwriter who helped write xXx:State of the Union, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith. This choice reminds me of Marvel putting Mark Steven Johnson in charge of ruining Daredevil, Elektra, and soon Ghost Rider, based upon his fine work writing Jack Frost and Simon Birch? In this regard, Marvel (and Hollywood overall) shows it's liberal stripes; only in Washington DC and Hollywood do people who completely screw things up get wads of cash and more important projects to screw up.So, needless to say, X3 was doomed from the start, and it is a credit to the strong character foundation left by Singer that it did not completely suck.And finally, the end result on screen. X3:Last Stand is uneven, overly dark, and a bit schizophrenic. The momentum from X2 is all that initially propels the movie, and the constant shifting of the story and characters kills that pretty fast. And, apparently, Ratner has decided to use the Hernando Cortez method of film-making, burning his ships behind him to make sure no one can come and try to make an X4. As a matter of fact, the wanton reckless nature with which he treats this franchise bordered on startling. And I couldn't help but think as I watched that Ratner was simply firing for effect at times, using shock to hold his audience where Singer would have applied solid, old fashioned drama.Most of the established characters are misused, ignored, or just plain cast aside, and the unscripted omission of Nightcrawler is particularly distracting. New characters are jumbled in with little or no foreplay, the net effect being many of them serving as window dressing more than anything else. Vinny Jones' juggernaut is most notably squandered, and that Angel was even in this movie - offering an early story element, but otherwise gliding through - is the only thing leading me to believe that another sequel could rise out of the ashes of this one. Kellsey Grammar's Beast is interesting and true to the comic book, but borderline out of place with the choppy bits of story he gets. The core characters lack consistency in this story, so secondary characters like Beast, Collossus, Angel, etc, struggle to take root themselves. And Bobby Drake/Iceman's flirt affair with Kitty Pride was just plain run of the mill bad Hollywood writing, impeding his effort to be established as a main character here.It's always hard to judge how good/bad a sequel is on it's own merits, outside of the larger context of a serial, and this is especially true with a sequel like this one that is the culmination of a series I am so fond of. Thus, my harsh judgement is not solely a reflection of X3, but is in part resentment for Hollywood studio fatheads that gave X3 to Ratner, Penn, and Kinberg, throwing away the capital Singer had built up the past 6 years in this tossed together finale. I mean, how can us fans who pay our $10 to see a movie spot a disaster in the making like this writing/directing team a mile away, while studio executives whose multi-million dollar existences are funded by avoiding said disasters cluelessly blunder forth as they did? I mean, did someone flip a coin to select this team or something? Has anyone in Hollywood seen xXx:State of the Union? After the Sunset? Fantastic Four? Hello? If you were to leave a DVD of any of those three movies on a sidewalk in a town that has pooperscooper laws, you would be fined.X3 is perhaps less horrible that I make it sound - it certainly has it's moments - but calling it anything less than disappointing when placed along X1 and X2 would be misleading.2.5 stars",X-Men - The Last Stand
1373,mavrik79,Very engaged X-fan!,7,28 May 2006,"Just saw it last night, and I thought overall they did very well with the film. The special effects were incredible and the action was very engaging. Ratner's style didn't stray too far from the first two and this has the makings of another blockbuster. Though it wasn't as good as X2, I liked it better than first one, where they had not enough character.There were quite a few things i didn't like about the film, however, The film felt very rushed and it didn't have to be because it was every engaging. The ending was pretty much slapped together and they didn't give Wolverine a satisfactory action sequence, like Singers X2.I know they couldn't possibly keep it completely on par with the comic book but the movie suggests that Jean loves Wolvie more than Cyclops, Wolverine is the one who at the end is enough to stop Jean/Phoenix but Cyclops and Xavier could not? That's extremely inconsistent with the comic characters. Halle Berry is very ordinary as Storm, she doesn't appear to care too much for the character, I won't miss her in the next installment. Wolverine, my favorite character, was watered down which they did explain, but I still don't like it. I like the way they handled the Phoenix, because to start incorporating the out of space element would have been too complicated. I thought too many characters were ""killed off"" even though they can easily explain bringing them back, i think too much killing and resurrection (even in the comics) just compromises the integrity of the story as a whole. I don't like Storm's story so much that it should be a central theme, but I hear rumblings that Berry wanted it that way. I'm not a big fan of Cyclops, but his ""death"" was pretty disrespectful for a character of his stature.Whoever did this film could have done their homework a little better in order to decide who is more important in the hierarchy of things. yet and still, all in all as film alone it hold it's own as very engaging.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1374,ZumoroNuva,"Action packed ""To The Max"", but not that much for storyline, with characters dropping like flies.",7,28 May 2006,"Recently saw this movie, and I've gotta say, it certainly has its pros and cons.The opening scene is 20 years ago when Professor X and Magneto visit Jean Grey as a young girl; problem is it didn't expand very much with the parents, like they were just there for the heck of it.Next we go to 10 years ago with a young Warren who is trying to cut off his wings, I admit the meaning behind it was useful, but the scene seemed a little needless.The Danger Room part was pretty good, and definitely gave fans what they wanted, but I was hoping they'd show a little more of the sentinel.The scene about the cure was pretty well done, and well established the purpose of the movie, but lacked the extra ""dimension"".The whole part where Jean is found alive was very interesting, and Scott's death was pretty unexpected, but the little bit about Phoenix was interesting.One interesting scene was magneto breaking out the mutants, definitely well done, but when mystique takes a dart for magneto, he seemed a little too eager to dump her there. At least she gets back at him by helping out the government.One very significant scene was where Phoenix kills the Professor, but it was a little too unexpected; though based on the trailers it makes sense, sort of.The whole bridge scene was well done, but seemed way too unbelievable even for X-Men; magneto lifting a whole bridge like that without much effort, unless Jean was helping.The climatic battle scene was okay, but seemed a little too focused on action and not so much on storyline. After several dozen deaths and half the island being disintegrated, wolverine manages to kill Jean before she destroys anything else, which was very jaw-dropping, but too simple in a way.Finally, the ending scene which I'd rather not reveal was very ""The End?""-ish.Overall, the move was definitely worth it in terms of action and plot, and had a few small mini-stories, however it lacked the complexity and dimension the last two had, and it seemed like most of the mutants they showed were just for the heck of it, barely having anything to do with the rest of the story. So like a lot of people have already said, worst one in the trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1375,dawghorn,X-fan no more,2,28 May 2006,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, for the love of Xavier's name, don't bother. It was the worst movie I have seen since King Ralph! The strange thing was the actors themselves were good but the story was so flimsy and pointless. Some who should have lived, died pretty pathetic deaths; those that should've died were free in the end, despite the horrible crimes they committed along the way.The lake scene with Scott was so weak. We waited since the end of the last movie and it was... ugh, there's not a word weak enough to describe it.And some characters who were introduced, like Angel and Colossus, were pretty weak as far as being used. If I was about to fight for my life and the dream I believed in, I'd welcome all the help I could get. They had a school full of mutants and only 4 were ready to go with Storm and Logan? Please.Ugh, I could go on forever but I won't. They really should have waited for Bryan Singer to finish Superman or, better yet, just previewed this trash to X-fans and they'd have known to go back to the cutting room and do it over again.As far as I'm concerned, the first 2 X-movies are the only 2 X-movies!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1376,kdogg7,A Very Good Ending To A Good Trilogy...,8,28 May 2006,"When I first entered the packed theater on opening day, I could see the anticipation of many spectators. After the movie ended, the same look could be seen on the faces of many, including me.***SPOILERS*** X-3 provided us with a moral and heartfelt story. It begins with Scott and Logan still struggling with Jean's death. During that time, a company has created a drug to suppress the mutant 'x' gene, which they call a 'cure'. An injection would suppress the gene forever, rendering the user as a human. On top of a Magneto war against the humans, many, including some X-Men, question whether or not to take this drug. As such, many moral issues come into play as well as some real world issues. Its themes of prejudice against the mutants, the way Xavier sacrificed his life to try and save Jean, and the unspoken love between Jean and Logan only accented an already good film, as it deals with those themes. Some hardcore fans may be disappointed with the way the film deals with the Pheonix but I thought it was a perfect touch. Magneto, on the other hand, just felt wrong. Instead of showing us the moral implications of why the humans must die, he just was pure evil. Personally, I thought he should have made us care for him more. Added in some dialogue that would perhaps persuade us into what he is trying to accomplish, but instead he is just pure evil, which in the other two films, it had shown reasons for his uber evilness.At the end, you were left with a feeling of accomplishment, like you had just saved the world. This film gives you the feeling of a good film and a saga completed.

Does Ian Mackellan even remember which movie he's in ""you shall not pass, cos I have power over metal...wait"". So disappointed, loved the first 2 movies and the potential for the third was huge, but the desire to make it purely an ""action"" film has ruined it, was there really the need to set on fire five cars, he's got flame power, we get it buddy, we saw the last 2 films.

Magneto un-characteristically surrounds himself with these punker mutants with tattoos and piercing. There are some really bad lines from Magneto in this one and they shoved so much material into this movie that really important scenes between characters like Pyro and Iceman are really short. Phoenix (Former Jean-Grey) is supposed to be the focus but she is in a trance the whole movie. Jean's alternate personality is a marijuana smoker or something. They should have made this movie longer to have more time for the new characters like Angel or not have introduced them at all. The director didn't do a bad job actually the movie is visually stunning, but the script is what's lacking.If I could change one thing about this movie, I'd have Pyro kill Rouge first thing just so we didn't have to watch those stupid ice skating and jealousy scenes.

1379,maximus_72,X-MEN Old heads Robbed.,4,28 May 2006,"First off, I'd like to say even though the X-MEN trilogy was mildly entertaining I'd have to say all 3 movies were horribly disappointing from an older fan's perspective. I'm a die-hard MARVEL fan and I expected a lot more than this movie gave. I was dying to see X-MEN 3 because I was hoping they would set the movie to the TRUE last stand saga from the comic book. From the trailers I expected the rest of the movie to be mostly like The ""Last Stand"" scene. Unfortunately, the scene they kept showing on the trailer was just a DANGER ROOM training session. I nearly walked out when that whole scene turned out to only be generated DANGER ROOM practice session. I wanted to see the X-MEN fighting some SENTINELS, and NONE of that happened.The Juggernaut, Angel, the Beast, Cyclops, nearly the WHOLE TEAM was gutted. As bit part as they made of Colossus, Juggernaut, and Angel, they didn't even need to be in the movie. For all of you youngsters: Colossus' alter ego is Peter Rasputin. The point is, Peter is Russian. Let me repeat, PETER IS Russian. Why is the dude playing Colossus speaking with an American ACCENT? I know there are budget costs to be concerned with but how hard would it have been for this dude to at least FAKE a Russian accent??? He only had 3 LINES, anyways.I was DYING to see Colossus fight Juggernaut. DIDN'T HAPPEN.How they thought they could get away with practically ALL of Phoenix's origin being IGNORED is beyond me. In the trilogy they've wasted a lot of time and money on all of these bit parts for all of these kids with pointless, pathetic, worthless mutant powers in Xavier's mansion but they couldn't take the time to develop the MAIN CHARACTERS a little more? You got one kid whose mutant power is to write on paper like a pen with her finger??WHY WAS ROGUE EVEN IN THIS TRILOGY? As I've said before, the REAL Rogue is an aggressive, no holds barred woman with a THICK southern accent. This chick that played Rogue in the trilogy only cried and pouted throughout the whole trilogy. At some point in time, Rogue was supposed to have the ability of flight and invulnerability. DIDN'T HAPPEN. So, WHY IS SHE IN THE MOVIE? Don't have a clue. Another wasted character. Time wasted developing pointless minor characters that ran around in Xavier's mansion, which reminds me, THERE WERE NEVER ANY SNOT-NOSED, WHINEY CHILDREN IN XAVIER'S MANSION. At least not as portrayed in the movies.In the comics, Colossus and Kitty Pryde are supposed to be DEEPLY in love. Okay, I'm already angry and confused that they paired Bobby Drake with Rogue but what really upsets me is, WHY IS ICE-MAN TRYING TO GET DOWN WITH KITTY PRYDE while Colossus is goofing around in the Mansion as if Kitty and Peter were total strangers??? Another confused plot that wasted time and money.In this movie, Storm is supposed to show her newfound leadership abilities. All this woman did was cry, spin around, and get her butt miserably KICKED twice by a gangster sewer broad. The ONLY character they didn't mess up was Wolverine. Hugh Jackman is the ONLY actor in this whole movie--the whole trilogy-- that has his character DOWN. Instead of Storm leading the X-MEN, practically being given the position of team leader by Xavier himself, Wolverine is the one that steps up and SHUTS THE MOVIE DOWN. If you ask me,Hugh deserves to get the deal to make a WOLVERINE movie. If you ask me, they could throw away EVERYBODY that was in the movie anyways.Why did they mess this movie up so miserably? DEMOGRAPHICS. There aren't enough old heads out there that pump enough money into the MARVEL machine for them to do a more accurate portrayal of the X-MEN. The few old heads that are out there, my age and older, that have waited for decades to even SEE Marvel characters on the silver screen don't care enough to want a more accurate portrayal of their favorite characters. Most of us are just happy to see our favorite characters in live action, which leaves the 18 and under crowd: Most of them don't have a real sense about Marvel comics beyond 1990. They'll only jump for RECENT history, things they know so, the suckers at Marvel sold out to appease the candy wrapper crowd.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1380,petitpicodon,We are all mutants,1,28 May 2006,"... if you see a theater playing that movie, run. Away. Fast. Like the good mutant you are. I am not familiar with the comics, but I greatly enjoyed the multi-layered X-Men I and II. The atmosphere, the uncertainty, the subtlety. Thank you Bryan Singer. I knew the third director would need to create his own space, and I do respect that. However, I find it appalling to see that NOTHING that made the first movies interesting appeared in this last opus. Instead we face an all or nothing situation, between absolute powers from the Phoenix, or no power at all thanks to the serum. Soppy good guys, or bad goth guys. A nice mansion vs a dark forest... blahblahblah. All the film is based on special effects. But they NEVER make a script. They are the support of the story, not a reason to make a movie in the first place. This exacerbated situation could only serve this purpose : make spectacular images, which are nothing but spectacular. It eventually turns into a big destruction company, obliterating all the interesting characters (and even the X plane), giving nothing to chew on but a lingering question : who's going to die next. Although once you understand the film is a failure, you don't really care much. Once you accept the ridicule of the situation, it can become rather funny to watch in a detached kind of way... The music was not inspired, the characters were empty, the scenario worthless, the final battle a joke, and, frankly, Magneto (well played as usual by Iam McKellen) shouldn't have left Mystic laying on the floor. Yep, bad guys will be bad guys. One good point : it's a short film. Thank you for that Mr Ratner. Makes the ordeal faster.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1381,DarthPlagus,Two Times the Charm,10,28 May 2006,"Seriously; the first time I saw it, I was torn. Yes it was a good movie and followed in the huge footsteps of its predecessors (X-men and X2), but it also left so much unexplained I couldn't really enjoy it and worst of all, main characters die. Then I went and saw it again.About twenty minutes in, it all clicked.In the first two movies, a major plot point is seen/heard/given away by something on a TV screen. (trust me, it's there, if you don't believe me, go watch it again) After watching X3 through all the way the first time around, I couldn't figure it out. Then I heard about a special ""something"" at the very end, post-credits. I went back to the theater the next day and watched it all the way through. Watch it again, or go see it for the first time, but no matter what else you do; Watch the TVs, and remember what they say.If you like X-men, this is your movie. Comedy, same thing. Action... duh. Writing, genius; directing, genius; acting, all characters perfectly matched.Also, this one's a little more actioned packed than the first two, so I'd recommend leavin' the little ones at home.In regard to it as an X-men movie, it ranks, in my mind, as the best of the trilogy. A hearty congrats doth go forth from my heart unto those who directed, produced, acted in, crewed, and made this movie.and signing off, here's the spoiler...Long Live Charles Xavier.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1382,ninetysixdecibelfreak,X-tremely X-ceptional movie.,9,28 May 2006,"WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS After seeing/hearing several un-promising reviews of ""X-Men 3: The Last Stand"" I went to the cinema to see it yesterday expecting to be disappointed. I needn't have worried. It was great. I should have known. I've seen this time and again with comic book movies. They send people to review them who know nothing about comic books, so they rarely get it. Would you send a vegetarian to review a steak restaurant? A blind man to review a painting expedition? A deaf person a concert or a non-driver a car? Of course not. But they happily send people who've never read a comic book in their life (and who probably regarded them as crap) to review movies based on comic books. Crazy.The movie turns out to be fantastic. Exciting, moving, relentless. And Vinny Jones as Juggernaut is inspired casting. As good as, if not better than the first two. The essence of X-Men and all Marvel hero titles has always been their relationships with each other and with their own psyches and the way in which they deal with their unique and unusual position in society. I thought that was well portrayed in the movie. The personal challenges that they faced in the story were at its core: all of them being offered the possibility of a ""cure""; Storm being handed the responsibility, (perhaps reluctantly on her part), for the school by Professor X; Rogue facing the possibility of maybe, finally, for the first time in her life, being able to have physical contact with another person; Mystique facing betrayal by Magneto, to whom she had been so devoted; Beast dealing with the dichotomy of working for a government that was working to eradicate mutation; Angel and his father facing the problem of their relationship and the consequences of his mutation; Bobby (Iceman) and his relationships with Rogue, Pyro and Kitty; and central to all of this, Jean dealing with her relationship with her dark side - The Phoenix; the Professor facing up to The Phoenix, happy to do so though he knew the consequence; Storm facing a formidable foe in Callisto; Beast facing his natural tendency to be a diplomat when confronted by the needs of battle; Kitty, the smallest, least experienced and youngest of them all rising to the challenge and saving the day, overcoming the most formidable of foes, Juggernaut, even without her powers, by being smart and resourceful. Inspiring! And finally Wolverine having to make a dreadful choice at the end, to do the right thing, even though it was the last thing he wanted to do. It gave me goosebumps. It was beautiful. Each of them faced their demons in their own way. Not always successfully (as so often in the real world - and in the Marvel world). It's not often that a story will kill off many of its central characters. I thought that was very brave.It was certainly different to the first two movies, but it captured the essence of an X-Men tale much more than its more superficial predecessors. This wasn't just exposition/origin stuff, this was a real X-Men story. I suppose after 40 years of reading comic books I'm in an unusual position to view this story from, but I thought it was tremendous. I'm keen to see it again. Of course it helps to be familiar with the original story, though that was changed. But Hollywood has to do that. Just like in ""Judge Dredd"" - in the original comics you never ever see Dredd without his helmet on - but you couldn't have a Sylvester Stallone movie and never see his face. In the original Phoenix story Jean does apparently die and returns as The Phoenix but then the Professor manages to bring her back from the brink. But these movies have changed the X-Men story from the beginning. Rogue, for example, was an older, sassy, woman - not the shy young girl of the movies (though Anna Paquin's characterisation was great). She also had extraordinary powers - flight, super-strength - that she'd taken, permanently, from Marvel Girl whom she'd put into a coma. She was also Mystique's daughter! None of that was in any of the movies, but it doesn't matter. ""X-Men 3: The Last Stand"" is a great movie and a suitable finale to the X-men movie series. Or is it.?",X-Men - The Last Stand
1383,marvandmartian,Redeeming factors,8,29 May 2006,I am a huge x-men fan and found this movie very satisfying. Now I have to admit when I was watching it I got extremely upset and if I hadn't actually thought things through I probably would not have liked it. There are a few things people have to think about. One you can't put the x-men story line into a movie. It is impossible to introduce every character especially when you are dealing with a group like the brotherhood. The second thing people need to realize is there is a severely redeeming factor for this movie in the piece after the credits. If you watch the movie don't miss this part. Every friend of mine that is an x-men fan has been upset about this movie until they find out about the piece following the credits.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1384,zymosiz,Very disappointed in X3,4,29 May 2006,"I loved the first 2 movies, but this one just doesn't do it for me. There is something about the production that makes the movie seem like it was rushed and made on small studio stages.The wood where the mutants are hiding seems like being a park and the final battle on Alcatraz seems like its going on behind a supermarket mall.There are so many things that doesn't work in the movie. So many cool mutants from the first movies are either not in this on or just dead.After Mystigue is turned in to a human you only see here for like a brief movement and its a shame to put an end to such a cool villain.The story about Jean Grey is stupid and not very interesting. Many of the new mutants are like taken out of music video and are just badly played.Pyro is so annoying and he comes of not as a cool villain, but as a stupid teenager with a sexual problem. When he finally gets to fight iceman its a very dull scene where they shoot a fire beam and a ice beam at each other, then there is a struggle between the two beams where it shifts from side to side where ofcause Iceman comes out strongest. Wow we have never seen that before. I want to see them do some serious stuff. Its a clash of 2 elements that are so different and that it should end in some seriously stunning action scenes.There are many new mutants and a lot i have looked forward to, but most of them don't work. The problem with all the new mutants is, that they don't give anything to the movie and the character development gone. Its a sad turn from the first 2 movies.I didn't have high hopes about this movie after reading the first reviews, but i did look forward to at least seeing Wolverine kicking serious a.. , but the cool fights like against mystique or Deathstrike from the first movies are not there, only a uninteresting scene in the woods vs. some silly mutants (the one growing and then throwing spikes/horns) looks truly stupid as he runs around chasing Wolverine in the woods. Take notice the next time you see the movie. It just doesn't work.If this movie will be the last, then its a sad and bad way to end what could have been one of the best super heroes movies ever made.But with a director like Brett Ratner i am not surprised the movie turned out so bad.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1385,dubanor,Brett Ratner better hope I don't find out where he lives . . .,1,29 May 2006,"Alright first off, I am not a rabid X-Men fanboy. I read some of the comics, watched some of the cartoons. The first X-Men movie was, I felt, good, but short of great. X2 however was spectacular. It is the only movie I have ever seen in the theatre more than twice. I say this to show that I went into X3 with the best of expectations, I wasn't looking to pick it apart.This movie has proved to me that a director can well and truly ruin a film. Where the hell was the plot? There was no story arc, there was a series of disjointed events with pretty colors! Fifteen minutes into the movie Cyclops is dead, no build up, no explanations, jean walks out of a lake and sucks him dry. I DON'T EVEN LIKE CYCLOPS! and it still managed to annoy me. All the characterization the first two movies built up was either ignored or destroyed. One of the most hyped things about this movie was the introduction of Angel, and he winds up with like five minutes of screen time. The film degenerated into a showcase of Storm, Wolverine, and Jean. This happens to include two of my favorite characters, and I STILL thought it both sucked and blew! And where the HELL was Night Crawler! And how does Kitty Pride rate X-Man status? She doesn't become useful until she becomes Shadowcat dang it!Bryan Singer did such a great job with the first two movies that the utter abortion that is X3 makes me almost want to cry. It could have been so very very good, and yet it's so very very bad. If I was Singer, I'd be ticked. As in, it's shotgun time, ticked.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1386,shakezula012000,better than the first,8,29 May 2006,"This is better than the first but probably not the second. My fear was that with so many characters the movie would be rushed & the story would suffer. I'm pleased to say the pacing flows well. If you're a fan of the comics (as I am) then you should like it. Of course some hardcore guys will say ""the Pheonix is like she is in the books"" but we weren't ever going to get that movie- its to big & it's Hollywood for crying out loud. The substitute reason for her arrival works for the film.All of the characters make it more like the comics & for those who know them it's fun to pick them out as they come on screen. There are some who (in the books) are good & now are bad & vice-versa, however.Watch it for what it is not what it should be. No superhero movie is exactly like the comic. I do think superhero movies have been getting better though. Thanks largely to the first X-Men movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1387,jeriko2310,"The best of 3, excellent baseline and final",10,5 June 2006,"I saw the movie in the cinema with all that 5.1 sound cool stuff and really blow my mind!!!. Excellent conflict (the ""cure"") that makes the disappointment of some people and the OK of other ones. I like unlimited powerful Jean Grey. The final was awesome (Logan with Jean, tellin' her ""I love you"" and then killin' her! Just sad!!!) and then the director hung on our minds the idea of a fourth, but may be wouldn't be ethical; not a trilogy (just $$$). Some good sources said that Marvel is really interested to make more movies about comics and its personages. I love X-Men; is the best trilogy I ever saw. Long life to Marvel and keep going with these fantastic movies.

1388,awesomestrongbad,terrible,1,29 May 2006,"Although I know it was never meant to adhere strictly to the comic book storyline, such an extreme divergence should never have been undertaken. The writers latched on to a single event (the Phoenix + Jean) in the X-men storyline and built an entire movie around it, coming up with their own explanations as to why it is there. No explanation of why it would be a Phoenix (other than the fact that we all already know about the Phoenix so of course it makes sense) and deaths thrown in for what seems to be shock value.Of course, with gratuitous fight scenes thrown in (which were cool; I won't lie about not loving seeing Wolverine own everybody) we're all expected not to notice how Jean kinda stands around in the background indecisively until everybody else is out of the way and she is suddenly in a killing rage for no reason.And like any good franchise movie, we're left with a little teaser for next time... of course, if popular gossip is to be believed, the chances of another X-men sequel are very low, so now I'm even more annoyed.This is the only X-men movie I left the theater not liking. I liked the first one less after seeing the second, but only in comparison. Unfortunately, I wouldn't like this movie even if I had to compare it with Battlefield Earth or Behind Enemy Lines.

1390,pittsems,confused and unfocused,4,29 May 2006,"X-men 3 is clearly a movie with either too many aspirations or writers with too much power. though it starts well, setting up its focus by explaining where jean Grey's power came from and why it has grown into the phoenix (and, consequently, how they were going to change the origin from the comic in order to accommodate the non-comic reading viewer ship), it quickly falls into the trap most ensemble movies fall into--the dreaded too many sub-plots that drag the movie's momentum. the characters from the last movie are still in shock from jean's death, and show it none too believably. Scott is a wreck, and wolverine is still his cool self. metered out, the tone of sorrow could have been believable, given the acting chops that the mainstays have. i mean, come on, you have a heavy emotional element and actors like Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin (Oscar winners and stage legends all) and you decide not to allow them to shine with the gravitas at hand? the relationship between Scott and wolverine is limited to a few sentences about who is hurting more. how did that happen after the buildup over the last two films of the love triangle between them and jean? could we not have seen more of the return to base after such a tragic outcome as the end of the second film? and Scott's grief is limited to his not shaving and not teaching. no interactions between him and the professor is ridiculous. the professor would be the best person to council and help Scott, as he had been his mentor and father figure for so long. and yet there is no mention from the professor about it other than oh, yeah, um.....he feels bad (paraphrased, of course). Scott eventually makes his way to northern Alberta to lake alkali (a terrifically long trip taken up in a matter of a couple of scene changes) and again, mentions his grief in a short outburst of firing rays into the lake. give me a break. if i had that kind of power, i would have fried the lake to a steam bath to find her body and cradle it one last time, or at least not have stopped until i was spent. jean wakes from her 'telekinetic cocoon' to find him on the shore, and not wasting a second, kisses the bastard, then kills him. good scene, and good segue to the team who hear the psychic call from phoenix. no explanation as to why no one else heard it, though. bad call on their part. one of the main subplots begins around this time with rogue and bobby(iceman). rogue is becoming jealous of others being able to touch her boyfriend (esp. the cute little kitty, played by ingénue Nova Scotian Ellen Page) and is bitchy in a superficial way because of it. another chance to allow the characters involved explore a love triangle that is scuttled by not enough screen time. Anna paquin is left to throw a range of emotion in a few seconds, so reminiscent of soap operas you almost expect to hear the scene ending soap music when they focus on her face. the whole thing is drawn out by too much action that goes nowhere and not enough focusing on the struggle that someone like rogue would have to go through not being able to touch anyone (which studies have shown humans need in order to keep sane) and finding herself on the losing end of a relationship change unless she drastically alters her body. out of all the metaphors for the modern society, why wouldn't they explore this one? and then there was the main plot, which is a serum derived from leech's body that will take away (supposedly permanently) mutants' powers. why they needed this is beyond me. phoenix's powers alone would have been enough to provide the reason for a big fight between mutants that the movie makers so obviously thought they needed for a special effects budget. it allows the introduction of beast and angel, who seems to have just been thrown in for no reason other than to throw him in. he is the son of the man who makes up this serum (who, for reasons unknown to us, tests it first on his son). why cant movie makers learn that if all you are doing is adding a character simply because you want them in a movie you aren't doing anything for them and just cheapen them. which is a shame, because if they had just decided to focus a bit more, and develop characters a bit more (like they did in the second movie with wolverine and rogue, and the love triangle b/t jean and the boys) they would have found that without the serum plot line, they had themes of sorrow and change bred of desire. look at the characters who resemble or follow that completely---magneto with his turn towards war; rogue and her complex; wolverine and his desire to be with jean; jean's death and the changes it wrought; beast and his latent desire to be human looking (never explored was his possible conversation with rogue whom he could in some way relate to); Pyro's continuing slide to delusions of grandeur; and jean's desire to be herself in Phoenix. finally, with the professor coming back in another body, his own change. for this movie, they certainly should have kept the Bryan Singer. obviously he was the man who was able to keep the idiot voices from changing what vision he would have had---or maybe he wasn't able to, as might well have been the reason for leaving the project. shame that Ratner couldn't have found the balls to tell people that no, he couldn't add one more character as a draw for a big opening weekend.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Where was Scott and jeans son, where was rouges flying and super strength powers, why was magneto and mystics powers taken away Xavier DIES what is this are u serious. the first two movies where excellent and a lot of hype was on x-men 3 but in my opinion and that is all it is my opinion it did not live up to the massive hype that surrounded it. the action was good it had some nice fight scenes good graphics and wolverine was once again the main character and provided a warm hearted character rather than the monterist mean tuff guy we are use to seeing but it all worked out for the best cause after all him and storm was practically the only ones left who were not killed off to look after the kids and continue the school for the mutants.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1393,moonbeam06,Not as good,6,29 May 2006,This film isn't as good as the first two. The characters are presented in a way that you don't really understand them. This is sacrificed for the special effects. It doesn't have the magic of the first two films which where directed by Brian Singer and this one wasn't and you can tell if you watch the first and second and compare it to the third. Wolverine is funny as usual and storm is her usual teacher protective self. The death that comes in the middle is a real shocker to the group but it brings them back into action. Its just mainly boring with a few good parts when you think about what you've just seen after you've watched it. Its not that brilliant. But if you love your action and special effects you should see it at the cinema.,X-Men - The Last Stand

But I am one of those people that watched the X-men cartoon. So, it is easy for me to know all the x-men and plots. And who can not help but love that Angel is in this one. I love iceman myself. And note to everyone who is going to see it stay after the end credits there is a hidden extra ending that will freak you out. I am not spoiling anything. I just want all you die hard x-men fans to see it. And it will tie in something else at the beginning of the movie.

1395,shadow_spectre,X4 please?,8,29 May 2006,"I saw this movie on the day it came out, and I must say, calling it Xmen: The Last Stand is something of a hoax. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it, but I will say that they simply CANNOT end it this way. This movie picks up a year or so after the second one left off. Magneto is considered a major threat, and the mutants and humans have formed an alliance to stop him. Meanwhile, a 'cure' has been discovered so that mutants may give up their powers and live as humans if they so choose. This cure arouses much controversy in the mutant community. At the forefront of those who oppose the cure, is Magneto, who assembles an army of mutants to his cause. Although the villain of the movie, I would not refer to him as 'evil'. He simply has his own point of view, and takes more direct and brutal methods to achieve his goals. Beast joins the cast, working with the government in dealing with mutant affairs. Kelsey Grahmer does a fantastic job in portraying Dr. Hank McCoy. Jean Grey returns as the Phoenix, her powers having multiplied, and her 'second personality' emerging, with somewhat darker intentions then the Jean from the previous films. The result: An all out war which takes it's toll on both sides. Many sad and shocking moments, and even more questions raised then either of the previous two films (including a secret ending after the credits) A great movie? Yes. Worthy of the legacy created by it's predecessors? Definitely. The Last Stand? I doubt it. I seriously do not believe that the fans will allow it to end this way.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The young girl who could walk through walls also performed well, somewhat of a standout in this cast and I expect to see more of her in the next edition - X-kids?The ultimate battle scene was far too reminicant of a ""living dead"" movie for me.

I personally was highly disappointed and frustrated. Granted, it's an adaptation of the comic book series, but they went way too far in the opposite direction. How could they do that to the main characters? My opinion on the reason behind it is money and star power. Shameful. A movie like this needs to appeal to its main demographic...the fans. True comic book knowledgeable fans. People who know the stories of the X-Men, specifically the Phoenix saga. While the movie was entertaining for the average movie goer (meaning, someone who's knowledge of x-men only extends to the first two movies), it was an utter shock to those who know about the comic books. I can only hope an appropriate director (Peter Jackson, maybe Christopher Nolan) will decide to re-do it at a later time, and give it the justice it rightfully deserves!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1400,carldraws,Aptly Titled,4,29 May 2006,"Plainly stated, the latest in the X-men movie franchise is awful. The storytelling is sloppy and the writing unimaginative. ""The Last Stand,"" while based on a decent concept, just riffs off of what had been laid down in previous X-men movies and speaks in stereotypical popcorn-movie dialog.I appreciate that this is a genuinely new interpretation of the X-men (this tale varies greatly from that of X-men mythology) but beyond the basic premise, and one scene (the scene of Angel as a child is horrifyingly touching) the movie is composed of the leftovers from a thousand bad summer blockbusters. After a few scenes, the movie is inundated by bad one-liners, the special effects become gratuitous and the characters fall flat. Major events (the death of a central character) are half-implied or vaguely referenced.The film was a big disappointment for someone who loves the comics and enjoyed the first two films.

1401,ajw204,lousy for x-fans,1,29 May 2006,"if you followed the comic books, or even know the story of behind the phoenix loosely, you will see what kind of hack-job the writers put together. While the acting was fine, and the action was plentiful, it just seemed way too rushed for my taste. Granted, it was a different director, i found that i missed the intimacy the audience had with the characters that was found in the first two movies, even though i'm not a big fan of those either. while they introduced a ton of new mutants, some completely made up hybrids of some of the comic book characters (new name and costume, but with multiple powers), the audience never got a chance to get to know these characters at all. one might argue that that is what the previous two movies were for, but why would the director deviate from this formula when it worked so well previously, especially when introducing more characters than the previous two movies combined? Also, the Halle Berry influence took an obvious toll on the movie's quality right from the beginning. For those of you that don't know, Berry wasn't going to re-sign to play storm unless she got more lines, seeing that she is a bigger star today than she was when the first X-Men came out. That being said, it was better when she didn't say anything at all. in my book, i've disregarded x3 the same way i've disregarded T3 from the series. It obviously made a sharp turn in the wrong direction, an insult to the people who put the previous movies together.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The plot is terrible thin and the actors lost all of they're charisma. The movie is a mix of useless babbling and chaotic scenes, with most of the times not even contribute to the story. I don't think you can make a true x-men movie just by seeing 1 episode or reading 1 comic but I got the feeling that's exactly what happened. A real waste of all the possible characters and they're fascinating stories. I'm sorry to say that the ""last stand"" did nothing for me and even with the great special effects en various humoristic plots; Brett Ratner failed to deliver us a real stand!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1403,sweetsarahsim,"Good, but something of a letdown.",6,3 July 2006,"**SPOILERS BELOW** I'll be frank to begin with: I have never laid hands on an X-Men comic before. Though after watching the movies, I am very interested in reading the comics, I haven't read any before. Only this year did I bother to even watch the first X-Men movies before going out to see X-Men 3: The Last Stand in theatres.I enjoyed the first two movies, the second one especially. So I had no objections to going to see the third movie. It, however, left much to be desired.At first, I was simply confused by Cyclops' sudden vanishing from the cast. Where had this character gone? The worst part about this movie, perhaps, is that of the main five good guys (Wolverine, Storm, Professor X, Jean Grey, and Cyclops), three die, and that the first two deaths are completely anti-climatic. Though main characters actually DO die before final confrontations, the deaths of Cyclops and Professor X seemed just thrown in there. I especially disliked how Cyclops' emotions about Jean's 'death' were so built up and then... BOOM. They switch places, she's alive and he's dead. The only death that really had any drama to it was Jean's second death. As a moviegoer, and comic book fans may disagree considering I have no clue what goes on in the comics, I really was also upset at how Jean was brought back after dying a first time. One thing I usually dislike is an emotional death followed by a rebirth, and worse, a re-death. It's overkill, both on the character and for the poor audience member.But back to the plot. The film seemed rushed in spots and I was upset at how little Rogue was around for and how much we saw of Kitty and Bobby. Though Kitty is an interesting character, I didn't care as much about her as I did about Rogue. I also disliked that Rogue gave up her powers, voluntarily. Though it's somewhat understandable, considering the nature of her powers, it seemed so... unlike the point of the movies. Wasn't it to have the mutants accept themselves and try and get everyone else to accept them too a main theme throughout the movies? As usual, I enjoyed Halle Berry and Ian McKellan's performances, as well as Hugh Jackman's as Wolverine, and I rather liked Pyro. I thought he was rather well-explored in the second film and then executed well-enough in the third. Jean, who seemed to be somewhat the center of this film, was shunted into the background a little too much. It's a shame we could not see into her mind, between the Pheonix and Jean. But that's the way the cookie crumbles.The special effects were, of course, excellent, and I have to say I liked the kid who played Leech as well as the man who played The Beast. I would also like to say that I was annoyed at how little we saw Angel in the film. He did all the things a properly developed character would do, except he didn't have any development in the film at all. I would really have liked to seen more of Angel.On another note, it was also sad to not see any of Nightcrawler in this film, as I really enjoyed him in the second film. It was also rather sad to see Mystique rather thrown to the side after losing her powers. I understand that now that she no longer has her powers she's of no use to Magneto, but she was a character I happened to like and to see her thrown away after she lost her use to her former boss was somewhat upsetting in a way.All in all, the story was good but it was far too rushed and too much proper development was left out for it to be a fantastic film. It was good, but disappointing after the first two, where the development is done much better.I'm looking forward to X-Men 4, with the hopes that it rises back up into the ranks with the first two films, especially the second.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1404,smeoli,Movie was well presented,9,30 May 2006,"This was a great movie. It again linked past issues back together but at the same time introduced us into another dimension. Wolverine is not alone as the hero even though he is the ultimate physical hero - The junior mutants have a bit of fun exercising their features and brain - shown when the young boy is protected during the attack, and Storm saves the school by deciding to run it (not so fascinating but needed to be done in the plot).As always, an institution is saved for the people(mutants)but this is one of the main themes of the movie -saving. Saving the institution, saving the mutants from being mutants, saving the homogeneous people, saving the boy mutant, saving the relationship between father and son, saving Scott from a miserable life without his loved one, saving Wolverine from regretting saving his loved one in the first place(previous movie), saving us from all the bad characters - again. I'm not a fan of the comic books, but loved the movie. Without spoiling the end - some of the more significant characters have a life change - either in the way they physically are, or attitude, or in their role within the school. There weren't any jokes bouncing off any of the characters (except in the first practice fight scene)because of the story line that followed - this was appropriate given the relationships that everyone had in the movie. Some may say that didn't work, but I thought it was required. The action scenes were all relevant for the plot. Only one small criticism - the makeup (except for the introduction) was a bit underdone on most characters. Hence, Wolverine didn't seem to have that healthy good look - This is absolutely necessary in a film with heroes - whether the heroes are female or male (or mutant). Go see it and enjoy!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1405,Pedigog,"Disappointed, but enjoyed.",6,30 May 2006,"As an old fan boy of the comic's I was extremely apprehensive about watching this adaptation. All I have read about this movie was making me feel I was about to waste my hard earn cash on something I would find so disappointing that I would wish all involved (producer's, movie exec's, script writer's ETC.) would be peeled and rolled in salt. Luckily for these people this was not the case. Yes it is rushed, yes it is short and yes the script is poor, but you can't stop watching as you don't want to miss a single bit. Forget everything you know about the comic side of the story and watch as if only the movie side ever existed and you will enjoy this film. Don't wait for the end as you don't feel any better about the return of a supposedly dead character and it will only p**s you off for waiting till the very end, it takes so long to happen the cinema staff were cleaning up around us.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1407,Marx_man,Watch the movie past the credits for and extra bit... Charles and Eric,10,30 May 2006,"Although no real information in this is a spoiler. This refers to the movie. I would advise seeing it till post credits.At the beginning we get a glimpse of their friendship when they were younger but later on see how much respect for each other they have as nemeses but not enemies. Eric or Magneto even tells one of his lesser associates that Charles' past action demands respect. (But not in so many words.)Their repartee would be better described as two friends but on either side of a chess board. And this is usually referenced upon in the movies. Even more so at the end with the usual chess scene albeit lacking a certain something which is a metaphor for Eric's philosophy, waiting for Charles or any other opponent who thinks they can challenge him mentally but you will have to watch to find out magneto's more important discovery by seeing the movie.Also the more important scene is post credits. When I watched it I had the good fortune of having Rhys with me to let me know when to stick around but the amount of people that left the movie and missed the uplifting scene was phenomenal. Down to an entire audience apart from a few who even then some got bored with the credits and left i would advise remaining seated. Although expected if you pay more attention than most it can still be a shock if not closure.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1408,evoshandor79,They just missed the mark by about two feet.,7,30 May 2006,"As I was watching the movie. I found myself invested in the story and the special effects. I was happy to see the danger room, and was very happy to see Beast so well portrayed. About halfway through the movie however, I thought to myself, ""I wonder when they're going to do something with the Phoenix. Sadly, I found out at the end that they won't do anything with her. She had the potential to do some great things not only in the story, but also visually. I never once saw any flames which is kind of what makes her a Phoenix! One point that really bothered me, and I hope that I'm just wrong about this, but I don't think that juggernaut is a mutant. He gets his powers from a mystical gem so he shouldn't have been able to be stopped as he did. All in all it was a fun movie, and if you didn't know anything about the comic book series none of the stuff I mentioned would make a difference. But if you do have knowledge of the comic book you know what could have happened in the story but didn't. My big payoff for the movie was seeing iceman, and see the bouncing Beast doing his stuff!!! It wasn't quite what I hoped for but it could have been much, much worse(need I mention Batman and Robin).",X-Men - The Last Stand
1409,hello_debabrata,Sad end,5,30 May 2006,"I was expecting a lot from the producer, director and writer of the 3rd sequel of X-Men3 but its really sad.firstly, though its a movie based on comic characters as a human being we do relate to the characters and the character of Jean was a positive character which was a main force being X-men 1 & 2 but portraying her in negative image was sad. At least at the end scene the writer could have changed her a bit and fight for the human and x-men cause so that it would have a nice feeling on the viewer.secondly the end of Cyclops, professor and jean was unceremonious. They are powerful characters and should have been given the due importance.thirdly mystique a wonderful character with so many sides could have utilized more than mere prisoner! lastly the character of rogue. It anyone seen the animated version of x-men they will be accustomed with a slim and trim rogue but in the movie they have not selected a character like that.I only praise the movie for special effects. that all!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1410,digital_artisan_219,It's worth the admission price,8,30 May 2006,"If you've enjoyed the first two movies, this one will come as quite a jolt to you. A lot happens in the movie that is totally unexpected, but that's not necessarily a good thing. In order to keep the movie turning on its axis, the script and direction of the movie doesn't actually build a lot of momentum because it pulls itself in too many directions. The main plot centers around a ""cure"" for mutants. This cure creates quite a stir in both the mutant and human society. Some mutants are thrilled at the idea, but just as many are offended at the idea of being considered a ""disease."" But whereas Rogue, who because of her powers can never be touched, should be paramount to the plot, is only a passing interest. The cure serves only to set a target for a large scale battle further on with Magneto and his Brotherhood.The movie sidesteps itself too much to cover the resurrected Jean without much story fed into it. Granted most of the comic book fans like myself will understand everything, but the layperson might not fully understand WHY Jean is back. Suffice to say the effort of saving the other X-Men at the end of X2 took a psychological toll on Jean. She no longer has control of her inhibitions. She's like a little girl: she wants to have fun and throws tantrums when she doesn't get what she wants. Professor Xavier is actually very cold in parts of the film and this puts him at the top of Jean's list. Among this crossweave of plot, Magneto tries to use Jean to help him destroy the facility where the cure is made. There is a terrific battle seen, most notable is Juggernaut chasing Kitty Pryde through walls. Kelsey Grammar's role of Beast plays perfectly and is one of the largest roles in the film. Wolverine is still the center of the film, but he's more into the team in this movie and far less the renegade he was in the first two films. Storm also has more screen time and we see her start taking charge of the school.For all my trashing of the movie, it is still a pretty good movie and its worth six dollars to see, or at least to rent. My largest gripe actually is that the movie is far, far too rushed. For everything that went into it, it could easily have been an hour longer. This would have added a lot of key points and helped pace the film. Angel, Mystique, and Rogue were barely in the movie.If you see it in the theatre: WATCH THE CLIP AFTER THE CREDITS. It's just a short epilogue, but its worth it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1411,rwlee75,Disappointment - only worthy of DVD rental,6,30 May 2006,"Being a X-men comic fan, I still enjoyed the first two movies even though the characters and story lines did not mirror the comics. However, this third installment of the X-men was just a disappointment and you could definitely tell that director Ratner did not get the job done as well as Singer. The story was no good and the new characters weren't developed properly, even their powers were off. Having to follow Singer's direction was definitely tough but with this screenplay I feel sorry for Ratner. Almost seems like this movie was made for a quick buck...The 6 rating is for the special effects but even still this movie is only a DVD rental. Very sad to see, but this last installment of the X-men felt cheesy and rushed much like the first round of Batman movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1412,xmana,"If you're an X-men fan, even the most casual - it's BAD",3,30 May 2006,"I was really torn here how to rate this movie as a movie (passable, maybe), or as an X-men movie. Well I can't view it outside of being an x-men movie, so that's what I went with.The first two x-men movies showed us that we don't need to make up excuses for bad action films just because they're summer blockbusters. They were so good, and exceeded my expectations by such dramatic lengths that I have been waiting for X3 basically since the credits of X2.First of all the deaths. I'm not going to be whiny and say I liked so and so so why'd they kill him. This much fighting by the third movie, it was probably time for someone to go. However, a death scene could have at least been powerful, or at least have meaning. Instead they seemed to signal where the plot was the most lacking, or was took the worst turns. Cyclops had just motorbiked from New York to northern Alberta (ya, OK). Actually, I was liking it at this point. He was showing so anger and some backbone and wasn't going to leave Jean's death in the last movie. There's the bit about the eyes and then...... she kills him. Forget everything about true love the original story was about or that we thought we're seeing at this point, the most major x-man ever is disposed of in a very cliché villain introduction scene.Lastly is Jeans death. The dialog as to why Logan is trying to save her - and then he kills her? ""Greater Good"" ya whatever, let's just leave out that he's basically just lying to her. Let's call this scene for what it is too - the fact that the ""dark Phoenix"" had really only been in the movie so much to show up and throw temper tantrums at convenient times that they really had no idea what else to do with her. A confession of true love and then Jean and Logan get together? Jean's love love of Logan saves her? Jeans death simply serves as a quick fix because the fact is despite having been introduced to violently (a scene that fails the desired effect wholly), the dark Phoenix has really been a non-villain in this plot line. In fact, it's almost like she was thrown in as a requisite of the foreshadowing at the end of X2. Like Scott's death however, it also signals a turning point. This time where not even a sequel could save the down turns the movie has taken the plot.Then there's Xavier's death. It was almost unmemorable at the end of the movie. It was pointless and anti-climatic. The only thing I can think of was that he stood in the way of a dumbed down movie. The ""foreshadowing"" of MacTaggart's comatose man was so blunt it was almost laughable the ""ethical"" question he was asking his class didn't even make sense. I completely knew what to expect as I was watching the credits.As for the mutants that loose their powers? Well only in the case of Rogue's character did it even make sense and she was such a non-entity. Now there was the end scene with magneto - maybe the serum wears off after a long time? I like that message - you can't change what you are. Still, the last quarter second certainly isn't going to save this movie. At the end of the day this movie did have some nice action - but hell they all did. In fact I wasn't even that impressed with the Beast in a fight and I was looking forward to that. What we had were a crap load of great characters getting squashed and replaced with a bunch of kids that weren't even stylized to look specifically like x-men, let alone developed in any way. What were they trying to save make-up costs on the 4th movie? Please leave this series at 3, the first 2 were absolute masterpieces, time to leave well enough alone.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1413,wolverine6104305,It's well what can I say it's x-tastic,9,30 May 2006,"All hail the new guy, and good riddance to bad singers. Supermans loss is X-men's gain. As a fan of the comics I feel this feel that Singer well frankly he messed things up, I felt he didn't get into the characters enough and Wolverine (No bias I swear)under the flag of singer he was well a wuss. The Wolverine under the new guy is how he should be. don't get me wrong the first two films were great films just not the X-men I know and love.Kelsey Grammar was the best possible choice for beast, the voice was perfect, it had the depth and calmness needed for beast with the ability to sound fierce. Hugh Jackman Takes up the claws again ind as usual kick major behind and thanks to Ratner he's allowed to be the violent wolverine he should be. Halle Berry Thankfully takes up the role of Storm and is great, Patric k Stewart and Ian Mckellen are also Perfect.There are some problems that couldn't be solved namely Collosus the Rusky with a heart is well American I Think and a few characters ain't as they should be Namly Jugganaut is a mutant he should in this when in fact he is an ordinary human granted super human strength, he should also be Xaviers brother but there is no mention of it.For fans of singers films beware this is a different type of movie and but it is still great.

1414,andjoshua,Too Many Liberties,7,30 May 2006,"I liked the overall feel of the movie and still enjoyed myself if for no other reason than I have been enjoying the fact that people are taking comic-books seriously as a venue for movie material(sorry for the incredibly long run-on sentence there).The stories are already there and waiting for someone to use them.That having been said this last X-Men movie took amazing artistic license with the characters which didn't need to be taken. Most of the liberties can be understood and even agreed with (ie Peter Rasputin/Colussus not actually being from Russia, Arch-Angel not being an X-Man already along with Iceman, Rogue, Colussus, Siryn, Psylocke, and Nightcrawler, and the Pheonix not actually being a malevolent being from an alien race but simply a manifestation of Jean Grey's Id). But killing off central characters who never die in the comics except in the weird post-apocalyptic future that Bishop inhabits and then only Gambit is alive. Gambit, by the way, one of the central X-men and not in the movies at all except a brief passing of his name on the registered mutants list in the second movie. But making the Juggernaught a mutant!? That friggin' crystal in his helmet is the only way that he transforms from Chris Marko, wimpy half/brother of Charles Xavier to the Juggernaught. Anyways...enough whining from me.And by the way, yes i realize they can bring all the people back from ""the dead"". Since they apparently already did that with Prof. X and you never actually see Scott die so presumably he may not be dead or he may be stuck in the Astral Plane. Jean Grey could also come back to life surviving just as Charles did or they decide that Logan killed her but only killed the Pheonix and they were able to save her body and Jean Grey is still alive.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1416,gantoris2,Xactly what I Xpected,6,30 May 2006,"A pox on Byran Singers house, for as soon as he abandoned the X-men series he doomed it to a sub-par existence. When I heard that Ratner was taking over the project, I imagined many bad things in store for X-3. I thought the characters would have all action and no substance, the story would be mostly pointless, and the overall feeling of the movie just would have the same emotional magic that Bryan was able to bring to the screen. As it turns out, I was mostly right. The character arcs that were in 1 and 2 just weren't continued to satisfaction. The musical motifs were completely discarded except for the opening sequence. The main problem with this movie came from the script/plot. Too many new characters and hardly any thought put into making us care about them. The movie is also riddled with pacing problems. Aside from all these problems... yeah, other elements of the movie were fine. I'd have to say that I enjoyed half the movie; just after I came out of the movie theater I said, ""That was a roller-coaster! Good scene followed by bad scene followed by good scene (and so on) throughout the entire movie!.""

For the rest of us who enjoy the whole movie watching experience, and are fans of X-men...this movie is extremely upsetting and a waste of money and time. Why you ask? Not only do we go from midday to night time in the same scene but also...*Iceman was a part of the original X-men squad, therefore he should be the same age if not a little older than wolverine. *Rogue and Iceman didn't have a thing for each other...that was Rogue and Gambit *Where was the Phoenix? The phoenix is supposed to be a bird shrouded in flames. We saw the outline of the bird in the end of X-men 2. *Who's idea was it to have Magneto and the Phoenix team up? *Juggarnaut was not a mutant, his BELT gave him his super strength... *Why do they make Rogue weak like Jubilee...WHERE IS JUBILEE? *Cyclops, professor X, and Jean Grey are killed... *If Jean Grey and Cyclops are dead, how in the hell could Cable be born? *How did Phoenix appear before Appocalypse? *Dania Ramirez is beautiful...Callisto was transformed into a beautiful model AFTER she took refuge with the x-men...before that she was raggedy, beaten and wore a patch over her blind right eye...To top it all off, Mystique, Magneto, and Rogue supposedly lose their powers to the cure. In the final battle, Magneto sends a group of his mutants towards an army to get them killed. And sits back and watches as all of his ""brotherhood"" is being destroyed. Afterwards, he throws cars at the soldiers and X-men, while Pyro sets the flying cars on fire.

1418,Godlovesyouandihopeyoukn,Surprised,9,30 May 2006,"To me, the first two X-men movies were good and exciting but were not very in touch with the original comics. Little did I expect to be blow away by the intensity and excitement of the third one. With epic battle sequences, amazing special effects, and a great story line, I believe this movie really got in touch with the original comics. Whether it was the new director, the amazing actors, or just the shrill brilliance of the screen writers, I can not say, but I do think that just by looking at the movie's 120 million dollar gross on its first weekend can be proof enough of the movie's success. I expect this movie to do far better than the first two - no matter how good they were. I cannot wait to see if any more movies are to be made.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I went with 3 friends to see this over the weekend. We pre-ordered tickets in the Premier Theater because this was going to be the BEST movie since LOTR and HARRY POTTER. We all were very disappointed. The movie was choppy, rushed, and void of a certain ""reality"" that the first 2 had. Rogue's character had a chance at some great scenes, but the chance wasn't taken. It felt as though the movie was made by someone different... it did not seem to have the same principles that the first 2 were based on. Many horrible things happened without good explanation... we were just supposed to accept simple excuses for very large tragedies. There also seemed to be several errors throughout the film. The movie is well worth watching, but I recommend waiting for DVD. There are a few decent displays of power and a few good concepts.

1420,vision_08,X Men 3 was a Huge Disappointment for All fans!,4,30 May 2006,"Bryan Singer left us for a Superman movie that looks far from promising and we're stuck with a director that obviously knows nothing about the original X-Men comics. How can you create a movie where small-time villains like Pyro and Juggernaut live--and kill off beloved characters such as Cyclops and apparently Xavier - as well as remove beloved characters such as Rogue (who turns her back on her fellow mutants when they needed her most)and Mystique (One of the best-developed villains of Bryan Singer's vision)? Angel was a waste of footage. Why not allow him to battle with the X-Men-What was his purpose? Logan and Jean Greys relationship seemed stronger than that of Jean and Scott. They never even showed Cyclops die - Major disrespect. Xavier is supposed to be an extremely powerful-telepathic and goes out like a punk in 2-3 minutes. And who were these new villains? I never even knew the character names until I looked on IMDb.com, yet their holding their own against the trained and powerful X-Men characters. Callisto could be a formidable foe for a young Storm, but not a poorly developed Callisto. Did anyone even know her name was Callisto? Finally, the movie title is X-Men The Last Stand, so don't leave us thinking there will be a 4th film. The entire trilogy failed to follow the comics and more disappointing was the lack of character introduction. It could have used more depth with characters like Gambit, Bishop, Havok, Wolfsbane, Polaris, Apocalypse, Omega Red, The Blob, Mr. Sinister, and countless more villains-instead we get Club Kid Callisto, Spike? and some other jackass.

1422,LiamJ-1,X-Men 3 aftereffects,7,30 May 2006,"The Last Stand was a movie I highly anticipated, scanning the internet daily looking for the newest photo, or the latest interview. I was eagerly anticipating seeing a bird of fire. The Phoenix saga was altered to be more movie-friendly. There was no celestial bird of fire, but all the tragedy of the Dark Phoenix is there. From the repressed and insecure Jean Grey of the first two movies (did anyone else notice that she looked frazzled and tired?), here she is is in her full power but, of course, she's spinning out of control. Famke is awesome in her powerful cold stares and dimentia, capturing the danger and terror of a ""level 5"" mutant out of control. Brett Ratner made the Phoenix into something demonic, like Jean was decomposing as she was overtaken by her power. It sticks with me. It's creepy and beautiful. And this from a comicbook movie!The Last Stand, as is widely agreed upon now, was rushed and that's too bad. X1 was slow, X2 was a release and X3 was too fast. There were some really corny scenes, too, like Wolverines pep talk--""Sure we're outnumbered, but...we're X-men!"" Certainly no Braveheart here. And Angel-- maybe it's 'cause I'm a guy, but other folks in the theatre laughed as well when angel had his ""big moment""--I think it was his funny facial expressions-- did I see a slight head shift? Like he was saying ""That's right, honey!"" There's a continuity problem with Magneto's army's arrival. Ouch!I like how The Last Stand had a little of the X-banter during fighting scenes--most notabley the scene with Wolverine and Beast.I see the next true X men movie (not just a Wolverine prequel) being the ""Days of Futures Past"" storyline. It was foreshadowed in The Last Stand, and it's the next most memorable story from the comics. Who wouldn't love to see Wolverine have all his flesh burned off in a fastball special? Let the movies continue to develop the characters in to who they are in the comics. Rogue gets her super-woman powers, and the baggage to go along with it. Iceman continues to learn new tricks with his powers. Mystique and Magneto both go through changes of heart. It's all ready to go, and I see this movie as just getting the X movies warmed up.Days after seeing the movie, I'm still thinking about it, breaking it down in my mind. Great action scenes and a valiant effort at putting something so diverse and character-history-heavy as the X-men into a movie. It's a tragedy that speaks its own language, sometimes stuttering or messing up, but it's just great to see my childhood heroes come to life so faithfully and with such a big budget.

It all just felt like it was incomplete. But I think it was still an OK movie...but it wasn't what I was expecting. And about makin a 4th I think they definitely should. In case you are wondering how they can make another one without 3 of the main characters well.....first we don't really ""know"" what happened to Scott...what if she didn't kill him and he was running around with amnesia or something. Even if he was dead...in the comics all 3 of them have died before at least once and have always managed to come back to life....so...and as for some of them not having their powers, the way they ended the movie seems to hint they might get it back.

I have one question, for the time you spent in the cinema were you ever left questioning why have i come for this flick? If yes then i really wanna learn what you guys do for fun. A movie that tries to keep in touch with the earlier parts and doesn't do to bad. It actually feels like a continuation of the previous parts which many sequels lack. At the same time you are introduced to many new mutants who could have more coverage but then the movie would have been for 3 hours or more.Overall a good movie, which is worth every cent you have paid as the action and visuals keep you entertained, AFTER ALL THATS WHAT A CINEMA MOVIE IS ALL ABOUT.

The film impressed me deeply not because of the action sequences or the CGIs but because of the way the characters were playing. This was the end of the X-men saga. I understand the dissatisfied fans that want more and more, but from a story standpoint this was the only logical end - with lots of deaths on both sides. The political moment was necessary, otherwise the influence of the X-men would have been to unchallenged, too overwhelming. This was the best film I saw in the past year.

1426,xoxgirl_interruptedxox,bottom line,6,31 May 2006,"i watched the movie on Monday and i must say that overall, it was not a bad movie. i agree with other people's observation of feeling like the movie was in a rush to end (cyclops and Xavier dying). i also thought that rogue's character was downplayed. i grew up watching the cartoon version of x-men and if memory serves me best, rogue was this strong and persistent woman who, despite her struggle with accepting her powers (because it was interfering with her love life), was able to overcome any doubts about her fate as mutant. she wouldn't be so desperate to become human and give up her powers.i also think the reason why we see all these movie plots involving superheroes saving humanity a lot in the theaters lately (i'd say post 9/11) is due to the the world we live in today. Today, our world has been filled with rampant deaths caused by warfare and natural disasters we are all in search of heroes.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1428,texana13,Good but empty,6,31 May 2006,"I am a HUGE X-fan, and although I liked most of the movie, realistically, it was like a beautifully wrapped gift that ends up being just a box. The action was fantastic and while I am not a big ""character development"" person, a lot of things about the movie didn't make sense. I didn't understand the motivation behind Phoenix's character. It was a little more graphic in the sense that there was a ""gettin' it on"" scene where children will quickly be educated about sex and how you do it. Also, I don't like the use of the b-word in the movie. It was over the top in those two areas. I loved Beast as a character; Kelsey Grammar isn't the first person I would have picked, but after seeing him in action he is PERFECT. In my opinion, he stole the show. Storm's character was still a little weak, and the storyline seemed very tenuous and fragile. The action could not cover up the movie's flaws. It was okay, but I can definitely tell that Bryan Singer didn't direct it. Also, I know movies can be different from the myth, but I really didn't like the total disregard of the spirit of the original stories. The cartoon version of the Phoenix saga did far more justice than this movie did.That being said, it was worth the $7 admission if you're looking for something briefly gratifying, like candy. If you prefer movies that take the original myth/comic/book, etc into consideration, wait until it comes out on video.",X-Men - The Last Stand

After the two first movies, that were awesome, and watching the trailer of that one, that looked just like the best movie ever, I went to see it really happy, expecting to see some more of what Bryan Singer did so great on the first two.Like it wasn't Singer, but Rattner, I expected it to be less intelligent and more action driven.So, the movie started and everything seemed more caothic than the first ones, but then it started to go crazy, everything really rushed, new characters being way important without any kind of explanation, old characters getting out of the movie just for the seek of it. It's hard to talk about the movie without spoiling anything. But what they did in this movie is just a crime.The movie was bad, but the problem is that this is not just a movie, this is part of a saga. It just killed the saga. I have never feel so sad coming out of a movie. Not sad because the movie intended that. Sad for what they have done.I just wished I could erase it from my memory, but I can't, and X-men will never be the same.That movie should have never existed, and I will personally never go see again a movie from Brett Ratner.

This movie is just so wrong in so many areas that I don't know where to start!I understand that this movie was directed by Brett Ratner instead of Brian Singer but I still don't see how things went so wrong. Even if Ratner completely sucks at directing, he still had the first two movies to use as a solid reference. He also had much of the same crew from the first two films and he was surrounded by dozens of film professionals and millions of dollars that were supposed to prevent something like this from happening.Why didn't they notice how wrong things were going? Why didn't they notice that they were creating a film that fails to work with the first two films in virtually every way? Why didn't they notice that they were making a pretty darn bad movie?It's 2006 and they had a $210 million budget .. what the heck is their excuse?",X-Men - The Last Stand
1431,ASberg,Well this isn't very good...,3,31 May 2006,"i was kinda stoked on this movie until i sat down and saw it. i have always been a fan of marvel comics and this just hurts. the first two movies i could bare to see but this is just crap, all they do in this movie is creating big fights and using way too much special effects(although it might be hard to do otherwise). and all the speeching!god its like they have to say some encouraging words every damn minute.then the actors, Famke Jannsen who plays jean has been awful in all these movies, she ""overplays""(överspelar in Swedish,don't know what you say in English)every second of the movie. luckily she doesn't say a whole lot in this one and thats just wonderful. James Marsden is another one who just doesn't have what it takes. but he also lacks space in this one so i just didn't care.Then we have Ben Foster who is kinda good but what i wonder is what his purpose in this movie is. he seems important from the first scene you see him in but then he kinda just disappears but still has a place on the poster...weird.one mistake that they made through the whole trilogy is going too far with this whole wolverine thing,hes my favorite character but its just overkill on how important he is. In this one they added one more to this list, jean gray... they made the most boring character into the most important and most powerful of all, it quite frankly sucks.There's so much more i could say, like that people die left to right, that nightcrawler does not appear and sooo much more.a big disappointment, no a über disappointment.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1432,mojo95128,Mehh,7,31 May 2006,"I saw the third installment this past Sunday. I can honestly say VISUALLY it was absolutely amazing. The special effects and magnification of all the Mutants powers where stunning, but it did fall almost flat short on character development. We are introduced to a handful of new mutants, most of which arnt given the proper introduction they deserved. And it was missing key characters from some of the previous films (NIGHTCRAWLER ehhhem?). Because of this, it made the movie feel somewhat incomplete to me. All in all though, the movie did make a good ending for the series, although the end of the movie AFTER the credits might say otherwise as far as the end of the series.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1433,rsport,Overview of movie,8,31 May 2006,"I thought that the movie was really great and that the plot line moved smoothly through the movie. However, there were many things that bothered me. For instance, the fact that the ""Phoenix"" was not really and alien, but in fact an extension of Jean's own power. This could be possible, but it seems pretty sappy to believe. Die hard fans all know that she was inhabited by an evil alien. Also, I saw how none of the characters were really there anymore. Singer did a great job with developing character's emotions, plot, conflicts of characters, and was able to sprinkle action everywhere with the great climactic fight. Ratner on the other hand sort of blinded you with action and hoped you didn't notice. With that said, I simply thought of the three movies as a live action ""what if"" comic which made it much more enjoyable.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1434,CanadamanEH,What!?!?,5,31 May 2006,"I was so pumped to see X-Men The last stand and Like many people I left the theater very annoyed. There was way to many problems with that movie for me to enjoy it. For one, it wasn't long enough. The plot was patchy at best and they didn't kill off more annoying characters like Storm. They didn't have Gambit, big mistake.If you haven't seen the movie stop reading now.One thing I was wondering was at the end with Magneto sitting in the park... He was just the most wanted man on the planet when he was a mutant but when he becomes human he's just an old man they let sit in the park and play chess? This doesn't make sense.I was also dis appointed with some of the other characters that were added. Angel only have about 3 scenes and had lines in 2 of them. The boy who contains the cure for some reason he just leaves at the end. It was never explained what happened to him.BUT!..I did enjoy seeing Wolverine kick ass (One of the main reasons to see the movie). I'm pumped for his own movie. They did an amazing job on Beast and of course Professor X and Magneto were great. You can really see the difference experienced actors make in a movie.All in all not bad i guess....X-Men 4 maybe???",X-Men - The Last Stand
1435,calvinstacey,Like and dislike,6,31 May 2006,"This movie was a joy-ride from beginning to end. I will have to agree, there were way too many characters and very little time. I had no idea that i was looking at psyclocke. I mean tell me a Lil bit about the who is before me, and why they are important to the movement. The biggest disappointment for me was the fall of two/maybe three of x-men's main characters... without them you have no x-men... without them, the hundreds of comic books that I've read, the Saturday morning cartoons that i have watched would never have happened... because the x-men movie adaptations were very shallow. If i based my views on the x-men universe according to the 3 movies that i have watched...the x-men universe would not be as exciting, and the possibilities would be limited. I seriously think that a 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th movie is needed, because the series do no justice for marvel fans... well at least for me...if Xavier is where he is according to the film, then all of what I've read and watched on TV would not have ever happened... maybe if the they bring Bishop, or cable into the mix, they can go back in time and stop some things from happening and then maybe we could have some truly awesome movie adaptations of the marvel universe",X-Men - The Last Stand

But come on...Why did Jean/Phoenix have to kill the professor??? In my opinion, it is definitely worth the price of admission, heck, I'd even pay to see it twice. But, here is a fair-warning to all of you X-men purists...you will probably be disappointed. You just might leave the theater scratching your head wondering why/how Stan Lee(creator of the series) could sign off on a film that strays SO far from his original premise.

The way it panned out in the end, is that there has to be a fourth one, but everyone has said their wont be. And by the looks of Hugh Jackman making a Wolverine movie, and Halle Berry bitching that Storm has to be the main hero in the group, it doesn't look good that there will be. But after i found out that Fox had confirmed a fourth xmen movie, and a rumor that vinnie( that actor who played juggernaut) had told the media that he signed on for a fourth and maybe FIFTH xmen movie, it sounds like their will be.SPOILER AHEAD! Jean Grey dying at the end made me mad so much, i about threw my keys at the screen in the theater. If Bryan Singer directed this, it would have been a helluva lot better.

I was very excited to see the involvement of new X-men such as Beast (Kelsey Grammar), ShadowCat or Kitty Pride (Ellen Page), Collosus (Daniel Cudmore), The Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), and Multiple Man (Eric Dane). I thought that Brett Ratner (Directer) did an awesome job even after taking the place of the X-Man Bryan Singer. He mixed the right amount of emotion and action and suspense. The best movie of Spring 2006.

Juggernaut isn't a mutant (so wouldn't be affected?) ... but I can overlook that too.Stupid dialogue, unexplained things like: Why did the most resourceful, powerful evil mutants decide to meet in the middle of a damp forest like bandits?How did the Multiple Man (Maddox) lose all the disguises in that forest?Why was Wolverine killing everyone with his claws, even though he's supposed to be such a good fighter?Why was Colossus not Russian?Phoenix waiting and doing nothing at the end? Okay, I can ignore the fact that all the mutants are portrayed as idiots and strangely aloof... but if she can obliterate Xavier and buildings etc. so easily ... what's the lame reason behind her not doing it to Wolverine?

Namely, in the comics, Phoenix is not some whiny uncontrollable teenage-like rage machine that she is in the film. She is an awesomely powerful mutant that uses her powers quite well. She also continues a relationship with Scott (not kill him!). I saw no real reason to add this plot twist.. except for shock value? drama? I don't think it added anything to the film. Also, why did they kill off Xavier and Scott? Again, no real reason for it except maybe for added drama effect. Personally I think they fell short of what could have been major potential. The ending left me wanting more explanation, and overall the film left me slightly confused at the changes and lack of real power.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1444,jmkeeping,X-Men: The Last Stand better then you think...,8,1 June 2006,"Well I am a bit of a later comer when seeing this movie, but I was thrilled with the action and impressed with the effects. The story line was actually well done... but I think maybe the story was a bit overdone which took away from the story.First of all, there are a few little ""nods"" to the comics that people may not even pick up on. For example, Jean did die ( several times and quite recently in fact at Wolverine's hands ) and her first ""death"" was what triggered the Phoenix personality ( in the comics it is a cosmic thing, but I digress ). In fact she was found in a Phoenix ""caccoon"" at the bottom of the East River in New York in an issue of The Fantastic Four, so the way Scott found her in the movie was appropriate. Professor Xavier was assumed ""dead"" early in the comics run and in fact could walk as a young man, and Scott Summers was killed by the mutant Apocalypse and only returned just over a year ago. So to say that neither of these characters have ever been killed is incorrect. Here is the twist... they always, always, always come back. Jean Grey is one of the most resurrected characters in comics history!Okay so we don't get filled in on the back story of Multiple Man or Juggernaut... so? In the first movie, the entire comics continuity of the X-Men is obliterated when we see Logan meet ""Marie"" on the road, and we find out that Jean, Scott and Ororo are some of Xaviers first students. Really? I thought Jean, Scott, Bobby Drake, Hank McCoy and Warren Worthington were. Okay, so things are not EXACTLY the same... but thats doesn't ruin the movie for me. So Juggernaut and Xavier may not be related in the movie... big deal.This movie shows the natural progression of the anti-mutant sentiments growing in ""Marvel- America"". In the first film we see mutant on mutant aggression, in X2 we see human on mutant aggression and in this film we see the progression of this aggression into developing a ""cure"" for the x-factor gene (the comics name for the x-mutant gene). Yes there could have been more character development but I really didn't care too much about the role of the Juggernaut or Callisto or Angel for that matter. I wanted to see the characters I know and enjoy and let me tell you, seeing 3 of them die was tragic... which has translated nicely from the comics. The X-Men have always been about tragedy and overcoming seemingly impossible odds and how much more tragic can you get then having 3 of the ""big guns"" taking the big dirt nap?Seeing the Danger Room was nice and seeing Wolverine eviscerate that Sentinel was very cool (though I wanted to see more then just the head) and finally seeing Storm use her powers to their full potential was truly a treat for the eyes. The cast of mutant was that extensive that couldn't keep track... was that Toad in the church? It was a blast seeing Psylocke ( though she was a baddie ) and what appeared to be a version of the Blob.Overall, very cool movie even if it wasn't perfect, people died and histories changed.

Sorry to spoil for those who haven't seen it, but he wasn't there, and that just didn't click. Because he was in X2 which meant he should have appeared in this one. Still I say go see it.

Endless scenes of constant action. All of the characters were involved in at least one fighting scene. Storm, in this version however is much more powerful than she had been in the previous movies, with lots of flying and spinning, Halle Berri does a wonderful job of bringing the character to light perfectly. With the deaths of Proffesor Xavier, Scott 'Cyclopse' Summers and Jean 'Pheonix' Grey, this movie seems to be the end of line for the X-Men. Brilliant performances from Sir Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackmen and surprisingly, Vinnie Jones give the movie a different range of flavours.

There was little to no depth to any of the characters in the. The film also introduced new characters with no explanation of who they are or their history. They also lost many members of the original cast by killing them off! The film became more about the spectacle than the story. Ratner must have let the inflated budget go to his head because the film is chaotic with special effects that seem to have no logical reason for their inclusion. The fight scenes were also sub par. They felt spastic. Most upsetting of all is they mixed the Pheonix subplot with their lackluster cure plot! The Pheonix is the most powerful being in the universe and she took a back seat to contemporary political garbage that crept into the film. I really don't know how this franchise can be saved at this point. Oh wait I do. Make Bishop come back from the future and change the events of this film. For god sake you can't kill off Prof. X!

1451,Noodlesakadave,A serious disappointment to any real X-men Fan!,4,2 June 2006,"X-men 1 & 2 were good but slightly disappointing as they didn't follow any of the old story line.. The characters were different and the best ones were missing! But this film was the worst of the 3! The storyline had completely changed to what it should have been like and leaving it with an open ending didn't inspire any confidence! To put the Phoenix into the film was a great idea but they ruined it.. Also introducing the morlocks was a good touch but again ruined because most of them looked normal when they're all supposed to look disfigured! Also taking out 6 characters, especially in the way that they did was appalling! I think this film was rushed to an ending! I may sound like a sad comic book nerd but I know what I like and I know this is a serious disappointment for me and people like me! I would just like to add to my comment to say I'm pleased that so many x-men fans agreed with me an raised point I had forgotten to mention! One thing I haven't seen mentioned was the connection between juggernaut and xavier.. they're supposed to be brothers yet that was never brought into the film.. and also the fact that juggernaut isn't even a mutant was neglected! Juggernaut only has his powers due to an artifact he found after being jealous of his brothers power! but in the film when he was near the boy, he lost his powers, which shouldn't have happened because the boy only has the power to suppress the mutant gene! The phoenix was also ruined.. That was a great storyline but completely changed into them saying the phoenix was created by xavier limiting jeans powers! They also missed out Rogue getting her powers and missed out the whole thing with mystique being her mum.. but i'll leave that for now! There are a few things I would love to see in a film.. in X-Men i would love to see Gambit and Mr Sinister make an appearance as well as the storyline with Forge, Bishop, wolverine and storm in the future! A spiderman film I would love to see would be when maddam web puts spiderman through trials and the last trial is where he can choose any marvel hero's to join him!

1452,driftreality,X-Men 3 was no good,1,2 June 2006,"There is a US government-supported anti-mutant campaign; Magneto wants to respond to the US government plot violently while Xavier stresses the need for diplomacy; Rogue laments her powers; Wolverine experiences internal strife; and Jean Gray dies at the end. Yup  that's the basic gist of X-Men 2. Unfortunately, all those things happen in X-Men 3 also.Sometimes it is cool if different things happen in a sequel. The film would have been more original if they had just taken X-Men 2 and re-dubbed it so everyone had French accents. I'm not even joking when I saw I would have enjoyed it more this way.The only discernible difference is that they throw in a random assortment of mutants with lame powers. One mutant's power is that he vomits black liquid on people. I can name three people in my student hall who have this same 'power'. Next time they want to think about adding new mutants to the film, they should bring in a consultant, like a five-year old kid for instance.If you are interested, I have written a full review on http://www.driftreality.com/london/xmen3.sucks.html",X-Men - The Last Stand
1453,rscott282,Huge SCRIPT Disappointment but X4 can redeem,3,2 June 2006,"I don't know where they pulled the writers from but now I realize why Bryan Singer (Director - X1,X2) said no thanks to X3. X3 had so much ability to pull off a final stand. X men DON'T die! Not like this story told anyway. No depth into how the ""Cure"" worked. The explanation of Jean's powers was awful. I don't have any doubt in my mind I could have wrote a script to end the Trilogy on a high note. Too bad Tolkien wasn't around to end this story. Then I think Bryan Singer would have thought twice about doing Superman over X3. There is hope though. I know I know X4 will never happen and the end of the ""DC comics to movies"" seems to be approaching rather quickly. But I think a beautiful story like X1 and X2 deserves an ending like LOTR3. The story is salvageable though. Apparently magneto was able to keep his mutant powers(thank god they left something), Therefore the ""cure"" could be brushed off as a temporary cure in X4. Now you have mystique back along with magneto, rogue, etc. etc. Now as for Scott, Jean and Prof X, well Jean is the Phoenix, and the Phoenix represents life and resurrection. Just bring them back to life, but don't let X3 writers near the script or it will end up being ridiculous. Now for the ultimate ending, Apocalypse. They'll need all the X men to take this guy on. Nightcrawler, Gambet, Jean, Jubilee, Beast, WOLVERINE, Cyclopes, Rogue, ETC, ETC. It's doable but the movie will have to last at least 2.5 hrs. It'll take a good 45 min to an hour to undo the crap of X3. Oh well, I can dream anyway!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1454,nightwingtdu5154,What about Cable,8,2 June 2006,if you are a true x-men fan and you have seen X3 then you will know that the 2nd best character next to Wolverine is Cable and because of this movie he can never exist. ( and I know that there is a difference between Madyln Prior and Jean Grey ... but) I think the only way to redeem this movie is to allow for a little time traveling action so the core characters can live and die like the comics intended.I understand adapting the story line to fit a movie but to kill off characters that are still alive in the comic is crazy.Plus it destroys all hope of the existence of Cable and with out Cable the future is doomed ... wait ... what a villain for X4.Besides that the ending of this movie just craps on the entire X-men universe. I think we should start a online protest so that X4 can live on and bring back some of our fallen heroes.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1455,sjt-songs,just about perfect,10,2 June 2006,"This film is part of a trilogy. And it ended wonderfully. When watching it i remembered the return of the Jedi. the pace was the same. no need for character development just an inevitable build to an explosive war.a few poetical endings and a few surprise endings. contrary to criticism storm is portrayed as a replacement leader having to support everyone and give wolverine a few home truths. the surprise hero is shadow cat ( wait and see) the whole team pulls together well, and there are some very moving moments. magnetos situation at the end is very thought provoking. easily an exceptional film. i have come to the conclusion that a lot of critics want to display there intellect rather than giving a realistic appraisal of a film. Brett Ratner did good !",X-Men - The Last Stand
1456,deluxe2103,does not follow comics so much,9,2 June 2006,"I thought that this movie was really great, it had everything i wanted in the first two movies that was never delivered. However, i must say that i have never favoured Wolverine as a favourite and always thought of him as a minor character, especially since he is dull and his powers are not that special. he has knives in his hands whoop. I did like the fact that Storm got a bigger part and actual powers this time. But what is up with the Rogue storyline. Without spoiling it for everyone, they have ruined her. Lets just say if they choose to make another film i doubt she will be in it, she isn't dead but just not major like in the original cartoon. I would not go and see a movie about wolverine because he sucks and to be honest all he does is growl. I think they should make the movie about how rogue gets her powers from Miss America and begins to fly and lift buildings etc. As a plot for the next x men film BRING BACK APOCALYPSE we loved those story lines, he was amazing. p.s. Grey House scene was really good!!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1457,yagdrissl,Better than most people think,8,2 June 2006,"I have seen a lot of criticism for this movie and most of it is undeserved. First this series of movies is inspired by the comics and not intended to be a direct copy and should be viewed thusly. I keep hearing people complain about the death toll and number of characters de-powered. To the latter, I just say pay better attention. The end of the movie implies that the effects of the vaccine is temporary so Mystique, Magneto and Rogue will be fine. Xavier is de-bodied but not dead. You never actually see Cyclops die and as for Jean Grey, well, if they stay true to the idea of the comics, then it wasn't her that died, it was a clone body created by the Pheonix force. They are probably in a hut somewhere in the woods waiting for the sequel. The only character that really got messed up was Juggernaut. Making him a mutant instead of powered by mystical means, lowering his power level and having no mention of his ties to Xavier sucks. Otherwise, while the movie may have been a little rushed, it was exactly what I expected it to be. It forwarded the over plot from the beginning two movies and at least touched on every character in some way (save Nightcrawler). The problem is not the director or the script or the actors, who all did at least passable jobs. The problem is the subject matter. This set of comics is a veritable saga with hundreds of characters and subplots. It is impossible to pay attention to everything fairly and not have the movie run 5 hours. While this would be fine for the die hard fans, most movie goers would get bored or have their bladders bust before the end. So the end result is that in order to have an interesting movie that at least pays a basic respect to the comics but also maintains the average viewer's interest, you are going to have several things glossed over and this is an acceptable loss. Good movie, I will buy it when it comes out on DVD.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1458,wishwaster101-1,Good but...,7,2 June 2006,If your a die-hard X-men fan whether the comic or the cartoon series you will find several flaws with this movie. Most notable is the way the professor is displayed. It is similar to the problem harry potter fans had with GoF. I found myself almost grinding my teeth in anger. However if you are just looking for a good movie with decent to good action then this is the movie for you. It does not take long to get into the movie it starts quickly. The movie flows well. It leaves it open for another or possibly even a spin of with a couple of characters. I was not happy with the movie but once i convinced myself that it was just a movie and to forget the accuracy I was able to enjoy the second half of the movie and after i left the theater the entire thing.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1459,emil-79,What a disappointment...,3,2 June 2006,"With the exception of some visually impressive battle scenes and cutting edge special effects, there's not much to like here. Wooden characters, underdeveloped characters, ""out of character"" characters, BAD BAD BAD dialogue, uneven pacing, questionable plot lines, and an underwhelming finish.True comic book fans will be frustrated by the misrepresentation, simplification, or lack of attention given to otherwise interesting characters (Archangel, Juggernaut, Colossus) while non-fans will just be left scratching their heads due to the lack of any character development.Bryan Singer did a fantastic job with the first 2 movies. His absence is dearly felt. The Last Stand felt more like the Last Gasp.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1460,missed_promises,What A Movie!!,9,3 June 2006,"My god, that was good. Particularly enjoyed Multiple Man, and, of course, the incomparable Pyro. And when I saw Multiple Man, I was like: OMG, It's McSteamy! (Grey's Anatomy fans know what I'm talking about)SPOILERISH PART I miss Scott. I never liked him, and now I miss him. Even though I was a Logan/Jean person. The end was so sad, too! All in all, well worth going to see. You don't even have to have seen the two earlier ones. Just go see it. Even if just just want to see Ben Foster's (Angel's) chest. Cause that was a definite highlight. Mmmm. And Kelsey Grammar dressed like a Lion/Dog.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1461,Keepitstrt,All things Considered,10,3 June 2006,"This movie, though not as highly anticipated as others such as Star wars or LOTR, has easily won the top spot in the box office and that alone should be enough to tell you this movie moves well with the already set storyline from X1 and 2; and creates open aspects for later movies that can be relied upon such as what role will Angel play or the return of Magnetos power. And for those of you that did Follow the old cartoon and/or comics what about Apocalypse? And for those of you who say the production and all that was bad, did you know that the producer and crew of X1 and 2 walked out on this project at the LAST possible second to go and make a poor movie like Superman? I say the producer (who made the TV series Prison Break) did an Excellent Job making this movie on the fly and should be congratulated for the amazing special effects and Great acting.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1462,Dyf91,"Good film, some flaws",10,3 June 2006,"I loved this movie, the action and emotions are brilliant and the plot worked well, not as well as it could of done though. My only complaints are that some things are missed out from the comics and t.v shows. Cain Marko and Prof. X are step/half-brothers but there is no mention of that there, and I'm pretty sure Callisto had different powers....but at least they kept the element of her rivalry with storm. The Pheonix was originally good before it turned bad, not just evil right away, and the thing that annoyed me the most is ....ROGUE LOST HER POWERS!? come on! whats with that?, she's barely in the film to start with which annoyed me, but then you make her lose her powers at the end, that's just too much, I know her ""gift"" makes her incapable of physical contact, but she's offered a cure on the t.v and refuses it!...Why do that to one of my favourite characters? if the x-men films truly do stop on this one I will be severely disappointed, because I'm hoping that in the fourth other mutants (rogue and mystique) will start to get their powers back like magneto already has. (If rogue does you can tell it will be at the most awkward moment for her and bobby) another idea for the fourth would be to add more fan favourite characters like gambit, and maybe bishop, hes a cool guy.On a good note for the film, the beast was brilliant, and Kelsey grammar played him really well, the final fight scene where they have to hold the line, the beasts fighting in that was brilliant. As usual Hugh Jackman played wolverine very, very well and Halle Berry was amazing as storm (if there is a fourth she may not come back :S) And as always Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian Mckellen were superb, the scene at Jean Grey's house was one of my favourites (despite how it eventually turns out.) Just another little thing thats been bugging me, after the credits Prof. X comes back in the body of that man we saw in the t.v during one of his classes early on. If there is a fourth, would it annoy anybody else is Patrick Stewarts voice came from that body? hmmm...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1463,haridbo,My opinion,9,4 June 2006,"Yo, people!I've recently watched ""X-Men 3"" and I found it nice. Yes, I agree that this is a new approach on the subject, but I found this plot very interesting. I believe that the movie didn't lack continuity and it's special effects rocked. To support my statements, I wanna point out a crucial moment for the movie's continuity: The moment of the attack on Alcatraz. Somebody stated that daylight disappeared and it suddenly became dark. If you take a better look at the background (behind Magneto's scene), you will be able to notice how the Sun is setting. :)Another thing about the other goofs that some users spotted, like Logan's underwear. People, some things can't really be shown on screen :D ! As for the wounds that vanished into thin air: Remember Logan's ability to heal fast!! X-Men is an action SF film after all... Somebody didn't get the why was that little boy The Cure. It's because he had neutralizing powers like Rogue, only on a higher level :)). I conclude my critique by saying that although this movie has allot of action and a huge collection of mutants, the first two are deffffinately better.~CK~",X-Men - The Last Stand
1464,capt_ofthe_serenity,Best movie ever!!!,10,3 June 2006,"I can't believe how amazing X-men: the Last Stand is. As a huge fan of everything X-men, I went into the theater expecting another great movie, but I got more than that. I was completely thrilled by the special effects and the twist full plot line. The way the movie first flashes back 20 years to when Jean was a girl is perfect for introducing Jean Gray's dark side, the Phoenix. I cried at least three times during The Last Stand. I can't believe the original X-Men die. I'm devastated. But having Storm as the new leader of the X-men is very comforting. The saddest part of the movie for me wasn't the first death, but the very ending of the movie. And I wasn't sad for Jean, but for Logan! How terrible... Watch this movie! You WON'T be disappointed.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1465,DarthErevos,Extra scene!!,8,3 June 2006,"I was anticipating that movie since the day I saw X2! I can say that my anticipation was not in vain! Amazing movie although there were some things that would make the movie even better. Lets start with the good part though. Very nice storyline, photography, soundtrack, action scenes and special effects. More Wolverine scenes, new amazing mutants, better performance from Halle Berry, Kelsey Grammar was awesome as Beast and last but not least.. Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen were for once more....simply....excellent! Now there were a few things that personally I didn't like. Why didn't they put Nightcrawler in the movie? The spectators at the end of X2 think that he becomes a X-Man too(when X-Men say to the President that they will always be there and camera shows Nightcrawler too) so they expect to see him in X3. Also, Angel appears only during few scenes while in many posters we can see him wearing the X-Men uniform. I believe that the movie would be even more amazing if it had those two characters more. Finally, I think that the movie should be 2 hours long at least cause people don't form nice first opinion when they see a movie's length being less than 2 hours. One last thing though..I couldn't watch the extra scene cause our cinemas here stop the movie a few secs after the credits begin so If anyone has seen it..please let me know!!Anyway, congratulations to the movie cast and crew..they did an excellent job and I hope to see them all back in X4!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1466,thepuckadelic,Comic fans should revolt!,5,3 June 2006,"For a comic book fan this movie is shameful. Every true fan knows what I am talking about. As mindless summer fun, sure whatever. Bret Rattner should have stayed with Superman because he did nothing for the X-Men. They should call the movie Wolverine and his friends the X-Men. Maybe the upcoming Wolverine solo movie will be called ""Wolverine 4: Screw the rest of the team."" I gave this a 5 because beast was cool and half of the story was tolerable. My wife really liked it and she has never read a comic in her life. I see this as a problem. I would hate to say don't go see this movie because if ticket sales aren't good than they might not make another movie to fix what they did wrong in this one, but don't give them anymore of your money. Buy the comic and read!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1467,antifitness,How did this happen?,5,3 June 2006,"The first Xmen movie was relatively good with slight flaws, it lacked character development, it was too short, etc. The second corrected those mistakes, yet something was still missing, it was just short of perfection. In walking into the Last Stand I had high expectations and was convinced the problems would be fixed entirely, making this movie the best of the three and closing the series well. Though the movie was not bad, I was met by as shorter film than the first with a frail plot. The movie lacked the flow and satisfaction of the first two, to me the plot was more flawed than the first. Where I expected excellence I found mediocrity, and left the theater in crushing disappointment. If you don't enter the theater with the high expectations I had, you will probably be satisfied with it, but it is undoubtedly the worst of the three. I didn't know whether I wanted to cry or punch something for what they did, it had such great potential.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1468,flex1500,The Last Stand?,7,3 June 2006,"If you have not seen the movie you might not want to read this!!! I'd like to preface this by saying that I thought the movie was awesome! Having said that though I'd also like to say that as a die hard comic book reader I was disappointed by the story line. I was OK with the slight changes in the first XMEN flick and X2, but I felt that X3 went far outside of the boundaries. In other words, if the movie had not been produced in the way it had it would have felt like the Batman movies that got kind of cheesy. It bothered me that they hyped the Iceman vs. Pyro scene and it only lasted a short time. Also, the fact that Nightcrawler was left out did not sit well with me. I would have rated the movie higher if Wolverine and Colossus would have had better fight scenes.Even after all that I must say that it was awesome!!!

1469,Carykidz,What were they thinking Again?,3,3 June 2006,OK please someone explain to me what was going on. I don't understand the fact that the characters were completely and totally undeveloped.Things that you don't do with great franchise movies.1. You don't take out the greatest person working on the project. (Singer what happened buddy) 2. What is with all the characters and the lack of development? Multiple Man best example of a possibly decent character gone wrong.3. WTF! Who kills off the professor and brings him back in some other disabled guy's body.4. Ummmm.... there was something missing *poof* OH NIGHTCRAWLER!!! Who cuts out night crawler then you have to play a game to find out why.5.SFX everywhere i mean left right up down and between u and me they weren't that great.6. Frankly I was over all disappointed with the whole character plot development thing obviously during X-men training 101 every flunked.In closing the next X-men movie should have a few note worthy characters... GAMBIT!!! Hasn't it been long enough? And if you are going to make a ton of dumb endings and then gonna try to end the franchise that is complete and total BS.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1470,khre,Does not follow comics storyline,7,4 June 2006,"OK...this may contain a little bit of spoiler, but I'll try to avoid the specifics. I do like the cast of characters....wish there were more xmen to do the final fight. Wish they had Gambit and Jubilee in there. Well, in terms of mutants being killed, this movie does not follow the original storyline at all. Much of the plot is made up and out of sequence from the original story.This movie is filled with awesome special effects, but the plot is flawed....very flawed. There is so much potential with this plot, but they blew it. They underused some major characters (Angel), and overused some less significant characters (Pyro). I still like Jean Grey. She is a hottie and she is really powerful this time around. As I said, the special effects were awesome. That last scene where Wolverine was literally skinned alive was truly incredible.

1472,ben-1284,Left me confused and disappointed,3,4 June 2006,"Many of the points I could make have probably made all ready, so i'll just stick to my personal opinion. (Also, this review contains no spoilers, based on the assumption that you guys know that you haven't seen the last of Jean/phoenix!)I am not a mad X-men Fan. I do not read the comics, but I have See the cartoon. However, i can honestly say that it does not take an x-man genius to discover th plot holes and awful character development. This film made me realise something very important about the relationship between action and storyline.In the other x-men movies, it was easy to attach to characters. They were warm and real. This made it all the more exciting when they discovered/used their powers. However, the 3rd movie is just plain bland. If characters are not believable, then nor will their super human powers. Jean/phoenix was a disappointment. She should have stayed in that dam lake. It is clear she was only used as the big scary ""super power"" that was invincible, rather than the character known as phoenix. In fact, you see more of the ""Phoenix"" is x-men 2. Hugh Jackman (wolverine) just seemed bored and unmotivated (awful one liners). The ratio between character exposure in the advert and in the film is completely unbalanced. I was amazed at how little Angel appeared (dude with wings).Anyway, I conclude by saying if your an X-men fan, you will come out of this movie more confused than phoenix. If your a movie enthusiast, you'll come out feeling more confused than pig in a lake. And if your just looking for an action movie, you will still come out confused.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1473,useful_moose,Waste of time and money!,2,7 June 2006,"Really, really, really, disappointing. Magneto's intelligence drops according to the needs of the plot. Wolverine's personality changes from scene to scene in a way that not even Hugh Jackman (a good actor) can make realistic. Squandering the emotional value of characters deaths by handling them so badly, you barely care. There are loads of other things wrong with the film that I can't be bothered to type out. Shitty pacing, weak jokes, inconsistent characterisations, plot holes and a highly dubious moral message. There was dubious morality in the previous films, but there, there was an awareness of it. Here the director just has the ethical development of a five year old.Oh God, this sucks. Don't go and see it. Really.

1474,y-gebara,underwhelming,4,4 June 2006,"I'm sadly disappointed at the third and last(?) installment of the X-men trilogy. I am a huge fan of the first two and was excited to see the final piece of the puzzle. I was concerned when I found out that Bryan Singer had left the project to direct Superman Returns, but I hoped that the aspects of the first two films that I so enjoyed would carry on the tradition. Wow, was I ever mistaken. To kill off Cyclops and Professor Xavier, neither of whom die in either the cartoon or the comic books to the best of my knowledge, seemed unnecessary and done purely for shock value. As well, where was Sabretooth, Jubilee, and why were Arcangel and Rogue just glazed over? Famke Janssen was grossly underutilized, apparently being the most powerful creature on the planet renders one silent and paralyzed, because she did little more in the movie than stand and glower. I even forgot she was there in the climax a couple of times because she was so inactive. The first two films had great dialog- funny and witty, as well as realism. This one felt two dimensional, I actually felt bad for the actors having to deliver these clichés, remembering that the first two movies demonstrated that they were capable of delivering more engaging dialog than, ""way to go, Furball."" Seriously. And the TERRIBLE editing error in the climax when the 'last stand' begins to take place broad daylight magically switches to nighttime...wow, millions of dollars spent to make this movie and that's what happens? Apparently there were tidbits for those who stuck around after the credits, but I was not one of those, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater...I was actually laughing about how poorly it was done...Shame on you Bryan Singer for abandoning such an excellent movie and leaving it to be undone, for the actors to become marginalized by the action, and the story to be left in the dust, while special effects reigned supreme.",X-Men - The Last Stand

It had great special effects and some good action sequences. But it almost seemed like that's what they focused on, the action. A whole bunch of the main characters in the previous 2 movies had smaller parts. And I'm not sure if the name is exactly fitting because they left it open for another movie. Also I felt like this movie was a little extra violent.The first two had their share but within reason. This one people were dying left and right and without very good reason I thought.

I was an avid comic book reader and X-Men cartoon fan. So for them to end it like this was a catastrophe. I hope they surprise us later and make another one, to make up for the bomb they created. Other than that, Wolverine, Storm, Jean-Grey, and even Magneto, were very well portrayed. The other characters though were not emphasized enough and allowed to be understood and loved. Also, given more time, and elaboration the movie might have got a little less bad feedback. Nothing like the comics and cartoons, that we all enjoyed. Its worth watching, only if you want to be disappointed.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1478,Alertas,A Great Disappointment!,1,5 June 2006,"The Last Stand should have been a Sequel, and as such should follow the previous movies' story and characterization. In my humble opinion it was a bad movie, failing to comply to every minimum of filming quality standard and had nothing to do with the very good X- Men and X2. And to explain myself, it was not a bad movie for comic fans, but a bad movie in general. Let me take this step by step:Gaps in Scenario/Writers' short vision: --Characters died without reason and no consequence to the killers' psychological traits. Jean Grey killed Cyclops and the Professor, why not kill everyone else too? Why not destroy all of new York, she seemed demented enough to do it and most capable of it. The loss of two of the main X-Men protagonists should lead to something other than ""oh, the filmmaker is so cool, he killed main characters!"". --Magneto could have Wolverine killed with a snap of his fingers. The Adamantium covering his bones and claws is indestructible, but his skeleton's joints aren't. Logan's limps would be easily scattered at the far corners of the earth. Instead of that, he just tossed him on trees and to the ground. He could have even stripped him of his Adamantium, leaving him more vulnerable and less dangerous, if he wanted him alive for some reason or personal agenda. --Magneto got Phoenix to his side just to have her watch him. He lured the most powerful mutant to follow him but he had no role for her. --Magneto moved the bridge (he could have lift a couple of mutant-manned buses, but anyway...) during daytime but he set foot on Alcatraz at night. --Again Magneto, used many mutants as ""pawns"" and let them become humans. He did to them what he didn't want the government do. --Kitty's superpower is to pass through solid objects. A power that could lead to harming herself or others, something similar to Nightcrawlers teleporting , when materializing in between them (remember Nightcrawler's fear in ""X2""). When she left Jaggernaut halfway within the floor, he should have died an agonizing death. --Wolverine's healing factor couldn't have saved him during the end. But even if the healing process was kicking in that fast, he should have been thrown miles away by the Phoenix, like a feather blown by a tornado. --Wolverine used four vials to ""cure"" Magneto of his ""mutantness"", but kept none to help Jean. Instead of the claws at the end, he could have easily stab her with a needle with the serum, but that wouldn't be ""cool"" and couldn't prove his ""love"", right?Worst Moments: --Angel's only Role was to save his father --Colossus was good in moving a TV around the mansion and tossing Wolverine. --There was a ""Ministry of Mutants"", something like Harry Potter's ""Ministry of Magic"". --Storm was not creating a twister, she was becoming one. --On Xavier's grave there was that ""coin"" of Julius Ceasar or Octavius, whatsoever. --The Brotherhood of Mutants was a bunch of hip-hop gangstas, all dressed in hoods. --Xavier dissolved in ""triangles"", drawn by a Voodoo FX's PC graphics board that brought special FX back to the video-games of the '90s. --Some characters' names, apart from Wolverine's and Storms', were all replaced by petty nicknames in every chance throughout the movie; it was mostly Tinman and Furball instead of Colossus and Beast.Comic Fans' Disappointing points: --The ""Phoenix Saga"" could easily be a trilogy all by itself. The Hellfire Club, Starjammers, Lillandra and the Shi-ar Empire; major drama, super-hero action, explosive moments, unexpected finale. By stripping it from exaggeration, the parts with the alien civilization and the devouring of a galaxy by the Phoenix, it would fit right into Singer's realistic vision of the X-Men. --Two of the core characters of the comic series, Cyclops and Professor X, ""died"" without reason and consequence. --Colossus was not Russian. --Kitty Pryde flirted Iceman, not Piotr. --Callisto had the super-powers of Calliban and the Quicksilver. --Jaggernaut was a mutant and the helmet was just an ornament, not a psychic blocker. --Iceman ""iced-up"" for 7 seconds. Colossus ""armored-up"" for a couple of minutes. --The ""Fast-Ball-Special"" maneuver degraded in a ""Hey, Tinman, toss me!"". --Rogue again didn't ""power-up"". --Instead of using well-known mutants -they're hundreds of them- the assault was made by no-bodies, without the slightest sense of uniforms, with messed-up, vague superpowers.Director's ""Touch"": The scenes were staged in a mediocre way and the cameras were set with no imagination. There are TV-films that the X3 have much to be jealous of. With only a little pleasant surprises -the flight of Angel, Magneto's attack to the police convoy and Jaggernaut Vs Wolverine-, Ratner's vision of the X-Men fell far behind his predecessor's genius film-making. If only Fox had decided to wait for Singer's return from Superman's filming, or even if Wenton would step-in, even at the last minute, the viewers would have a Major Trilogy to remember.Overall: A pity...!X-Men's Last Chance?",X-Men - The Last Stand

1480,amcdonald-5,The Best Honest X-men 3 review. (WRITTEN by X-MEN COMIC FAN),7,5 June 2006,"X-men the Last Stand was a fairly good movie, I admit I was entertained, but the movie had many flaws.The first thing wrong with the X-men movies were they had only half of the main X-men who literally make X-men what it is. In X-men issue #1the first X-men were Professor X(1,2,3), Cyclops(1,2,3 barely), Jean Grey(1,2,3), Beast(3), Angel(3) and Iceman(3). In the '70s night crawler(2), Colossus(3), Wolverine(1,2,3), Storm(1,2,3), Rogue(1,2 barely 3) and Shadow Cat(3) were added. X-men Movie #1 Only 6/12 of these characters were introduced, in the 2nd 7/12 were introduced. By the third they managed to have all 12 characters introduced but sadly too late. There was not enough time to introduce these complex characters, but it was cool to see the ""missing"" X-men in 3 even if only for 10 or 15 seconds.After you realize half of the ""movie X-men"" are missing more problems arise... the personalities of the existing ""movie X-men"" are also missing or warped. In the comics the X-men are all oxymorons of their powers... in the movie they basically only have their powers but missing their unique personalities. The people who made the X-men movies only saw the powers and not the characters associated with the powers.The movie was pretty good though, good action scenes, good acting, nothing really wrong more good than bad. For an X-men Fan movie scores 3/10, for the average joe who has no idea what the X-men are 7/10. If you want an excuse to see a movie and you have already seen Davinci Code and Mission Impossible 3, this movie is worth seeing.PS: isn't the phoenix suppose to represent something of a bird? I think a flaming bird would have been cool at least...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1481,pulchra_of_excessum_vene,The Basis of this movie did not follow the comic book.,1,5 June 2006,"I grew up on X-men, and Marvel. This Movie was supposed to show the Dark Phoenix and the story line of the Cure. While I'm all for the Dark Phoenix Showing up in the movie the way it was done led me to believe Hollywood has once again destroyed another great saga. Proffesor X is not supposed to die in fact he lives on even after everyone else has left. Jean Grey couldn't kill Scott if her life depended on it in the Comic Book Series. The Danger Room was treated like a toy almost. Wow, can we say major no no in the Scott Hand Book of the Danger Room. Mystique losing her powers was another mistake. And the worst part of all was they treated Rogue like a cameo role, Toltally throwing out the fact that Miss Marvel dies giving her powers to Rogue and that Rogue loses her taste over Ice Man. Yeah the special effects were great, but what are effects with an awful plot and total destruction to the series. Jackman once again pulled off the Wolverine...but my question is what happened to the wolverine that the comic book series showed would kill before allowing rogue to go out on her own again....Am i missing something here....",X-Men - The Last Stand
1482,gkremian,"Excellent and entertaining, with a couple flaws",8,6 June 2006,"While offering dazzling visual special effects, fantastic action sequences, and the end of the story, X-Men 3 creates an exciting and entertaining summer film that is only offset by the certain ignored elements of plot.X-Men 3 introduces several new characters, mainly minor ones, that are not given enough development or character background. Even the old characters have certain aspects in their behavior that are not fully explained unless you are familiar with the X-Men comics. A lack of general character development may bore many of the more psychological based audience, although those that have a love of action films will be pleased.The special effects in the movie are absolutely stunning, including many of the scenes that are based around senseless violence, and the opening scene with 20 years younger Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart.If you are not familiar with the X-Men storyline, I highly recommend seeing the previous two films before going to see the third. They will clarify some aspects of the movie that may go otherwise unnoticed, and they will provide the character development for the veteran characters that is not found in X3. However, this film has certainly triumphed over the other superhero films to have recently come out, and most should find the film generally entertaining.There are also two endings to this movie: One is the selected ending (before the credits), and the second is after the credits. Stick around and watch it, don't just get up and leave!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1483,shankar_sk,Xcitement unlimited,9,31 July 2006,"I think the movie was indeed proved to be a last stand for the x-movie trilogy as well as for the x-men, unless someone wishes to start it all over or trying an individual x-centered movie. It maintains the high grade of intensity right from the first initial scenes towards the ending ones. The special effects & the accompanying action which proves to be a by-stander was absolutely awesome making your jaws drop. However, it seems to have been hurried up somewhat to make it the last stand. I'd say its a definitely must watch. Hugh Jackman definitely stands out above the rest.Even though some may not be happy the way the movie evolved but i will stand by the movie for a 9/10 rating.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1484,guy-schellens,Disappointing end to a trilogy,4,7 June 2006,"I went to see X-Men: The Last Stand a few days ago with two adolecents(13 and 16). They actually liked EPIII, so I guess they were accustomed to bad acting disguised by great special effects. They also saw the first 2 incarnations and some X-men cartoons (but read no comics, as most kids are now to lazy to read). I think this is exact the public this movie is aimed at. But guess what: they didn't buy it (either)...The obvious reason: Bryan Singer left for Superman and took a lot of creative staff with him, and it shows. I guess this is how it went: they figured they had only one shot left with the current cast. Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman probably had their financial and creative demands.Moreover, some of the cast indicated they wouldn't be back for a fourth movie. X-men doesn't make sense without professor X so Brett Ratner had to replace Patrick Stewart, hence the disintegration. I wonder if this coma-guy will be bald and in a wheelchair too? This also resulted in killing or ""curing"" some other cast members and introducing a whole bus load of new mutants (something Bryan took two movies for).I honestly think Brett tried to make the best of a bad situation but forgot that sometimes ""less is more"". The whole movie/theater experience is all about getting sucked into the story and caring about the characters. It's not about jumping from one location to another to see some fighting and special effects. Nor is it about adding subplot after subplot to make it's 104 Min's full.Ironically, its premise is quite ambitious but I never had the feeling the movie dealt effectively with the issues it tried to touch (racism, terrorism). In stead the plot is mostly used as glue for the action sequences. In the first two movies, the action supported the drama. I really cared about what happened to Jean: what an heroic way to die, saving your comrades. We all were curious about the history of Wolverine, we all felt sorry for Rogue. Singer was also able to dose. We even could understand Magneto to some extend. Of course, this is the 3rd movie, so the main characters needn't to be introduced anymore. More reason to develop their characters to give the movie some depth and to put some effort in introducing new mutants. The flash back scene at the Grey house is debated over often here. I find it one of the greatest of the movie. You see two friends who become bitter enemies later on, it's obvious they have some history together. One can only wonder what happened to Magneto later on. Hey, some character development after all :-) If an important character like Cyclops dies, we want to understand how and why. I still don't get why Phoenix would want to kill her/her alter-ego's lover. For giving her a kiss?? Were his eyes disappointing? Did she want to try some kinky stuff with candles like Madonna ? We will never know... Imho we don't get to see this death scene because you can't film a scene that doesn't make any sense.Juggernaut is just plain silly (""I'm Juggernaut you bitch"").I was (like some other posters here) also disturbed by the fact that Magneto and Wolverine are portrayed like some kind of dumb-asses. Indeed, Magneto has the awesome power to move a whole bridge, yet in stead of just crashing the whole thing into Alcatraz he just throws some burning cars aided by some sissy. Imho Magneto is portrayed way to powerful so he must under-use his powers to have a plot... Wolverine on the other hand, wastes 4 or 5 doses of cure on Magneto and then has to kill the woman he loves to stop her, this is so unbelievable. You have to buy this stuff for at least 2 hours !!On the other hand, Phoenix is not half as scary as she should have been. For me, she's an apathetic neurotic most of the time, not some kind of apocalyptic goddess.Conclusion: I think it's very hard to make a believable X-men movie. Bryan Singer did the job, Brett Ratner IMHO failed. Nevertheless he did deliver an entertaining movie for 8-13 year old. The accountants of Fox will be delighted.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1485,kskinney46135,Not the X-men I know,3,8 June 2006,"The writers obviously haven't read any of the classic X-men stories on which some of this is based. I know, this is a movie, and not the comic book, but still, some faithfulness to the original is called for. Basically, we have the names and powers (and sometimes not even that, for example the Callisto character), and that's all. Several characters completely out-of-character. Basically, a fairly mindless, predictable, Wolverine-fest. Too bad. From all appearances, this is the end of the X-men movie franchise (or so it was said until the box office came in, which can surely resurrect them all). If so, no great loss- I'll hold out hope for Spider-man 3.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1486,dalutheia,Comics Come Alive,6,11 June 2006,"In a movie based on a comic book you expect color, action ,noise and clearly drawn characters. On the whole, X-men delivers, but I'd rate it only a little above average. Of course, you have to suspend any disbelief, how any of this stuff is possible in reality anesthetizes real thought, but, hey, it's pure entertainment. (Though an item for discussion would be why guys getting blasted into a million pieces is entertainment) You need good special effects, and I'd rate them 7.5/10 in this movie. Ian McKellan gives the most interesting character, older men have more depth. I liked Shawn Ashmore's portrayal of Iceman. I can't watch Patrick Stewart without thinking of Capt. Jean-LucPicard!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1487,tijd100,"Good attempt, but some minor narks",7,9 June 2006,"*****WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!***** First of all, I'll reiterate what most people have said. This is probably the worst film of the three and Brett Ratner did nowhere NEAR as good a job as Bryan Singer.However, that's not to say he completely failed to deliver by any means. The film is easily the darkest of the lot with some major character deaths and underlying themes.The film revolves around two story lines, the 'cure' for mutants and the Dark Phoenix saga, I won't go into too much detail of these, as they've been plastered all over every review and synopsis anyway.The film opened well, watching Xavier and Magneto visit a young Jean Grey at her house, before their different viewpoints tore them apart. There's a nice little fight in the Danger Room with the group fighting a Sentinel, which was very well done and a bit of a treat for the comic book fans.After this however, and this is major nark, the film then gets a bit too fast-paced. Ratner's tried to cram too much into too short a time, rather than extend the length of the film to perhaps a 2 and a half hour, or even three hour film. The end result is that all the setting up of the plot lines feels a bit to rushed and makes somethings just seem improbable. Most notably Cyclops just upping and leaving the mansion. OK, fine, he's upset, he needs some time alone, I can handle that. So he just 'happens' to go straight to Alkali Lake, which nicely coincides with Jean rising from the waters. It just happens a bit too fast and doesn't quite seem plausible, like there's some more explanation needed.Once things are in place, the film proceeds quite nicely with some fantastic action scenes and plot-moving moments, the stand of at Jean's house in particular is executed brilliantly. It's just a shame Ratner didn't put the same input into the pre-storyline that he did with the rest of it, otherwise this film could have been walking away with the full 10.Directtion aside, there are some very good performances from the actors. Sir Ian MacKellan once again faithfully reprises his role as Magneto. Vinnie Jones was always going to be amusing as the Juggernaut, purely because it echos himself so much. You kind of wonder whether there actually was any acting required for him. Halle Berry takes a more pivotal role as Storm in this film, making her actually powerful, which, considering she was one of the main characters is about time. I always thought Cyclops and Storm were a bit 1-dimensional in X1, with Wolverine and Rogue stealing the show. In X3 though, it is arguably Kelsey Grammar who steals the show playing Beast to absolute perfection. I can't imagine anyone else playing this role.Other pro points included Iceman finally realising his potential and the proper introduction of Shadowcat and Colossus. Though rant at this point: Colossus is Russian!!! NOT American!!! There was no problem keeping Nightcrawler German in X2, so why not Colossus? Final Nark: Whilst Angel was introduced right at the start, seemingly in a major role, he was hardly used at all, and the bit where he saved his dad when they threw him off the roof you could spot coming a mile off.I don't feel I can end this comment without responding to a few of the complaints people have thrown up though (*****MAJOR, MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*****): 1. ""Magneto got stripped of his power. It's unfaithful to the comics."" Um, not really. The same thing happened at the end of the House of M storyline. In any case, you see him getting his powers back at the end.2. ""They killed off Jean."" You mean you COULDN'T half guess that was going to happen considering the whole dead/alive thing that's gone on with her in the comics? 3. ""They killed of Prof X."" Stick around for after the credits.4. ""They killed off Cyclops."" Probably a foreshadowing for X4 as someone rightly pointed out, you never actually SEE him die.5. ""Cyclops was barely in it."" True, but I don't see why people are taking that out on Ratner. He was barely used in X2 either.On the whole, I thought it was a good watch and I'd happily watch it again though. I don't think ""The Last Stand"" is the right title though really, as it's been quite well set up for another sequel.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1488,angie-thompson,Poor Choice of Words,5,9 June 2006,"Hi, I was highly excited and anticipated viewing the The Last Stand; but was disappointed with the a few of the scenes. In the theatre I attended were many children all excited as me to see the movie; but when Juggernaut made his few (choice) words in a negative, disrespectful to women and foul mouth language...it totally turned me off!! There had to be another way that he could have expressed his feelings. Brett Ratner selected a poor choice of words for that character especially in respect to the children that look up to the Xmen. Also, the sexy scene between Wolverine and Jean Gray could have been done with out the body exposure. Brett should look at some of the Older movies in the 30 & 40's and learn how to express love without showing skin!! Outside of those scenes, great job! Oh, the last three words of Xavier! Wow! I can't wait for the next movie and have Bryan Singer direct it....please!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1489,npdejong,the good the bad and the rest,9,9 June 2006,"hello, i read some very interesting comments concerning the latest movie featuring x men on it. and hopefully i can do so without giving all the readers of the site some spoilers , so here it isthe movie like many already mentioned goes around a certain invention concerning the mutant x gen, scientists lead by a person who does have good intentions, are able to create a virus which suppresses the mutant x gen permanently, to which many refer as cure, at first my thought was that like the second movie it goes about a corrupt government which forces these onto the mutants like the stereotype bad guy movie. to my surprise i found out that here it involves around a society who in some degree have accepted mutant rights at the government , why even one of that government is a mutant himself (no spoilers). i found that the situation strongly reminded me at the realistic political currents involving our society. instead of the typical good-bad no side between movie , this was very realistic to me (despite arguable facts of people walking through walls ))< which makes it so much more fun to watch of course. though there are down sides to me , of course those could just be completely personal. these downsides , which i found occurring by the others as well, are that it usually goes in an immense rush , meaning something 'traumatising'for instance happens and then it goes of to the next without any real hints whether those changes really happened, leaving you to wander if it really did happen the way it looked like, mainly because it sometimes really shocks you from the movies point of view or if something happens to undo it or something (we are talking about people who can deify the laws of nature after allon the other side i found it pleasing as well honestly. i never expected it to walk like this , completely different from the first two that way i wasn't prepared or expecting the following current of events making it a lot more interesting, sure it was shocking at times , especially when wolverine confronted the dark phoenix and reached to jean following a hearth breaking conclusion of the war. all in all however i found it most worth it before it evolves mostly around giving you the best movie there is , both action , humor (check out Hugh Jackman presenting wolverine) , as well as fitting drama and originality. i for once couldn't be more happier.giving a thumbs up for the incredible cast who without it never could have been what it today notably of course are Ian Mc Kellen playing the calm serene but jet somewhat twisted arch nemesis magneto , along side with Hugh Jackman who plays the berserk , wild yet good hearted Logan (Wolvering) as he presents him as in my opinion never as good as he has before. making this movie a sensation for everyone to see.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1490,leo-miles,How Ratner tried...and failed: a biased review,3,9 June 2006,"The beginning of the movie was quite promising: few flashbacks from the past about Jean Grey and Archangel(although nobody did name him that during all film), then present time, where Scott Summers goes to look for Jane and there everything start to go downhill. Actually, Brett Ratner was very successful in making promising scenes and then totally spoiling them.The main storyline is about mysterious cure from the mutant disease, made from other mutant's genes and Jean Grey who decides to play Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. Very original. She kills Cyclops(although nobody bothered to show exact way and poor guy's corpse) then goes horny on Wolverine and kills Proffesor X. Gosh - I got the feeling that the so called ""Director"" wanted many dramatic moments and used first stupid ideas which came to his not very wise head.Talking about dramatism - the saving of Mystique, certainly one of the most attractive and enigmatic character of X Men series, was so pathetic, that it shocked me totally: I never knew that Magneto was such fanatic mutant activist, that after saving his closest comrade from custody, he left her naked on the prison's floor just because she lost her powers saving him from the same thing. ""You are not one of us anymore, so git."" Yeah, it was truly masterfully designed emotional scene, it was so emotional, that I wished for slow and painful death of that smart guy, who wrote it.Effects were great. Maybe because the movie consists mostly of them. You can see tons of various mutants with the most spectacular powers, but without names. I think Ratner wanted repeat epic battles from the Lord of the Rings and concentrated solely on that goal.Result is the most amazing fight scenes, fantastic special effects and almost no dialogs and deeper looks into main characters. Who is who is told only through appearances, there are no more distinctive actions except the ones taken in combat. Did Ratner thought that effects could compensate awful script? Probably. All losers think so. And they all are wrong.After watching this movie, in my imagination I created my version of it. There were more dialogs(not declarations), relationship scenes(Magneto could at least cloak naked Mystique with his mantle and explain that without her powers she cannot survive in their war) and a little different outcome(for instance both powerless Magneto and Mystique playing chess or baking a cake in the Magneto lair:)).I hope that one day Brian Singer will return deeply regretting that for one movie he abandoned epitaph of whole trilogy, and remake The Last Stand.Also I hope that Ratner will turn into a rat.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1491,brian_erlandson,If you liked the comic books-Stay Home,3,11 June 2006,"Lots of deviation from the orig. plots by Stan Lee and company at Marvel. The phoenix concept was actually better than the ""space nonsense"" of the the comic books, but could have still been better. The real kicker is killing off primary characters from years of comic success. That just seemed foolish. Prof X is an integral part of the comic success, and with or w/o Patrick Stewart, he should not have been taken out! Mamed to make way for another actor, but not killed off. What a jerk for coming up with that.Cyclops is another. How completely stupid to kill him off. Hey, just get someone else to play the character if the current isn't working out.Obviously, the ""cure"" won't last forever, and the big bucks will fall all over themselves to get another one started. The ""Sentinel"" sequence was a preview of things to come, I am sure. Nightcrawler must have chosen to go underground like a worm, or they simply forgot him this time. This seemed pretty dumb after the character development was started in 2.Juggernaught was suppose to Prof X's brother, and virtually unstoppable. Instead, he was laughable. Rouge was suppose to save the day by a little laying of hands to bring down the invincible Juggernaught, but she was twisted into getting rid of her power, so that lost out.All in all, there was little for-thought put into this movie. I was very disappointed as a fan of the comic and Marvel in general. There is so much that could have been done, yet so little was. Hopefully, it will all be a dream movie and be redone with more original thinking.last, if your looking for a mindless action flick, this is a good one. If you have never liked the comic or don't read comics, then this will be a good 1 1/2 hour yarn. If you are a fan, go see it and be upset after. Then post a comment here!",X-Men - The Last Stand

Story was better and more dynamic, and the story was close to the comic book. And then... THIS! If you could feel my disappointment. I mean... First half hour wasn't so bad. I like new cinematography with grain and all. Looks a bit European. But as the story goes it gets more and more insulting. I don't want to put spoilers here but when lead characters get killed through out the movie, the third sequel becomes better movie for people who never read the comics, and more and more bad for x-man fans. I mean THERE IS NO X-MEN WITHOUT THE X MAN! Phoenix part of the story is like... DEMOLISHED! And other deaths and similar moments i don't want to comment. It's outrageous! I think i'm mostly annoyed because it's a good movie basically. Well... it would be if they didn't put Angel who appears for like.. 2 minutes! Or director's approach when he's trying to explain the stuff a 3 year old can understand (EXAMPLE: mystique caged in the truck. one shot of her as a president. shot of the policeman. shot of her as a little girl. shot of the policeman. shot of her as herself in all blueness. OK we didn't needed that last shot. we KNOW it's HER.). And the end is very very lame. They destroyed the X-Men in this movie. Demolished.

Anyways its poorly done the acting is preschool level the way it was filmed was beyond lame. Their is virtually little or no plot. It was not even close to being accurate with the actual X-men story. Magneto would have never ditched mystic after she just saved him from losing his powers. Many of the characters served no purpose in the movie like Angel, Rogue, Pyro,Iceman, Juggernaught, and the guy who could multiply. All of them were just put in as background characters who maybe had 2 or 3 lines in the film and never did anything significant. And by the way were the hell was Nightcrawler.

While I laughed throughout because the script and the direction were so absurd, they might have been passable in a tight little action number like X2. The writing in the first 2 movies isn't particularly effective on a line to line level, but it serves because the stories and the direction are so tight and packed; X3 is wearing horizontal stripes. Its flaws are magnified. The scope of this movie is too large, and some potentially interesting thematics become boring, melodramatic stretches where action sequences might better have gone.

So Scott Summers (Cyclops) is still mourning the death of his wife Dr. Jean Grey. He goes back to Alkily Lake where Jean died and he finds out that she isn't dead. She actually wrapped herself in a cocoon of telepathic energy. She comes out of the water and starts kissing Scott and ends up killing him. Later in the movie she ends up killing Professer Xavier too! Storm and Logan (wolverine) find out and go to the lake a find Jean and take her to Professer Xavier. He says that she has two personalities one is the Jean Grey we Know and the other is the Phenox who wants to kill. Jean Grey joins with Magneto and his army that he put together to defeat the humans who have made a cure to suppress the mutant X gene permanently. Some want it desperately and others are offended by even thinking of the idea of a cure. They go to Alkatraz Island where the cure is held to kill the humans and there like always to stop then are the X-Men but now with some new people. The team is Wolverine, Storm, Colosuss, Kitte Pryde, Iceman, and the ever loved ever blue Beast. After destroying most of the army the Colosuss throws Wolverine at Magneto but he stops him and throws him to the ground but Beast comes up behind him and sticks him with four cures and one of the most powerful mutants is cured. So the X-Men end up coming up on top again. But then in the end Magneto is sitting at a chess table and he sticks his hand out to see if he can move the piece and it moves and the movie ends. I say to you now though you have to stay for the credits it's like the best part of the movie I don't want to spoil it for you but I will tell you this Professer Xavier isn't dead.

1496,tlee-24,how could you Brian singer? Ratner was just awful.,1,13 June 2006,"This contains mega spoilers. but i will keep this short and sweet. my problems with this movie are as follows: 1)main characters die. Cyclops,professor X, Jean(needlessly,I might add because wolverine could have just stabbed her with the cure). They all died.2)It seems as though Huge Jackman and Halle Berry were the pivotal characters of a movie seemingly geared toward selling tickets. So naturally make It's mostly about Jackman and Storm,who by the way has apparently forgotten that she's supposed to have an accent. I wonder if Ratner spent all his time catering to the whims of those two while cheating the other characters of their significance.3)Collosus doesn't have an accent but juggernaut does.4)When going to see phoenix at Jean's house professor X just walks by Juggernaut as if they have no history in the comic books and doesn't even acknowledge his presence.5)When Juggernaut hits the wall, the implication is that he is a mutant and can lose his powers when he comes in contact with the source of the cure.6)Angel is there essentially for a cameo.7)X-men took a dive at the box office in consecutive weeks because of the negative word of mouth that people like who read the comic and who were big fans for years are going to give it. This isn't like killing off the Joker in Batman where you can simply introduce a new a new villain in a sequel. They disposed of the main characters. I don't understand the business decision to kill off the main characters and alienate comic fans from the movie just to appeal to the masses. They could have let them live and still have made a good movie and not have us resent this movie's creation for the rest of our lives. The great build-up of the first two movies came undone in X3.8) Nightcrawler was eliminated due to the costs of having to costume 3 blue mutants in make-up(mystique & beast)were already written in.9)Major character relations emphasis of rouge & bobby, Jean/cyclops, were done away with to focus on the big stars Jackman,Berry,and Grammar.A word of advice to all the marvel fans on this message board. Please join with me to petition marvel to not let people unfamiliar with the spirit of our beloved comics be allowed to ruin them on the big screen. It seems as though this movie was entirely money-driven and that the writers had no intimate knowledge of who their audience actually was. I wonder if they were just a couple of geeks that hadn't even heard of X-men before they were handed the responsibility of writing this movie. How could marvel let them do this. I feel betrayed for many years of supporting marvel comics and movies (I even saw both Punishers to contribute to their profits).Sure it made money for one weekend but its legacy will not endure as a great cult phenomenon. The disappointment I feel with this movie is akin to the disappointment I felt with the two matrix sequels, blade 3, the Hulk (Bana and Connelly were completely miscast and delivered an utterly bland performance while Noltie stole the show), and Daredevil (where the superb acting of Afleck and Garner was negated by the absurd acting of Colin Farrell and Michael Clark Duncan,and even both Punisher movies (Tom Jane looked the part but didn't have the benefit of having the script of the first 80s movie,which was good except that Frank Castle was miscast much like Bruce Banner; Dolf Lungren's countenance has the look of a glassy drug addict).",X-Men - The Last Stand
1497,spencedogg41,I Loved It,8,13 June 2006,"Over all I think we are looking at a great Comic Book Movie. It may have lacked a story element that could match X-Men and X2, yet when it came to Intensity and Action ""The Last Stand"" was Fantastic.Most of the characters where portrayed well, and possessed their charm. Effects were beautiful. The fights were great. And I loved it when Bobby took on his Ice form. The movie seemed to keep me emotionally connected, I really cared about what happened to everyone. Some may complain that Professor X and Scott died too early. But if anything that made it more believable, and made me feel like I was reading one of the comics again. It always seemed as if characters were missing, and only a select few were involved in the conflict.But don't get me wrong it had some flaws too. Juggernaut(Ugh!)... need I say more? I felt Kitty Pride was never properly introduced, and just sort of forced into the story. Rogue seemed to be overshadowed by the rest of the film, and some what irrelevant. And many Geeks such as me may feel the movies veer off too far from the comics.In the end I think it was a great conclusion to the X-Men Trilogy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1498,bobo767676,"In a year loaded with big-ticket comic-book movies, X3 beats them all!",10,13 June 2006,"X3, a well-written film with superb performances all around. The script is admirably dark and develops the characters in interesting ways, continuing and exploring themes from the first two films. Crucially, it's all played extremely straight, although when it's time for action  Look out! X3: The Last Stand is that rare sequel: one that deepens, darkens and expands upon the original. Think ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Think ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" In a summer loaded with big-ticket comic-book movies, X3 beats them all.In my opinion, X3's main strength is letting every mutant show off their powers thanks to great special effects. Wolverine shows his animal-like behavior that we all know and love. A movie that one must add to his or her home collection whenever they release the home video.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1499,venussyracuse,ice man and the movie,7,19 June 2006,well they could have done a better job through the movie they should have did a lot of scenes with ice man because they could have put stuff like his ice slide or more scenes in his ice form and the movie could have been a whole lot better. plus they should have told us more of why they didn't include night crawler or at least one or two scenes with him in the movie.there could have been a cameo because if this was the last of the x-men movies they could have made it more exciting and make it so that people will jump out of there seats and plus Bryan singer could have done a better job at directing the movie then this new director.but other then that it was a good movie.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1500,DanielBarnhardt,It wasn't very good,1,16 June 2006,Ya if you seen this movie you may or may not agree with me but i find that the movie was not all that great because in the movie Dr X and cyclone and jean Grey die and mutants lose there powers that is not how the comics or the show happened at all so if you agree we should write a letter or e-mail the people who made the movie.Ps If you don't think the movie was wrong then your not a big fan of x men not to be rude so sorry if i made people mad. OK thats it for now.i Think the movie was the Wherest movie i've ever seen so if you haven't seen it don't watch it because it's Not so good.And this is getting boring because when you try to write a simple comment it tells you to fix it all the time and that,X-Men - The Last Stand

1503,rizshe,"Overall okay, X-men fan ......... movie sucks",4,20 June 2006,"Finally i watched the over hype X-men the last stand. Just after watching it I got back to my X-men collection of X-men and X2 on DVD, Next day go again and watch it again and I can tell you it really sucks. As an action movie yes you might say that it is okay but plz. remember action is not everything, the weak story, no character development and no proper time focus action sequence before you know the movie is over. Forget about comparing it to X2 which is my favourite, compare it to first one in trilogy and it is nothing. As an X-men fan It really kills to see Prof Xavier and Scott died without any explanations. They don't seem to realize that the last movie just showed how powerful the Professor was and in this they just dump him. I am sure if they said that both Professor and Scott are visiting some distant planet or had hay fever, the fans will not be that much disappointed. Overall a 5 out of 10 and that is also because some of the action sequences are okay.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1504,MorphaLynn,"Worth it, but only once",5,20 June 2006,"Overall, I have to say the movie wasn't bad, but it just wasn't as good I thought the series finale would be. (And I find myself hoping that it is not the end.) I'm a sci-fi fan, but not a hardcore X-men fan. I watched the X-men cartoons as a kid, and have seen the first two movies many times. After seeing the third movie, I have to say that it just didn't measure up.There are times where it seems that the movie is missing pieces. I felt that I missed an explanation or back story or even character names to help my understanding of what was going on. Action and effects were overused in this series ender. The DVD version will probably find itself in my collection, but only to have a complete series, not through any greatness of its own.If you've been eagerly awaiting the next installment of the series you have three options: go to the theater to see it, wait to rent it or add it to your collection when it appears on DVD. The movie is worth seeing, but only worth spending money on one time.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1505,zpolson,your move....singer!,6,22 June 2006,"This movie disappointed me. Shame on you X-3, you get a major wag of the finger. My hat goes off to the actors though: Hugh Jackman, Famke Jannsen, Kelsey Grammar, Ian Mckellen, etc. They were great. Kelsey Grammar fit the role of beast like old people fit in at a buffet.However there are some complaints, many people blame Brett Ratner for the films noticeable decline in quality. They say Bryan Singer would never had let this happen. Well, he did. He just had to go and do Superman--which I really hope tanks by the way--and leave X3 to go through two more directors. You don't abandon your trilogy. It's bad form. You my betraying friend are on notice. You ruined your own trilogy. Secondly, no one should have ever done the phoenix saga. My hat goes off to brett ratner for doing a decent attempt. I've read the ""plot"" for the phoenix saga. Its like they shredded Freud papers up and mixed it with the x-files. It MAKES NO SENSE! Jean is possessed, actually its not really jean but an exact copy, and so on and so forth.The writing of this movie is horrible. Never give Halle Berry more screen time, she doesn't use the time she has well enough. AND never kill an important character off without giving credit to the fans and the character himself.Overall, the movie was a disappointing end to a great trilogy. Oh and by the way those of you complaining about nightcrawler have no one to blame except nightcrawler himself. He pussed out because its too much time in the makeup chair. However a lot of the scenes are visually stunning and the actors do a great job. Except Halle Berry, she's on notice.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1506,SaintAndy,Another way to save Jean,7,23 June 2006,"I'll keep this comment short. i've seen this film and i loved it, but... i did have some problems with it. the first would be that i didn't enjoy the fact that they managed to kill off three major characters, while others were severely underplayed and underused. the second problem is the solution they found for the whole Jean/Dark Phoenix issue. i mean, they had only about a million syringes with the mutant cure, but Wolverine had to say he loved her first, and then stab her. Couldn't he do to her what they had done to Magneto just minutes earlier, that is, cure her? No class 5 mutant power, no more Dark Phoenix, just plain Jean Grey. She lives, repents for her crimes and runs into the sunset with Wolverine. But i suppose her death made much better cinema than saving her and making her human. the third problem is still connected to the whole Phoenix stuff. I think they didn't make just a great job of explaining the motivation behind Jean's actions. Xavier explains the whole split personality stuff in about 2 minutes to an enraged Wolverine, who totally resents the idea of anyone being controlled, and that's it. No more debates about why Jean/Phoenix likes destroying everything around her. The special effects were great, but if there's no substance, like a logical explanation, to support them, it all becomes kind of tedious.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1507,howunfortunate,"Great movie, with some kicks",8,23 June 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand is a great movie. I had heard a lot of good things about it from friends & family and decided to see it for myself.Starting off, X-Men: The Last Stand introduces a handful of new characters and gets rid of a few old ones. While certain characters are focused on and a few others left undeveloped, the story is left unaffected and is still very enjoyable. It was very sad to see quite a few of the main characters die or lose their mutant abilities. (For example: Mystique loses her mutant abilities.) If you're looking for a good action movie, X-Men: The Last Stand if for you. The battle scenes between the humans and the mutants are fantastic! I personally think they went a bit overboard with Jean Grey being an all-powerful mutant though. Any further and it would have been humans vs. mutants vs. Jean Grey.All-in-all, this movie has a great story line and great action sequences. While some of the characters were a bit undeveloped it didn't make a huge difference in the end. I give this movie a 8 out of 10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1508,themindwalker,the only reason to watch this is because you watched the others...,3,24 June 2006,"Well I watched this movie looking forward to seeing how the trilogy was going to end. When the film had ended I was in the uncomfortable situation of still waiting for it to make sense. The idea of this film ""The Last Stand"" promised a lot. There was also a lot that it could draw on for success; a wide variety of characters, a wealth of research material that could be drawn on i.e. comics, cartoons, me, I'm sure we could've negotiated a price, not forgetting the 2 previous movies which I found entertaining. Though the movie had good special effects and action scenes the thing that was missing was the ability to draw me into it. There is the basic story outline and then nothing. No emotional connection. No beep beep of a heart monitor to suggest that though the movie is unconscious there is going to be a jolt to bring it back to life. It felt like the characters had all been mind wiped and then were running around trying to remember who they were and what they were supposed to be doing. Personally I,m hoping that somehow what I saw was just some footage from a dress rehearsal and that the real movie is still in post production somewhere.The only problem with that idea is that my mutant ability to disappear into the realms of fantasy in the face of harsh reality was cancelled out by a little character in the movie. Why didn't I sit further back from the screen. Oh, that cursed call of the second row why did I want such a close up look at this film, that desire will be the end of me.The last time I felt like this was when I watched Batman and Robin staring the Governor of California, what a state of affairs that was. No, that movie was awful this one was just bad.When I think about the money that I paid and the enthusiasm that I mustered up to go and see this long awaited movie I am forced to quote the words of Magneto when, like the script and acting in this film, he was faced with the reality that his plans had fallen to pieces turned around and looking back asked, ""What have I done"". I Love X-Men and therefore have to ask, ""why did they have to spoil a good thing"".TMW has spoken.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1509,exohuman,A great film that will keep you on the edge of your seat,10,24 June 2006,"I know many people disliked the fact that so much of the X-Men cannon was thrown out, but I felt that there really wasn't any other way to do a movie. Simply put, the comic ran for decades, movies run for a couple of hours. And what a couple of hours that was: you never knew who would live or die from one point to the next. Halle Berry was great (finally) as Storm, because they actually bothered to write out her role this time. Hugh Jackman was superb and so was everyone else (except Rogue).My only complaint is that the film should have been longer. I wanted to see more of Angel in particular. The human rights debate played out in this film contained bold and dramatic arguments that I don't even think the comic was able to handle.Excellent film, just don't let your love for the comic (or TV series) ruin it. Just enjoy the film for the good film it is.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1510,Jmstallone,A Different Take On This Movie,10,27 May 2006,"After viewing this movie, thinking about it after wards and reading many of the comments on this site, I am beginning to think that many people may be overreacting to the fate of several of the main characters. If you have not seen the movie, you may not want to continue reading this post.Consider this:1) We don't actually see Cyclops die. Are we sure he is really dead? 2) Judging by the final scene at the end of the movie (after the credits), it appears that Professor X may have transferred his consciousness to someone else. He, too, may not be dead. 3) Jean Grey has already died once, could she come back again? 4) Is it possible that the cure is temporary? If so, Magneto, Mystique and Rogue all could come back with their powers intact if there is an X4.Don't get me wrong, if Cyclops and Professor X are truly dead, no one would be more disappointed than myself. I am just wondering if we are all not ""jumping to conclusions"" to assume these characters are gone (or powerless).Either way, I really enjoyed the action and special effects in this movie. I liked the performances, particularly by Halle Berry (who is often unfairly criticized in my view). Kelsey Grammar, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were very good (as they always are).I certainly hope there is an X4!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1511,bdodubbag,Awful - Horrible - Embarrassing - Painful,3,26 May 2006,"This movie was all of these. Halle Berry was in more than half the scenes in this movie - not a good start.

I felt it was beating me over the head with scenes and moments meant to explain what was going on in the film, without letting the action explain itself. With non-bearable cheesy one-liners this was an embarrassing 3rd edition to this series. Hopefully the X-Men don't turn into the Batman series.You have to see this in the theatre, but don't expect much*****(For some reason I have make my post 10 lines or more- So I'm filling up space)****Sorry",X-Men - The Last Stand

X-men seems to be one of the best marvel comic movies that I have ever seen in my life.

1513,searchraven,X-Men 3 Hated It!!!,3,26 June 2006,"TWO THUMBS WAY DOWN!For fans of the original comics and cartoons, X-Men 3 was a major disappointment. Toss the director and bring back Bryan Singer, who at least seemed to appreciate what the X-Men saga is all about. Note to the director, if you wanted to sabotage the series you should have just left it alone. You completely missed the point of the original Phoenix saga which would have made an excellent movie with stunning visual effects. Instead Jean Grey looked like a psycho freak on acid. You missed the whole point of the troubled Jean Grey/Phoenix character. Killing off your main characters? Hell, why didn't you just torch the whole franchise, or was Pyro not strong enough? Bluto never killed Popeye and they fought for decades for top billing. Magneto and Mystique as ordinary homosapiens? Blasphemy! The director and studio totally missed the mark on this one. What was this about a bigger paycheck for Ms. Berry who has always complained about her role in public? Storm ain't no pretty girl, she is a mature, strong woman, equal to Professor X and his confidant. But Hollywood always thinks young and beautiful. Again you missed the mark. Gorgeous Angela Basset would have been far better suited to the role and an equal to Wolverine and Professor Xavier. Professor X and Cyclops, what you did to them is tantamount to superhero treason of the highest order. It is the love shared by Jean and Scott that ultimately saves the Phoenix. You wasted a perfectly good franchise and all this talk about spin-offs - sure Magneto would have jumped at the chance, but Wolverine, beneath that rough exterior is a team player and he would have never wanted it. I'm not sure what the studio and director were thinking but X-Men 3 bites!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1514,savannahholt,great movie.,9,20 September 2006,"I loved this movie. The first two in the series were hard to follow, and Brett Ratner had a very fresh take on how to portray the stories. It does not follow the comic books as well as the first two, but in diverging from them it creates new emotional stories with a tad more realism than a comic book could ever have. Unfortunately, it is an action movie, and can only invest so much time in developing each character's emotional arc. It is a busy, intense, suspenseful and utterly gorgeous film, with a haunting ending that leaves room for more.I'd also like to add, the comic book had a series called ""the last stand"" and that it was not indeed the end of the xmen... I'm sure it won't stop here.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1515,akparry76,The Last Disappointing Stand,4,29 June 2006,"The rating I gave would've been lower were it not for the good action sequences. While I sat in the theater watching this movie, there were at least a dozen or more times where people actually laughed out loud at the terrible dialog. I would've too except I'm usually a forgiving viewer of science-fiction / adventure films. Being a fan of the comic book and the previous film, I have to admit it made me feel a little uncomfortable. I would not recommend that anyone see it, though at this point many have already. Why did Bryan Singer leave the project? Could it be the awful script? Beast was an entirely unbelievable character. His hair was so fake, not to mention his role in the president's administration. Cyclops was killed? What the heck for? So James Mardsen could be in 'Superman'? I think it's ridiculous to kill off a major character (the team leader, no less) in a series with limitless potential so Hollywood can fulfill it's quota. Is there nothing sacred? Also, if you're going to use the character Colossus, quit skimping on the special effects - he was metal most of the time, not for a few seconds while he deflected an object. I have so many complaints that this review has come out as a disjointed rant. There were so many more problems with the movie. Let's just forget it ever occurred and pray that the next film follows the 'Days of Futures Past' story so all the dead characters can be explicably alive.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1516,remylebeau007,Less fun than a houseful of roaches,2,2 July 2006,"That's what I gave up to see this movie. A houseful of roaches. I prefer the bugs myself.Once again Marvel has allowed some one to change core elements of major characters in one of it's movies. Okay, no big surprise there, but come on, how many X-Men do you need to kill in one film?I grew up on the X-Men, Spider-Man, Batman, all those heroes. Why ruin the best team in comics like this? My guess is that it's because Brian Singer and most of the staff from the first two films were busy making Superman. Well, it shows. I got really tired of seeing Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman in every scene.In closing, if you're not a fan of the comic, or you've only seen the first two movies, you might enjoy this film too. If you're a big fan of the comic, it's characters, or movies that don't suck, I suggest you go spend your money on buying some roaches. At least you can squash them.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1517,outcastedrogue,x-men 3,9,4 July 2006,"to me this movie was good. one thing that i did not like, which may or may not be a spoiler, is that night crawler is not in the movie. he is not even mentioned in the movie. he had a role in the second one and then just dropped off the script. but other then that, i believe you will like this movie. i do agree it could of been longer, but longer means more money. but the money they raked in with this movie should help out with the forth, when ever they make it. anyways, stay and watch the credits. you'll get a surprise after the credits that 3/4 of the people in the theater missed. it will make you smile and say ""i knew it""",X-Men - The Last Stand

There is a scene where Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is fighting some rogue mutants and is wounded, leaving noticeable traces of blood on his undershirt, after he heals, however later down in the fight scene his shirt shows no signs of blood at all. Does Wolverine clothing have cleaning capabilities? Another fault was with the golden gate bridge. After Magneto removes the bridge to Alcatraz Island, the suspension bridge should collapse into the San Francisco bay, and if magneto's powers kept the bridge aloft, why didn't it fall after he lost his powers",X-Men - The Last Stand
1519,Nostalgic1,A treat for X-Men and sci-fi fans,7,2 August 2006,"This is the long anticipated final in a trilogy of films based on the popular American comic book heroes,The uncanny X-Men.The storyline is based on a world where mutants exist. Human who have special powers or gifts. One of them, Charles Xavier envisions a society where human beings and mutants will peacefully co-exist. He establishes a school where young mutants can escape from the worlds prejudice. They are also trained to use and control their powers.Another Mutant called Magneto believes that mutants are superior to humans. They are the next step in the evolutionary ladder. He gathers a group of mutants and launches a crusade to dominate the human race.In this film, a rich businessman funds a scientific project that yields a vaccine for the genes that give mutants their gifts .He is motivated by the fact that his son is a mutant. The vaccine is proved to be successful. Mutants are divided as some seek a cure and others seek to maintain their gifts.Furthermore, one of the X-Men called Jean Grey, who was thought to have died in the previous installment comes back to life. She becomes more powerful than any other mutant. Unfortunately, She leaves the X-Men and decides to side with Magneto,The film is quite easy to follow. The characters are great. Almost each character has their own separate storyline. Some of the dialogue is quite humorous . Hats of to the special effects team. The mutant powers exhibited by the characters and their effects are very credible. Fights are well choreographedEthical issues raised by the films are very relevant to today's society. If a cure could be found for the misfits of society, would people be willing to take It ? Is it right for one person to control another for the benefit of society? The reality of death is also treated with due respect. Most significant of all, the need for individuals to stand for righteousness regardless of personal feelings or opposition. The violence, although rather frequent and voluminous, is not bloody or gory. Nevertheless it is debatable whether the film should be given a 12A certificate. In one of the scenes a totally nude woman is seen lying on the floor. Some of the characters have little regard for human life, as seen by the way they kill mercilesslyScreen veterans Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart put in some superb performances. Kelsey Grammar, well known as doctor Frasier Brain from the hit 80's TV series "" Cheers"", also adds to the magic. In a change from the earlier films, former beauty queen Halle Berry plays more of a leading role.Overall this is a good film for adults and teenage children. The hype prior to its release is justified after watching the film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1520,kaplanrose,"For Heaven's Sakes, read the comics!",8,18 October 2006,"Maybe some of you think this is a mistake, but I always read through the other reviews before posting mine. This is not because I'm need to see others' points of view before posting mine (I'm not that easily influenced), but because of my peculiar academic (I'm not quite an academic, but frigging close)and personal interests. I'm interested not only in what other people think of the film, but also how they ""construct"" (academic jargon alert) it, which is to say, I'm not only interested in how good or bad they thought it was, but the underlying values and assumptions they use in making that determination.In this case, I'm surprised at how many of the reviewers have zero knowledge of the comic book on which this and the two earlier X-men movies are based. First of all, the political metaphors that the two directors (Singer and Rattner)are getting credit for creating (mutants as homosexuals or aids sufferers, mutants as persecuted Jews, magneto as politically sincere terrorist)are more attributable to Chris Claremont (briefly seen in a cameo as ""lawnmower man"" at the beginning of the movie). And long-time fans of the series know that the ""old-school"" characters that one of the other fan reviewers refers to, (Wolverine, the blue furry beast) are in fact ""new-school"" when compared to the original Stan Lee x-men (Cyclops, a non-phoenix Jean Gray, a humanoid beast, ice-man and Angel). Chris Claremont did for X-men something akin to what Alan Moore later did for Swamp Thing.It's not that I'm being a ""fanboy"" here--the film's got to stand on its own merits. It's just that a lot of the good things and bad things that are part of this film are largely due to the difficulties in adapting the material from the comic books. The ""rushed"" quality that a lot of reviewers have commented on are due to the filmmakers' attempt to load this last (?) film with the plots of several epics spanning many years of comic books into one film. The film tries to tell most of the groundbreaking ""dark phoenix"" saga, while also including material from the New Mutants, and seeds of the Trask (though Trask seems to have changed race in the film!)/sentinel storyline with the attendant anti-mutant USA government storyline For hardcore fans, they also managed to slip in oblique references to the ""Days of Future Past"" saga in the opening scene. Furthermore, the ""too many mutants to count"" phenomenon is also a standard part of the original comic books.Anyway, given these observations, I must say I thought that it was still a damn fine film. One element that I've always enjoyed in the comic books was wonderfully translated to the screen. For whatever reason, in the comic books whenever two groups attacked each other, rather than it being a free-for-all, or one group picking the other off one-by-one or double-teaming, they would break off into pairs, for some reason. This is objectively puzzling, but in practice it makes the action fun. My favorite action scene in the movie is the mêlée at Jean's house, where Wolverine takes on Juggernaut and Storm takes on Callisto. Since every one of these beings is super-powerful, the difficulty is in making the fights more than one over-powerful meat-head beating on the other. The film pulls this off wonderfully, with creative, fascinating fight moves that are unique to each individual. This is what I always enjoyed in reading the comics and it is successfully translated to the film. Grace notes, like the dual personality of Beast (quiet intellectual, snarling beast) are fun and invigorating. I didn't enjoy the final apocalyptic scene as much as the Grey house fight, but hey, that's how I used to feel about the books. (Though I must say, for an all-powerful being Dark Phoenix sure didn't do a hell of a lot--she was kinda like the devil in The exorcist--for all others spoke about her infinite powers her dark ambitions seemed rather limited).As far as the acting--Patrick Stewart and Ian MacKellan are, as always, joys doing the simplest things. (If you have any interest in Shakespeare check out the MacKellan/Judi Dench Macbeth--MacKellan is magnificent, and see the British TV series I, Claudius for a brief appearance of Patrick Stewart with ""hair"") I thought all the performances were admirable, although I agree with the other reviewer who said that the emotional content of the film was rushed through to get to the action--but hey, comic books are essentially action melodramas--I'm not looking for nuance, so who gives a? If you notice X:men the Last Stand got its highest votes on IMDb from females under 18, so maybe the doomed romance of the main plot was as appealing as the action sequences. In any case, X=men: The Last Stand got my heart pumping and that's what we go to the movies for, right? (Besides, who can dislike a film whose main character is a short, angry Canadian--I want my own set of admantanium claws damn it!!)",X-Men - The Last Stand
1521,morganc123,Poor Directorship spoiled a potentially great movie,7,24 July 2006,"After watching the trailer for this movie I eagerly anticipated the involvement in it of one of my favourite X-Men characters - Apocalypse. It was he who presented ""The Cure"" to Mutants and contrary to the movie, ""The Cure"" was a ruse to trick people and transform them into Apocalypse's elite guard - The four horsemen of the Apocalypse. In retrospect, I would have been happier had the movie revealed ""The Cure"" to be a fraud. If the film had centred on this instead of the unconvincing path that the movie did eventually take, then I think the movie would have been unbelievable. Therefore, because ""The Cure"" is an actual cure in this film, inferring that Mutant evolution is a disease, then this is the film's ultimate failing. By curing the mutants the X-Men saga ends with the sad notion of humanity rejecting mutant evolution as much as many people reject Stem cell research today. The Humans win, the Mutants lose and evolution is halted by fear of the unknown. Because of the shortness of the movie it is hard to comment on whether it would have been excellent had it been longer. Instead, the movie gave off an aura of what can only be described as amateur directorship. Brett Ratner is no Bryan Singer.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1522,grega-stucin,Spectacular ending of a spectacular trilogy.,9,19 July 2006,"I saw the first two ""x"" movies and they were outstanding, so i wait long and hard for the third one. But the wait was worth it. I think that this movie is more like a climax for the previous two. If you want to get everything from this movie you must see the x-men 1 and 2, because in the third one the story is not so deep and revealing. This movie leans more on special effects, than the characters they are more in the shadow of all that effects. This movie is like battle before the gates of Mordor in the Lord of the Rings 3. So it can't stand alone without the first two. Here you can see the lack of Singer's influence in the story. I'm not saying that Brian Singer would do it better, but he would do it differently. In general, director Brett Ratner did a great job and concluded the trilogy with a special effects dessert in The Last Stand.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1523,myragescene,What most of us should think about,9,20 July 2006,"Um, is it just me who thinks that after watching X-Men 3: The Last Stand I get the feeling that the X-Men trilogy is actually focusing more on Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix in terms of what most people thought of, in that case,Wolverine? I mean think about it. The first film of the trilogy starts out with Jean making a speech about mutants in a congress/conference whatever you want to call it, ending with Jean/Dark Phoenix nearly killing off the entire world? I have to use my words carefully here. Of course Wolverine is one of the main characters as well as Storm, Rogue, Magneto ecetera. But in this film, The Last Stand, we see more of Jean transforming into a superpower mutant. It's not soap opera that everybody seems to think it is, like; hey didn't she got killed in the second installment and now she's alive again? What is this, a soap opera? But more of a shocking treatment the last of the trilogy has brought to the big screen and I think the director and the crew deserves to be congradulated because think about it, not many film triologies ended great. The Last Stand, in my opinion, had the coolest ending EVER, kay? Come on! It's got romance, super cool powers, a plot, and great animations! You seriously can't ask for more. One thing I have to mention here by the way is that critics are really getting on my nerves. Just chill out and ENJOY the movie for once. When was the last time people really cared about the film. Really. All they want to do now is to exploit how much mistakes the film is making and not really paying attention to the plot and the characters of the film. Some people might've took 'critics' literally, like; being a critic you actually criticise something or rather. But there's more to that. You have to see the positive side of it, not just trying to pick out fleas on a cow's back. I mean, who cares if wolverine or the dark phoenix had more scenes than any of the other characters in the film. Maybe you do, but guess what, the majority of the population might not even care about the other plots - what they really want to do is to simply enjoy what the director and the crew has brought to the big screen.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1524,qdh22,X-Men 3: downfall of a franchise,6,26 July 2006,"As a comic book fan, I understand that the awesomeness of these cannot always be portrayed on screen. Never the less there a some important things you should follow. Seeing that Bryan Singer started X-men with a slow start for introductory reasons, then continued it with a kick @$$ sequel showing the power of the X-men, Brett Ratner should have at least taken Jean and had her resurrect as the Phenoix, Firebird and all. There isn't even a symbol anywhere on her. Strange how its on her coat in the second X-men. all in all its a decent movie. Needed more character development. Angel was good, but not developed. Scott and Mystique were not integrated into the plot well enough. Halles parts were the crustiest, but she was over used. Lastly Magneto didn't fly enough but Pyro, he was the coolest.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1525,Ngh-4,A parade of missed opportunities,6,2 August 2006,"I had issues with this movie that could be summed up as: too much, too fast. A number of people have commented that the film ""introduces"" new characters left and right, from Phoenix to Havoc, and not one of them is given a proper introduction. That's true. It has three story lines that are all woven together very poorly, and not one of them comes out as a quilt - the Phoenix saga, the Cure, and Graduation Day. Any one of these story lines would make for a full length movie, together they just make a mess. Also, mentioned by others, and also very true.For more specific issues, I'll start with the characters. Phoenix is all right, not great, but passable. The most admirable trait of the first two movies is blending the ridiculous comic book world with a more plausible realistic world that make the movies flow so well. The explanation for why Phoenix exists without the whole ""Jean Grey is possessed by an interstellar god"" thing is well done. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie flings the conservative, careful crafting of the first two movies out the window in every other regard. The only way they could have made the plot more full of holes and less plausible, is by actually introducing Apocalypse as well.Angel? Is only in the movie because he is in the Cure storyline in the comics. All he does is get in the way of just about every mismatched plot line in it.Phoenix? Only there because of the ending of X2, and the writers for this movie clearly wanted to get on to other things rather than deal with her. That, or they thought Phoenix would just sit back and do nothing for the majority of the movie, besides throwing a tantrum every now and then without saying a word.Multiple man? Introduced for sheer novelty, appears again ONCE as a bit part later on.Spike? Leech? Psylock? Havoc? For those of you who have seen the movie, do you know who any of these characters are without guessing? Nope, didn't think so.Magneto? They ruined him. What makes Magneto such an incredible character is the moral dilemma(s) he brings up, as a survivor of the holocaust and victim of all manner of terrible things, he is a pitiable character who genuinely cares for mutants and their well-being. in the first two movies it is made clear that while he is not exactly nice, he can't be called evil either. He does terrible things, but he has arguable reasons and has redeeming qualities - such as his loyalty to Professor Xavier and Mystique. In THIS movie, he loses those redeeming qualities almost utterly. Not only does he turn his back on Mystique the instant she loses her powers (totaly out of character for any of the previous portrayals of Magneto) but he becomes a gibbering idiot when deprived of his own powers. As if his powers were all there was to the man. If that were true, Xavier would have just knocked him into a coma in the first movie. In X3, every attempt is made to erase any sympathy for Magneto and make him a true villain. Which leaves a significant gap in the plot, with no anti-hero nemesis to fill it.One last note, the final fight scene is a total joke. It consists of carrying the Golden Gate bridge full of mutants loyal to Magneto over to Alcatraz, where the ""cure"" is being studied. Then an entire battalion of marines with plastic guns are disarmed in one shock-wave and stand there like dead weight and do nothing for the duration of the battle. Once they're stupefied, a mass of mutants run (yes, run) straight at a building yelling. What are they doing? Couldn't tell you; do they use their powers? NO. You have an *army* of mutants and only Magneto, Pyro, and Callisto even think of trying anything with their powers - oh, and Havoc (once) and one guy who can be cut up and regenerate instantly, but he doesn't do it until wolverine makes him. The rest run onto Wolverine's claws and die, or just run around and yell some more. Of all the millions upon millions of AWESOME things that could have happened in a massive brawl between two groups of super-powered mutants, the only thing we get is lot's of yelling and a few flaming cars.If nothing else in the movie really ruined it, that scene would have all by itself. Now, I'm not saying it was completely useless - I saw the movie and am glad I got to see it, I even enjoyed it. But both only as one of countless crappy action movies, not as the medal-worthy films that were the X-men series before this latest installment.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1526,gonzo1210,It sucks!,6,31 August 2006,"I'm so sorry to admit it but Brett Ratner did an awful job. The film is a major box office hit BUT, its quality is poor. The adaptation of the comic is very bad, the edition of the film is awful, and most important, he introduced many new characters that looked like clowns in the big screen... what was the purpose of Angel in the movie? Juggernaut could have been developed a little more, and the beast! for God's sake! I'm pretty sure the fans of the comic would like Brian Singer to com back to this successful franchise. Singer did an excellent job with X-men and X-men 2 turned out to be an outstanding film and adaptation of the comic.

To me the main problem about x men movies is Wolverine: because is the favorite character of the new generation of kids, people of cinema looking for easy money give him all the ligths: in fact, this films should be Wolverine and x men.. but Wolverine is, at last, the most superficial, plain and without deep of all the group. Characters that are pivotal in comics, more introspective and with inner conflicts as Cyclops, the first x man in comics and tortured in the books, the basis of many arcs in the comics, is in the films and in this last part diminished and forgotten when he has a great potential that the very bad screen writers aren't capable to develop.The way screenwriters delete Cyclops character is an example of how shouldn't be developed an screenplay. Besides, dialogues are short and full of silly jokes, there aren't any deep in the conflicts and Phoenix only kill persons she love and care and never touch the rest (what a silly idea) And a lot of explosions and good actors without nothing to do because the director only got the job because luck A waste of time and an insult to comic lovers",X-Men - The Last Stand

1529,major_angus_boothroyd,What a conclusion!,8,18 August 2006,"Attention: ""I was not sure which part of my review would be considered a spoiler. So I played safe by giving the warning. You MAY NOT find spoilers."" First of all everyone should get one point clear The movie is about a 'cure' with an ability to suppress mutant X gene permanently. The source needs an introduction which has been done (No I am not gonna tell you anything more about the source. Watch the movie.) And the movie also derives its plot from 'The Dark Phoenix Saga'. Hence Jean Gray will be in limelight and so she is. Therefore as far as the setting according to the story goes the movie is brilliant. Emotions run high in this movie and Wolverine is actually caught right in the middle of a whirlpool called dilemma. You would know why if you watch X-Men 3. Disappointments? Colossus. Minimal dialogues and the only times I saw him show real strength was catapult Wolverine into the air. Cudmore should have had a little more screen time. Rest all were great. Watch out for Iceman vs Pyro and Storm vs Callisto. All credit to cast and crew. Of course the charismatic Jackman, he deserved the limelight perfectly playing a desperate Logan looking for ways to get Jean back.Respected veterans Sir McKellen and Stewart. Berry has bounced back after her feline mess in Catwoman.",X-Men - The Last Stand

If you can call it that. But worst comic book movie ever yes. Tat means worse then Hulk, worse then spider-man 2 worse then Batman and Robin. It was so disappointing I spat at the screen.

Too many characters, too many story lines, too little time, too little talent behind the camera and holding the pen. They added in half a dozen new characters, and developed none of them. There was enough material here for 2-4 movies, and instead they make one movie that is bursting with story lines and characters, yet devoid of emotion or inspiration. I paid full price to see X1 and X2 in the theater, and bought both on DVD, and I got my money's worth. I paid half price to see X-Men: The Last Stand in a cheap theater, I will never buy it on DVD, and I feel I paid too much.

Of course, Wolverine got plenty of screen time, and Storm got her major part...but where the heck was Rogue? I mean, she had about ten minutes of screen time tops! I felt as is they could have made the movie a bit longer. A finally like this deserves at least 2 hrs! The movie felt rushed.

Some scenes obviously filmed too dark, and needed to be lightened (man, even *I* noticed the grainy effect). The story-line everyone was waiting for not happening. And it was so short!

1536,magus888,Looks like an essay outline,5,14 September 2006,"I watched this movie, and enjoyed it. It was not horrible, and it was worth the money I paid to see it. However, it was not all that it could have been. The first problem was that character development really suffered. We have some development, but not enough. That was the best part of the first two, that they were action movies that actually cared about their story lines. The special effects were nice, and the action was well done, however they fell short of their full potential as well.However, my greatest beef with this movie was the length. It was far too short. It looked like someone had done a 4 hour master piece with seven or eight interconnected story lines (Rogue and the cure, Magneto's recruiting spree, Jean vs. the Phoenix (sp?), etc.), and then cut it down to an hour and three quarters. However, instead of cutting most of the story lines, and just developing one or two to make a good, if simple, movie, they tried to put a little bit of everything in it, resulting in an inescapable feeling of emptiness when you leave the theatre, wishing that you had seen more of this character, or that that plot line had been given more screen time.All in all, the movie was acceptable, but fell well short of its potential. The next one (I still hope there is an X-4) should be longer, and more involved, or simpler. You cannot compress a complex story into an hour and three quarters without losing something, especially when you have to shoehorn in great big special effects fight scenes.

1537,curlzbaby131,All that icing and no cake,5,26 May 2006,"I am a huge fan of the X-MEN franchise, but this is ridiculous. This movie is too fast paced and it had a crappy storyline! Brett Ratner must hate details, because there are literally none. It is basically one battle scene after another (most of those were pretty cool). The screenwriter used random characters or pointless transitions just to showcase powers for the heck of it- at times it was fun, but most of the time, it was just incredibly misleading- we are led to believe they may play a central role in the plot, but they are indeterminate. The movie lacked a lot of the wit that made the first two memorable.The movies preceding ""The Last Stand"" had actually made an attempt to develop characters such as Wolverine (his past, powers & rage), but the 3rd movie made a rather digressing turn by just putting him in every scene (whether emotional or a battle). It is not enough to just be there, the screenwriter should have given the characters more to work with. Speaking of the writer, it should be mentioned that the screenwriter does not care for continuity. The movie really never gets into a smooth groove because it is very choppy.The movie is 1hr and 44 mins long, and it is an entertaining film. It is not one of those movies I am going to be going to see again in the theatres, but people should see it at least once to pay homage to the previous two films. There are some d*mn cool battle scenes (albeit, way too short), but battle scenes do not act as proper compensation for a script that is lacking. All I have to say is that if ""The Last Stand"" is not considered the 3rd movie of a trilogy, then the next director has a huge mess of a film to fix.5 out of 10 was given because there are awesome displays of power, but the combination of bad script and bad director is atrocious.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1538,cupofliferamen,Deconstructed Review,5,21 September 2006,"I don't claim to be an absolute die-hard fan, but there were a lot of characters in this movie that I had not heard of. (It seemed like there were two Spykes, I have no idea who the fast black girl is, nor who the guy wearing a bra is). Plus I don't remember Spyke or Phoenix ever being part of the brotherhood, Phoenix just wanted to destroy everything and Spyke was part of the Morlocks after a bit. Beast and Juggernaught look horrible Beast is to bright blue for real life acting and Juggernaught isn't even red, his helmet is different in a bad way, and the actor who plays him is way to small. Something else I noticed is Juggernaut seems to lose his powers when he gets close to Leech even though his powers are magical. They made a point of letting you know that the weapons the humans were using were plastic, ceramic would've made more sense. When Magento is preaching it makes the brotherhood look dressed like a bunch of Goth's and punks, In the comics and cartoons they had much more colorful outfits. I don't remember Phoenix killing Cyclops or Professor Xavier in anything I've seen or read. There's something to be said for a rendition of a plot line however its my belief this movie went way to far, the movie looks like it was rushed.

The script was abominable, character origins changed for no obvious reasons, special effects skipped due to being too expensive, a character seemingly killed just because Halle Berry held out for a bigger part in this one, the morals and ethics of the film don't make sense (apparently it's OK to kill people because they're trying to stop someone altering them against their will, but it's very sad to kill someone who is an out-of-control mass murderer who wants you to kill them).I'll see if I can find the words another time - for now, I'll just say I wouldn't go and see another X-Men film, or anything by Brett Ratner, or anything with Halle Berry in it, unless I had already heard multiple positive reviews from trustworthy sources.I just want to forget this disgrace of a film.

1540,jacobkaine709,Not what it could have been,6,23 September 2006,"OK, heres the deal, I'm a lifelong fan of comic books. This does not mean I am some be-speckled 98 pound weakling who haunts the internet to complain over whats going on with the films. My interest started from the art work, I'm an art major specializing in character design and cartooning and so comics naturally grabbed my attention, adding to this a lifelong love of film and obliviously the current run of comic book based films has my attention. What a viewer who has never read an X-men comic needs to know going in about this film is how much better it could have been.What I'm saying here is that starting from the direction to the story to the characters, it was all there but it was all lacking. There was not one thing in this film that could not have been done better. When a new viewer watches this movie, they need to know that characters that could have been very cool and very interesting aren't even given real speaking time. Also and this is where the artist part of me kicks in, I grew up on the Jim Lee era X-men, there was a definitive cool x-men look from that time and they missed it here. Juggernaut looks ridiculous, and it follows from there, to me the directors should go for the characters appearance first and then go from there. Hugh Jackman was one such casting decision, he looked like Wolverine. In this new movie though they lost this.Ben Fosters turn as the Angel case in point. Now from a ""look"" point of view the casting of Ben Foster as one of the foremost X-men drove me nuts, but I had faith in his acting ability. Angel is the pretty boy with a very dark side(His skin turns blue and he becomes the Angel of Death, so not kidding about the dark side), which after watching Fosters turn in Hostage I was willing to admit he could definitely play. I assumed he was cast not based on his physical appearance but due to his acting ability. Well he says maybe four lines in the whole film, at that point why not hire some Calvin Kline model who's 6' 4"", get the look right and not worry about him speaking? If it were just Ben Foster's character it wouldn't be that bad, but its everything. Brett Ratner packed his film so full of characters in a bid to OUT DO Bryan Singer. So instead of subtle intelligent cool, the viewer is bombarded with a cheap, special effects laden over blown film that feels more like an hour and a half long music video that someone forgot to put music to. There's barely enough time for old characters let alone new ones and They screwed up the story, which drives fans insane, but as a film fan drives me crazy because the only reason to change from source material is to improve on it, well they don't.The story is one big rush pushing for an ending thats supposed to be climatic but isn't. It's an ending true, but in so many ways it's very disappointing, it just isn't what it could have been.Now I've done a lot of complaining here and I suppose for me, no this is not a good film I have to much of an idea of what audiences could have seen, but for people who just go to a theater to see a movie I stick by my 6 out of 10. Kelsey Grammar being one of the main reasons, he is entertaining as the Beast and does actually manage to get a character arc in there. The special effects are overblown but there and there is a story with a beginning and an ending. So if you are a viewer who loved the first two films and is expecting the same level of entertainment and intelligence you're going to be let down. If you just want to watch a movie thats got random people doing things with super powers this is your movie, but hey I'm only one guy, someone else may love this film, OK, critique over.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Surprise surprise another comic book based film that doesn't go by the books. First off i hate it when the movie people have these crazy ideas that they need to change everything. People that grew up with the x-men comic and the X-men cartoon series (love it) know exactly what i am talking about. They will take something original and turn it into crap! also i hate rouge in the movie!she is not at all the rouge that i loved to see in the cartoons. she is very weak and looks and sounds nothing like what she should. instead of a tough southern bell we get this little innocent looking girl who is nothing but a whinny mutant. her power in the movie should be the power to whine which she does very well. Then they think its OK to kill all of the best x-men in the movie ............What the hell! i don't remember that happening i remember something similar but the ones that died got caught up in some telekinesis limbo thing. but then they come back. Lets pray when they make another one (which looks unlikely) they will bring back the rest of the team. I say that instead of the Americans working on the films like this we should have the Japanese direct the films. they seem to keep the originality concept into play in most of there films that come from books, video games and series. ITs sad to watch something that you anticipate will be good and then at the end feel unfulfilled. I think i will just go out and buy the cartoon series on DVD and not get sucked into the movies. I will not pay money for them to mess up a movie and then make another one that sucks.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1542,adritek-1,the commentary,8,5 October 2006,"first of all, great film. hollywoodism aside, i believe everyone behind this film was very true to the genre and story.now the ripping - so i'm watching the commentary, yeesh, can brett ratner get anymore cheesy? every line out of that guys mouth was, ""i was true to this and that and theme and colour and character and tone and music and lighting and story etc etc etc. the guy carries on like he invented the franchise.the writers chime in ever once and a while to offset ratner's natty raparte (oh yeah, i can be contrite as well - but i know a limit to my power). thank god they do, they offer a well rounded view of the film process that brought this film up to date and enjoyable.how ratner weaseled his way into this project is beyond me, how does one go from a babbling c. tucker drivel to a hardcore fan based franchise is even more crazy than thinking that ratner had any (if at all) say in what went on in this film! bottom line: ratner = a$$-licking studio 'yes' man -- writers = saviors of the genre and story!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1543,npowru,The Final Flop,1,8 October 2006,"This movie totally sucked on so many different levels. A big let down with all of the favorite characters being killed or changed to human. Such a big let down since the first two were flawless. I was highly disappointed. The film should have been about mutants good and bad coming together to fight Gene since she was that powerful. And not to have her fight until her life was threatened was also cheesy. To kill the Professor, Cyclops, to change Mystique and Rogue was not a good choice and poorly done. Why would Magneto go through all of that trouble to save his loyal right hand only to dis her? Who is Magneto without his cunning sexy blue side kick. To have Juggernaut call an under aged girl out of her name was very distasteful. The fight scenes were very poorly done and the way people died was too fast. Not to include Night Crawler and to tell how Mystique became his mother was another bad choice. We all wanted to see Night Crawler strut his stuff. What a let down and to introduce Arc Angel and not have him fight was another let down. Far from the comic book version. Hope they do a remake with the original director Bryan Singer.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1544,imaginedreamer09,alright..,8,8 October 2006,"This movie was alright. I thought it was going to be the best of the three, but I was a little disappointed. I'm a x- men movies fan, and i would definitely say i liked the second movie better. Something in x-men three just wasn't right? I hope the next one is better :] I still love x- men movies. I will continue to go see everyone that comes out!I think all the action in this was a little corny. And we have seen it all before, and it was pretty predictable. The whole ""cure thing was kinda cool though, and its awesome that the mutants will get their powers back. *in the end magneto started to get his powers back, after getting stabbed with the cure* So I'm sure the next x men movie will be awesome if he gets his power back, and the professor comes back. I'm looking forward to the next movie, if they make one!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1545,Uenoparker,Disappointing,5,13 October 2006,"Really a disappointing ending to a very promising series. The first movie got things off to a reasonably good start. The second was *very* good, showing that mutants/bad guys could actually think and behave intelligently. The third was... meh... kinda a waste of time. The character deaths were pointless and did little if anything to advance the plot. The addition of Dark Phoenix did little if anything to advance the plot. And the mutants no longer behaved as intelligently as they had. Where was Nightcrawler, BTW? Disappointing. Other questions: What in the world did Angel add to this movie? IMO -- nothing. Was there really a reason to depart so far from the comic storyline? IMO -- NOOOO!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1546,cmcoleman,Arguably the best of the trilogy.,10,19 October 2006,"X-Men The Last Stand is one of the handful of movies i've seen in the last few years that hasn't left me feeling disappointed. The story is full of a sense of impending doom and looming tragedy that mirrors the comics best years under the pen of Chris Clairmont. The film moves along at whip crack speed and has so many wonderful moments of both character and emotion. The balance between character and action has always been difficult in comic book adaptations to the big screen and even though I love the first two movies, I felt that Brett Ratner achieved that balance better than Bryan Singer. Compare X-3 to the turgid and just plain dull Superman Returns if you don't get what I'm saying. The effects were virtually flawless and the music is the best of the series scores. In particular the piece of music that accompanied Xavier and Jeans telekinetic duel and the face off between Wolverine and the out of control Pheonix during the films climax is one of the most haunting pieces of film music i've ever heard. The performances varied from excellent to workmanlike but were more than adequate for this type of film.In the battle of the summer box office X-3 delivered the most bang for your buck and who at the end of the day can argue with that.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1547,greentire23,Paging David Hayter...,6,20 October 2006,"I have seen this film twice now on DVD. I was not interested in seeing this in the theater, as it received poor reviews (both in print and by word-of-mouth), and I need to save my money for more quality cinema. I found this movie to be satisfactory as an adaptation of a single comic book issue to the big screen, but it did not in any way stack up to the previous two movies. I feel that this has much to do with the absence of Bryan Singer (haven't seen the new Superman yet, as Superman is my least favorite hero of all time). It also has to do with the absence of quality scripting that the first movies featured. I am not alone here. Many people here on IMDb have commented on the low quality one-liners (Cyclops: ""We all don't heal as fast as you""...Picard, before his death, to Phoenix: ""Don't let your powers control you"") and general lack of love for the characters shown in the dialogue. What is missing is David Hayter! He wrote the screenplay for the first X-men movie and co-wrote the second movie. To fans of the Metal Gear Solid video game series, he is the voice of Solid Snake and Big Boss. He is one of the finest non-Hollywood voice actors in video games today. For whatever reason, he did not script this movie, and I could certainly tell. If this is truly the final movie in a trilogy, and they are going to do prequels from now on, this is a shame. David Hayter should have been onboard for the finale, as should have Bryan Singer. Heck, David Hayter should have had some role as a mutant in this third movie as well. His rough as gravel voice would have been a welcome addition to the cast. You know, Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear Solid video game series seems to be a better director than many in Hollywood today. I cannot wait for the long-anticipated Metal Gear Solid movie to come. I am hoping that David Hayter will get his due either playing Solid Snake or at least doing a voice-over. I have heard that Hideo Kojima wants Viggo Mortensen in the lead role. So be it, but with David Hayter's voice-over! Oh well, I shall continue to dream. I will dream the Uwe Boll does not get to direct it either!",X-Men - The Last Stand

1549,androidcellhan,Very short movie for a long story,7,10 November 2006,"X-men 3 was a shocker for most comics fan.These people have been dying to see the last installment of the movie trilogy. According to the reviews I read, this was a disappoint but I say it wasn't entirely disappointing.It was an exciting and action-packed. Beast and Angel was introduced in the movie. I was happy that there were so many fight scenes unlike the first two. I felt happy that Storm was given more fight scenes.I think that it captured the essence of what the movie is about. The finale of trilogies should be grande and more spectacular.Brett Ratner went another way of presenting the last movie. If he based the plot entirely on the comic books, then the movie would be way predictable. I also think that the story was so fast and some characters from the previous X-men movies were not given importance.The dark phoenix was okay for me. Famke acted really good in looking like a disturbed mutant. I think one of the reasons why Rogue and Nightcrawler had no important in the movie was because it could have easily ruined the whole drama going on with Jean Grey. The fact that Rogue could absorb other mutants' powers, and Nightcrawler being able to teleport can easily outplay Phoenix. Rogue could have easily take out Jean's powers and the rest of the enemies. Brett must have thought of this.Nightcrawler, Toad, Sabertooth were all forgotten in the last movies. I didn't even notice Colossus speak in the movie. Rogue has no importance in the fight scenes. Mystique however lost her powers and got lost in the last scenes. Cyclops died within the first 30 minutes of the movie.I felt disappointed with Juggernaut and Charles weren't introduced as brothers. Callisto had better powers in the movie unlike in the comics. Shadowcat wasn't introduced properly.I just felt that it could have been longer just to present a better plot. I like the whole shocker part because it was unexpected.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1550,icejigga,Disappointed,5,26 May 2006,"I didn't think it was possible to mess up the X-men franchise since you've got almost all the same actors and actresses coming back and a decent storyline to work with as well. Well, Ratner once again proves that under his direction, there are no bounds-especially on the downside. After all, who could forget ""After the Sunset""? The previous X-men movies were so good that one hoped that the series could go out in style. Instead, we get this mediocre picture to close out the trilogy. After seeing the movie, I felt that I could have just watched the trailer and I would have basically experienced all this movie had to offer. I don't want to be too critical of this movie though. The movie isn't terrible in the absolute sense but compared to the previous two movies, it just pales in comparison. The pace of the movie was very rushed and it was obvious that they tried to cram everything in within the time frame.The movie tries to maintain a decent storytelling pace in the first hour or so. There is an actual attempt at character and plot development instead of full-blown popcorn action. Unfortunately, the problem here was they were throwing in various scenes that did not support the main story lines. There were clearly way too many mutants and it seemed a lot of them were just putting in face-time and showing off their powers. All in all, it just seems they were trying to jam all this footage in without taking the time out to develop and make it good. What also bothered me was the Phoenix storyline. It did not fit well with the mutant cure storyline. It almost seems like half the time she's standing there bored waiting for her turn at camera time. In my opinion, they should have just made this movie solely about the Phoenix and explored her evil side. Perhaps she goes on a rampage or something and then it culminates in the obvious big battle. Now, THAT would have been a movie. The mutant cure story wasn't bad, just this movie wasn't long enough to support two plots. The action and CGI are top notch of course. They do not disappoint at all. I just hope they change their minds and make another X-men movie. Surely, they can't let this be remembered as the last X-men movie. There are good scenes and acting performances scattered throughout the movie that keep it enjoyable and prevent it from being a disaster like the Punisher or Daredevil. I just wondered if someone had properly managed the flow and execution of this movie *cough* Singer *cough, how great this movie would have been? Well I guess there's always Superman Returns...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1551,daibhi,"Good Screenwork, bad writing",2,9 December 2006,"First I would apologize to the fanfolk who liked the movie on all merits however, I must say that with regards to the FX and music, the movie rocked. However, with regards to the storyline, it was dead, deader than dead. It was in my very humble opinion the prototypical ""tired writer/movie maker"" syndrome. They basically get tired of the concept and decide, despite what fandom may want in killing everyone off.Things that ticked me off most in the movie: 1. Killing off the main characters of Scott Summers and Charles Xavier within the first half to first hour of the film. 2. Weak writing on both Storm and Wolverine's character. 3. The Holodeck sequence, blending of Star Trek: TNG into X-MEN. 4. Having Magneto ""cured""That's just the starters, I'll close here but I sincerely regret now buying the DVD and will probably EBAY it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1552,glennmerritt,**SPOILERS**Both enjoyable and totally rubbish at the same time!,2,31 May 2006,"X-men comic and cartoon fans will probably think 5 or 6 major plot elements are stupid and totally out of the x-men world.So much potential to make a great Phoenix-centric movie wasted by stupid ""twists"" and crazy story lines, Vinnie Jones is plain awful as the waste of a great villain that became Juggernaught, even the Logan character is mixed up and without true character from his comic book life.The death of Cyclops was stupid, the ""deaths"" of Mystique, Magneto, Rogue and Prof X were un-needed and made a mockery of the film. Angel was in 3 scenes, what a waste.Clearly the guys who wrote the story have no feeling or understanding of the characters, the x-men or comic book films in general.Positives: Kelsey Grammar was brilliant, and was the obvious choice for Beast. Iceman actually icing up was great. Golden Gate Bridge scenes were very well done.The biggest winner is Bryan Singer! This film made him look like a genius!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1553,DarkenedHeart,Not a real X-Men movie.,4,19 April 2011,"The movie entertained me but I have to try and disassociate it from X-Men because frankly they changed too much. I know movies have to change some things. But in this they changed too much, often to an unnecessary degree.The Phoenix - wasn't the Phoenix. Not even close. She was more like Scarlet Witch. Her powers were nothing like the Phoenix's. It's also a letdown given in X2 they tease us with the full Fire Bird image in the water.Rogue, a great character, was rendered fully and completely useless. It's bad enough the SERIOUSLY nerfed her abilities down in the first and second movies but in this one she's was entirely worthless.What the fluff was with Callisto? Why change her entirely? Her attitude, her powers, her role it seemed, her very reason for existing in the X-Men mythos was erased and replaced with this retarded amalgamation of a depowered Quicksilver and Caliban. Pathetic in every conceivable way.They changed Pyro's ability. In previous movies and all of the mythos his ability is ""control"" of fire not generation but he is able to ""expand"" small fire into larger amounts to an extent. Yet in this movie he seems to have an infinite supply of fuel for his lighter seemingly hidden on his body. Yet, in multiple scenes we also see him generating fire without the lighter. No need for the change, and silly.Storm getting beat him by this wacky and crap Callisto? Really? Storm, one of the more powerful mutants up there with Xavier and Magneto who can decimate towns to cities with just her mind, a woman who was revered as a Goddess was getting beat up by Callisto, who is frankly a weak and pathetic excuse and shouldn't have been able to land a single hit - why the fluff didn't Storm just swirl the wind around to slam her into a wall, a move that would guarantee work no matter how fast Callisto dashes? Seriously? Quill/Omega Kid acting like a bad-ass. Most laughable thing ever. Amongst the weakest of the mutants seen and he's acting tough? Silly, very silly.Cyclops and Xavier are killed off which, while evil could serve the plot. The X-Men become leaderless, lost, perfect for the story of finding their feet again and overcom-- oh wait, no. None of that except for one cheesy speech and one tiny scene. So, why the feck were the killed again? Why do this if the story doesn't need it? Dick move. Very much a dick move.Psylocke? People keep saying she was in this movie. Now Psylocke has history with X-Men, she's a psychic with telepathic ability and can form Psychic Knives that can be used for stuns or kills. Interesting, a good character for even a small role and no need of any kind to change powers so... Where the hell was she? There wasn't even the slightest hint of this character anywhere in the movie. Was it a deleted scene? Or were they, once again, changing the character and abilities when it was completely unnecessary? Is this actually an X-Men movie? Really? Juggernaut was vastly changed. His history erased. It didn't need a big thing, why not just still leave the reference there that Juggy is actually Step-Brother to Xavier? Oh, of course, because this just really isn't an X-Men movie. At this point it's better to say ""inspired by the vague idea of X-Men"" not ""an actual X-Men movie"".Angel was useless. Good character and good opportunity to show his development from self-loathing kid into a young man acknowledging and learning to proud of his wings. He was more than just wingman, he had heightened eyesight and later develops some minor healing ability (as in, healing other people). But, no, sod that, sod the whole point of having him, let's just make him insta-snap to the pride thing all on his own because lord knows a person dealing with self-loathing for years on end is going to instantly become accepting of themselves just like that. *sigh* This wasn't an X-Men movie. It was some lame attempt to imitate a few things but by no means can it really be an X-Men movie when they mess around with almost every character for no good reason. The first two were X-Men movies. Things were changed here and there for necessity but they were mostly on track. This movie, wasn't. Entertaining as a movie but pure insult to call this an X-Men movie.It's almost as bad as the X-Men Origins: Wolverine but not quite.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1554,thelosos,Garbage,1,6 January 2007,"I registered just so i could say that i pray to whatever deity, maybe even Odin, that this is an alternate universe movie. X-men die a lot, i know that because its in the source material, but they come back or it turns out it was different time line or some other crazy excuse... but the brutal way they get rid of key main characters is absolutely ridiculous in this movie! After they just offed cyclops, I think i picked up my jaw somewhere around the mystique gets normed scene. Then, just as i had it cleaned up and replaced, they whack Prof. X... and now i see they somehow plan on doing another X movie... but with what characters??? who's left?? they killed the corner stones of the team, wolverine sure as hell cant lead or hold the xmen together. Storm could do it, but who wants to watch Hallie be a leader full time? plus, no matter what anyone says, just because she's pretty doesn't mean shes perfect for the role of an African princes with powers over weather.

1555,hilla2@rpi.edu,Do yourself a favor and forget about it.,4,10 August 2006,"What? A third X-men film? What are you talking about? They never got around to it. You must be thinking of something else. Pity, though. The first two were so entertaining. Imagine how great a third one would have been...Yes... this is what's going through your mind now. Repeat it to yourself. Repeat and remember. Do not attempt to let any other reality clutter your mind. The truth of this movie's existence is a truth best left forgotten.The primary reason is that to put it simply and quite generally, compared to the first two X-Men films, this film fell way below the mark in plot, character development, and scripting. Now before I elaborate on this, I'm sure some who have seen the film are thinking, ""Yes, but the point was to end the series, and that's what they did, so the movie was a success."" I almost agree. I'd say the point was to end the series WELL. And to that end they most certainly did not succeed. In essence, it was much more akin to a sloppily written concluding paragraph to an excellently constructed essay, conjured together solely due to the necessity of a concluding paragraph with little thought to the work that for which it serves to be the finishing punctuation.Let's talk scripting and character development first, which were the weakest points of the film. The first two movies were filled with key exchanges between major characters that led us deeper into their beings and made them feel real. The second movie in particular, though it boasted a large cast, worked diligently to make each character feel necessary to the story. The first film set up several important character interactions, and the second not only elaborated on those but introduced new ones that were equally compelling. XM:TLS, however, neither introduces nor elaborates. Whatever we know about the characters in XM:TLS must already be with us before the opening credits roll. Many key character interactions feel cut short and shallow (Scott/Logan was a disappointing regurgitation of their old issues, there was very little Xavier/Magneto besides a flashback and a quick exchange in a residential setting, Magneto and Mystique are on the screen together for about three minutes, and Rogue and Iceman barely even speak to each other... not even to argue). The only character one could argue shows any development at all is Logan, but for this to have been a feasible wrap-up, they should have done better than just one character. Also, several key moments are fraught with terrible lines and worse delivery, as if the actors recognized the flawed script and lowered their enthusiasm in quiet protest. Without giving away too much, one major character's downfall in the film's climax is met with the spellbinding memorable line, ""I'm..."". Yep, that's the whole thing. And as dumb as that sounds here, it's even worse on the screen.The plot of the movie is just as deplorable. (Possible spoiler alert... but if you've read this far, then you've either already seen it or are actually considering my arguments, so read on.) The first problem is that a few of those key characters that the first two movies had encouraged us to love are not even present in XM:TLS or play an extremely minor role. Don't look for Nightcrawler... apparently he teleported out of here (I like to think when he read the script). Other key characters (at least three) are rendered functionally useless (e.g. death, loss of powers, mysterious disappearances) by it's midpoint. Many of these losses might have been truly powerful with some magnificent scripting to support them, but alas, there was none to be found. In the end, I felt I had lost characters I loved, but not to the inevitable circumstances of the story's progression, but to the vortex of shallow plot devices thrown together to end the story as quickly as possible.While some new characters are (more fully) introduced, like Beast and Juggernaut, there was very little background given for any new character. Beast is introduced as a refined diplomatic government worker who happens to be blue and furry and has connections with the X-Men. Juggernaut is literally simply found, his name read aloud with ""Once he gains momentum, nothing can stop him,"" and he's sent out on his merry way. Indeed, the development of new characters would have been counterproductive to the director's intention of simply wrapping up story lines, so it seems he took pains to keep all new characters on a shallow level which completely paralyzes the audience's ability to connect with them.I could continue, but I believe this review is verbose enough, and by now I've painted a sufficiently detailed portrait of this film's shortcomings to appease my troubled mind. In conclusion, this movie existed only to wrap up story lines, bringing very little substance to the table and consequently very little satisfaction to the fan. So do yourself a favor and forget this film ever existed. I plan to.Wait, what film was I reviewing again?",X-Men - The Last Stand
1556,mystery_shah123,True X-Men Fans verdict,1,5 February 2007,"One of the worst movies ever made. If anyone wishes to give a true X-Men fan a torture make them watch this movie. Beware if you make them watch this movie twice you will be attending their funeral. I don't know if there was anything in this movie we could have truly appreciated. It seems the people who are appreciating this movie are completely unaware of x-men's comics and cartoon plus they they lack the ability to distinguish between a masterpiece and junk.There were so much expectation from this movie and all of them went deep down in the gutters. I am still at loss what was this movie about. Pheonix, Sentinel or The Cure. All of them are completely different stories. The killing of Cyclops, Professor Xavier was completely senseless. Scott was the main motivation for Jean to overcome Pheonix in cartoons and comics. But a split second killing of Scott without a fight, regret , and relunctance on behalf of Jean was disgusting. It left a bad taste right from the start. Pheonix role was totally absurd. Just standing like a zombie for most of the movie and used in a mediocre ending. Xavier killing would have been justified if in the end Jean could have conrolled her power and defeat Pheonix just like the Professor was advising her when he was dying. Rogue was also a casualty deprived of her powers. A true X-Men fan knows that Rogue character and personality is not truly displayed in any of films in this trilogy. She is displayed as cry baby doing nothing special. She has ability to be most the powerful mutant as she can absorb the power of any mutant and can also kill them in the process. Juggernaut's inclusion was total disaster in the sense that his true personality was completely altered. He is not a mutant. His powers are mystical. There was no mentioning of his relations with Prof X. In this way one of the fearsome rivalry was left out. And also the way he was shown in a film was ridiculous. In plastic suit and not so threatening physique. His true personality is more of a rough neck and aggressive. Juggernaut usually works independently. So how in the hell he joined Magneto without even saying a word ?Believe me this movie was not X-Men 3. It was Wolverine 3. The whole movie was centered around that Wolf and of course Storm as his side kick. Wolverine was shown completely invulnerable and indestructible. All of us knows that he has healing powers. But the rate at which he was recovering was outrageous and extremely exaggerated. How come Pheonix possessing the extreme telekenetic powers was not able to hold the Wolverine back. Her powers were greater than of Magneto and she could have tossed him form one country to another. But instead Wolverine was walking towards her without any serious damage and she was just waiting to get killed. Why didn't she resort to flying when that wolf was coming to stab her. Where was her force field when she needed the most. It would have been better if Wolverine realizing that he could not match her power began shouting that he killed Professor and her lover Cyclops and Jean finding the motivation to control her power. If Mr Ratner or co were really bent upon killing her. It could have been better that she was fighting rest of X-Men and Wolverine stabing her from behind. Lack of these scenarios and details made the script and this movie really weak. Summing it up it was a sucker of a movie and showed Mr Ratner is also a mutant possessing the power of destroying years of good work in just an hour.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1558,HeavenForbid,Pitiful X-scuse of a Movie,1,14 March 2007,"""I would have rather flushed my money down the toilets then spend it on that movie ticket,"" said Theresa Lewis when interviewed outside the Danbury Cinema in Chillicothe. ""It would have been much more entertaining and I wouldn't have had to go as far to throw up."" Such was the reaction of many movie viewers as they left the movie theater after seeing 'X-Men 3: The Last Stand'. One movie viewer, Kathryn Lewis, went so far as to say, ""I would rather cut off my right arm and eat it then have to sit through that again."" The movie, directed by Brett Ratner, begins where 'X-Men 2: X-Men United' left off - absolutely nowhere! In the ""not so distant future"", Xavier and his circus of freaks are once again battling Magneto, a mutant whose power is the ability to (you guessed it!) control magnets, and who is determined to (you guessed it again!) destroy mankind. Needless to say he is eventually defeated and winds up playing chess by himself in a park. Although in most regards the movie was worse then its forerunner (if that's possible), in one respect it was better: three main characters are brutally killed (unfortunately Wolverine isn't one of them). It was obvious to many viewers that the makers of the movie were trying to cram as many characters from the original comic book series onto the screen as possible, even at the cost of a good script. Many of the characters were useless to the plot and several ""main characters'"" names were never mentioned. This movie is brimming with supposedly clever comments, hours of pointless violence, mediocre special effects, and another band of disposable mutants. The acting is poor and the script is worse. The plot is non-existent. Movie Weekly declares, ""Unbelievable! I had no idea any primate higher that a lemur was capable of making a movie this bad!"" Movie Watcher Today hails it as ""Shocking, we haven't seen a movie this bad since 'Mutant Blood-Sucking Alien Clowns from Another Galaxy'."" The Movie Watcher's Almanac adds, ""Outrageous, at one point someone in the theater took off his clothes and killed himself with a fork in front of everyone, and nobody realized it wasn't part of the movie!"" Anyway, the total run time is approximately 104 minutes although they could have made it 4 minutes without any loss to the plot. The movie ends with a final scene that suggests a sequel although what the title could be remains a mystery. Possible candidates include 'X-Men 4: The Last, Last Stand', 'X-Men 4: The Last Stand 2', and 'X-Men 4: The Last Stand-We Mean it This Time'",X-Men - The Last Stand
1559,Pegasuz,"The final installation(?) has it ups, and downs. Mostly a piece for the fans.",6,27 May 2006,"First of all, let me start by saying that as a fan, X-Men 3 meets the expectations. The problem is, that's all it does. What the first movies had in humor. and wit, this one lacked, and compensated for with (brilliant) stunts/CGI. Brett Ratner is known for is leaning towards massive scenes, and you can expect some massive shots. (Golden Gate should be no secret, being put in the trailer). Allow me to go somewhat deeper into the material. The intro gives us some further background into how Jane Grey was ""recruited"" into the X-men. We also learn that she is indeed more powerful than both Xavier and Eric Lehnsherr. It seems that the writers are running on fumes for long parts of the movie, and key characters are being faded out (in my opinion) too fast. During the first quarter of the movie, three VERY prominent characters are off...Having many of the characters we know from before leaving this early, opens for a new set of gallery, unfortunately, the movie is rather short in length, so as an audience, we never get to ""know"" them very well. A character such as Juggernaut (played by Vinnie Jones), could have been a both funny and diverse plot, but ends up as a regular trooper almost...If you liked Rouge (who didn't), you're also in for a disappointment. She comes, leaves and that is that. Same goes for Cyclops,, Mystique and many other... When the first X-Men came out, I for one, was intrigued by all the mutants at the school NOT playing a major part, looking forward to see them grow in the next installments. Sadly, most of them never did... Instead of keeping the characters Singer spent two films developing, and introducing, they're almost forgotten, or replaced by characters you never really get to care for. The Iceman/Pyro theme is played out well, so at least that's some, and Beast actually works out better than feared. Big thumbs-up to Kelsey Grammar for taking a part so out of typecast and having fun with it. As for Angel, the trailer holds him as a main character. He is in now way that, but I'm willing to let that pass. Introducing yet another character, when so many new is already up, would be even more confusing.There's action in this movie, lot's of it, so if you don't have strong feelings for the first two, and likes BIG scenes, you'll be more than happy. In that way, this film is NOT for the die hard fans. If you liked the first two, and expected to see the school vs the Magneto crew, this film isn't that much what you asked for, but it's still worth seeing.All in all, calling X-Men 3 a bad movie wouldn't be fair. The actors do a good job with what they were handed. Kelsey Grammar plays it just right, and Sir Ian McKellen is worth the ticket alone (as always). I'd also like to point out Halle Barry and Famke Jansen. Vinnie Jones isn't acting bad, but he isn't handed the best cards from the start... This is, as a stand-alone, pure popcorn entertainment, and will stand in the shadow of the first two. As and end to a series, it does what they wanted it to do, namely not ending anything in a way that can't be spun on...SO, to the end of the film... It's called the last stand. Do NOT leave the theater before ALL the end credits are shown. Not everything is what it appears. If you pay attention early in the movie, you see what I mean.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1560,RaymondShaw,"Couldn't think of an ""X-"" pun",7,25 May 2006,"To be honest this is nowhere near as bad as I had feared. Third installmentitis hovers at the edge of your visual fields throughout; it just never comes into view. Very little character development has taken place - that that has is fairly extreme and binary in nature, good/bad sort of stuff. All SFX are up to expected standards, but nothing we've not seen before. Acting is very much by the numbers. There are enough new characters to keep ringing the changes, however, perhaps not enough concentration on those that we are familiar with. The script and ideas seem excellent - perhaps in other hands a darker film was lurking which could have been so much more satisfying for a conclusion. In essence; 100 minutes of crowd-pleasing bunkum with enough mythos to probably keep the fan-boys happy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1561,grlgoddess_101,A decent movie,8,30 September 2008,"First off, I am not a huge fan of X-Men. I enjoy them and all, but I am not really knowledgeable of all the different back stories. I haven't yet seen the first movie, but really enjoy the second.Now about this movie; visually, the effects were alright. However, it seemed a bit choppy, cutting between shots a bit too often or sharply. The plot lines were good in theory, but I was often wondering just how some of the stuff was managed. The Phoenix and Cure plot lines could have each made their own movie, but in this meshing of them, both were severely underdeveloped. Starting with Phoenix, it started off kinda cheesy, then got interesting, but quickly lost its appeal. All the stuff about her being completely controlled by joy and rage quickly dissipated into bland apathy. For most of the movie, she just stood there, occasionally letting lose and trashing some things.With the Cure, it was sort of a background thing, not really affecting the really main characters. You kind of forget that this ""cure"" is the whole reason for the upcoming battle. Then, all of a sudden, you're reminded ""oh right, that kid they have to kill."" Also, Angel is a really cool character from what little I know. It was disappointing that, even though he was important enough to be put in right near the start, he basically just swooped in like three times. His character could have been developed way more.Overall, I did enjoy the movie. It was fun to watch, despite the many plot disappointments.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1562,Protector of the World,Death of a trilogy,1,28 May 2006,"I mean it how it is, how it sounds. This film (piece of crap) is the final nail in the coffin of what could have been the finish to one of the best comic book movie trilogy ever. Already being an X-Men fan and someone that knows good from bad I plead everyone reading this DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.We have a cure for our main plot and the rise of Jean Grey. By doing this the filmmakers then Kill the leader of the X-Men Scott Summers within ten minutes of the film starting and then kill off the X-Men founder Prof. X. now i don't know about anyone else but by doing that they have alienated mostly all of the comic book fan audience. along the way Mystique, Rogue and Magneto are all cured.... ....WHY?!! The script was so weak i wanted to puke in my popcorn box. Most of the action was moderate at best and not even the great Wolverine (God bless you Hugh Jackman) could save this film. The direction of Ratner take no originality of experimentation with CGI. No what we get is a film that should have been the best of the three but is the worst.I could go on but i'll finish by saying this. Hollywood execs those runners that get you coffee, take your crap and still come into work everyday for more. If ever you see one of them with a comic in his your safer giving him 100 million than you are Brett Ratner for this total annihilation of one the best stories in comics.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Let me tell you the pros and cons.Pros -Killing off the Professor was the right thing to do Professor X death by the hands of his own student was a great sendoff. With his death the story was allowed to move forward.-The cameos were handle well for the most part Most of the mutants got good screen time for the most part.-The action scenes were truly amazing THis has probably the best CGI ever seen in a film.The comic book lines were cool Who didn't love, ""Oh my stars in garters."" Cons -SHOULD NOT HAVE KILLED OFF CYCLOPS He is the leader of the X-Men. How can you kill him off? He got the shaft in all three films? - Why is it always Wolverine and friends Wolverine always gets the spotlight!!! I know he is a great character, but could the story had evolved around Jean's true love, Cyclops.-All you need is a healing ability to defeat Dark Phoenix Once again Wolverne taking center-stage Overall I was very entertained by the movie. I think if Bryan Singer had still been apart of the movie it would have been better. Brett Ratner did a great job with what he had.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The whole movie was just simply unrealistic. All the main characters had superpowers, which they were disliked by the normal people. Let's start with one of the main characters, Cyclops. He has got a superpower which had a laser eye and he used it as a weapon. Next, that was Magneto who was in the bad side. His superpower was that he was magnetic. In real life, if he is magnetic, he should have controlled the whole world as he could control all the weapons but in the movie he lost. At last, that was Xavier. He was a key man in the whole movie. He was the head of the justice side but he was disabled. Therefore, his strength was that he could read what the others think.Besides, the whole movie was just a mindless entertainment. It just ran with big actions and movements. If you are fond of this kind of stuff, I suggest giving the money to Jacky Chan's Rush Hours, at least it was a bit 'funnier'.

Stay away from things you don't understand, please.Let us fans take care of this, okay? You made some incredibly characters into right out wusses.

There really aren't words to express how angry and disgusted I was when I left the theater.So I'm just going to point out a couple of little things I haven't seen mentioned yet: 1. Storm naturally has white hair. In the first 2 movies she has white hair. So WHY does she have like 1-inch long dark gray roots in this movie? Are we supposed to believe that she went out of her way to dye her roots only so it would LOOK like she naturally had dark gray hair but put foils in it and bleached it white? 2. Jean Gray: poorly thought-out combination of the Dark Phoenix and Scarlet Witch characters. WHY? 3.

1569,DamnOrbOven,Story hopelessly dragged down by unforgivable plot twists,1,28 May 2006,"The movie viewed completely as an action movie was decent. From the perspective of a fan devoted to the comic books, the many character appearances and displays of mutant power were mostly well done and enjoyable. Even the adaptation of the storyline from various comic books was done to nicely fit into a more realistic setting without traveling to alternate dimensions and all of that.***Spoilers*** But killing off the three X-Men most closely related to the comic books for 40 some odd years is a travesty and a big middle finger from Ratner to all of the close followers of the franchise. I can deal with the fact that Rogue, Magneto, and Mystique have a loophole for a return to the series should another movie be made. And Xavier returning to another body is a clever twist so long as it can somehow be explained that his powers came with him. But poor Cyclops--who through 3 movies was so underused that you almost feel confused about why he was even in the movies--get's bizarrely vaporized just when you think he might actually have a significant impact on the plot. And Jean Grey? Not only is she killed with the least room for a way to bring her back later on, but throughout the entire Pheonix saga, you never get a feel for any internal struggle going on. They made it 50% of the basis of the movie and it's like they totally ignored developing the character at all.The worst part of it is, these are the only things that really kept me from enjoying this movie, and you get the feeling that any director that cared about the rich history of those characters could have made small changes without it impacting the overall plot. If they actually do make an X4, I seriously hope they get another director and address those problems.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1570,a-random-contribution,If this was the end... then they obviously knew how to go out with a pang.,4,16 February 2009,"The first time I saw X-3, I was absolutely mesmerized by the action scenes and effects. 1 year later, I started going to movies with friends that utterly loved Independent films, and I quickly matured into someone that developed a finer taste in terms of the entirety of the movie, the dialog, the character developments and the way the characters could grow on me, rather than the mindless action lover I was a year prior. Remembering my love for X-Men, I watched X-3 first, because at the time; it was my favorite of the three. I was absolutely bewildered as to what the happened to the epic film I tagged as one of the best comic-book adaptations to date, and why it was replaced with something so much less than profound. I still thought somewhat highly of it- that is until I watched the first 2 films before watching 3 again, one last time to make a final judgment.From X-1 to X-2, there seemed to be an apparent 'evolution' (no pun intended) in the storyline. As the main characters were established, there was more time for action to be instilled and the characters could really be further fleshed out into what made them lovable in the original comics. Story lines became deeper, intense. Characters grew up and matured, and the plot line became more complex, delving deeper into Wolverine's past.X-3 completely disregarded this, and it totally caught me off guard upon my realization and how blind I was the first time around, watching the 'epic' film. I had no idea what Bryan Singer was thinking but wait, therein lies the flaw. As far as I was concerned, Bryan Singer had directed all of the X-Men movies and how mistaken I was, in thinking that. Upon discovery, you couldn't imagine how angered I was that someone that taken no part in either of the previous movies could have possibly attempted to out-direct Singer and create a massive hit, let alone being able to take the movie under his own wing. Inevitably, it missed the mark. By a mile. Not only had Ratner thought he could complete the trilogy with a film bigger than the first 2 movies, he completely demolished the solid foundation Singer had created and built on in the first 2 movies and constructed something on very unstable ground;(HadExpandedOnThePointsButwordLimitStoppedMe)Point 1. The impossibly fast pace. Point 2. Unholy amounts of new mutants being squeezed into the picture. Point 3. The killing off/departure of some originals/favorites. Point 4. The detachment from the suspense created by the end of the Second movie.Within the first 20 minutes of the movie, Jean is resurrected, (Only to die again in the end), Scott is killed in the next 5 minutes of that and Professor Xavier is killed half an hour after. If X-3 wasn't a game of ""Let's see how many of the original cast we can kill off before pushing our luck"", then I'll kiss the ground Ratner walks on. This was the deal breaker of the movie. I could sit through the movie not knowing half the new character's names, and I sure as hell could deal with the feeling that the movie felt out-of-sync. But to kill two of the original characters just lost me completely especially after they had such a solid fan base (I'm a major Marsden and Stewart Fan, so you could imagine the outrage at killing off Cyclops. Still recovering from the shock, only to be stabbed again by killing off Professor Xavier! I almost threw my remote at the new television). By then I was only semi-angry at the way Mystique departed from the film earlier. Rogue should have been killed off too considering she played hooky for 95% of the film. By then, Jean's death meant nothing. She's been there done that, killed off 2 of the major characters and figures in her (and our) life, and died again. Joy.I often fathom on how X-3 would have turned out like if Singer had directed it. I had instincts telling me SUCH different things. Rogue's transition from troubled runaway, into a confident and (more) secure young woman showed me that she could get some decent fight scenes for X-3. In the X-Men 1 and 2 deleted scenes, Jubilee is acknowledged. Playing such a major role in Wolverine's character in the comics, I was half-expecting her to be introduced and fleshed out in the third installment. ( but half expecting her to still play a minor role because Singer had established and did not wish to intrude on the strong bond between Rogue and Wolverine). Either way, though she's listed in the cast for X-3, I didn't see her at all.Guesses aside, I can safely bet that had he done it, it would have been just as good, and if not better than X-2, which to me was Singer's finest pieceHowever, X-3 is not entirely lacking. 5/10 was given to it for its redeeming properties.Gorgeous cinematography. The trailers for it looked *so* good because the composition, camera angles, colors and effects made it look like art if you freeze framed it.AndThe brilliant musical scores in this movie, was to me, the light of hope for this movie. The score being played in Xavier's death scene gave me goose bumps.Don't get me wrong, this movie is 'entertaining' if you're not seriously into X-Men and are only 'acquainted' fans the first two films for the comic-brilliance that they were. Or if you like massive action and fight scenes that take up two-thirds of the movie a 'Popcorn movie' to be accurate. But if you're a die-hard X-Men fan, or someone that truly appreciated the substance, and magic Singer brought into this franchise, I suggest sticking to daydreams on what could have been  than seeing the highly anticipated 'final installment'.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I am very disappointed, because as a fan of the comic books i have waited for 15 years to see Phoenix on the big screen (can you guess i am a huge phoenix fan), and finally we get her in the film and then it was just a kinda let down.

1572,anystrangeparallel,"Why didn't Magneto just drop the Golden Gate Bridge on Alcatraz Island...or better yet, just get the Phoenix to incinerate the island....",2,21 April 2009,"The second sequel in the X-men series was a poor follow-up. The three or four solid, intriguing story lines developed in the first two movies were but fragments in The Last Stand, and the various character portraits reduced to skeletons of themselves.Instead of mutants appearing as powerful, otherworldly-sorts of beings, they are now hunted down similar to how petty criminals get chased and cornered in ""reality"" crime shows such as Cops or Dog: Bounty Hunter. Whereas mutants used to be individually-painted and each possess a visibly distinctive set of superpowers, they are now faceless members of a 'mob', and dress in the Gothic garb of the creatures that once filled UPN's Buffy the Vampire Slayer. For Chrissakes, one mutant's superpower is to turn into the villain from Hellraiser....Plans for world domination have now become reduced to killing some little Golden Child who can turn mutants into normal human beings. This Golden Child is sequestered on Alcatraz island, and an entire army (!) of mutants traipses over to San Francisco in order to eliminate this threat.Now, when Magneto tore the Golden Gate Bridge off of its moorings in order to give the mutants something to cross San Franciso Bay, I started wondering why he didn't just take this many thousands of tons of flying metal, and drop the damn thing right on the structures on the island where the boy was housed. That certainly would have crushed most anything standing upright on the island. Magneto could then have ""swept"" the bridge from side to side, like some giant metal broom, across the surface of the island, to further crush and grind its inhabitants into the dirt.Wait a minute, that above scenario seems too complicated...Wain't the character of Phoenix set up to have near-omnipotent powers? Why didn't Magneto just very nicely ask her to raze the island to the ground with her vast mental powers? She might have refused him...? Okay, well then, he could have fallen back on Plan B of using the bridge as a multi-ton flying weapon...Wouldn't those two scenarios have been far better climaxes, or near-climaxes, than a ""street fight"" sort of ending pitting dozens of faceless mutants against each other? Sure, these scenarios might have shortened the movie by a considerable amount, but then that freed-up movie time could have been used for something much more worthwhile, such as character development of the mutants...",X-Men - The Last Stand

1574,IANmania,A Bomb,4,27 May 2006,"When it comes to big Hollywood blockbusters, I've learned that it's often best to keep my expectations low. The X-men franchise, to this point, had been different. The first film pleasantly surprised me; the second film outpaced the first. I couldn't help but feel like something was missing from the third film. Maybe it was the former director, a remote sense of character development, or even an engaging plot. Whereas some films are destroyed during production or in the editing process, the failures of x-men 3 seem to reach back to the pre-production period. Besides losing its director, the X-men franchise had problems with its major stars. James Marsden had a limited schedule so his part was smaller than it should have been. Halle Berry demanded a bigger role. Alan Cummings wasn't invited back to play Nightcrawler. As a result, Cyclops is killed off quickly and Storm is shoved down our throat.Other x-men characters are simply lost in the shuffle. Kitty Pride and Collossus have maybe one paragraph of dialog. The Angel, with all of his appearances in the commercials, is really only in a few scenes. Even Professor X, Rogue and Mystique have their roles massively reduced. X-men 3 is a skeleton of a concept, thrown together by a second-rate filmmaker and a heavily compromised cast. As time passes, I will probably mention this film alongside the 2nd and 3rd Matrix films and all of the new Star Wars. Avoid at all costs!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1575,philaulie,"Mildly exciting to the general public, a huge disappointment to fans...",2,31 May 2006,"*This comment contains some spoilers, if this movie could be more spoiled for you*There were plenty of ways to make the final X-Men movie a good one. Plenty.Unfortunately, there were also plenty of ways to ruin it, and it seems Brett Ratner and the scriptwriters for X-Men:The Last Stand made almost every mistake in the final X-Men movie of what-could've-been a remarkable trilogy.The basic premise is that a cure to the mutant ""disease"" has been developed, and of course Magneto and his clan are out to stop humans from ending the lives of mutants (whom they believe are the next step in evolution). Throw in the return of Jean Grey as a psychic with a split-personality, and the most powerful mutant of them all.First and foremost, this movie lets you down almost immediately with the quality and creativity of its action sequences. Remember the Nightcrawler scene from the beginning of X-2? Forget it. This movie offers nothing even remotely close to as beautifully simple as that scene. Then the let downs continue with the pointless return of Jean Grey (another comic- book plot ruined by Hollywood) as Phoenix, and the death of a major (yet constantly under- developed) character. The hits keep on missing, soon there are too many mutants to keep track of, a cure for the mutant disease, and one cheesy one-liner after another.It's saddening for any fan of the comic books (or the cartoon series) to watch so many great potential plots be ruined in one fell swoop. And for those in the audience who are new to the X-Men, it's just confusing. Names and objectives are glossed over, action scenes are rushed, dialogue is choppy and uninformative, the background music is uninspired (even boring), and the actors seem to be floating through their roles.Why did this happen?Is it because Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman demanded larger roles? Storm (Berry) is a lot more impressive in this movie, and gets the chance to show off her powers, but she still takes a backseat to Wolverine, and the countless other nameless mutants (both good and bad) who litter the screen at any moment.Don't get me wrong, this movie has it's moments. However, they are brief and forgettable. For instance, Multiple Man (who has a pretty interesting ability to multiply himself into countless copies) is only shown using his power once. It's a great moment, but it's a moment that could've happened more.Where X2 fully explored the possibilities of its mutants (especially Nightcrawler and Wolverine), X3 introduces fantastic possibilities and then just lets them dangle, helpless, in your face. Just like the head of the Sentinel in the danger room scene (which seemed thrown in as an afterthought to please a few fans, and served to only anger them, it seems).All I can hope is that Bryan Singer made the right move, and Superman Returns will be a movie to look forward to. Honestly, save your money, and wait a month for Mr. Singer to successfully tackle another comic book franchise and remind Brett Ratner how it's done.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1576,strike71,"Disappointing, wretched, two-dimensional, and a missed opportunity",1,4 June 2006,"There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to decide where to begin and how to keep the word count to a minimum. I will say that the casting was a nice touch. Sticking with familiar and in some cases beloved faces was, for me, the only pleasant element in what was otherwise a painfully manipulative and cardboard film.The screenplay was fluff, with none of the humor or irony or self-depreciating comments of the first two 'X-men' films. None of the jokes, verbal or visual, were memorable, and all were predictable in the extreme. Important, even vital 'X-men' characters that shared long and loyal histories with one another were killed off or removed from the story line with no more than a few pat phrases of farewell or betrayal.Characters were flat, given two emotions to work with at most. In Logan's (Wolverine's) case these were frantic concern and dry sarcasm in various degrees. Some characters, such as Hank (The Beast) and Storm were given fewer than that, playing only with various shades of 'determined'.The story, god, the story. What could have been a true heart wrenching tale of self-loathing and renewal, real Greek-type mythological stuff on the nature of man, which is what 'X-men' is all about after all, was reduced to a constant stream of destruction and killing, though oddly bloodless. True, this is just par for the course these days in cinema, but I take it much more personally in this case, because what went before, 'X-men' and 'X-men: United', while hardly perfect, had such promise and even heart.I could go on and on, but what's the point? When I heard over a year ago that Bryan Singer was abandoning 'X-men' to do 'Superman' I had a surge of misgiving. Surely no-one could inject the kind of passion into the project that he had. I was right.It seems odd to give a movie one star out of ten. Could it really be that bad? Yes. It's a miserable, disappointing, failure of a movie. It should have grabbed me and wrenched at my heart, prodded my ironic snicker, stimulated my horror of injustice, and satisfied my hunger for fairness. Most of all, it should have touched a tenderness, that sweetness that is the best in people that the 'X-men' themselves purport to protect. Bah. What a waste.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Maybe the DVD will be like an extended cut? like Lord of the Rings we can only hope.I was disappointed that Gambit was not in the film due to the actor who was supposed to play him declined because the character was too much like his character on lost.One thing i did like about the movie was the character shadowcat, she deserved a larger role as I believe she did a good job of the small exposure she had.Anyways i gave this movie about a 6 or 7 because if i you forget about all the technical xmen stuff and view it as an action movie it is pretty good with great special effects.

1579,isc500,Trash,1,17 March 2010,"People on this site have taken Ratner to task for the film, and of course as the director he should shoulder much of the responsibility: it is no good for him to deplore fan-boy obsession and point out that Xavier was killed off in the comics five times (actually, probably more than that). The point is, few of Marvel's writers would have wanted to (much less dared) dispose of the founder of the X-Men in the same pointless, over-CGId, pathos-lacking ham-fisted plot twist as he did. Of course, Ratner's not really to blame for that, the script writers are: ghastly people who clearly have no interest in the subject matter they are writing. It is they, together with the artistic void at the zenith of Fox's hierarchy, who should be consigned to the lowest circle of Hell (a la the Divine comedy) and forced to watch the soulless, artless trash they churned out for the rest of eternity. They might meet George Lucas there I suppose The death of Scott Summers in the first twenty minutes is probably the most inexcusable wrong. It is true that the writers and directors of the previous two films also had problems finding a role for Scott (though why is anyone's guess, they've got forty years of material to work with that demonstrates very successfully what role Cyclops has). But this character's treatment in X3 went beyond the pale: ""cursory"" is too generous an adverb. Anyone who bothered to read the Phoenix saga, and indeed the history of Scott and Jean's relationship would understand that the idea of Jean killing Scott is on par with Romeo murdering Juliet in cold blood. Jean's love for Scott was the very thing that made it impossible for the Phoenix to kill him. Of course, the crassness of the rationale behind the death is an order of magnitude less than the offensiveness of not actually showing him being killed. Bad enough that Juliet offs Romeo, but the fact Romeo isn't even given a decent demise is appalling.If Cyclops' death is simply cynical expediency for want of anything better to do with the character, I remain to this day utterly baffled at the purpose of Xavier's death. Was it merely to create dramatic pathos? If so it failed, not least because the context was so poorly handled (by which I mean nonsensical dialogue and tenuous plotting), and because by this stage in the film we were all so thoroughly ticked off we couldn't dislodge frustration in favour of sorrow. It probably didn't help that we discovered Jean's chosen method of extermination was not, as in the comics, impressive bursts of telekinetic fire, but rather confetti-isation. A mode of destruction suitable for nuptials I suppose: a theme followed through by Jean's increasingly ""Bride-of-Frankensteinesque"" appearance.Then of course there was the death of Jean at the movies' pretty but preposterous climax. Boring is probably a good word, though that doesn't do it justice. Was I the only one left wondering why someone didn't thrust Leech in her general direction? Hey presto, Jean has no powers: you can subdue her then (should you want to, I was actually keen to see her offed by this stage). Or what about those fabulous instant-curealls? Not beyond the ""team work"" of the X-Men to somehow get one of those past her is it? No, instead, we have Wolverine gut the bad-girl with his claws. Again. And so ends the short but immensely tedious existence of the Phoenix, whose purpose post-Xavier slaying was exactly what? Magneto's heavy guns? Lame. Bad enough they treated the Phoenix so heretically, but to then run out of meaningful things for her to do halfway through the film really is inexcusable.Much opprobrium has been heaped on Storm/Halle Berry for the disproportionate amount of screen time she got. I don't think Storm's the worst culprit actually: my perception was that, once again, the film revolved about the most uber-tedious of the X-Men: Wolverine. Here we have Wolverine assuming the role (and personality) of Scott Summers and thereafter dominating most of the action and dialogue. I always thought that the X-Men were something of an ensemble cast, but no: apparently the only ones people are interested in are Storm and Wolverine. One wonders how characters like Cyclops, Colossus, Rogue, Professor Xavier, Angel and so-on have endured for forty years. The dominance of these films by this character is particularly galling when one considers Wolverine was also the star of his own film. For those of us who regard Wolverine as their least favourite X-Man character this brings on particularly intense periods of teeth grinding.If Storm and Wolverine hogged too much screen time, then the so-called new introductees suffered the opposite problem. I still have no idea what the purpose of Angel was, nor really Hank McCoy, well acted as he was. As for the Juggernaut. Good God one is lost for words. Setting aside for a moment the questionable choice of actor to play him, one wonders what possessed the script writers to include the character at all. They sacrificed the awesome Mystique (again, presumably for the pathos: that didn't work either) for him? In short, this film was a rushed job, on the basis of a meaningless script developed by writers who had no clue about their subject material (or else didn't care), passed on to a less than competent director and chased out onto the cinema by a studio that had either lost interest or couldn't wait any longer for the dollars (or both). It was an unworthy use of otherwise interesting and compelling characters, a betrayal of the source matter in every way and a hugely disappointing end to what was otherwise an awesome franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1580,gvitz,What a blockbuster!,10,25 May 2006,"I had the pleasure of watching this film yesterday, and all I can say is wow...I'm a big fan of comics and more often then not disappointed when comic characters are put on the big screen. This was not the case with this franchise and X3 continues where X2 left off.I guess if you want to be anal you can search for things to change but as a whole this movie delivers, considering it had big shoes to fill after X2.Enjoy it, it's well worth the time and money and definitely needs the big screen experience. Maybe after watching it a second time and can look for flaws or critics.There are twists, turns and surprises so see it ASAP so no one spoils anything...Would be a shame to learn too much about this movie before seeing it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1581,JamesCartmire,it's the best of all the x-men movie installments (yet),8,28 May 2006,"I really must say, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is by far the most amazing superhero/comic flick movie i've ever seen. And it's not just because of the stunning effects, but because it was able to push the characters' powers to limitless possibilities (well, of Jean Grey mostly, but it's still good).Yeah, it's true that Jean killed Scott and Prof. X and Logan killed Jean, but if you're a real X-Men avid fan, you'd know that it's even possible to escape death, come back to life or, even be reborn. For the longest history of the marvel storyline, only a very few really died.But let's go back to the movie. The usual cast were just that.. usual, except for Berry, Janssen, Stewart and McKellen. Jackman's character nor his acting didn't really improve much, though he did appear tamer.Grammar played Beast fairly well, with his look, voice and all, though there were times that the lighting made him look like care-bear fuzzy. Jones' portrayal of Juggernaut was disappointing and his costume sucks big time. Page's and Cudmore's role were really just supportive, but at least they didn't suck. Another disappointment was Foster's (very minimal) role.When i heard that Angel's gonna be in x-men, I was eager to know who's gonna play the part. I'm not a big angel fan, but his character is really promising - wings, hollow bones, a pure muscle body that doesn't store fat, and healing blood that can be transferred to heal any injured person (unlike Wolverine who can only heal himself). I knew Foster from ""Six Feet Under"" and I know that he can act.. but for angel's role? His portrayal was fairly good though, but his minimal role made him less than a supporting character, more like just an extra who happened to be the son of the man who triggered the whole storyline.What i like most about this movie was that it stretched the possibilities of the characters' powers and gave a fairly good explanation to all of it. Being a telepath and telekinetic, Jean is really yet the strongest mutant in the X-Men movie storyline - her powers range from simple mind reading and spoon bending to literally distorting atomic structure of any matter (like when she 'killed' Prof. X by disintegrating his body into atomic dusts) and it was good of the movie to harness that possibility, making her the real antagonist.But what made it better was the explanation to it. In the original comic book story, Jean was capable of controlling her powers, until the psychic interventions of Mastermind caused the phoenix force, which inhabited her body to save the universe, to go berserk. The ingenious of the movie was that it offered a more viable reason to the rise of ""the phoenix."" In the movie, the phoenix was the other side of Jean, a powerful, irrational consciousness, caged by Prof. X to help her control her powers; when the wall of water hit Jean in Alkali Lake, she was cocooned by her powers and the phoenix unleashed itself.Another amazing possibility that the movie storyline brought to the audience was the cure and its source, Leech. In the original comic book storyline, Leech was a mutant living in the sewers and only had the power to temporarily disable mutant powers. Unlike Rogue who can temporarily copy a mutant power, Leech can only disable it.In the X-Men Evolution cartoon series however, Leech was portrayed as a kid who had the ability to disable mutant powers within a certain range. Apparently, this is where the movie's storyline spun off. The cure in that movie came from his DNA, which was able to disable mutant DNA and turn the mutant normal.But the ingenious there wasn't how the cure was made; it was the lingering question whether the cure was temporary or permanent. When the cure hit Mystique, she immediately 'devolved' into a homo sapien. The fast reaction could have been caused by the immediate effect of Leech's powers over other mutant powers. But as seen in the end, Magneto (who was supposed to be 'cured') was able to at least wiggle the metal chess piece again.Here's an assumption: though Leech's DNA may be able to disable a mutant gene, it could only suppress it for some time, depending on the dosage taken and evolution of the inflicted mutant's DNA. For example, if Jean was hit by a single 'cure shot,' it could only have a temporary effect on her since she was only injected a small dosage and her mutant abilities have been harnessed to its full potential already (and that's probably why the writers of the movie did not do it) Besides, since Leech is a mutant himself, his genes are 'mutated' as well and a mutant's body could dissolve its effect or even possibly get immune to it.When i first watched X-Men and X2, I was disappointed because the storyline never gave the mutants' character a chance to explore the possibilities of their powers. At least now I understand that it was, more or less, part of the writers' technique to tell the story in a compelling manner.And oh, don't forget to wait for the scene after the credits rolled. Apparently, Prof. X isn't dead. And I wouldn't be surprised if in the next installment (in any case there would be one) Prof. X becomes a different character. Again, his survival was another possibility explored by the storyline. After all, no matter how powerful Jean is, Prof. X was/is always the most powerful telepath alive.. and the mind is as limitless as space.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1582,inkblot1,Horrible!,1,28 May 2006,"It would be nice if the director, script writer, casting director, and producer would actually sit down and read an X-Men comic once in a while. This movie was pure fight, no story. The subject matter was weak, the characterization produced yawns of apathy, and the rest of the two-dimensional nonsense actually drove me out of the theater thirty minutes before the film ended. And, I grew up with the John Byrne's ""Phoenix Saga"" as being one of my favorite books. And, with such characters being completely dumbed down, with the story being so paper thin, with the art direction being totally focused towards making every single film frame to house some special effect, boasting the director's lack of restraint for abusing computer graphics, the enter episode left me feeling empty inside.God,...why did you allow man-kind to make this travesty?",X-Men - The Last Stand
1583,Bobby-in-Raleigh,Disappointment,5,28 May 2006,"Very disappointed. Although the action scenes were entertaining the overall direction and writing for this movie were awful. The movie was filled with lame puns about the characters' powers and one-liners that we have heard all to often (ex: ""God help us...""). The only real take-away I had from this movie was the realization of just how talented Bryan Singer is...in that the first, two movies were done so well that even my wife who hates all things sci-fi thoroughly enjoyed them. It should be mentioned again that the action sequences were very good and you true fans out there should go see the movie but keep your expectations low. I hope that next time Hollywood can somehow convince someone of Singer's talent to stay behind and finish the job.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1584,Mercenary_NL,so so with crappy ending (disapointed),6,26 May 2006,I'm going to make this short (since there are MANY with my same views) if your loyal to the comics in any way you would think this movie is BS (more so then x1/x2) and with the deaths of so many mutants. The ending made me want to juke a little. What where they thinking!!! Man they mess up rogue so bad... and where the hell is gambit?? Just horrible. The story line was OK but a lot of things were left out. Things that people who don't read the comic wouldn't know. And the way they tie all of it up was just not right. Just not cool to whoever made this movie.They should of got someone who acctuly read the comics to make this movie. THis movie leaves a bad after taste.,X-Men - The Last Stand

As a fan of the comic books as a child, I was very happy with the first two installments of the x-men. Alas, All good things must come to an end, and they did. I will add another director to my list of those whose movies I will always question before I invest valuable time. In fact, I found myself looking at my watch a couple of times. My movie going parter even thought it was dull - and she liked ""Fantastic Four."" Go figure. It's not that they didn't try - the cast simply didn't have a good screenplay to work with. Special effects alone do not make the movie. And from the interviews with the cast that I've read, they knew.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1586,zalpamex,this movie sucks,1,15 May 2011,"First this movie was just horrible, it looked like it took about a weekend to write the script, second, it just like the first 2 did not stick true to the comic book whatsoever, and lastly Their was too many characters, not enough screen time for them and all the screen time was given to Wolverine....as always :)Other little things that just make this movie horrible is that The previous characters we saw either were killed off or just never completely mentioned again, or they just were given 2 to 3 lines to say and killed by Wolverine AGAIN!! or they just lost their accent (STORM) or the characters playing them just never stuck to a specific age(KITTY PRIDE) or some we saw as cool but only used as second Bananas (SABRETOOTH,ColossuS,Juggernaut,and others) so out of all of them this one movie seriously ruined the franchise!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1587,boomba,Big Let Down,5,1 June 2006,"I am a huge fan of the comics from way back (mid 80's) and I enjoyed the first two X-men very much. I would put them just above Spiderman as the best super hero adaptations thus far. However X3 was a huge disappointment to me. The basic story, about the ""mutant cure"" was OK, but almost every new mutant was presented with no character development or worthwhile dialog. The effects were OK, but not great. Some things I thought were lame:1) Magneto would not have ditched Mystique and left her naked on the truck. I know we are supposed to think he is a jerk, but he doesn't HATE humans, he fears an upcoming conflict between humans and mutants, and wants to nip it in the bud. She was not a threat, she was his right-hand gal, he would have compassion for her. 2) There apparently was no need for Magento to create his army of mutants to attack the facility. None had any ""real"" powers, and he let them all get captured/beaten, then attacked with just him, the Juggernaut, the fast chick, and Pyro. That's all he needed. He could have snuck up and gotten the mutant kid any time with just those 4. 3) what the hell is with Phoenix killing Scott and the Professor? I haven't read the X-Men comic in a few years, but when the hell did that happen? I am assuming she is so all powerful as the Phoenix that they are really not dead, just maybe thrown into another universe, but geez. 4) Horrible casting and use of mutants. Calisto was in this? I had to look her up. What a waste. And Spike? Why?On the plus side it was nice to see Chris Claremont have a cameo, and Magneto seemingly getting his powers back at the end is a good sign that they realized the script left a big dead end. Hopefully they will crank out X4 quickly and with a good script to counter this debacle.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1588,Narkompros,I hate Brett Ratner,4,29 May 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand is the worst movie I have paid to see in a long time. It had bad pacing, bad production value (get a DP that didn't learn lighting from Michael Bay movies), and performances that simply left me confused. Apparently even some of the best actors in Hollywood couldn't save the last installment of an until now great movie series.I had been waiting for X-Men 3 for 3 years, and after the spectacular X2, I was expecting one of the best superhero movies to ever grace the silver screen. Unfortunately it completely failed to deliver, in multiple ways. Like The Matrix Revolutions, it took a great franchise and completely destroyed it. Also, like The Matrix Revolutions, it made suspending one's disbelief far more difficult, and brought the end of the trilogy into a series of ""are you freaking kidding me?"" moments.There was no logical pacing to X-Men 3 whatsoever. It was a sequence of event after event, with no feeling of a particular flow to what was happening. As such, no significant development was given to the characters or plot. That also made the overall experience of the film much different, and I never once felt emotionally involved with the characters or story, completely unlike the previous films. That was one of the most disappointing aspects.Certain parts of X-Men 3 were simply cheesy, such as the scene where the decision is made to keep Xavier's school for mutants open. It is so cliché and poorly done that it's not worth describing. If you have seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. It also killed off characters for the sake of killing them off, with no drama or significance attached to it. And they brought in some pointless new characters as well.What was up with Iceman and Kitty Pride? He could potentially bang his girlfriend Rogue (portrayed by the beautiful and talented Anna Paquin) after she gets the ""cure"", yet he is spending his time with a chick that's like 14. Also, Rogue was only in the movie for about 5 minutes total, which I think is a terrible waste of an Academy Award- winning actress. It also seemed odd considering that the first movie primarily centered around Rogue and Wolverine. Although she was in it very briefly, Rogue's storyline actually made the most sense for X-Men 3, as her drive and motivation was the most logical.Beast should have been brought in in the second movie, he was underutilized and could have been a valuable part of the series. Although, he did fight in a pretty cool manner. You wouldn't see Kelsey Grammar's character doing that kind of stuff on Frasier. He would be too concerned with getting his dad's dog off his couch and being late for the wine club meeting with Niles.The Juggernaut barely did anything except kicking the crap out of Wolverine, which was a decent fight scene (which ended in the very stupid-looking floating house). In a good version of this movie, the story of the Juggernaut being Charles Xavier's half brother would have been preserved. I simultaneously appreciated and was appalled by him saying ""I'm the Juggernaut, b****!"" I enjoyed that it went so far as to make a reference to an Internet joke, but in doing so it completely destroyed any idea that this was going to be a serious effort to continue the legacy of the previous X-Men movies. Or a serious effort at not being crappy.The whole Dark Phoenix thing was total crap too. It simply didn't work, at least not nearly enough to build a chunk of the story around. Magneto knew she was unpredictable and dangerous, and even after she almost attacked him, he still kept her around. And after breaking and floating the Golden Gate Bridge to Alcatraz, he didn't sense the X-Jet arriving. And why, at the end, after they got the kid that can counteract mutation by proxy, did they simply not throw him at Jean Grey? It would have been a hell of a lot easier than banking on Wolverine to sacrifice the woman he had his contrived feelings for.I loved the first two X-Men movies, and had very high hopes for the end of the trilogy, despite Bryan Singer's departure from it. This was a very disappointing end, and for a fan of the films, it would probably be better to make up your own conclusion to it than to consider this one as the finale.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1589,MMeNDtal,"Good movie, but not great.",7,1 June 2006,"After watching this the other day, I came away from the cinema slightly disappointed.This is my first comment on this site, so let me try and organise my thoughts into some sort of coherent structure.The beginning of the movie felt slightly odd to me, almost like I was watching the first movie of the series. There were lots of fresh introductions of new mutants, most of whom turned out to have very little purpose (but I'll get to that). There seemed to be too much going on and it seemed to be squeezed in too short a space of time.Another small disappointment from the beginning was the training room sequence, where we get a very short glimpse of a Sentinal. We see a pair of eyes and a head... Wow! Considering this is supposedly the final movie in the series, it's not like they're holding back on showing the Sentinals in all their glory for another instalment (or are they). Did the budget not stretch to a full CG shot? Then we had a new selection of mutants with very little purpose, in my opinion. We have Angel who jumps out of a window, then a bit later saves his dad (who we don't really care about anyway). Some new bad guys who don't really do much, one of whom seems as if she's only there to progress the story (finding Mystique). Oh, and obviously Rogue wouldn't have been missed too much... And while we had these new mutants introduced, who we really didn't need, we lost Cyclops right at the start of the movie. He had about 5 minutes of screen time, after all that's happened in the previous movies (in which he also didn't feature too strongly, if I remember correctly) and then he's gone.But those points aside...The story was interesting. The idea of a mutant cure was a good one, which has many implications to all sides. The action was impressive, though nothing spectacular. I still think the best sequence of all three movies was the beginning of X2. The final half hour, where Magneto moves the entire Golden Gate Bridge was awesome and the final battle was superb, really giving us an idea of the power some of these mutants possess.Kelsey Grammar was great as Beast, perfect for the role, I only wish were able to see more of him. Vinny Jones was also well cast as Juggernaught (thank god he didn't have too many lines though). All the regulars were as good as ever (even Halle Berry, who some people seem to have a big issue with).In short, I believe this movie could easily have been the best of the three, but it just wasn't. It felt too muddled (kind of like my review, I guess), like it was trying to show us too much and by doing so, didn't leave enough time to show what was really important. It didn't develop any particular character as it should have, or focus on anything in particular. It WAS enjoyable. I WILL definitely watch it again, but I'd take either of the first two over this one.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1590,vtac1,give it a break,9,30 May 2006,"What in the world is getting into you people? Tear up your comic books,sit back and enjoy a good movie,with a good story and good special effects.Oh I forgot you live in a perfect world where there are no mistakes,even your pencils have no erasers on them.Stop being so critical and learn to enjoy life,it really is to short to spend on nick picking.Get a life other than the world you live in.You are supposed to read a book ,go to a movie or any other passtime for enjoyment.Not to see how miserable you can make yourself.I will bet if you looked closely at your worshiped comics you would see mistakes.You know i even saw something in a comic that was supposed to be red and was blue.

1591,llutsic4,X-Men was Awful!,4,28 May 2006,"I was at the midnight screening and before watching the movie. I checked the credits. I was truly excited to see Jubilee, Rogue, Pheonix, Storm, Omega boy, and Beast. As I was watching the movie from beginning to end. I must ask this! How could you totally rewrite and change the entire history a character is supposed to develop? It is wrong, overdone, overwritten total miscontent of a character. First you try to stick with the history of the comic books and cartoon. The next, you try to stir things up a bit a decide to rewrite the entire character to your own liking. All of you who were there to see it know exactly what I am talking about. The movie has totally been redone and has been turned into a complete piece of crap. For example: SPOILER WARNING!!!! READ BELOW!!!! When Professor Xavier Dies (Never happened! This is totally rewritten.) Omega Boy (More like porcupine boy. His entire character has been reduced to him basically killing people by ejecting sharp quills out of his body. He was telekinetic for god sakes!), Pheonix/Jean (Her powers were entirely introduced the wrong way and her killing Cyclops is just ridiculous.), and Storm was still excluded from the story with minimal monologue. If I remember correctly, her lines were something along the line of, ""It's time we make our choice! If you're with us, then *be* with us!"" Now I can respect changing things around a little. But If you are to do that, Do it right. Not all over the place.So in closing, the movie was a major disappointment and was done horribly. I give it 4 out of 10",X-Men - The Last Stand
1592,AnnaNaberrie,For the Fans,10,29 May 2006,"When they made the first x-men movie, I was unhappy with how little the characters did. This is not the case in X-3. As a massive fan of the comic books, i was transformed into a child watching in amazement as all the characters did what they did in the comics. This is most evident with Storm, Wolverine, and Beast. The story is as solid as any, mostly because they have taken some of the best X-men comic story-lines and put them on-screen in a believable way. The only disappointing things were a few minor editing issues, probably will be fixed for the DVD release, (day suddenly being night, on the bridge - and Wolverine running from outside the 'Grey' house, when he was inside 2 seconds before) and that yet again Rogue is weak, and there's no Gambit. All in all though, its an EXCELLENT movie, any fans will be happy with it, and will be wanting more!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1593,ParadigmIdentity,Thoroughly disappointing,5,30 May 2006,"I knew something would be wrong with the film as soon as Brett Ratner was hired to replace Brian Singer. Singer proved himself from his debut Usual Suspects to have a knack for huge casts and successfully rotating the characters throughout the films so that each of them was developed. Ratner's shown in Rush Hour that he can handle a duo, but with X3 there were too many characters and he was woefully inept at handling them.Multiple characters are killed all-too-quickly, robbing us of the emotion that should result from it, some in a way where you're not even sure if they're dead or if they'll be walking into the shot at any moment (Cyclops). Others are shoved to the sidelines, merely used as means to an end rather than as characters in their own right (Angel, Shadowcat, Rogue, Multiple Man). The characters who DO get developed (Storm, Magneto, Jean Grey) have these new developments forced down the audience's throat rather than letting them happen naturally. They say what they're doing and why aloud then do it, attempting to make the audience believe it because they said it, not because they're actually convincing. Of the significant characters left, I'd say that the best performance is Pyro's. Wolverine suitably continues his bad-ass protagonist routine but gains nothing new. Beast is established more than anybody else due to his being the most significant new character, but the speed with which he's accepted into the inner circle without establishing a past between him and Xavier doesn't sit right. Pyro, while not given much to do, at least feels like a passionate performance, and pretty much the only one where the character's ideals truly are the driving force behind his actions.The film is too short for all Ratner and the screenwriters wanted to accomplish. They took two stories, that each could have been their own film and ineptly smashed them into one, all while trying for an under two-hour time limit for maximum number of showings per day. This sets plot developments into a breakneck speed that leaves no room character development. Whether this film will please fan-boys is debatable. There are a few nods to the comic-literate audience in the inclusion of obscure cameos (Multiple Man, Callisto, Arclight and the most obscure, Phat and Spike from ""X-Statix""). While it's gratifying to see these characters on film, none sit very well. Multiple Man, perhaps the most rich character in a lead role in any Marvel Comic being published today, is never developed and is cast aside after performing an intriguing task, robbing us of ever seeing his powers in use (disappointing considering I'd read about a fight sequence he was supposed to have). Callisto is depicted in a particularly bad manner: she doesn't look anything like she does in the comics and her powers are completely different. If not for reading her name in the credits, I'd not have known it was supposed to be her. Arclight is too minor to really care about in the comics, yet she actually gets named in the film where Callisto and Psylocke do not. As she's such a minor character, the creative liberties taken with her are less objectionable. Nonetheless, the way in which she is used, naming her and telling her what to do with her powers makes the moment feel like a Power Rangers-esquire solution to the situation ; conveniently pulling it out of a hat. Phat and Spike are mere cameos, and I'm pleased for them yet am quite puzzled by the fact that Spike (black in the comic) is white and Phat (white in the comic)is black. In any other situation I'd just accept that, like with Kingpin in the Daredevil (not a problem; Michael Clarke Duncan was the only person with the right presence for the part), but as Spike & Phat are related, switching their ethnicities seems deliberate, but why? Two major characters new to this film who are sure to please the fan-boys are Moira McTaggert and Juggernaut. McTaggert's role is disappointingly small, as the fact that they bothered to cast a known actress to play her might lead some to expect more screen time from her. Juggernaut, a fan-favorite, actually drew cheers from the audience I watched with, both when he first appeared and for his ""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"". I feel it would have paid off to have sprung for a speech coach for Vinnie Jones to minimize his accent. Again, like Duncan in Daredevil, Jones is one of the only actors out there with the bulk necessary for this character. I feel that Juggernaut in the film will please those not familiar with the comics and somewhat familiar, but it will bother more committed fans that the film makes two glaring omissions concerning him: that he's not a mutant and that he's Professor X's half brother; making the scene where the Professor wheels past him without them acknowledging one another one more disappointment.This film is, overall, a thorough disappointment. It tried to appeal to my fan-boy nature by including minor characters I love, but proceeded to alter, waste or outright ruin them. I feel that the acting was lazy, though I respect the possibility that this is the fault of the screenwriters not providing material for the cast to expand upon rather than the fault of the actors. It was overly ambitious with its eyes on two grandiose stories and on the box office rewards of a shorter film at the same time. You can't have it all, and this film does not. In trying to have ""everything and the kitchen sink"", the film ends up instead having a bunch of cardboard cutouts and perhaps a rusty old lawn sprinkler.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1594,red_felidae,so-so popcorn flick,8,28 May 2006,"The Last Stand is not a bad movie but compared to Bryan Singer's exceptional work on the two previous installments Brett Ratner's movie leaves a lot to be desired... Even though some die-hard fans may have a different opinion on the number of mutants (new and old) in the movie - there can be definitely too many mutants. This is the case with Rattner's movie as there are too many newly introduced characters, who, as a consequence of the crammed and rushed script, are not given enough screen-time to really establish themselves, their motivations, goals etc... (Angel, anyone?)Another, maybe minor thing, that really bugged me: the dark phoenix look. OK, we all liked the look of The Grudge and The Ring; mysterious young females, with their hair hanging in their faces while they sit staring into nothingness, on a much too small chair but come on...it was kind of uninspired to pull the exact same gag on Jean Grey...and her eyes turning all black as soon as Phoenix came through - puh-lease!all in all, it's not a bad movie. it delivers what it promised, it's action-packed front to back and will certainly entertain you for its 104 minutes running time.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1595,thewalrusisme,Nay-sayers shut up.,10,26 May 2006,"I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time. AND I'm a long time fan of the comic books.When you're turning 60 years of comic books into three two-hour movies, you can't stick steadfast to the events and relationships in the comics. You have to make the movies make sense within themselves. And they did.If you're only complaints about the movie are how they differ from they comic books, then I think you have nothing to complain about.If you look closer, they have a lot of connections to the comics under the surface. That crazy girl that has super-speed and can detect mutants who's in Magneto's brotherhood? When I first saw her, I was like that's a really random combination of powers. Then I realized that she's a combination of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, the siblings that were in Magneto's original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in the comics.Yes, Juggernaut wasn't actually a mutant, he got his power from the stone, and yes, he was Prof. X's half-brother in the comics. SO WHAT?!?! If you let that ruin it so that you didn't crack up when he said ""I'm the Juggernaut, Bitch!"" then you shot yourself in the foot when you came into the movie.If you're still going into ANY movie adaptation of a piece of literature, whether it be novel, graphic novel, or comic book, and expecting it to stick to what you read, you are dumb.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1596,Atlacatl84,Too Man y Reason the movie is Disappointing and Not Satisfying,5,28 May 2006,"I would have to say that i liked or pretty much appreciated the x-men series. But despite being a fan of the movie because of the characters that came alive through Singer work. This film i would say was the most disappointing of all. One for starters the movie was introducing many characters from left, right, and centre in which was too much for a hour and forty-five minute movie. The director tried to cram in far to many useless characters in such a short span of a film (which you can't really blame the director). There was a female character who looked like prince and had the capability of shocking wave, another character was KId Omega who looked like a hedgehog. These character who were more useless then Halle Barry performance in the film. Second, x-men characters like nightcrawler was not in the film without any explanation to his whereabouts, cyclops is killed by wife Jean Grey(Phoenix), Rogue decides not to be a mutant and in the end becomes a human, Professor Xavier is killed by Jean Grey and mysteriously is alive at the end of the credit for the secret ending and finally Jean grey who is Phoneix is killed off by wolverine. Third, The story was too far stretch for this so called epic ending that had huge fight. The fight scene wasn't that great at the end it seemed like a joke. The characters that i can say stand out was wolverine, Beast, and Iceman. None of the action sequences with wolverine seemed realistic or comic book fantasy like. The movie in my opinion is OK, i didn't enjoyed the many characters that could of been used in further installements if they were to make any more. The action sequences didn't leave a lasting impression on the film it looked too simple and childish like. I would have to admit studios should target this film more for teenagers and adults who grew up reading or watching the x-men series not to children where the violence or the story seemed more like a joke and kiddish like. As much there are many other parts of the film that were good and bad i would give this film a 5/10.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1597,squish64,A lackluster end to a series,5,28 May 2006,"X-Men 3: The Last Stand was pretty hyped up. It was built up in the second installment, and got a lot of positive press going into its release. I'm sorry to say, that it doesn't live up to the hype. It doesn't even live up to the first two films.The story follows a pretty simple plot, something that actually happens in the comics: a cure for mutants. You've probably all seen the trailers so you know what it is about.I have two main problems with this film. One of them is a pet peeve. After hyping up Gambit, a fan favorite, in X2 (Remy LaBeau appears on the mutant database in Striker's office), he is nowhere in the third film. Apparently, the actor offered the role turned it down, and the writers couldn't quite figure out how to work him into the script. But that's just my personal problem.The biggest problem with this film is not the direction which many people were worried about; Ratner does a fine job with what he's given. The problem lies in the script. It is VERY lackluster, with major plot points that basically ruin the film. That said, major characters die. Sure the script is littered with messages about the world and acceptance but I think that is overshadowed by the bad parts: Killing off major characters is the biggest one. I think the actors weren't really that committed this time. Also, there's such a small amount of X-Men that actually fight in the film. There's so many X-Men that had been introduced in the first two, why are they all gone here? Magneto has an army and the X-Men fight with six people.Kelsey Grammar was a bright spot. Skeptics abounded, but Grammar's Beast is a very nice touch. He does play it very well and was perhaps the highlight of the additions to the third film.All in all, this movie could have been a lot better. The reason the script stunk so much is probably because Brian Singer took his writers with him when he left. Major characters are absent through much of the film, and while I like the new X-Men introduced, they just weren't big enough or written well enough. This movie is fine if it's set in an alternate dimension, but fitting with the other two, fitting with X-Men as a whole, it doesn't work. Pay the money to see it once. Actually, get a friend to pay money for you to see it. It's worth a free trip. I'm not sure it's worth 7.50 or 10.00 dollars. This film will do fine at the box office though, but it's definitely a step down for Marvel. Only a certain web-slinger's third installment can really pick things back up.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1598,carlitosenjapon,"Regarding characters who suffer changes throughout the trilogy MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!! Don't READ IF YOU Haven't SEEN THE TRILOGY, PLEASE!!",10,25 May 2006,"Following the trilogy and considering that Brett Rattner did a pretty good job in finally letting the character lose their anal features and become much more fierce (when compared to the first two movies)... Does anybody out there agree with me that this should be considered as a trilogy and left in peace to rest as such? I mean, considering that, Rogue and Mystique are no longer mutants, Jean and Cyclops died, Xavier reincarnated in a dying man (which was a very weak final scene, yet it is forgiven since the movie was indeed very good), Magneto retired and will live out of the government (why did no one put him behind bars, beats me) and who knows how many others were banished by Phoenix... Cash cow and all, do you agree with me that the smartest move should be to close the story here? If something, the story lines could be headed into spin-offs and whatnot's, but as it is, this movie should be put to rest and let it take its place along great trilogies such as The Godfather, Classic Star Wars and Alien (come on, nobody even remembers that one with Winona Ryder...)",X-Men - The Last Stand
1599,Roverite1970,"All in all, very entertaining",9,25 May 2006,"I went into the cinema tonight expecting a different type of X-Men movie from the 2 previous. The reason being obvious. New director and screenwriters. Brett Ratner, whilst meaning him no disrespect is no Brian Singer, who is a master craftsman when it comes to his movies (just watch the Usual Suspects). What Ratner does do, is let his strong sense of action direction guide him. Big, brash and very loud action sequences are his forte, and X3 has them all in spades. He also has the job of killing off 3 major characters, something that I never once expected, and something that I do think that he carried off well. There are some strong leads, but as previously pointed out, an awful lot weaker characters. Vinnie Jones is totally miscast as Juggernaut, and his make-up looks fake. I was disappointed with the lack of development of Rogues' character, which was pushed aside without examining the real reasons for the choice she made. The same can be said for the apparent abandonment of Mystique by Magneto after her change of circumstance. Why did he just abandon her? A lot has been made of the screen time of Wolverine and Storm, but they to me are integral to the X-Men movies. Wolverine, don't forget, was the basis of the story for the first two movies, and as for Storm, we finally get to see some strength from her. (plus she now flies!!). All in all though, I really enjoyed this movie, as did my 6 year old daughter. Brett Ratner has performed an admirable job in the face of adversity. I remember when his name was mentioned, people groaned but I think he has done a good job, but why oh why did they have that ending??? Eric Lensherr looked completely believable as a forlorn, lonely old man, until the chess board appeared!! ENJOY.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1600,ravnos_kumpania,Not too Shabby,7,25 May 2006,"I'll do my best to keep this as spoiler free as i can I'm not going to lie. When Brett Ratner was confirmed as Director for the last in the trilogy i was a little let down. Don't get me wrong, Red Dragon was a good film, but i felt letting the Rush Hour director run wild with everyones favourite group of mutants could be a bit of an error. However, while not superb, the direction is smooth and the action scenes should prove enough to keep even the most hard core of action fans happy.I was also a bit wary of some of the new casting: Vinnie Jones? eek. And Kelsey Grammar as beast? After 10/11 years of playing Fraiser I couldn't really see that being a stretch of his acting skill. But that said, both men fill their roles well, especially Vinnie Jones who provides a hint of comic relief in an otherwise fairly tense film. Most of the old characters return and its business as usual with Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart continuing to add thesp clout to the franchise in style! Famke Janssen portrays the tortured Jean Grey/Phoenix admirably and kudos to the make-up department on that front too. Slightly more annoying is the exclusion of Alan Cummings' Nightcrawler because they claimed he'd be a ""peripheral character"" only to bring in Angel who is on screen for about 4 minutes total.The plot, although deviating more from the comics that the previous two, is enjoyable and, keeping with Bryan Singers legacy, belts along at a great pace, never letting itself get bogged down or attempting to make a bigger film than the script allows (King Kong's 2 hour film trapped in a 3 hour body springs to mind).All in all this is great multiplex fodder: a good start to the Summer blockbuster season. Good film for groups of mates or for a date, however, and perhaps i was a victim of all the hype here, but i imagined the ""last"" (we shall see..) X-men film leaving me with more...more emotion! More excitement! More sadness that there wont be another! Don't expect to walk out of this one feeling like u did after Return of the King.Oh, and make sure u stay til the end of the credits for the obligatory comic book adapt ""hidden scene""",X-Men - The Last Stand

1602,Brooke621,From Hong Konger's point of view,7,29 May 2006,"When Mystique was turned back to her human form and Magneto simply ""dumped"" her, I felt her pain. I doubt any guys would feel the same way other than starring to Rebecca Romijn's figure, I know my bf was drooling(LOL)I just love the scene when Logan kicked that ""unlimited-arms man"". Ppl were laughing way too loud around me and i couldn't hear what he said when the man's on his knees....I mean.....I knew what he said from the subtitles, but I dun know the EXACT line~By the way, here in Hong Kong, there was a subtitle saying that there will be some more after the credits are shown, which is kinda odd to me.I mean... for all these years I've been watching movies, unlike most ppl who just left the cinema without the credits played, it's my usual practice to stay till the last min. Now for this time, together with that weird subtitle, there was actually a girl shouting from the back, saying that there will be something more after the end. Well... to me, I think only those who respected the production deserve the last bit~~ It was totally awkward for someone who actually put a reminder before ppl left the cinema~~~",X-Men - The Last Stand
1603,Tulls19,Why?,1,28 February 2012,"I normally do not pay attention to who directs or produces a movie. I have never written a review for a movie. Several years ago I saw this movie and was disgusted. Today I tried to figure out how a franchise that was looking so promising all of a sudden nose dived into a pile of Sh#t and surprise surprise it had a different director. Some of the old stories coming out around the time of the movies release have the director a ratner guy bragging about how he took creative license with this movie. Yeah what he did was rob me of my money. The people who rated this movie as anything other than a 1 star are probably not followers of the X-Men Comic books. This movie not only sucked because it was a bad movie but because the potential was there for so much more. With an established fan base of millions of people who like either the comic books or the other Singer movies Ratner had a blue print for success. But instead of using that blue print to give us something worth seeing he took ""creative license."" He did his own thing knowing that people would go see it due to past experiences of enjoyment when it comes to the X universe. That could almost be forgiven had he not left the franchise in a totally and completely ridiculous situation of having very key characters killed off for no reason what so ever. He not only squeezed the franchise for money but also clear cut the forest and sowed salt into the soil so that people trying to redeem the series are in an almost impossible position. For that reason the only thing I ever want to see from this utterly useless loser ratner is an obituary. I will do my research in the future to avoid ever giving anything he is associated with one god#mn cent.So I am now writing my first ever review in order to warn anyone even contemplating seeing this movie to please use your money for something else. You could set the money on fire and it would serve a better purpose by not leading anyone in Hollywood to EVER consider giving this subhuman another part to play in the creation of another movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1604,halusha-helenski,Pales to the original,6,27 March 2012,"""X-Men: The Last Stand"" pretends to be a sequel to X2, but ultimately, this film builds on the bones of what came before, rather than on the solid, already established foundation. Characters are dismissed with perfunctory waves of the hand, or ""revealed"" to have always been the exact opposite of everything we were told before, specifically in the case of Jean Grey. The treatment of Jean invokes the worst excesses of comic books (namely, retroactive continuity or the ""retcon,"") while losing whatever emotional pathos was involved in the source material.Most egregious, however, is the finale. The X-Men rush into defend something without really explaining why it's important, and their goals and the stakes they are playing for constantly shift. While you never quite get to the point where the story doesn't make sense, it's safe to say that the motivations never make sense, if only because there are no motivations. There are certainly some good action scenes, but overall it's hard to enjoy this even as mindless action because moronic director Brett Ratner gets so bogged down in the process of pissing on all the plot lines and characters that he inherited from Bryan Singer's vastly superior work.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1605,TheAbsoluteJay,A very good addition to the franchise,8,28 June 2006,"This Memorial Day I got a chance to get out to the theaters and see X-Men: The Last Stand. The third installment of Fox's X-Men franchise, The Last Stand takes place some time after the second. A ""cure"" for people containing the mutant gene is found, leading to a political uproar that draws battle lines between The Brotherhood, a group of misfit mutants led by Magneto(Ian Mckellen), and the X-Men, still led by Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart).The cast of characters have essentially stayed the same. Most all the characters from the previous film appear in The Last Stand save for Nightcrawler(played by Alan Cumming) who has been written out of this one. Fans of the Nightcrawler character should check out the new X-Men official movie game to find out the details of his departure. New faces include Frasier star Kelsey Grammar as Dr. Hank McCoy(aka Beast), the U.S. secretary of mutant relations. Snatch's Vinnie Jones is playing the role of Juggernaut, and two young up and coming stars Ellen Page, who is the third actress to play the role of Kitty Pryde(Sumela Kay and Katie Stuart were the other two), and Cameron Bright(Ultraviolet, Thank You for Smoking), playing Leech, the young boy whose mutant power is the cure for others mutant gene.Being the third installment in the franchise leaves a lot to live up to, and without actor/writer David Hayter(who wrote the screenplay for the first two) writing the script, it leaves a little to be desired. While the characters are very believable and real, the story itself, with the exception of a few well placed plot twists, is a little dodgy.On the topic of directing, Brett Ratner, director of Red Dragon and both Rush Hour films, left production of the problematic Superman Returns(and was replaced by The Last Stand's original director, Bryan Singer) and was hired to finish this film nine weeks before filming was scheduled to begin. He took what he had, which was a decent script, half built sets, and a bunch of grumpy Fox executives and made a good film.Pros: Great digital effects. Many companies had a go at the effects on this film, predominately Weta Digital, LTD.(the same company that did the CGI on the Lord of the Rings films and King Kong), and Cinesite Europe(they did the special effects of V for Vendetta and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). Others were Framestore CFC who did the visuals on Doom and the Harry Potter franchise, CIS who was behind the effects of Poseidon and Aeon Flux, SOHO VFX who did visuals on The Chronicles of Narnia and Fantastic Four, and Hydralux, who also did some of the visual effects for Fantastic Four.Great characters. One of the more subtle parts of the movie, The Last Stand illustrates the major differences between The Brotherhood and the X-Men. In the final battle, the X-Men stand outnumbered, but use teamwork instead of sheer numbers, showing that they are a tight knit group, and that they can beat The Brotherhood. Also, none of the X-Men use their ""mutant"" names, with the exception of Storm, but it is kind of hard to say Ororo, in fact, only Kelsey Grammar says it once. Hugh Jackman. He is Wolverine. All three of the films manage to capture the character incredibly well and he plays the part perfectly. Plot twists. Many things happen in this movie that you don't expect, so pay attention.Good directing. Brett Ratner does a great job with this movie. He took what he had and made probably the best movie he could make. Only things I didn't like were his choices about certain special effects.Cons: Bad characters. While the main characters were wonderfully portrayed, some of the smaller, but pivotal characters, were not built at all and we were simply teased with their great powers. Weak script. While the story itself is really good, but has too much going on and not enough dialog. Between finding the cure, the Brotherhood forming, the love triangle between Bobby Drake(Iceman), Rouge, and Kitty Pryde, and the Dark Phoenix, we should get two or more hours of awesome movie. Instead we got a rushed and seemingly jumbled one hundred and four minute goulash. Most of the character development occurs through action or reaction, making the characters seem victim to the story, like they aren't a part of it. Hugh Jackman. He steals the show, and while I love him as Wolverine, I want more diversity.Sub par in camera special effects. This happens a few times in the movie. In the opening of the film, Peter Rasputin aka Colossus, hurls Wolverine through the air towards an enemy, a maneuver dubbed the ""fastball special"". Wolverine sailing through the hair looked very hokey and in comparison the the rest of the visual effects, it looked downright bad. Poor outdoor set design. While all of the indoor sets are wonderfully put together, the outdoor sets that weren't on location filming, are a bit hokey, and seem small.I thought this movie was a good addition to the previous two of the franchise. It's a comic book movie at its core, and it shows. Go for Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen stealing the show, and stay for the plot twists. Also stay after the credits for one more mysterious twist.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1606,Lynchian3,A Strategic Review **SPOILERS**,10,26 May 2006,"I saw the midnight showing of this film and I thought it was without a doubt, incredible. Sure, some of the dialog was WAY too scripted--but it wouldn't be a comic book movie other wise. However, the special effects? The PLOT? It was utterly BRILLIANT. Magneto not only lives up to his stoic evil supremeness from the first two films, but he becomes the utmost chilling villain as he realizes what potential of power he could wield by having a power house like Jean Grey on his side. Xavier as per usual will stick up for humanity and his codes on morals and ethics, just as he expects his precious X-Men to do in turn. The true villain here is Jean Grey or most known as the Dark Phoenix--a smart little plot change for movie rights to work by making Jean Grey have a split personality disorder. (It's from this stand point we also get a taste of Professor Xavier's alterer motives as he is involved in her training because he knows she could used to do great things...) So brilliantly put and so brilliantly played--Jean Grey becomes the true evil entity in this masterpiece. Though Magneto is ever powerful and makes that statement by relocating the Golden Gate Bridge, he is no match for Dark Phoenix. Neither is Xavier. As a viewer, it was vastly incredible to see the Professor himself become dissembled molecule by molecule all due to Jean Grey. That scene was mind boggling--if not a bit disturbing. Once she takes out the very person who made her what she is today? Clearly you have no idea what side of the fence she's on. It seemed fitting that Wolverine would be the only one to put an end to all the madness... Magneto out of commission due to a fatal dart stab filled with Leech's nulling DNA... Most of the X-Men out of commission... Cyclops dead, Rogue trying to be cured. However because Wolverine could regenerate and apparently held some sort of brief contact with that woman once known as Jean... It was poetic justice that he be the one the sink the blades in. (This is a special treat to any who has read Origin of Wolverine...) The scene in which Warren as a child is literally cutting and slicing his feathers off in order to remain normal was astounding and powerful. Indeed, something of a ""cure"" is found--the DNA of yet another mutant. DNA so potent it nulls out ANY power. There are many enemies here; Though I am inclined to think this... Who truly is the ""evolved"" of the species? The mutants? For being able to perform the feats they can? Or the humans? For learning how to harness the one thing and market it to stop the mutants in their tracks? Once again, a very well done flick. Best of the three--and clearly the darkest of the three.

1607,deathcabfordrew,"Solid action, solid characters, stop ya cryin!",8,1 June 2006,"Come on, this is an above average comic book and also action movie. It brings back a little humour, which has been missing from some adaptions lately, while still keeping the action fast paced and slick. Character development is better than X2, not as good as X1 but they have a crack at it and it turns out better than expected. X2 featured characterisations and performances that felt wooden and more like action figure clichés than actual mutants dealing with extraordinary events. In Xmen:TLS, at least we get a sense of how these people feel when amongst their own kind but also the normal humans. All I'm reading on hear and hearing are some fan boys who cant let go of the comic and would have cried out no matter who directed this. Ratner does a good enough job, he may not be well liked for whatever reason but he nails this and in my opinion it can sit next to red dragon as something to be proud of. This is above all a popcorn movie, something in the realm of fantasy that transports us to another place for two hours and tells us an incredible story. Its pure entertainment that succeeds in combining a slew of characters that are all given importance to the story, something hard considering the amount of talent on show here. Plus, the crew have done their homework, did anyone else hear the name of the doctor friend who sent Xavier the case file tape for his students? Any true x-fan would have noticed this and realised it a wink to past x-history and also future x-events. All in all, it was good, it was entertainment and it was fun.

1608,orangeboy77,Why can't you people enjoy a good movie?,8,28 May 2006,"You must be joking about this movie. X2 was a weak movie with no real villains (come on, the big threat was Professor X himself). They were supposed to do the Sentinels but the studio wasn't willing to spend the money. The only reason anyone liked X2 was because of Nightcrawler, who rocked. The first X-Men was just a set-up movie, not bad but not so great cause they had to take time doing back-stories and all.We finally get a really good X-Men movie here. No, it's not ""Lord of the Rings"" good but it's pretty darn good. The lack of development people are talking about is because they already did two movies and they assume you've seen them. Why repeat the same info? It's the same thing they do with Harry Potter. Definitely worth a look in theaters for anyone who liked the first two movies. Hardcore X-Fans and fanboys might wanna stay away cause the movie could ruin there social life and grasp on reality. At this point I am sure they have all already seen this one though.My advice go check it out and if you are worried you may not like it, go see a matinée. It's worth the $5-$8 dollars for an early showing for sure.Also, no one is saying that this will for sure be the end of the X-Men movies. I highly doubt that cause the movies are way too profitable. This was never intended as a trilogy. They made another Batman even though Batman and Robin was one of the worst movies ever!

You might as well as say they went around making everyone the same race. They used it to take away their cause to fight, its disgusts me.UGH! this movie was horrible. It sucked. I'm so disappointed. I'm disgusted by the writers of this movie. And if this is the last movie they are doing of X-Men, they should have never bothered making the comic book into a movie in the first place.

It just was'nut as good as I anticipated. I feel out of the three this was the weakest. Although Beast delivered and The Juggernaught was passable X-4 better make up for this one.

The scenes with the plane plummeting toward the earth are fantastic as was the scene with he bullet bouncing off of Supe's eye. Just awesome!And that was just the trailer! X-men 3? In one word - Disappointing. Here are my reasons for saying so. First, I agree with others that there were too many mutants and not enough character development. Seconedly, I noticed a few continuity problems, but won't go into detail. Thirdly, Halle Berry's character had too much of a part. I realize that she wanted more, but has it occurred to her that people don't want to see that much of her? Give the character enough of a part but then step kindly away because your big ego gets in the way. Fourthly, they just killed Cyclops and Xavier off too early. I didn't grow up reading X-Men so I don't know if this happened to them in the comics, but I felt at least that it was too soon in the film. I kept saying to myself,""Surely not, Scott and Prof. X are in some sort of stasis or dimension. At the end, I hear that Prof. X does come back. Hmmm. Lastly, the story was too rushed. The crammed two story lines into an hour and 40 minute time slot.In all, the movie just left my wife and I with a sagging depression. For me, partly because so many characters I loved about the first two films were killed off in this one. Even if they did make a fourth movie, I wouldn't want to see it if they weren't there. Maybe that's just me. It's also partly because a potential good movie was ruined by a rushed storyline and...lousy director? Fox definitely should have waited for Singer to return. This is where impatience gets you - a sagging depressing movie. Thanks Rattner, thanks a lot!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1613,omarsalgado,The Last Stand stands it's ground!,9,16 May 2006,"According to the MC at Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City, the night of May 15th was the world premiere of the new Marvel Mutants movie, X-Men: The Last Stand.The last installment of X-Men was walking on thin ice since the creative team move to another super-movie leaving it on the hands of new comers to the franchise like Brett Ratner and with a script from people who didn't give us the last two, more than satisfactory, adaptations.I'm glad to say that despite the somehow new style in the movie, this new adventure fills all the expectations. A nice debate about if this is the best of the trilogy will come.The story comes this simply way: A war is coming to the world since a ""cure"" for the mutant disease arrives. Xavier and his students aren't very glad to hear it and Magneto knows is the chance he has been waiting to unite the Homo Superior against the Homo Sapiens. Add to the mix the wildest card ever: Phoenix.In a very nice and clever way, Phoenix is explained to the not comic readers as the next step on Jean Grey's evolution. Also, the movie goes where the comics rarely go. The first act of the movie comes with the death of a major character which some found as a relief.And many more come to die too. This is the last movie and they make it perfectly clear.And if you thought Storm was a waste of Halle Berry salary, think it twice. She finally gets her moment.Wolverine, Colossus, Iceman and Kitty Pryde go to war with the furry company of Beast (fear not, he looks kind of silly, but you manage to forget about it as the movie advances). There are some new comers like Angel, Psylocke, Multiple Man and Juggernaut presented in a similar way to the other movies. Not main players, but you know who they are and what they do.Of course, you can't wrap out a mutant series without a blast, what better than a big battle on Alcatraz with Golden Gate bridge as your main way of transportation.A satisfactory end this one is indeed. By the by, don't glimpse on the last frame of the movie or you will miss the fan service to everyone who thinks there should be more X-Movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1614,pinay_flava,Love It!,9,30 May 2006,**contain spoilers** i absolutely loved this movie. at first i heard that it wasn't good but i was pleasantly surprised! it was totally worth my money and seeing it at a big theater! it gets right to the action and there are a few heartfelt moments. the special effects were superb but i felt that rogue's role wasn't as big as the 2nd movie. my favourite part of the movie is when they show all different kinds of mutants with different powers. the only thing i didn't like was how they killed off mutants so early in the movie such as Scott and Xavier. and i didn't like how they made mystique normal but other than that i highly recommend that you go see it!!,X-Men - The Last Stand
1615,robeazy15,X-men: The Last Stand...The Good...The Bad.,9,1 June 2006,"X3 is a great comic book movie it moves fast, has great action scenes and a story that keeps you interested even though it's a thin story, just like a 32 page comic book ( we comic book fans sometimes forget that characters develop over a series of issues and that movies need to do this in a span of approx. 2hr). I do not fault the actors or Brett Ratner because they kept the same feel and atmosphere as the 1st two movies. The only thing that was disappointing and this was because of the fast comic book pace, there wasn't much development for the newer X-men (Angel, Colossus, Kitty Pryde, Juggernaut, and yes even Beast). Only being approx. 1hr 45min. this is a movie, if it was longer it would of definitely benefited from it. Even with it flaws you will enjoy this quick comic book of a film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1616,speed24601,The Best of All 3 X-Men Films,9,27 May 2006,"The guy who reviewed this before me obviously didn't see the same film I did. X-Men: The Last Stand was the most emotionally powerful of the three films. It also had action occurring on a much grander scale than the 2 previous films. Without giving anything away, you really get to see how Wolvie and Storm have become the heart and soul of the team. It was the same way in the comics for about 10 years in the mid 80's to mid 90's. After reading the X-Men comics for 3/4 of my life I must say this movie was finally what I'd been waiting for. There were tons of mutant cameo roles, some back-story on Jean, Charles, and Magneto,*SPOILERS AHEAD* and even a Danger Room Sequence with Colossus giving Wolvie the first live action ""Fastball Special!"" Not to mention Iceman finally gains his totally ""Iced-out"" form near the end of the film. In my opinion, this film should have STARTED the X-Men film franchise, not ended it. Even though It doesn't appear to be over yet. STAY AFTER THE CREDITS!! You'll thank me later. Sure I've been reading X-Men Comics since I was 7, but even if I hadn't been I would still say this is the best movie out of the entire franchise. It's a great motion picture. (Especially with Rebecca Romijn butt naked!)",X-Men - The Last Stand
1617,djcarro,Bryan Singer's movie would have been far different... and better.,7,27 May 2006,"X3 was rushed and lacked strong character development. I didn't hate the movie, butI found it to be a letdown after what X2 was building. Cyclops dead after ten minutes? What in the hell were they thinking? Halle Berry is really what made this film nose dive (from what I've heard). They really should have waited for Singer to finish Superman. Let's be honest here, when you are hired to pen a third installment to a series that someone else wrote, it doesn't take an expert writer to just kill a whole bunch of characters and change the course of the story.C+",X-Men - The Last Stand
1618,chineseboy,What a film!,10,25 May 2006,"I have just returned from a screening an hour ago. What a magnificent addition to the x-men series of movies. The action was fast moving and the visuals truly graphic. The cast was superbly brilliant. I think there is more than enough scope for x-men 4 and 5. Famke is starting to show her age on the close up shots. Nevertheless, she retains a flawless physique. I would like to see more of her in future films. The new players were fantastic and will make for good spin off series. I loved the special effects and plot lines. This is certainly a movie to be enjoyed on the big screen or a deluxe home theatre. I recommend this film to all.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1619,benraffe,Hmmmmm. Not bad....,7,26 May 2006,"Well, I've just seen the new X-Men flick, and as an X-phile I can say that it was.... 'Ok'. I was worried when I saw that Bryan Singer buggered off to do Superman instead and saw the highlights of Brett Ratner's career being Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2.... But it was actually pretty OK.BUT... What a strange choice of villains! Why bother using Juggernaut in such a minor way? Also - am I wrong, or is he, in fact, not a mutant? WHY use Arclight? Surely one of the worst of the Marauders! Why bother with Pyro? Why have Madrox as a bad guy? Surely he's a good guy all the way for X-fans! Why decide to jib off Mystique? And why bother bringing Jean back? Apocalypse.... Shoulda been Apocalypse.....Still, at least they killed Cyclops, which was a GREAT move! He was such an unbelievable goon....Not bad though! And not just for fanboys!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1620,coolpanagos,"not perfect, but who cares?",8,25 May 2006,"not bad at all! Being an X-men fan (well, 10 years ago, now I' m rather old for comic books)and having seen both previews films more than once (so, more than the usual critic),I think that this sequel completes really well the series. Well, you don't leave the theater with the impression of a masterpiece, but come on! It' s X-men, not Tarkovsky! The script is the best of the three, although sometimes we feel the director does not fully take advantage of that. Maybe sometimes one scene should be longer or some things omitted etc. But this doesn't spoil the film. As for the plot I think it is more raw and primitive than the others, more about human characteristics and passions than politics and racism.Seeing it that way you 'll find that this film doesn't lack the depth we saw in the others, only chooses a different perspective. And for us not-specialists the direction won' t present any considerable flaw. If you liked the other two films, you should definitely see that too.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1621,teja1015,I want more,10,28 May 2006,"I recently saw X-men, and I was very happy with the movie but a little disappointed. Being an X-men lover, it got my excitement up just seeing a new character being added to the cast. There is a lot of that in this movie, but with a running time at 1 hour 44 minutes, another 40 minutes of run time would have given a lot more to the climax and time to introduce/tell the story of the *new* mutants. But don't get me wrong, this movie is still fantastic. Its got sadness, romance, and a hell of some action scenes, plus its X-men so it'd be cool even if the movie was horrible. But again, I would have liked to see Juggernaut and Collusus duke it out.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1622,skywalkr97,"Good scenes, bad movie",5,5 June 2006,"This movie was an amalgamation of comic book stories, but they were both distorted and just fit together badly. It is fine to make changes from the source material, as this is usually necessary to some extent. That is not my main problem. I felt that it was not a cohesive movie and story. It may just be that it was so much poorer than the books that my disappointed soured my experience.My advice would be watch the movie for the eye candy it is. See the cool scenes on the big screen. Then, if you really like the X-Men, open the Dark Pheonix Saga and From the Ashes comic sagas, and you will appreciate much better stories that actually have good characterization.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1623,andremion,"In Kevin Smith's words: Yes, I enjoyed it, with all it's flaws and s****.",5,28 May 2006,"Starting at the beginning, I was really afraid that this movie would not be so great, I read the summary on the internet and the story seemed weak, and after seeing it I have even more things to say. Firstly, I'm a big fan of the X-Men, I grew up watching the cartoon, I dig the message, it was part of my moral as well as ethical formation, but as an adult, I realize that mutants are not the same as Jews, blacks and homosexuals. Real world minorities are not a threat to anyone and their continued persecution baffles me, anyone who would waste their time with prejudice and not enjoy life is, I'm sorry to say, an idiot. However, mutants are endowed with special, and often very destructive abilities, and for every one good-hearted mutant who wants to live in peace, there are ten maniacs who want to rule the world, make no mistake: these are dangerous people! Yes, maybe they wouldn't have to fight if it weren't for the racism, right? Wrong, trust me, JUGGERNAUT WOULD STILL BE LIKE THAT (I KNOW he's originally not a mutant, we're talking about the MOVIE). Moving on to the story, the humans have a ""cure"" for mutation, and so begins another debate between the three factions in the movie: X-Men (read ""good"" mutants, GM), Brotherhood (read ""bad"" mutants, BM) and humans (read ""us stupid assholes"", HM). To begin with, all three groups are wrong: HMs want to cure all mutants, which is racist. GMs say there is nothing to cure, but if your power was to kill whoever you touch and you had to live your life without physical contact, wouldn't you want a cure? And BMs say they are the cure, which makes no sense and only proves my point that they have lost it. This is where the movie gets lost in it's own argument, in the first movie you have a bunch of dick-heads with signs forming picket lines shouting ""NO MORE MUTANTS!"", and in this movie you have a bunch of dick-heads with signs forming picket lines shouting ""WE DON'T NEED A CURE!"". The discussion in this movie should have been ""the use and misuse of power"" as Xavier so eloquently put it, before he lost his way completely, as did Magneto. On to filmic and directing complaints. THERE ARE NO SENTINELS, what we do have is a lame teaser in the danger room, there is a shot where we see the silhouette with glowing eyes, it should have been the first but it's the last, yes we ""see"" the ""fastball special""...ish, I personally wanted to see wolvie digging his claws into the robot's neck, but after he's thrown he just disappears, we next see him standing next to a giant head on the floor...pathetic. Also, the HMs who were once painted as racist bastards are now mere innocent bystanders, can you think of a more pathetic role in a film? Also, I can't believe how low Xavier has sunk, trying to control Jean rather than advising her to use her power for good, same goes for Magneto, who abandons Mystique after she saves his ungrateful butt just because she got ""cured"", up until X2 he was an evil maniac, but at least I respected him. The problem with both mutant groups is that they can't accept that there are going to be those amongst them that are going to want the cure, how can they be so thick headed? Also, I'm offended by Rogue's comment on Iceman, or any other instance in film or TV where a woman says that men only think of sex (fighting this misconception is part of the reason I became an artist, I'm a college film student), it's also a stupid cliché, stop using it! The soundtrack is weak, there is only one good moment but it doesn't compare to X2. And it's not like we really see Iceman, he's in full ice for two shots, maybe two and a half, and forget the character we came to love, Kurt Wagner AKA Nightcrawler, he is nowhere to be seen. It feels like the Mission: Impossible trilogy, where the 1st one had only content, the 2nd one had only action and the 3rd one had balance, making it the best one. Only in X-Men the 2nd had balance and the 3rd has only action, which is enjoyable, but let's face it, the 2nd one is the best, Singer took off and took everything with him, leaving the 3rd movie with nothing (fingers crossed on Superman, by the way).",X-Men - The Last Stand
1624,fenixmagic,What a crap fest,1,26 May 2006,"You might enjoy this movie if all you've ever seen of the X-men has been in the movies. As for anyone who has ever followed it in any other format, you will be disappointed and perhaps angry. They have taken your favorite characters and destroyed any level of humanity they had. Many people die in this movie, good and bad alike, without any regard to consequences. Some old characters are unrecognizable, some are gone without any explanation, and some are so changed (Callisto anyone?) that you can't tell who they're supposed to be. They use profanity and odd moments to draw laughs that aren't needed and the vulgarity of it is unexpected - how many other movies feature villains that repeatedly call women and teenage girls ""bitch"" for laughs? Famke Janssen was wonderful as Phoenix; it's easy to pass off her ""personality"" changes as special effects until you realize the acting that went on underneath all those pixels. The final battlefield scene was intriguing, but not right somehow - it seemed odd to see the ""cannon fodder"" factor in a series that has especially concentrated on individuals. Hugh Jackman does a good job as well as the ""old"" cast; they just aren't given much to work with script-wise. Kelsey Grammar was stately, but didn't get to play up the charm and educated qualities of Beast. Angel...well, he was barely in the movie, unlike the trailer would have you believe. Rogue's transformation shows a misunderstanding of the tragicness of her character, and also leaves her with nothing to do in the movie. Overall, the script reeks of too many treatments, and the direction is just not up to the bar that Singer set for the series. If you're a fan, don't see this movie and encourage this type of degradation of your favorite heroes.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1625,yukatafish,"Fun, but leaves you wanting more.",6,26 May 2006,"X-Men was disappointing.Brett Ratner was a completely wrong choicethe film was being billed as something epic, yet the whole film was saturated with the same homogeneous emotion. There was no climax, no point at which the heart races. Instead of getting some intense, emotionally powerful film (which the story was perfectly capable of supporting), we get what is more like a dragged out television movie; the death scenes are anti-climactic, the story brief and episodic, and the effects sometimes cheesy and usually sub-par. The film does contain some good parts (I enjoyed the protests), but overall, it could have been better. Instead of a blockbuster that carried its audience along emotionally (Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope), it is a blockbuster that, like Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith, is polished yet hollow, and like a mint flavored star burst, is enjoyable, but leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1626,tannecolley,The credits say it all!,3,30 May 2006,"All you have to do to understand where this film went wrong is look at the credits listed on this website. There are no credits for the WRITER. That says it all. Possibly, the studio did not seem to feel a writer was important enough to list, or the writer, after seeing the horror that they made of what might have originally been a decent script, refused to be listed. Most apparently, she/he was absent! Therefore, so was not any logic, tension, creativity, reason, continuity or substance in this story. All that money . . . so little value. I've never read any of the comics, but thoroughly enjoyed the first two films, and hope they will hire real writers who have read the comics for the next one (which they certainly left openings for). This film was ""assembled"" by immature children, none of whom knew how to tell a real story of substance, or who understand writing at all. Why? How can Hollywood spend this much money to tell a story, without the strong input of a real storyteller. It is astounding! There is no foundation. And even I know that some of the decisions made in telling these people's stories COULD NOT follow any character or series logic because it is too far from the original basis of the first film. It was idiotic beyond reason. All you have to do to know that is to watch the absurdity of the manner in which Magnetos group travels, with dozens of viable transportation options all around. I won't say more, but it was clearly the work of a simple mind, designed for other simple minds. For those of us who are not simpletons, its insulting.This studio could have funded 100 independent filmmakers with the money they spent on this one huge mess, and supported the art of film, and not abused such fine actors. We viewers need to insist upon it, unless we like this.Hollywood should be ashamed of what it does for greed. Quality has left the back lot it appears, too often.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1627,elric-kline,"This could have been another ""Empire.""",1,26 May 2006,"This film could have been another ""Empire Strikes Back."" With a bleakly tragic plot line and a devastating list of casualties, it could have described the heart-wrenching tragedy that inevitably unravels at the core of the greatest sagas.They had all the right pieces. A daunting, uncontrollable new power in the form of the Phoenix, with the obvious implication that the Professor's fearful meddling in young Jean's mind is at least partly responsible for her untamed alter-ego. Doubting himself--not as a telepath, but as a teacher--Xavier had locked off the parts of her power that he believed could not be educated. Thus hidden from her conscious mind, this power had the freedom to become the Phoenix, a selfish and destructive creature possessing nearly unimaginable power.Meanwhile, a major pharmaceutical company develops a ""cure"" for the mutant condition, sharply dividing the mutant community and providing the banner around which Magneto can build his own army of angry mutants. The government, of course, has weaponized the ""cure"" using plastic darts that take only seconds to incapacitate their target.Again, all of the right pieces for a genuine tragedy for our X-Men. Betrayal, fallen friends, hopeless odds. I loved this story. I could have enjoyed this pain... but they just would not let me.On a dramatic level, the film falls flat. Director Brett Ratner comes across as amateurish and unoriginal, while choppy editing and rush-job writing whisk us through a dazzling array of scenes with virtually no dramatic impact. Meanwhile, writers and director simply refused to tug at the nagging loose threads of their own story. The most glaring example? Xavier, who may not have deserved to die, certainly made his own death-bed. Despite a weakly-drawn confrontation with Wolverine, however, not to mention punchy but thin accusations from Magneto, Xavier never admits his mistakes, never confronts his contradictions. Thus, he dies still pleading his pathetic paternalism to a Jean Grey already destroyed by his own manipulations. He dies with impotent stubbornness, with no dignity because he cannot escape his conceit. His death, while tragic, leaves a bitter taste in my mouth because he never managed to repent.If his death is sour, Xavier's memorial and the succeeding scenes are far worse. The memorial is brief and unremarkable; afterward, Hank discusses closing the school, an option that Storm all too quickly rejects. We are supposed to feel uplifted, hopeful that life goes on for the X-Men. Instead, I feel cheated, robbed of yet another chance to properly mourn the loss of an icon: we never get to absorb his death, to revel in the tragedy. Suddenly, things are simply back to normal.The narrative flow is practically non-existent: the story, while interesting, fails to build tension toward a dramatic climax. It is hardly helped by a flat and uninspired musical score.There was no need for the X-Men to ""win"" this battle. There was every reason, in fact, for them to lose. We might have left this story with Magneto and Phoenix ascendant, at the verge of true world conquest. Indeed, this would have provided the escalation necessary to make the Sentinels a reality, to launch this movie franchise wholesale into the bleak and unapologetic world of the X-Men comics.Instead, we get Hank McCoy, ambassador to the UN. We get a world in which, for no apparent reason, human and mutant suddenly get along. Yes, the X-Men saved the world (again) from Magneto, and they defeated the seemingly unstoppable Phoenix... but are we really supposed to believe that human paranoia gives in that easily? The actors, for the most part, did a superb job with a lousy script. Ellen Page was especially notable for a very honest, very relatable Kitty Pryde--I wish we had seen more of her.I loved this story. I love a good tragedy. Too bad they had to ruin it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1628,cbruce78,HOLY EXCREMENTAL EUPHANISM that was terrible.,1,26 May 2006,"When setting up the time frame at the beginning, we are told that it is ""Sometime in the near future"". Excellent.That means that there may still be time to avoid this calamity! I don't mind that there were more mutants included in the cast. The X-Men is a large family in comics, and it was fun in the first two movies trying to spot the little cameos. However, there were obviously too many for the characters to keep track of. Maybe that's why they... well, never mind. Apparently there were also too many plot points for the writers to keep track of, because those also were hastily portrayed or forgotten. The characters were sadly written as idiots. Often an obvious solution to a situation completely escapes the characters. Just watch the ending (no spoiler here, don't worry), where our heroes are so certain of the only way to resolve the crisis, despite the audience shouting at the screen about another safer, more efficient and completely obvious means to thwart the ""bad guy"". Magneto said it best in the first film: ""I thought you people lived in a school.""As for the cast, Hugh Jackman is still the man to play Wolverine, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were nice to see, and Famke Janssen was good but extraordinarily underused given the apparent importance of her character. Kelsey Grammar wasn't too horrible as Beast, though it felt like some of the lines were almost stumbled through (I blame the writers, again). Halle Berry, however, needs her Oscar taken away; there really needs to be a ceremony where representatives of the academy pry the statue from her arms. Perhaps there should be a probationary period for an Oscar, perhaps about three years, wherein an actor must give another performance to justify the award... but that's all for another rant in another area of the internet.I guess there were other important members of the cast, but again, too many characters to be kept track of by lesser talents. Perhaps a better writer and/or director might have been able to pull of such a large cast of characters, and perhaps I might have lobster for breakfast instead of oatmeal.All that said, I do love the X-Men, and perhaps that is why I am being harsh. I think I will eventually pick this up on DVD... when the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version is ready.To close, it is said that one can learn more about writing from bad material than from good. I believe I'm due some sort of degree or at least some college credit after tonight.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1629,SingeAllerdyce,Warning - comment contains one rabid fangirl and a barrel full of spoilers,4,26 September 2006,"After two flashback sequences (one quite interesting and with plenty of fuel for the good ship Chuck/Eric, though it hardly adds to your love of Jean, one touching but fairly pointless and heavy-handed way of introducing yet more backstory) X-Men 3 gets off to a good (read; geek pleasing) start sentinels (wow!), the hardball special (wow!), the first hints of a Bobby/Kitty/Rogue love triangle (which like everything else in the threequel will not be explored to anywhere near its full potential, but seeing as we don't know that yet, ooh!) and a decent danger room sequence But from thereon in, when we get our first glimpse of angst-ridden Scott, and the Prof makes the ""I won't be here much longer speech"", you can pretty much see how this is going to pan out - a not totally pleasant mixture of emo-esquire angst and impressive, though hollow, set pieces.It's irritating, especially since Brett Ratner tries so hard to make you believe that hes up to something progressive, exciting and daring (several major - and I mean REALLY major - deaths fairly early on in the film always making for one hell of a calling card), the main problem being that Ratner throws us bones but no real meat. To cite just a few examples of strands which could be so much more richly exploited Rogue's temptation to be normal (depressingly reduced to little more than lusting after Bobby), the caged/free dynamic between Logan and Jean (*start shippery rant* which might well have been the one saving grace for JeanWolf, given that that dynamic should NEVER have existed anyway... *end shippery rant*), the Phoenix entity (who really does little more than glower and smoulder) and - shock horror - the main Mutant Cure plot, which becomes little more than a way of propelling us from one ""ooh look, an obscure mutant from the comic... being killed"" battle sequence to another. Mainstream audiences would probably be annoyed enough by this, but for us fan-boys and girls there's a whole other level; the total shameless bastardisation of the Dark Phoenix saga, popularly regarded as the masterpiece of the series and reduced from EPIC to a pathetic excuse for Wolverine to act all tormented and stuff, and a little of the ol Tyler Durden, again falling woefully flat, by means of explanation for the Phoenix's presence. Makes you wonder why they bothered, really, other than to link it to the comics. True, God Loves, Man Kills on which X2 was based, bore little relation to the filmic version, but at least that made sense. Grr.Okay, its not a bad film. It could even be called Mindless Fun provided those of us who give a damn about the comic-verse can truly become mindless. But then again, if you weren't a fan of the comics or the cartoon, then there's probably far better mindless actioners out there (even the dire M:I-iii springs to mind) sans deliberate fan-boy pleasers (Mutant Spotter checklist at the ready!) and plus a whole lot more sense. All in all, not an especially fabulous Final Stand and, if the end is anything to go by, they can't even pull off Final properly. Our only hope, brothers, is that the almost inevitable X4 is far better",X-Men - The Last Stand
1630,keen14you,A great sequel? Definitely! The final chapter of a trilogy?...maybe,7,30 May 2006,"I treated myself to X-Men 3: The Last Stand on Memorial Day, which was perhaps a very good occasion for it. Although a work of fantasy and fiction, this movie definitely pays a degree of homage to the fallen heroes whose sacrifices preserved freedom for others. A shorter running time might appeal to those overwhelmed by the 2+ hour viewing frame increasingly disgorged by Hollywood lately, but it doesn't quite click in a sequel that features MORE freakin' mutants than were in the first two movies COMBINED!! As a result, no new characters, although a flurry are introduced, receive much background or development, other than Mrs. McCoy's bouncing blue-furred boy, the Beast. As a long-time X-Men fan, I instantly spotted the major discrepancies from the comic continuity. The deaths of two long-running, major characters at the hands (or mind) of another? My only guess as to the reason behind this was to free up some screen time and bankroll for a certain ebony actress whose history of comic-based movies has been less than laudable. The director (who departed the helm of Superman Returns, which Bryan Singer dumped this sequel in favor of, how poetic is that?) makes a commendable effort of smoothing over these potentially problematic events by diving headlong into the plot of the film, yet with an almost whiplash-inducing diversion. The result makes me highly curious as to how Singer's initial plans for the film. It's not so much Ratner's treatment of the patented history of over 40 years of X-comics per se (Juggernaut is NOT, and has NEVER been a mutant, neither has Callisto ever possessed superspeed) as it is the lack of elements that were nicely established in the first two movies. Why is there no inclusion, or mention of, Nightcrawler? He was the only fan-favorite to be treated with dignified consideration to join the X-Men in the first sequel, yet now he's inexplicably absent? And it goes without saying there won't be a return of Sabretooth until Wolverine's solo movie. Speaking of whom, Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the ol' canuckle-head was nothing but faithfully dead-on accurate in the first two films; a gruff, cantankerous loner whose past is lost in a haze, Wolverine never displayed any desire for leadership, yet that is exactly what he does in this latest installment with relatively little motivation. Had Jackman added a sense of reluctance to the essence of Logan, there would have been a better transition. His conversation early in the movie with Cyclops when he comments about just ""passing through"" makes this jarring divergence from character all the more evident. That being said, it is Halle Barry's depiction of Storm that emerges as the most fundamentally improved, and most needfully so! Through tragic events afflicting her clandestine family, Barry approaches this role at long last with passion and panache, augmented by CGI effects and stunt sequences that don't pull any punches, bringing her closer to the level of the ""African goddess"" she has played twice before. Ian McKellen as Magneto is as undeniably powerful and commanding as Ian McKellen as Gandalf, 'nuff said!! While his dominance of the plot wanes in comparison to X-Men and X2, this is a major harbinger of his fate: No more hints about this, let's just say that he, Mystique, and Rogue had best start seeking out reliable health plans! Before approaching the more fascinating aspects of the film, I must say that the handling of Jean Grey as Phoenix was both inspired and disappointing. It was inspired in the sense that the timeless tale of Jean Grey achieving near-omnipotence, then driven mad by it, could be effectively compacted into supporting scenes in a movie barely an hour and forty-five minutes long. However, it was disappointing that little to no foundation was given to it, save for the opening flashback featuring Xavier and Magneto when they were still colleagues. Some glimpses of this ultimate ""evolution"" would have been very welcome in the first two X-Men movies; while they might have been confusing in their individual context, the final outcome would have been much more convincing in X-Men 3 (again, the switch in directors probably decided this). My biggest letdown in Jean Grey as Phoenix: NO PHOENIX EFFECT!! Famke Janssen is a natural beauty, and I can only imagine watching her levitate against a fiery raptor construct would have enhanced this much more than the disturbing change of her eyes to solid black (very Hellraiserish) and her pronounced veins, which smacks more of Tom Welling with Kryptonite poisoning in ""Smallville"" than this mutant who walks in both worlds. But, at least, you can see all the original comic X-Men in one movie (albeit not together, sadly). The disparate desperation of the X-Men and the White House to diffuse the situation is very redolent of their ongoing, uneasy truce from the comic books: Ethnic and homosexual comparisons aside, the key focus of power (mutant or military) should be to preserve life, so more incidental debates may occur later. This is displayed brilliantly, if not obviously, in the climactic battle on Alcatraz, yet could have been more appreciably expressed by Grammar's Beast, as he is both an affiliate of the government and a former student of Professor X. To sum up, this was NOT the sequel that X2 was, which is NOT to say it's as mindlessly chaotic as Fantastic Four or as interminably melodramatic as The Incredible Hulk. It IS, however, probably the most exciting, action-packed superhero spectacle of this year, replete with unrequited love, social issues, and personal choices, all long marking the X-Men as a cornerstone book for Marvel. If you want to see Bryan Singer's interpretation of these world-famous, outlaw mutant heroes, don't see this film. But if you want to see Phoenix at unimaginably destructive, inhuman depths, as well as a movingly vulnerable and sympathetic Wolverine (even my brother, who hadn't seen the first two movies, commented on Magneto's inflicted frustrations in his last scene!) it's a necessity. Excelsior!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1631,coca_cola_white_bear,"A summer blockbuster, not an x-men sequel",7,30 May 2006,"Being a big fan of the first and second, I was excited when there was news of a third. Probably like most people, I was distraught when news that Brian Singer was leaving and even more let down when news that Brett Ratner was taking over. With that said, Singer would have made X-men 3 a deep experience, taking story over big special effects. All Ratner did was make a summer blockbuster thats fun to watch, but disappointing to think about.I'll start with the bad news since I always find it better to end on a high note. The character development, or lack there of, was probably my biggest problem with the movie. They kill off two of the main characters to make room for all the new mutants, which most of you never even get to know there names. Colossus gets about as much scene time as he did in the second one, Phoenix's only role was to kill Xavier, Angel does nothing but fly around, and Storm, Wolverine, Magneto, and every other original X-Men are pretty much the same except stronger, or in some cases useless even(Rogue, I'm looking at you). They don't even explain how 'The Cure' works, how the class system for the mutants works(which I guess isn't all that important because they don't even explain what it is), where Nightcrawler went, why Beast is blue...well you get the point.Now for the good, which I'm sad to say isin't as long as the bad. The special effects are stunning, which is expected for the x-men movies, especially a summer blockbuster, which is all this is. The acting is good for the most part, but you will cringe at some of the dialoge. Did I mention the special effects were cool. At least they didn't break the cardinal rule of making sequels and got all the original actors to come back.As an X-Men sequel, its disappointing and as a summer blockbuster its fun to watch. A 7/10 for ""Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut, Bitch!""",X-Men - The Last Stand

1633,X_Fan,Many Characters Wasted,5,29 May 2006,"I have been a fan of X-Men since I was 3 and i would have to like every single cartoon and movie no matter how crap it is. Mostly I'm a Mystique fan and how wasting of a character she is. She saved her partner (Magnetos) life by getting shot by the cure and the reward she gets is her being left there butt naked just because shes a human or homosapien as magneto called it. Everyone knows how big her role is in the cartoon and movie because she has such a history and why should she deserve to be cut off and be put all that make-up for a appearance at least 20 minutes in the movie. Mystique would have been a good fighter in the war against the soldiers and the X-men. Other characters that were wasted were Multiple Man, Juggarnaut, Pyro and mostly Rogue. Multiple Man is a great addition to the last stand because he has unique powers especially in fighting. Juggarnaut got knocked out by the same wall he smashed into to see Kitty and Leech so no reason why he got blown back. Pyro was knocked out as well by Bobby (Iceman) meaning he does survive unless he got burnt away when Phoenix was destroying the place. Rogue is a great character and Anna Paquin is a great actress. Hopefully she will be able to fly in a fourth movie also starring Ms Marvel and Mystique. Yes she got cured but Magneto was able to move the chess piece at the end of the movie so the cure is temporary. Other than that, Storm, Wolverine and Phoenix had fantastic roles other than Cyclops who died earlier in the movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1634,jonathan-f-mccord,The Comic without the Story,5,5 June 2006,"I saw this one on opening night and have held back my decision to think about it. Being a devout fan of comic books while still recognizing the inherent differences in the different mediums, I like to see the stories make it to the screen when done well. Unfortunately, the newest X-Men simply does not come through where it should.I appreciated the director's concern to show the vast number of mutants present in the world (even if we did not get to see their powers-e.g. Psylocke), even if it is dismissed by some as being a ""special effects showoff"". That's what good stories do- create epic, memorable scenes (Star Wars, Zulu, King Kong). I must say though, there are not epic scenes in this quickly moving three-peat.There is little to no resonance with the other two films in the series. What of the Weapon X program/Wolverine's past that had been the centerpiece of the other two movies? Why does Toad appear only to never show again? What happened to Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (perhaps one of the greatest, three-dimensional characters in a comic book movie to date)?SPOILER's Below! I do not mind the butchering of the Phoenix story as much as some do, as the medium would simply not allow for a 3 hour side story in space with the Shi'ar. However, now Jean is dead, along with Scott (Cyclops) and Professor X (no matter what the clip after the trailer was supposed to show). I'm not convinced the ""cure"" really meant anything at all, with Magneto regaining his powers (with apparently no legal ramification for his crimes against humanity). At the end, what did the movie accomplish, except to quash the hopes of fans of a well done 4th film and free certain actors of their respective contracts.In conclusion, this movie had the same stellar cast as the other two films (I especially enjoyed the addition of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut) but no story to drive them. Try as they might, and look as good as they did in makeup and special effects, this movie is at the end, a failure.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1635,spamme-24,I think I know why they made this movie...,1,28 May 2006,"OK, let's go over the list of things they did:1. ""killed"" Prof X 2. Killed Cyclops 3. Killed Jean 4. Rendered Mystique a human 5. Rendered Rogue a human 6. Rendered Magneto a humanI'm thinking 'real-life' affected how this movie was made. I'm thinking Patrick Stewart said that he didn't want to be in any more Xmen films, and thus we have the 'body switch'.I'm thinking the actor who played Cyclops just basically ticked off the director and thus was promptly handled.I'm OK with the killing of Jean.I'm thinking Rebecca Romijn wanted this to be her last film as well.For the Rogue thing, I think the Director actually thinks Rogue wanted this 'Cure.'Rendering Magneto a human...Movie ploy, fails miserably. So, lots of the horrible things that happen in this movie I think financially/actor based. Some other things are not so easy to explain away. Juggernaught: His powers are magical, and the dude is supposed to be as big as or bigger than the hulk. I mean wolvie is supposed to be barely the size of his head.Nightcrawler: Wtf was he? He's definitely in the game.Beast: Can't quite buy Kelsey Grammar as a fighter. Scholar, yes, fighter, no.I can't quite remember a film I had more issues with since Streeet Fighter the movie. Very frustrating to watch Hollywood in action sometimes...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1636,pete_michaud,The best of the 3,7,26 May 2006,"This is a thoroughly entertaining movie worth the $10 admission (depending on where you live). I am a big fan of the genre, and I am familiar with the X-Men (but by no means an expert). When I saw the first in theaters, I thought it was a decent movie but by no means lived up to my expectations. My opinion towards the second was pretty much the same, so I resolved to keep my hopes down for the third. Sure enough, this one pretty much commits the same major errors of the first two, but is much better in terms of pure action entertainment. In short, many of the characters are underdeveloped/grossly different from the comics, the dialog is mediocre, and the plot is far from air-tight. However, the action leaves little to be desired; it is a fun way to spend an evening, if not deeply moving or artistically inspiring.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1637,mrpeepers629,I can't believe people are actually giving this movie a 10,1,26 May 2006,"How can people give this movie a 10, did you not see the first two? Did you not see how an X-Men movie should be made? In Brian Singers absence the X-Men turned into just another popcorn movie along the lines of dare I say it, Fantastic Four. Bret Rattner didn't totally kill this movie, I'll admit that there was some pretty neat stuff in there aside from special effects, but the absence of Singer really made this project the weakest of the three films when it should have been the greatest and I firmly believe would have been had Fox just waited for Singer to come back. I think this film would have been better if Matthew Vaughn directed it, Layer Cake was in so many ways better than anything Bret Rattner has ever done. I hope Superman Returns blows the crap out of this movie just to reinforce the fact that Fox screwed up in not waiting for Singer.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1638,clashcitygraham,Excellent...but a finale?,9,4 June 2006,"After reading the mixed reviews from critics and fans alike, I was slightly wary before seeing X3. Let it be known that I am not a fan-boy; I do not own any x-men comics, I have read a couple but that's the extent of my connection with the original comics. Whether or not this lessens my view is something else.I thought X3 was the most entertaining film I've seen in a while. Reading through comments on IMDb it seems many are disgruntled with the shortcomings of the story, the plot acting as a foundation for impressive visual effects. I can understand fans being annoyed about the mish-mash and dilution of stories in this film, but those who claim the plot wasn't complex or exploratory, what did you expect? The first two X-Men films were also excellent, but neither had an amazing storyline. I've also read a lot of whining about X3 containing no emotion or character development. As for emotion, X3 is the most moving of all the X-Men films, but I agree with others in saying a lot more could have been said about the X-Mens reaction to the cure. A lot of people are saying there was little character development in the film. For those new mutants on-screen for the first time, I agree - little background is provided and some insight to their lives (in the way Angel is introduced at the start) might have been good. For established characters such as Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm etc, there is no need for character development or time dedicated to their stories - What do you think the first 2 films were for? I don't want to watch Wolverine blabbing on about his life, I already know about it due to the films that came before this one. Besides, this is not a drama series - it is a set of action films. While the X-Men films blends action with strong characters, I still want battles, explosions and eye-candy.Which brings me on to the visuals. Jaw-dropping. The special effects in X3 make M:I-3 look like it had a budget of 300 quid. X3, because of its special effects, feels epic in a way that the previous films did not, while retaining some of their humour and emotion. Although the film is missing Singer, it follows a formula that one could imagine Singer directing, which makes me wonder why viewers are so upset about his absence. The film flows perfectly with the other two, and Ratner has done a good job (even if he allowed some cringe-worthy moments of cheesiness) Overall X3 is everything I hoped for - The great elements of the first X-Men films combined with a grandness that elevates the franchise. Despite many claiming it lacks emotion, and while the acting from some is hardly inspiring, it manages to be moving in places. Some won't agree with me, but even if you find the film average, you can't deny it blasts every other comic book adaptation out of the water even when it's mediocre.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1639,dalnik,They needed to wait for Bryan Singer,6,26 May 2006,"I saw it last night, although well intentioned, Brett Ratner has a terrible pacing problem with this movie. It doesn't seem to flow well. I think Avi Arad took it personally when Singer went to direct ""Superman"" for DC. I saw Avi Arad at Wizards a couple years ago when he was promoting the soon to be released ""Fantastic 4"" At the time the director was not sure yet, and he was asked if X-Men would suffer without the direction of Bryan Singer, he seemed to be annoyed with the questions and said ""The story of the X-Men surpasses any Director."" He should have waited for Bryan Singer to finish ""Superman"" Or hired Joss Wheadon to direct.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1640,grandpakhan,An enjoyable film marred by the high expectations of loyal comic book fans.,8,6 June 2006,"As my summary indicates, I quite enjoyed this film. Personally, I think it is quite a shame that so many feel the need to trash it with one-star ratings, although it is perfectly understandable why they feel the need to do so.X-men is different from other comic books. It does not focus on a single hero, or even necessarily a small group of heroes. Instead, there are numerous characters that have played the heroic lead throughout the course of the series, most of whom have been developed to a large degree and have developed considerable fan bases. It would be nigh impossible to appeal to every fan of the series, as there simply is not enough time to develop every character and plot in a movie format! It is thus impossible to appease all the fans of the comic series. There is not enough time in a movie format to develop all characters adequately and make them fit properly into a plot that can incorporate them all. Thus, some characters are toned down a bit and moved more towards the background. Others characters, like Gambit, as absolutely awesome as they might be, are left out completely because there is little way to tie them into the plot and pay them proper justice.And some are killed off in ways that run fundamentally contrary to the source material, perhaps in ways that do not pay proper respect to the characters in question (I do believe that could have been handled better). Yet such things are at times necessary to advance the plot of what is ultimately an action movie.X-men 3 is an action movie. Comic book fans come to see their favorite characters and plots played out on the big screen. Average viewers, on the other hand, that are not particularly devoted to the comic book series come to see an action film. If time was taken to include all of the major characters of the X-men series, develop them properly, and place them in a plot faithful to the comics, the movies would all run about three hours long, contain very little action, and would most likely ultimately bore the average viewer. Now, as a fan, you might blame the studio, the writers, the director, and the producers for taking the average viewer into slightly higher consideration than devoted comic fans... but the fact of the matter is that without attracting and entertaining average viewers, enough money will not be made to cover the expenses of producing the movie, a profit will not be made, and the entire incentive of the studio to put out the movie in the first place will thus be entirely defeated. Films, just like any other product, aren't put out for the sake of altruism. They are put out to make a profit.*SPOILERS FOLLOW* This means that the movie must fit into the action format. Action film goers don't necessarily want to see a movie that runs two hours long. This film was the same length as the first, which honestly felt a bit right. The second film was a bit over two hours which, while it worked for that film, it would have made this one drag. The length was just right for the plot, which in turn was just right for the genre.With all of that in mind, the plot was great for an action movie. It was entertaining, well casted, and the actors did a reasonable job, with some delivering stronger performances than others. I did feel that the ending was a bit on the weak side. In addition, I fully agree that the death of Cyclops could have been handled in a much better fashion.At the risk of upsetting some readers, however, I will point out that I do believe his death was necessary to the flow of the plot. The story, as it was written for the movie, did not need both Wolverine and Cyclops. Their feeling for Jean Grey would have ultimately been redundant, and the conflict between the two, while potentially highly interesting if developed and tied in properly, more likely might have been disruptive to the flow of the plot the third time around. Wolverine was the more strongly developed of the two heroes, leaving him out would have done harm to the film, and thus Cyclops' absence really was for the best. Killing him off made more sense than merely putting him in a coma or having him go missing, as it would have put unnecessary attention on him that would have distracted from the overall plot. Thus, it was a good decision that could have been handled better (and, after all... there are ALWAYS ways to bring people back for a sequel, if necessary).*END SPOILERS*Overall, I found X-Men 3 to be an enjoyable comic-based action film. It would not have made sense for this trilogy to have been done in the fashion of Lord of the Rings due to the fact that they are two different genres (action vs. fantasy) and their source materials are dramatically different. The director, writers, and producers obviously did what they could to make this an enjoyable MOVIE, which, again, due to its format, makes it rather impossible for it to be absolutely loyal to a source the magnitude of the X-Men Universe. All of the characters cannot be developed, emphasized, or even included, and it would be quite impossible to maintain the integrity of the plot from the comics.If you see this film because you want to see your favorite X-Men characters and story lines on the big screen, you will be sorely disappointed. Film simply is not the right format for a project of that magnitude. If you'd like to see a great action movie that attempts to capture much of the ESSENCE of the X-Men, however, you will enjoy this film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1641,Davies21189,"Ratners Comment About His Own Movie Sums It Up, ""Just Eye Candy.""",5,25 May 2006,"After having one of my good friends, whose movie opinion I usually trust, go to the X3 premiere, and tell me it was bad, I had absolutely no expectations walking into the cinema today to see the film. And let me tell you, it would probably help you a lot if you also went in with no expectations. Giving this film 5 is probably only because of that.This is my opinion. If you have seen nothing of the X-Men films, and just want a good action film, then you'll enjoy this. But if you have seen the previous X-Men films (like myself) and have to see how it ends, enter at the risk of wasting 100 minutes of your life.But it does have its moments. Wolverine and Storm are quite good (only because the whole story revolves around them.) Besides them, Kelsey Grammar as Beast is one of the best casting roles in a while, in my opinion. Grammar made me believe, for brief moments, that this film was decent. MOST of the action sequences were brilliant. And anytime Angel popped up on screen, it was gold.If you plan to blame Brett Ratner, however, cut him some slack. The blame should be placed firmly on the writers, Zak Penn (Elektra) and Simon Kinberg (XXX2 and Mr And Mrs Smith.) The script was absolutely pathetic (look to Juggernaut for some real dodgy lines), but it had its moments (look to Wolverine and Beast.) The main problem in this film is that it tries to fit 8 or 9 X-Men comic book story lines into the one film, and they are all done incorrectly.Another problem with this film is that half the mutants you see in the film, you don't even get a name. There could have been more credibility if someone like Quicksilver was in it, not just some random with his powers.All in all, this is, as Ratner previously quoted, ""Just Eye Candy.""

1642,jtbradyl,Good but really dumb,6,2 June 2006,"There were just too many dumb inconsistencies in the movie to allow me to sit back and enjoy it for the comic book it was, There was an antidote for the mutant gene but there was a kid with the same powers. At the final cataclysm I kept thinking,and sometimes even yelling at the screen (quietly),""Where's the kid? Use him why don't you."" I'm sure he'll surface in the next sequel.) I mean people with such enormous powers were getting zonked with adolescent tricks.

1643,jennsonwong,The Last Stand to what?,6,27 May 2006,"I remember loving the first two movies. I also remember getting more and more excited as I watched both movies when they were released in the theaters. Yes, they changed a few details in order to make the live action believable, but as a moviegoer, I really didn't care. I just wanted the movie to stay true to the spirit of the comic without sacrificing too much of what the readers have come to love about the comic books.And while I never felt it made much of a difference between directors, I now can see why directors make such a big difference for a movie. It's the difference between a Steven Spielberg film and a Stanley Kubrick film.In this case, it's the difference between a fantastic movie director and a mediocre movie director that made a name for himself by helping put Jackie Chan on the map (ahem. Rush Hour anyone?)Clocking in at barely 1 hr and 39 minutes, there just was not enough time allotted to any of the characters. Little to no character development and lots of Kraft cheese laid on top with the expectation that we as an audience don't know the difference. Psylocke was in the movie? Where? Jubilee too? and Siryn? WTF?!? It became painfully obvious after watching it a second time that they needed to make this movie at least 20 minutes longer. Plenty of action, not enough plot or character development. It just tried to do too much at once.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1644,iam_notafish,Worth the wait. Worth the admission. Worth a fourth...?,8,2 June 2006,"***CAUTION***SPOILERS***AHEAD*** On the whole it's a great watch and worth every penny of admission. Sadly, and I mean that literally, it is marred by a number of annoyances. These range from small to potentially catastrophic. The several story lines entwined in this movie need and deserve a run time close to double the 1 hour 40 mins they are given. The character development and motivation that Singer was so good at is lost in Ratner's short and frankly rushed attempt. The Dark Phoenix is the best example, simply shrugged of as Jean Grey's twin personality before being reduced to a creator of special effects. Rouge is also pushed too far into the background as the one mutant the movies 'cure' storyline should focus on. Another example is The Juggernaught's (a mis-cast Vinnie Jones) and Maverick's instant allegiance to Magneto's cause the minute they are released with no motivation considered or explained. Other mutants reasons are also left out (Pyro's turn to evil and most of Magneto's new henchmen lack that elusive third dimension minor characters require) although forgivable, these are just more reminders of Brian Singers absence. The film also relies too heavily on the masses of visual effects that drag the movie from action sequence to action sequence with each one only lessening the great emotional story that is trying to get out from behind the green screen. And finally and least excusable is the laughable and inexplicable lapse in concentration in the editing suite. In one scene (a particularly good one if you ignore the production teams lack of respect for their audiences intelligence) the daylight becomes pitch dark in a single cut that covers a few seconds of the story (no deleted scene will explain this)The saving graces though come, thankfully, by the bucket load. Retrieving The Last Stand from the depths and transforming it from watchable to memorable, leaving most of my grievances in the theatre is something Ratner has done with ease. Singer is obviously missing from this instalment but the film does not suffer in great amounts. The films reliance on FX is less of a problem when you see them: Magnificent and cool to say the least. A look inside the Danger Room (at last) sits well with many fans of the comics and animated series as well as providing some brilliant Wolverine moments. As I mention Wolverine it only suits to hail Hugh Jackman as a colossus (sorry) of an actor as both the feral Wolverine and the human, love torn Logan  silencing critics with believable and inspiring scenes with Jean and most notably in reaction to the Professor's fate. Jackman (as good as he was) is not the best thing the movie has going for it. The ever calm and collected 'bad only when necessary' Magneto is so brilliantly portrayed again by Sir Ian McKellan and is the centre of some fantastic CGI. Again the focal point of many scenes, he along with Patrick Stewart steals the show in the final two scenes (stay in your seat until after the credits).A point I can't place as pro or con is the screenplay. It is often rushed and clumsy regarding the main emotional aspects and new characters but it is spot on in wit and one liners (if you remove Juggernaught's contributions) and when handling emotional issues involving old, well known characters. When writing it the powers that be also had no hesitation to kill/cure a large number of mutants (some pawns and even a bishop of a king or two). I found this hard to take at first but I think I prefer this to the cliché save the good guy routine. In reference to the final scenes however they seem to be insensitive to two of the most important (especially if considering a 4th) events from the film.The largest downfall and saving grace I leave to the end. The downfall that leaves this film lingering below the amazing finale standard it deserves is simply the films it follows. They are intelligent and appropriately packed with action and emotion while taking great care over each character. In Lehman's terms X1 and 2 rule in this trilogy. The saving grace happens to be its ending, even though I found it lessened some of the big twists and turns. It redeems itself solely because it leaves the door well and truly open for a fourth. I hope this is the case as I feel, as a fan of the comics and TV series, there are many more stories and characters to be explored. X4 would do the series good as once you've made three you might as well make four and give it the ending it deserves. X3, so called 'The Last Stand"" doesn't feel like the end and fits more the role of mid series action fest that thought provoking and definitive finale.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1647,LanceMiller-2,Lacks the heart and soul of the original...lacks Singer (possible spoiler),4,30 May 2006,"Okay....I was really wanting to give this movie a chance. I have had no beef with Bret Ratner until actually seeing this movie. I actually enjoyed the Rush Hour movies and Red Dragon, however...now I'm overjoyed to say that I know Superman (my favorite superhero ever) is going to be wonderful.The core concept of this movie...that there is a cure for mutants...needs exploration and delving into the way it affects the characters more. Singer would have done this. With Ratner it seems to be that all the characters are sitting around saying ""this sucks....okay whose ass can we kick now?"" I read the novelization and it actually had me excited...and pretty jazzed about the movie...the tone was slightly different...but I thought if Ratner did it right....it could be pretty good and a fitting conclusion to what could have been an excellent superhero trilogy.That being said...things were slightly different in the novel...such as Rouge's fate. All in all...this movie left me....disappointed and even more excited for Superman Returns, a superhero movie that will be done right.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1648,chara_lynn,Closure.,9,26 May 2006,"This movie brings good closure to the trilogy. It is very well made and keeps you on your toes. You won't be bored! The dialogue is a little forced at times, but the fight scenes are worth it. The acting is also pretty good. McKellen has some great, subtle facial expressions that bring so much to the character. I was surprised at all the twists that didn't leave me disappointed at the end at all. The movie starts with flashbacks and moves on from there in a seamless transition from the second movie. I enjoyed the movie a lot, and I think one would appreciate it even if they hadn't seen the other two. It also has some great special effects. It was definitely shocking, but closes things up nicely at the end... or does it?",X-Men - The Last Stand

Angel was very poorly developed character especially for how much of an important character he is to X-Men and that Jean Grey's death was a good moment in the comics, it semt rather underwhelming and maybe could of prolonged it to the next movie so we could fully see her strength.But however I'm glad to see that Iceman, Colussus and Kitty Pryde are becoming much stronger and hopefully the next movie will continue this development.Oh, and don't leave during the credits, wait to the end.Seeya.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1651,stew75,They Killed the X-Men Franchise!,1,26 May 2006,"This was by far the worst movie all summer. It is proof that a trailer can make a movie better then it really is. I thought for sure you could not ruin the X-Men franchise, but leave it to Brett Raitner to do it! I was willing to give this guy a chance after I saw the trailer, but it was a big disappointment. All I can say is wait for Superman since the guy who did it right (Brian Singer) is doing it. The thing that gets me the most is why do people in Hollywood feel they need to screw with story lines of comics? They are popular for a reason! Bryan Singer and Sam Rami knew that and that's why their movies are successful, because they know if its not broke don't fix it. I don't mind little plot changes like spider-man's web shooters or some tweaks to the origins of the X-Men if it serves the purpose of the overall story. But X-Men 3 did not do that. Instead it looks as if Raitner wanted his own stable of X-Men and killed off all the ones Singer established in the first two movies. The plot was very weak and the characters were all watered down. Wolverine looked like a bitch. Magneto came off as moron. Rouge, well, was she even in the movie? Cyclops went out like a chump! And how are you going to kill off Professor X? So if you're a fan of the comic save your money and if you were unfortunate enough to see it, do what I did, pretend it never existed. It worked for Superman 3 and 4.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1652,thomas_anderson_75061,Witness the greatest let down in movie history.,1,26 May 2006,"I honestly don't know where to start with this movie. After being in love with the first two movies, reading the comics in the past few years, and reading as much history as there was with the universe of X-Men, I can honestly say this movie sucked. It was a disaster. Leaving out spoilers, it felt like the movie was thrown together at the last minute. (Thank you Brain Singer for leaving X-Men high and dry so they would be stuck without a solid director for the better half of two years and also taking with you most of the production staff, including composer and Editor John Ottman, cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, writers Mike Dougherty and Dan Harris, and production designer Guy Dyas. Everyone Stop blaiming Brett Ratner! By the time Ratner had a chance to clean up the mess that was made by Singer's sudden leaving. ""Life gives you lemons, make lemonaid."" Well Singer left Ratner crap, so guess what happened?) There was no character development at all. It didn't even seem like we were watching the same cast of characters as the previous two movies. The plot is not a bad plot is not a bad plot. The story wouldn't be so bad if it was in a comic book. There are several story lines going on today in the X-Men Comic 'vers. This could be okay as on of them, but is terrible tried as a Blockbuster movie. I sat there almost the whole time of the movie thinking I was about to wake up from this nightmare at any moment. The dialogue is not bad either accepted that since it does not even seem like this movie could be connected to the first two, you can't take it seriously. You can't take it to heart because even though your brain is witnessing the biggest let down in movie history, you heart is fighting for the chance that what you're watching isn't happening. There are some good things to this movie, but all those good things simply come from see our favorite characters using there powers in key ways that we remember from the comics. If you're going to so something, do it right or don't do it at all. I hear that Singer's Superman Returns picks up the story of Superman after Superman II and just acts like the fallowing films never happened. I can only hope that maybe someday X-Men will get the same treatment.WARNING!!!! SPOILERS BELOW!!!!! This is a list of the major happenings that add to the pile of what made this movie not work.Cyclops, who was robed of team leader in X2, had less then ten minutes of screen time before being needlessly killed off by Phoenix.Mystique looses her powers.Xavier is needlessly killed by Phoenix.Stop me if I'm wrong but last time I checked, Multiple Man was a good guy.Angel has maybe ten minutes of screen time at best.Magneto looses his powers.Rogue decides to take the cure and in doing so she looses her powers and we loose the chance to see her have the super human strength and flight she had in the comics.Actual footage of Colossus adds up to him being there only so we can see him throw Wolverine.Kitty Pryde's character seems there only to create tension between Rogue and Iceman.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1653,JungleBrother,What a waste....,3,29 May 2006,"Major disappointment.... All of the interesting themes of the previous two movies - isolation, persecution, fear - were cast away in lazy attempt to make a video game demo out of a veritable movie franchise. Rather than follow the well-established path of his predecessor, Dir. Ratner merely contents himself with some CGI mutant powers and calls it a wrap. Wasted acting talent (i.e. Famke...merely grimacing for an entire movie and...seemingly...told to mirror that girl in Species for some scenes) and wasted characters (i.e. Rogue...Iceman...Mystique...Colossus) highlight this film; does being a mutant require no introduction, or are we supposed to just assume Beast is...well, a Beast?!? Yet when Ratner opts to rely on CGI, rather that screen writing or editing, he is only too (sub)-human, as the finale was hardly a scene that will live long in the annals of superhero filmography (reminiscient of Zog and his harlot and goon fighting Superman in NYC in No. 2 for entertainment - hardly - value). Even the foreshadow (the simulated battle in the intro) was more entertaining.So many possibilities (i.e. Magneto's employment of the mutant underclass vs. Xavier's 'best and brightest'), such waste (was there a memorable line even?!?). Makes you appreciate Singer and the forthcoming Superman Returns, or even the fact that Raimi will be doing Spiderman 3. I didn't expect Ratner to exceed Singer's performance in any way, but I had hoped he would have at least honored his predecessor by at least attempting some form of character/plot/thematic development. What a hack.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1654,cedrone1985,The trilogy is complete,10,31 May 2006,To start off i would like to say that before i went to see this movie i was constantly logging on to IMDb to see comments and ratings. Although i saw some terrible things said about X-Men 3 i still went and saw it. One lesson i've learned about listening to peoples advice including my own is that everyones opinions are terrible.I am a huge fan of the X-Men comics and also the X-Men movies and after seeing this movie i can say that this trilogy is absolutely complete. I agree with some people about Scott summers and the way he went out however there were many huge reasons why this movie kicked butt compared to singers first two.1. Storm finally stopped her corny lines and showed her powers and MUCH better acting. 2.Pyro & Iceman's characters finally did something instead of nothing. 3.The action goes from beginning to end non-stop with incredible special effects. 4.I saw rebecca Romijn pretty much naked. 5.Rouge's character is finally put on the shelf because she didn't deserve the attention she got in part 1 and 2. 6. Great ending to keep you wondering. and 7. They brought it from a G rated movie to PG-13 although they really didn't it just seemed like it...Don't Take anyones advice just go see it for yourself.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1655,dgrr02,Finally! Some Sex in the Series,7,27 May 2006,"X-Man: The Last Stand is not a disappointment after all. Many - myself included - were more than skeptical about the third, and supposedly final entry, when a new director was announced. It's not so much that we all loved Bryan Singer (although his first two entries were respectful, solid entertainments) as much as that we really don't like Brett Ratner (who made the immediately forgettable Rush Hour series, the unendurable Family Man, and the absolutely abominable Red Dragon). It's a wonder why any studio would enlist Ratner to head a popular franchise, as he aptly demonstrated how to ruin one with Red Dragon. Maybe my dislike is much more simple. Maybe I was skeptical because I can't imagine a serious film director whose name is BRETT RATNER, who hails from Miami Beach, Florida, and who looks like this (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0711840/).I'm being terribly cruel. But the news is good! In fact, I wouldn't put up much of a fight to the statement that The Last Stand is the best X-Men thus far (please, for a series so grave in it's pleas for diversity and tolerance, let's change the title to X-People). The third entry is the tightest in the series  with a taut, intricate storyline, and a slew of new mutants. Once again, Ian Mckellen is here to make meager lines ring Shakespearean, and finally, the now 40 year-old, still absolutely ravishing, Famke Janssen is back from the dead. Well, in fact, she never died, as fans of the comic-book already knew.And this I'll say for Ratner, when he does give Famke Janssen screen time (she's not on screen for more than 15 minutes), he uses her splendidly - better than Singer ever did, or ever could. In the first two X-Men, her beauty was distant and almost motherly (she was the mother, and Wolverine and Cyclops were her disobedient children desperately seeking her approval and love)  she had no sex appeal. Here she is all woman, and in the film's best scene, she gives us one of the better seductions in cinema this year. After a dangerously long kiss with Cyclops which results in the latter's death, she wakes up at home base, not completely herself. She's got split personality issues  she's both the sweet, tender Jean Grey and the destructive Phoenix. She wakes, wearing a skimpy black tank top and an even skimpier pair of black shorts. Wolverine is beside her, drooling over her. ""You're making me blush."" She says. ""You're reading my mind?"" He asks her. ""I don't have to."" Then she sits up and delicately straddles him with her thighs. She's hungry, and I had to wonder: isn't it strange that Phoenix's first two appearances are lust driven, and unfulfilled? Would Phoenix be such a threat if Wolverine had set aside his personal doubts and given in to the passion of the moment? Is Phoenix really blood-thirsty or just extremely horny? There is another strong, female actress in the film that makes Phoenix/Grey's dilemma all the more transparent. This actress is the lovely Anna Paquin (terribly neglected here), who longs to be cured of her power so she can finally touch and kiss and screw her boyfriend (she can put people in a coma with a handshake, or worse). These mutant women are tired of being ""special"" and ""powerful"". They just want to be held, they just want to be loved.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Most of the actors did a good job and I was pleased. But the script was not as good as the first two movies.I think that Halle Berry's performance was OK. Her parts in the other two movies were very small, but in this one it was a little better. Huge Jackman did a wonderful job as Logan and portrayed the character well. Jean Gray is my favorite character in both the comic's and the movies. Famke did a good job with her. I did not like Scott in this movie though.There were some things that kept me from giving it the full 10 stars.

I am shocked that Marvel Entertainment, Inc. or Marvel Studios allowed this movie to be made and distributed in the form it was delivered to the public.After this abysmal interpretation was released, I found myself unable to wait for a reboot of this once proud Marvel franchise.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1658,larrystewartjr,Worth the ticket!,9,29 May 2006,"Wow is all I can say! **May be a spoiler or two here, read at your own risk!** I went into this movie against the advice of some friends and some pretty bad reviews that I read. I am glad I did not pay attention to them. This move was a lot darker and emotional than the first two. This aspect added to the depth and realism of this movie. This movie (as with the first two) was the continuing story of two groups of mutants; one trying to be accepted as normal and the other that wanted to rule the world. Caught in the middle of this mutant war are the regular humans. With any war you have casualties and this one had more than its share. The first two movies had very few casualties and even when Jean Grey died at the end of the second movie we all knew she would be back. The special effects are out of this world, better than 1 and 2 combined and the action is non-stop. The story introduces several more mutants on both sides and may detract from the story for some of you die-hard X-fans, but I thought it added to the story very well. There are a few emotional moments for those of you inclined to shed a tear or two and some surprising deaths that you may not expect unless you have read about it already. This movie was well worth the ticket and you will not be disappointed. This movie is more than just the battle between good and evil, it is a struggle for survival against fellow mutants and the human race that lives in fear of something they do not understand. GO see this movie!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1659,t0rrance,X3 The worst Stand,3,28 May 2006,"This film brought tears to my eyes, not only because of the laughter brought on from the numerous flaws but simply because they took a good franchise and trashed it with a poor director and mediocre acting from actually talented actors. Brian Singer dropped this film in order to finish Superman Returns, and thus Brett Ratner took over. This was a horrible move, the film suffers from many different problems. The story line is dry and seems like it was taken from the old cartoon from the 90's and then dulled down so that the general public would enjoy it, they made this film for the average American, the one who didn't vote for the president but did vote for American Idol, the type of American that watches daytime television instead of reading a classic or simply being a real person. Many main Characters die very quickly to make room for a lame love story between Jean Grey and Logan. Xavier changed so much that I was happy to see him explode into nothingness. The scene at Alcatraz made me sick, so many problems and flaws that I was simply crying by the end, the scene where they change all their guns into plastic is hilarious, Ed Wood made better films than this, the wrong person died at the end of this film, Bret Ratner should have made an appearance simply died, anyone who considers themselves intelligent should not enjoy this film at all. I'm sorry if you disagree you are entitled to your ignorance",X-Men - The Last Stand
1660,pam5191,If you've seen I and II you have to see III,10,29 May 2006,"As the controversy between humans and mutants continues, a cure for the mutant causing gene is developed with the aid of a young boy. Then the controversy turns to the mutant community - with those who wish for a cure and those who believe a ""Cure"" is not needed as they do not consider being mutant a disease. The reasons for arguments pro and con prove to be varied, debatable and personal. Charles Xavier's school was created to help Mutants learn about their powers and also to learn to control them and to live side-by-side with non-mutants in peace. His dream is to make a place for mutants that is free of the fear and bigotry felt against anyone who has special powers through being a mutant. Some powers however, may prove to be so strong that learning control is nearly impossible and there are those Mutants who would allow these powers free reign in order to promote the welfare of their type and to show non-mutants that they are the weaker of the two peoples. This particular group of Mutants believe that they are the next evolutionary step, that no cure is necessary and that they, as the stronger species, will survive . I thought this was the best of the three thus far and if you have seen XI and XII then this one is a must. There are a few new characters introduced like the Angel, Calisto and Juggernaught, and then the old characters are back with some stunning twists. This is an exciting fast-paced ride.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1661,dragunov_273,"A fun film, just not enough of it...",7,3 June 2006,"X-Men (3) The Last Stand is the third film in the series of X-men films following on from where the last film left off. However in doing so, there are several things that need to be explained, the one obvious thing is; where is Nightcrawler? Apparently though this is explained in the game, so fair enough.We see the return of most of the X-Men from the last film, at in doing so, most end up being ""removed"" from the film, and then add in a few new ones, whose reason to be in this movie is not fully explained in the 1:30 time slot. Though we do get to see these new mutants in action, there is lack of character development with the new mutants, Angel, Juggernaut and Multiple Man have very little appearances in the film, nor do they have many lines, they have a good choice of actors, yet we don't get to see much of their potential as mutants because of the lacking lines. The only new mutant who gets character development is Beast played by Kelsey Grammar who executes the role well. However these mutants are put on, just so then Ratner can kill off a few, then replace them with these new ones, Cyclops is a prime example, his removal hardly did much to make Ratner develop the new mutants. For the mutants who had lacking screen time on the film, Brett Ratner could've of addressed this situation by making the film longer instead of trying to fit it all in a 1:30 time slot, surely he could've made the film go over at least 2 hours, the last film did, that way he would've been able to fit in all that was necessary, and everyone would be happy (I wish it were just as easy as that). Ratner instead trades development for action, and there are some scenes in the film that are fun to watch, like the Juggernaut chasing Kitty. Yet the lack of character development makes it feel these characters don't seem necessary in the film.Though, if they are making a 4th film, I do hope that the issues in this film are addressed to.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1662,DS7691,Best X-Men movie ever.......Two thumbs up,10,21 June 2006,"This movie definitely kicks ass and is one of the best summer 2006 blockbuster movies ever made. Although Bryan Singer did a great job for the first two movies, this final chapter does show the true skills of the x-men, ie action which was less in the previous two movies. The fight between juggernaut and shadow cat, the bridge scene was spectacular. I give this movie two thumbs and would definitely watch this movie again. Also, keep a close eye at the end of the credits for spoilers, which may lead to another sequel. The only problem is that the movie was not as long as the others but it definitely made my weekend good.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1663,cvinny1972,Far from horrible...,7,28 May 2006,"One thing you have to remember about the X-Men, is that it is about a group of heroes, not just one. Each sequel has introduced new characters, and in doing that, reduced the roles of others. It is hard to focus on everyone in just 2 hours. There was also a question about Scott Summers.... I think his fate was purposely left open, because maybe his character is still alive somewhere. The reason I say this, is because James Marsden, who plays Cyclops, wanted to do Superman Returns, which filmed almost simultaneously as X3, so they had to be creative on how to keep him out of this film with the possibility of bringing him back. I think that if there is another sequel, there will be some surprises on what actually happened to our heroes. This movie was action packed, and fast paced, but the plot was not convoluted. Magneto got a lot of face time for a good reason...he is only the most powerful baddie out there right now. Wolverine is everyone's favorite, so of course he gets some good screen time. Overall, this film was very enjoyable to watch! I recommend this on the big screen! Don't wait for the DVD!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1664,smileycrew,"Fast movie, fantastic story",10,26 May 2006,"I hear a lot of people commenting that this movie was ""fast"" or ""corny"", well I think a lot of people forget that this indeed a comic book movie, a genre meant for for quasi corny lines and based in an action environment.I went in to X-Men 3 expected that the best scenes were in the trailer, and from that I was expecting a good movie. But I was blown away. New characters such as Beast, Juggernaut, and Phenoix were right on from the comics and cartoons of X-Men. I was beyond impressed with Kelsey Grammar and Vinnie Jones. Plus with the advancement of older characters like Storm, Kitty (although played by a new actress), and the much MUCH better writing for Iceman, this movie, in my opinion, was the best of the series. On top of all that, Magneto's character showed a lot more heart despite being the bad dude. I won't say why for fear of spoilers, but you can see really see how dynamic Magneto really is. Sir McKellen rocks.When you base a movie off of another already printed material, you can't impress everyone, especially the die hard fans. I'm a fan of X-Men, but not a die-hard one. I had a great time watching this movie, and haven't gone to a movie and left feel satisfied and beyond in a long LONG time. Great lines, very comic-booky, full of action, and tons of pleasant (and some sad) surprises. See this movie, and then you can start waiting for X4 like me.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1665,naijalola,The Worst Stand,3,12 October 2006,"Brett Ratner's next project should be about meat heads on steroids blowing stuff up because that's where his strengths lie. The action sequences in X3 where very well done and that's the only positive thing to say about the movie. I have been waiting for Last Stand to come out since the premier of X2 in 2003. I was convinced that the story could only get better. Alas, no. There is no hint of emotional attachment to any of the characters. When major characters are killed off, it's obviously for shock value and you're just left with a displaced feeling of whaa? Each of the subplots could have been viable if the time was taken to set them up properly. I have accepted that the movie universe is different from the comic book universe and would have been content if the storyline changes were consistent within the frame of the movie universe. The entire attempt just felt half-hearted. If the characters are not invested in their own fate, why should I care? I have loved the X-Men in every incarnation they have had and I hope Bryan Singer can pull of a Batman Begins type move to help us all to wipe this disaster from our collective memories.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Even though he was never really a favorite, he was the leader and an important character. There were some really lame ass lines in this movie that I am trying to forget. The music was amateur at best. Not enough of Colossus. They killed off several main characters and butchered the Phoenix Saga And as a few of you mentioned above how Ratner's directing credit interrupts Magneto moving the chess piece at the end.

I always hated Cyclop; good for me, he is killed almost at the start.This movie can be entertaining. You can search the plot, or where the intelligence of Magneto has gone. Or you is the guy with the big wings. Or if it is possible to kill good characters in a more lame way.

Recently people who attended press screenings and various critics etc. had given this film a lot of flak which upon viewing this excellent film I can only suppose is due to their dislike of Brett Ratner. I'm not a fan of Brett's previous work but he obviously wanted to stay close to the source material- both the comics and previous films. The film itself is full of wonderful set pieces, fantastic special effects and great acting. James Marsden, who plays a small yet important part gives a great performance as the grief stricken cyclops.All the other actors are excellent including Ellen Page who gives a standout performance as Kitty Pride. The film is the best in the trilogy and combines action and emotion seamlessly. If I had one problem it was the fact that Collusus' hair was silver.

1671,shanatoight85,Nothing done right,4,14 May 2007,"This film by far has been the most disappointing comic book movie to date. The script and Brett Ratner's directing is utterly horrendous. First problem was giving Halle Berry a bigger part because she decided to complain enough times. So they kill Cyclops... well there goes any future X-Men movies including Cable one of the cooler mutants. The Phoenix was done completely wrong when compared to the comic books. Angel played no important role in this film and was just there for a ""wow"" factor. Colossus being one of the original members of the X-Men in the comics still has a very limited part in the film. He doesn't even fight Juggernaut which would have been a sensible battle. No instead Juggernaut fights Kitty Pride whom gets more time in the film than most of the other X-Men. I do give kudos for the line ""I'm the Juggernaut bitch"". At least the film producers listened to that much of the fans. Multiple Man also did absolutely nothing in the film and could have played a much bigger part. The script had so many pun jokes that I was banging my head against the wall of the theater I couldn't not take it anymore. The only thing done right in this film was Beast. Kelsey Grahmar was a perfect pick for the part and his character was presented correctly. Overall a 4/10 for all the reasons listed above.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The other movies were a tad slow and I always thought them kinda over dramatical in that sense, but this one preserved believability at a fast pace. I'll admit I thought X3 was kind of jumpy at the beginning when it jumped between three different time lines in the first few minutes, but it picked itself back up quickly and told a great epic in a solid two hours. I thought my money was well spent and I plan on going to see it a few more times before it leaves the theater.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1673,Freezer654,Newest installment for all those X-men fans out there!!!,9,26 May 2006,"This installment of X-men was a great step in the right direction for this trilogy. With many new characters introduced, the cgi and eye candy are just oozing off the big screen. I might have to say that was my favorite part of the movie! This director definitely did a good job in the area of displaying the characters' mutant powers where the first two movies lacked. I had hoped for a little more character development, but perhaps if/when another movie is released, the newly-introduced characters can be expounded on adding more intensity to the already enthralling story line. Overall, a great movie with near nonstop action and beautiful graphics! Get off of your computer and see it!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1674,bigman1425,What a waste of time!!!,1,27 May 2006,"The great thing about the first two X-men movies was that they contained a sense of realism (in spite of the fantastical concept of super-human mutants). In this new one they completely disregard the universe created in the first two of the series. Also it seemed like they just tried to cram as many mutants into the movie as they could, and there was absolutely no character interaction or development what so ever. This movie is a complete waste of money and Fox should have waited for Bryan Singer to finish with superman before moving ahead with the project without him! P.S. Do you think that fox could have put their logo in the frame any more times? The hole movie was like Fox News propaganda.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1675,post_script,"why, oh why......",5,28 May 2006,"Like most people, I had been HIGHLY anticipating this movie ever since finishing X-Men United. Even when I found out that Bryan Singer was not going to be directing this movie, my hopes for the third installment going out with a bang overshadowed any doubt I had in Ratner. How idealistic my mindset was. How foolish I felt walking out of the theater. I had never felt this angry, and had never been soooooooo disappointed. WHY RATNER WHY, YOU INCOMPETENT FOOL!! The 7.4 rating as of now is complete B.S. This movie does absolutely no justice to the first two Xmen movies. The hour and forty minutes seemed like 4 hours.First off, the story was horribly developed. It seemed forced and there was no fluidity. Not once did I even feel a sense of urgency for the characters.Second, the integration of the plot with the action seemed very ""flipflopish"". It was as if the action was just implemented at the wrong times. The cool CGI just compensated for every long period of bad development.Third, the action itself was not impressive. When I watched the first two installments, I was constantly impressed with how these animated characters came to life in the fighting scenes. The way they manipulated their powers and abilities was smooth and creative. In this third movie, all the action seemed very dry and unmotivated. Ratner relied heavily on the CGI effects other than the creativity Singer incorporated. I remember the scene in the previous movie, the way Magnito escapes the plastic prison by manipulating the iron, and who could forget the NightCrawler (btw, I hate Ratner for not including him in this one) scene in the white-house. Those were done perfect. But NOT ONE SCENE stood out to me in X3, it was just chaos.Fourth, the development of the characters just makes me want to punch Ratner in the face. This movie jumps for one character to another so quick that you don't get a chance to absorb any one of them. It was as if Ratner just wanted to show you a mutant quickly using his/her ability in random parts of the movie without ever ""elaborating"" on the mutant. Even if you already know who the mutant is by just knowledge of the comic, it is still nice to see them develop even just the tiniest bit. Just think of Colossus' development in the 2nd movie, but nowhere near even that.This movie was just flat out very boring. I would give it a 5.5 (since a 5 would put it on the level of white chicks lol) but my disappointment rounds down. I honestly tried hard throughout the movie to enjoy it. But Ratner does not give any benefit of the doubt. I have no doubt that Superman will show what Singer could have done with X3.*********spoiler************ the ending with Magneto that signifies that this movie is not the last stand gives me and other fans of the beloved XMEN a glimmer of hope that Singer will come back to finish it off the right way.********end spoiler********* I really, really hope this movie completely bombs in the box office. It sounds cruel, but we need to give Singer a sure sign to come back.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1676,scharfnyc,Pretty darn good,8,27 May 2006,"Look, this movie wasn't perfect. In this day and age, who can expect a movie to be flawless? But it sure was entertaining. Throughout the movie, I was stimulated on both a raw, emotional level, and an intellectual level. The CGI was masterful, as one would expect, and the story lines, while perhaps overly intricate, were woven together into what I thought was a relatively seamless mosaic.Many people have complained that this movie tried to cram too much material into too short a time. And perhaps the movie would have been better had they cut one of the major story lines. But, like an English paper that attempts to tackle a broad and difficult topic or a gymnast attempting a particularly difficult jump, this movie deserves some leniency for its level of difficulty. It was simultaneously original and true to the comics. It mixed sincerity with cynicism, sorrow with humor, and intellect with action.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I'am not sure if my remark counts as a spoiler (checked it anyway), but the good, clean X-Men fun was spoiled for me when I saw this movie.Awful!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1678,Shabang728,Review of X-Men: The Not-So Last Stand,5,30 May 2006,"X-Men the Last Stand was a highly disappointing installment in the X-Men series. (By the way, when a movie makes $120 million in its first four days, its not the last movie in the series)Brett Ratner took the reigns for this latest X-Men movie and he did an admirable job considering the conditions he was reportedly working on.First off for all avid IMDb users and x-men fans, you may had noticed how 'X-Men 3' took a long time to be officially announced, and then it took an even longer time for the movie to get settled on a director. Bryan Singer did not take kindly to this and promptly left to do Superman Returns. So by the time the studio finally decided on Brett Ratner, he was given 14 months to make a $210 million movie without a script. The studio never gave the filmmakers a chance to make a quality movie (which by the way is not what the studio is after, it is after $), thus Brett Ratner wasn't exactly given a fair shake at this movie. However, a movie must be reviewed by the final product, horror stories about making the film cannot hurt or help the movie.This movie is by no means as bad as fellow comic book movies like the Punisher, Batman and Robin, or the original Superman movies, but its no X2, X-Men, or Batman Begins either. What the movie lacks in heart, substance, character development, and original plot (plot is pretty similar to the first two installments)the movie makes up for in creative action scenes, and spectacular special effects. But what the movies lacks really holds it back from being a good movie, and is instead just a popcorn summer blockbuster that will let down the hearts of true X-Men fans.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1679,sim_rahzel,A very disappointing end to a brilliant franchise,4,26 May 2006,"Simply put, X-Men 3 was the Terminator 3 of the X-men trilogy. So unless you were one of the sh mucks that actually enjoyed that dire film I would recommend you give this one a miss and settle for watching X-Men 2 again.Don't get me wrong - it's not that the film was actively bad. It was just that it failed to be good in any way. The action scenes were uncreative and unimpressive, and despite an abundance of dialogue there was a prevalent lack of chemistry between the characters. The best you can expect from this film is to be occupied for two forgettable hours of your evening.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1680,ryanwicks69,peoples expectations are far too high these days...,9,26 May 2006,"This Film that I saw last night (premier night in the U.K) was fantastic. from start to finish the action and c.g.i's displayed were incredible. it exceeded my expectations and did a credit to the trilogy. However the things that prevented me giving it a 10, were some cheesy 1-liners from a lot of the characters relating to there powers, also I felt it would have been better if the film would have lasted longer. All in all though you cannot, leave the cinema disappointed, with the variety in action and meeting loads of new mutants all with unique powers and coming head to head with other mutants...in all fairness, it makes the fantastic 4 look like a fairytale....If you love action from start to finish, massive actors in Hollywood taking on huge mutant roles, with an English twist and humour thrown in with the legendary vinnie jones you will leave this movie with just one thought in your mind... plllllease can they make a 4th...either that or you'll wish you were a mutant.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1681,midnighttrudger,No Bryan Singer,5,26 May 2006,"Dropped the ball is a huge understatement. Brett Ratner not only dropped the ball but the crushed it completely. If I were producing this movie I would have given Bryan Singer whatever he wanted to make the final movie. Now there were some good parts, but most of them were because the cinematography and the special effects were amazing. There was a chance to really show off the different mutants in this movie but we only really see the main characters that have been in the other two movies. In the trailers you are lead to believe that Angel plays a big part in the movie and he does all of the 15 minutes he is in it. The possibilities for this movie are so vast but after watching it all that I am is frustrated because it wasn't worth staying up for. Instead of being in depth on a few really good plots and sticking with them this movie has a bunch of little plots that circle around one main plot. The whole movie should have been over in 30 minutes but these little plots, some of which were never finished, made the movie impersonal and just stupid.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1682,lordandysimmonds,what have they done to the x men?,5,30 May 2006,the film i had most been looking forward to this year was x-men 3.i was slightly disheartened when singer pulled out of the directors chair but was still confident that a good film could be made!it was only after seeing the film that the world of the x men lay in tatters!too many inconsistencies rear their ugly heads.Juggernaut being the biggest no mention of the fact that he was professor x's half brother were made.or the fact that he wasn't actually a mutant and his powers came from an amulet.the story was all over the place and had too much going on.i gave the film 5/10 only for the fact that iceman finally ices up.Kelsey grammar also gave a magnificent performance as beast I'm glad that they steered clear of too much c.g.i. Isincerly hope that they do an x-men 4 and that it starts with jean grey waking from a coma that she was put into following the alkali lake incident from x2 and says thank god it was just a nightmare!,X-Men - The Last Stand

I feel so frustrated and so cheated.There's a scene in the second movie where Wolverine and Scott start bawling like babies over Jean's death. I've always felt that scene just doesn't work.That's the feeling I got from almost the entire third movie .. it just doesn't work.Of all the things wrong with it, the thing that stands out most is the sheer lack of imagination. There is so much they could have done with this movie .. with characters like these, the possibilities are endless .. and yet, they didn't come up with squat.Do everybody a favor and wait for it to hit video.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1684,blanata1,It could have been AMAZING if....,6,28 May 2006,"This movie was action pack, lots of great special effects, but it could have been better if they just made it longer and expanded some scenes and characters. So many scenes from the trailer were not included in the movie. There were a lot of characters in this movie that felt incomplete.Rogue- Huge character development for her in X1 and X2, but what the hell happened here? The cure was a huge part of this movie and she wanted it more than anyone yet they gave her like 7 minutes on screen.The love triangle- I thought there was going to be a love triangle between Kitty, Rogue, and Bobby. Yeah, they gave hints to it in this movie, but nothing really big happened. I would have like to have seen more on this.Mystique- Coolest character by far yeah she gets cut off early. I kinda can understand that for the purpose of introducing new characters but none of the new characters are ever really explained like Juggernaut. I mean seriously it wouldn't have taken that long to explain some stuff about him.It seems like they made several cuts to the movie which I think took away from what made X1 and X2 so good. The first two movies had a nice flow with the right amount of character development. This movie seemed to fly by. Only a few characters got to really develop.So, if you want to see a high action film then this is for you, but if you're a fan of the old films you may come out disappointed.",X-Men - The Last Stand

(Word of advice, don't buy a large soda.) It had everything, action, suspense, a little comedy and the thing that's been missing from all the latest release. A GREAT SCRIPT!! An awesome story with Amazing characters. I loved it and would see it again. Probably will sometime soon too. ;)I look forward to seeing where they take Wolverine from here. I will always enjoy Hugh Jackman and his performance was outstanding. This was the role that made him famous and I love that he owned up to it. It was also great that the director FINALLY gave us fans some things that we wanted to see! Some aspects of the comic book as well as the characters themselves that were held back from the first two films.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1686,Silver_Toxin,Don't Get Your Hopes Up,4,4 November 2006,"Pretty shoddy movie... I mean, compared to most other movies, it's golden. Decent script, great actors, the whole works. But because it's a sequel it MUST be judged based on the two X-Men movies that came before it, and sadly, it just doesn't hold water. It's 80% the director's fault. At one point, he had literally crammed over 100 GENERIC mutants onto the screen. I mean, what's the point? It's not a contest to see how many cameos you can pull off in the allotted time. Give these people some back-story! Hell, give them some POWERS. And X3 definitely had the most hackneyed one-liners in it... I mean, it's sad that cliché make-you-sigh one-liners is pretty much the norm for mainstream comic-book movies (with Batman Begins as a possible exception to that rule), but they weren't even trying to hold back...It's definitely an interesting story, it definitely has an amazing cast, and it's definitely worth seeing. I'm judging it harshly because I had come to expect near-flawlessness from the first two X-Men movies--stories that kept me on the edge of my seat, engaging dialogue, etc... Instead what I got was a half-baked ""well, let's finish cashing in on this cash-cow""-style movie, which was quite frustrating.So, rent it... but don't get your hopes up.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1687,seiji_001,"See it if you've got the cash and time, otherwise, wait for a rental.",5,28 May 2006,"The movie was entertaining in a ""I just wasted two hours?"" kind-of-way, but at the same time, it leaves that ""I just wasted two hours!"" bitter after-taste. As a matter of fact, that after-taste is really what sticks with ya.X-Men: The Last Stand lacks everything that made the first two films awesome to watch. You really can't feel anything for the characters this time around, or rather, you're just not allowed to. On top of that, the pacing was horrible, and the dialog cheesy. The opening sequence had me wincing a bit! Deaths in the film came left and right without warning, and without consequence. They were all dealt with in such a way that people in the audience were laughing! Probably the most dramatic death in the film yielded cackling from all around. The reactions from the characters, aside from a quick funeral scene that feels very out of place, are also (unsurprisingly?) absent and as said, lack any consequence. They might as well not even put them in the movie! Almost all of the scenes felt out of place. If you've seen the several-minutes-long preview of the film, then you have an idea of how the film was edited. Very choppy, jumping around all over. There was just no clear, concise, smooth transaction between scenes. It's like counting to 10 and saying 7, 8, 9 before 3.The only saving grace of the film was Sir Ian McKellen. I love the man, and he did a wonderful job with what he was given. I was also pleasantly surprised with Kelsey Grammar as Beast. Halle Berry, though, was cringe-worthy. I'm not sure if it was her, or just how her character was written. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume it was the latter. Patrick Stewart was also given some very poor lines, in my opinion. Delivery was great, but the script? Hm.One other victory point that the film wins with me is the inclusion of an internet meme involving a re-dubbing of an X-Men cartoon episode with the line, ""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!"" uttered. Hilarious! I also have to hand it over to the digital fx team; they did a great job. The action sequences were also fairly entertaining to watch, especially during the climactic battle.All in all, see it if you have the time and spare cash. Otherwise, it won't hurt you to wait for the DVD. To rent.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1688,skaboarder151,Pretty much what I expected,7,26 May 2006,"After watching the first two X-men films from Bryan Singer, I questioned whether or not Rush Hour director Brett Ratner would be able to deliver in the third installment. I saw the midnight showing at the local theater with a crowd of X-men fanatics who all seemed to enjoy the movie. While there were high points to the film, i felt like half of it was missing. Ratner did a good job of maintaining the style of the X-men films, he goes in depth with a few characters, but forgets many of the others, good effects, etc. However, the film was far too short for me. They rushed through the first act trying to catch you up on all that had happened to give a good back story, but also to prepare you for the rest of the film. I found a few lines of dialog to be quite cheesy as well. In the end, this was a decent attempt at finishing off the trilogy of X-men films.

First off they could've't put this movie into 2 parts first the unleashing of the pheonix as JeanGrey and then the resolution, the movie was the shortest of the 3 though it need more time for explanations!! They introduce tons of mutant including Angel who had 4 lines, and was never explained how he really was or what he could do besides fly..And don't get me started on the deaths they killed of Professer and Jean and not to mention Cyclops who got killed of 10 MINUTES in to the MOVIE!!!! I know that's not how the comic books went which leads me to ask if they didn't want another sequel coudn't they have just showed how the war ended. I mean Cycloips did a lot more in the series where's his going to Europe? Or Jean the Pheonix wasn't Jean it was released? And what about Cable? You had to show Cable before Cyclops dies? Honestly the only thing that kept me in the the theater was the funny lines and Storm and of course curiosity of what would happen next, also wondering if Rogue would have really given up her powers which she did!

There is no Jubilee! And they should be wearing their costumes that they wore in the cartoons, don't you think?! But all in all it's a good film, Oh and when the film ends, DO NOT leave!

1692,sharkey_98,Ratner Proves He Can't Direct,2,26 May 2006,"We all went and saw X-3 last night and tragically, my girlfriend was the only person who actually enjoyed the flick. I spent most of the movie holding my head in my hands as Brett Ratner personally took a sh*t on the franchise, just as I thought he would. I won't get into anything spoilerrific here, but I'll break down some thoughts on the flick in general fashion. Here's what I thought sucked: 1. The drama. Only someone as untalented as Brett Ratner can make me not give a sh*t when such dramatic and possibly tear-jerking events happen. There are at least four huge moments in the script that are supposed to shock and create an emotional response in the audience... I just sat through them wondering if they were a joke. In fact, during one scene at Jean Grey's home (if you've seen it, you know the scene I'm referring to) something very important happens, and I literally thought that it was going to wind up being some sort of dream sequence, or trick to fool the audience. Not because I didn't want it to happen, but because it was done so poorly. There seemed to be no setup, no reasoning behind it, and no purpose for it in the movie whatsoever. Dramatic devices with no payoff make for a bad film.2. The characters. It seems like Ratner spent about five minutes on each new character, and that was it. Rogue was in the movie for what, three scenes? And what happens with her at the end of the movie was tacked on, like they realized at the last minute ""oh sh*t, right, we forgot about her."" And how about Angel? They feature him prominently in the trailers, but he's in three f-ing scenes as an adult that I can remember. He may as well have not been in the movie whatsoever. They didn't even resolve his conflict with his father, not that the story had been established enough to make me care in the first place.Then you've got Leech. A profoundly tragic figure, being utilized to knock out the powers of his fellow mutants all the while being forced to sit and stare as these amazing things happen outside his window. But do we ever get an ounce of character development beyond him putting his hand on the glass and looking sad? No. Why bother, we've got 8 other new characters to not develop properly. Let's move along.3. Jean/Phoenix. If you're going to make the movie about Jean Grey, and her completely rewritten backstory... how about putting her in the f-ing film!?!? If they were going to paint the picture of a tragic backstory of a character, it should have been Wolverine or Storm considering they were the only mutants besides Magneto that had any kind of decent screen time.4. The stunt work. I'm nitpicking now, but all of the wirework looked ridiculous. Every time Storm flew and did her spinny bullsh*t, or Beast leapt through the air, I laughed.It seems like Ratner was more interested in giving fanboys a bunch of wet-dreamlike moments (fastball special, stars-and-garters, Iceman's...iceness) rather than spending time on the actual plot. Not to mention the fact that he was developing about 8 different plots, and didn't give proper time to a single one of them. You've got Jean's story, Warren's decision to stay a mutant, Rogue's difficulties with Iceman, The team's inability to work together effectively (this lasted a minute, and was brought back at the very end), Leech and his sad existence, Storm being groomed as the new leader, the future of the school, Cyclops and his struggles... it's just too f-ing much. All of these seemingly major plot devices are pared down to about ten minutes apiece and served up like a dinner comprised entirely of appetizers.I'm sure a lot of you liked the mindless fun and action, and more power to you. I'm glad somebody liked it. But the fact of the matter is, this film did a lot of bad things for the franchise, and I frankly hope that they end it with this film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1693,i_hate_ben15,X-men- What a Movie,9,26 May 2006,"I just watched this movie yesterday and was soooo happy!!!!! I thought that it was the best of the three movie for a number of reasons. Firstly they managed to introduce a lot of new characters without confusing people. They didn't go into their backgrounds and stuff, they were just other mutants, which was cool to see. Although any future x-men movies must now be careful not to include any mutants that were killed in this one!!!! I thought that Wolverine and Jean were amazing in this one. I had always been a little unsure about Hugh Jackman, I never felt he had that Wolverine Edge, MAN WAS I WRONG. His scene with Jean is one of the most intense scenes i have ever seen. I thought all the young actors did really nice jobs, especially Kitty Pride and I also felt that although Vinnie is not the greatest actor in the world, he also did a good Job on Juggernaught. All in all this film is the best comic book movie ever, and i say that without exaggeration. If you have not seen it, go now!!!!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1694,sirilu,"Why so blue, panda-bear?",5,27 May 2006,"This movie really was way too caught up in itself.

I'm an open person when it comes to film adaptations (hey, I thoroughly enjoyed Spiderman even though he doesn't make a single wisecrack while webslinging through the city), but this was just ridiculous.The film really does JUMP THE SHARK, and jump it early. The characters were hardly redeemable, either: they were all hollow. There were several huge, depressing scenes involving main characters that left me going ""bleh."" If you're looking for an action flick with pretty lights and fighty-sounds every 25 minutes, go on, bring eight bucks to the theater to watch this. If you're a comic/toon fan of X-Men, I'd advise you to stay away: don't let this movie ruin the first two installments for you.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1695,TychoRyan,"A travesty, not worthy of its predecessors",4,26 May 2006,"As a fan of both the comics and the previous two movies, i must say that this film is a travesty of American cinema. Gone is the great storyline with layers of subtle social-political messages, gone are great performances by Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellan, gone are the great action scenes that keep the audience at the edge of their seats.Brett ratner, you ended the series with a whimper.Summary *don't read if you want the movie to surprise you*: Magneto declares war onhumanity because of a newly developed cure for mutation. Meanwhile, Jean Grey returns and goes absolutely crazy, killing much needed characters within the first 25 minutes of the movie and without much explanation as to why her powers force her to do this. Magneto and her team up (well, she just follows him around and does nothing but stand in place until he's been defeated), to create the ""ultimate team"" of evil mutants on the mission to destroy humanity.The film goes by so fast that you can't even absorb what's going on. A character dies, then BAM on to the next subject and/or fight scene. There's no character development, something the other two were so good at. Where are the moral struggles that the characters face? I would say that this is just like Fantastic 4, because the diologue style and lack of any good point is similar, but X3 is much worse. The Pheonix is extremely overlooked, wating until the last minute for a scene of chaos and destruction that finally got my pulse to stop flatlining. unfortunately that scene lasts only about a minute and a half. This epic ""goddess"" (which is what magneto calls her) doesn't have any role in the ""last stand"" of the title or even any relevance to trhe plot. Jean Grey has become as useless as a poopy-flavored lollypop, and that's really too bad.Apparently people like this movie. I can't understand why. It reeks of sub-par, typical Hollywood superhero crap from the 80's, where people don't care about acting, story, relevance, or even entertainment value. In the entire movie, only one moment made me smile: Vinnie Jones as the Juggernaut, and his line to Kittie Pryde when she sticks him in the floor (""i'm the juggernaut, b****!!!""). It was a great homage to the fan-made Juggernaut dub-over video found on the internet, and it was tear-inducingly hilarious. That, and one short scene where magnete destroys a cavalcade of cars to rescue mystique, give this movie any stars at all from me, because this mindless ""action"" movie threw away a perfect, winning formula that Brian Singer created in the first two films. We CARED about those characters, we CARED when Jean ""died"" there, we CARED about what happened during the action sequences because they were filmed and choreographed so damn well.

Too much tries to happen in this film and there is very little character development. The action scenes are top notch though, the musical score is decent and so are the sound effects. Visually, the film is very good. For fans of the comics and original X-Men mythology, it is as if whoever wrote the script took a pile of the original comics, lit them on fire and wrote his own thing. As a film on its own, there's too much story going on. Of the three X-Men films, this one is the worse, but it is still a decent film worth seeing to complete the trilogy. Make sure you stick around for a scene following the credits.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1697,sameermir1980,It's X-Men with the brains sucked out *SPOILERS*,5,25 May 2006,"Lower your expectations, now lower them again, and now one more time, Now you're at the level where the film might meet your expectations. Let me clarify first of all the I have never read the comics so I can only compare this movie to the first two. To say that I am disappointed would be an understatement, I wasn't expecting much from Ratner but my god I was expecting more than I got. People have commented that this movie sacrifices its story for more action but I struggle to see how it has more than X2. I'm struggling to remember any of the fight sequences in the movie, it just seemed to be a mass of people fighting and dying with me not caring. There is absolutely no emotional connection with the characters apart from maybe Magneto, I can't believe I have just watched an X-Men movie. We were spoilt with the 1st two, where they built up each scene, X3 just rushes through as if it was directed by a teenager doing a media studies assignment. Ratner clearly does not understand what the whole story is about, maybe because he is from such a privileged background?The only reason I give it 5 stars is because I have seen worse movies and to give it less would give the others more credence.It's shame that this franchise has gone the way of the Terminator and Alien movies. If I had a single wish now it would be for Fox to bin this and bring back Singer to remake the whole thing. Ratner needs to stay away from making movies he has no idea about, I feel I could have made a better movie than he has.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1698,rjallan-2,"Disappointing, shallow effort.",6,26 May 2006,"I was surprised by how this movie just doesn't hold up. Lots of small, and shallow bits of plot leading up to the inevitable fight. There was no depth anywhere, formulaic and without a single twist that couldn't be seen a mile off. It felt more like a collection of cut-scenes in a video game. Angel came, and went. Didn't need to be there, and without any character development we were given no reason to care if he was, or wasn't. Ratner showed in various interviews that he didn't really understand (care about?) the actual franchise, and it showed.CGI was pretty and the opening X/Magneto/Jean scene worked really well though.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I thought, generally, preview screenings happened maybe a couple of day or two before opening night, not 8 days before..... I'm in Australia and I'm off to see it in a couple of days myself (hoping for good things, obviously). Whoever posted the mini-review seems to have 5 friends who have also seen the film and voted already. What's up with that? Maybe the voting system on IMDb should do some sort of check to see if a film's actually been RELEASED before it accepts votes? (like THAT'D ever happen).

1700,ltera001,different. but good.,9,30 May 2006,"I really really enjoyed it.I mean... the concept, WAR, was the focus of the film and they did it well. With any movie that has chaos and OMG FIGHT CHAOS as the big climax, and I do mean almost ANY movie, then yeah.. sadly, character and story development take a huge backseat. It upset me, but because I'm a sucker for the latter two!With all that said, I appreciate what the movie went out to do. Yea, I was upset that:a. it went by FAST b. Cyclops and Xavier just.. vanish c. some things were never given time to be explained (see a)but you know what.. this was a time of panic, and chaos, and because of that, this movie did a good job of portraying exactly that. Props for the endings too. The Magneto ending and Xavier surprise definitely made me feel better about the deaths and results of the film.Good movie. Each one was quite different from the others in the series.. but man, I wish this one was given more time. Go see this film, it will still psych you out!",X-Men - The Last Stand

I mean, i love the 1 st two, it was great but the 3rd one just disappoint me. It hype around showing Angel/warren Warthington III but only have four scenes of him and i can even memorized the line after just 7 hours watching it. Cyclops dead and so does Prof. Xavier. What the hell?Well i can't blame the director only, the scriptwriters done an awful job and FOX FOX FOX, if only you people have patience and wait for Bryan Singer to finish Superman up, this could turn out to be one of the greatest superheroes movie. Where's the Phoenix, the bird, the flaming bird? That's all i can say. I can't say the whole thing out. Can't really portrayed how disappointed i am. I've been watching X-men cartoon since i was 6 or 7 yrs old(19 now), there's no Gambit and so little i mean very very little of Jubilee. I love those 2 characters in the cartoon.Wish Singer could re-do the movie. It could have been 2 hours movie than 1 and half hours.

1703,kapura,Wack,3,27 May 2006,"Disappointing. I wanted my money back. They had so many possible ways to go and did nothing with it. What was Angel's purpose? The dialogue was corny as hell. The final scene when Logan says ""I love you"" is not convincing at all. Why did they kill of Cyclops? He made the character of Wolverine better by making it closer to the comics. He's the straight edge guy and has to keep Wolverine in check. Instead, Wolverine became the straight shooting pansy. It seems as though that the sole purpose of making this film was to make money on opening night. Unfortunately, if you are reading this while contemplating whether or not you should watch the film, I advise you: please save your money. As a big fan of the first two films, this one does not stack up to them at all. The script sounds pieced together with just two many corny one-liners by every character, especially Wolverine and Professor X. I could go on for a lot longer like I did with other disappointed fans on opening night, but it's not worth my time to comment any more on this film. In fact, I can soundly say that watching this film was not worth my time.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1704,Graffiti_on_TheRisingSun,Ratner turns X-Men 3 into just another crappy comic movie,3,28 May 2006,"I loved the first two X-Men movies. The best thing about them was that they both took themselves seriously, and while having people who can control fire and shoot lasers out of their eyes, the characters still seemed like real people and the plots were believable. X-Men: The Last Stand undoes everything that was so masterfully done in those films. Rather then intelligent and dramatic character development, Brett Ratner opts for special effects that were a lot more impressive back in 1999. Although I can see from some reviews that people are still amazed by big things being lifted up in the air and fire balls.Of course, the substitute we're given for the drama of the first two movies is lots of major deaths. But, like the death of Elektra in Daredevil, they're essentially just a cheap way of keeping the audience fooled that something interesting is going on, when the truth is the exact opposite. Thrown in there also is a convoluted love story that goes nowhere and a bunch of new mutants that do nothing. Recognisable faces such as Angel and Juggernaut are comparable to the Q gadgets given to James Bond; they don't really serve any purpose except to do exactly the right thing at exactly the right moment, and then be forgotten.Furtheremore, while there is certainly a lot of action in the film, it fails to be what trailers promised it to be. It might just be me, but I expected there to be all-out warfare between man and mutant, chaos in the streets, superpowered armies clashing for each's survival. Instead, the climax is a fight between a few dozen mutants and soldiers on an island. No character development, boring drama, bad action. Sounds like a run-of-the-mill comicbook movie to me.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1705,saddlesoap1,What the...?,4,9 June 2006,"If I hadn't read the comics and knew nothing about X-Men, this would have been a pretty good movie. But since I do know things about the comics... WHAT THE HELL?! I'm sorry, is the Phoenix thing really that hard for the directors and writers to grasp? Because back when I was nine and first started watching the show on FoxKids and then got into the comics, I did pretty well with it! Dual personalities...not quite. Jean doesn't have them; Phoenix does. Separate entities. Not that hard, people!! All I can say is...I hope there's another movie and I hope they fix it. And...I just liked it better in the comics. So not only does my favorite character have to die, not once, but twice, they can't even pull it off right? Urgh.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1706,aubade_lancs,X-cruciating!,2,4 June 2006,"In film, seeing the dreaded digit three in the opening credits of your movie more often than not means very bad things are about to unfold before your eyes. Being the third child of a franchise just ain't easy. Just think of the tertiary tat that was the third Jurassic Park, Jaws, Terminator or Star Wars, to name but a few. Simply put, third films suck, Yet, like a moron, I always forgive and forget. I went into this one with the usual wide-eyed optimism. It's X-Men, it's the end of the trilogy, it's gonna be awesome! It was shite.Incoming Director Bret ""I'm not Bryan Singer"" Shitner seems simply overwhelmed by both the legacy of the franchise he is expected to bring to a climax and also, rather depressingly, the ensemble cast of players he has been left to shuffle the pack with. Character arcs built over the previous 200 minutes of mutant movie menagerie are either dealt with in an excruciatingly inept manner (Cyclops take off your glasses! Oops...) or simply ignored altogether. Worst off surely must be Halle Berry. She is like a $10 million dollar extra. With her perma-angst expression and a nonsensical rivalry with some random Asian chick (all Asian people in this movie are evil by the way) she seems to serve no other purpose than to occasionally flare her nostrils vacuously until the inevitable final-reel slap-down. Running her close is Paquin's Rogue, contending with the ideological theme of the movie, the idea that her genetic gift could in fact be a curse. In her particular case this means having the touch of death, something she seems to have passed onto everyone else involved in the movie. She disappears for ninety minutes, turning up only in the last few minutes of the film. I wish I could have joined her. Only Ian McKellan seems to realise the sheer turgid banality of the enterprise he is contractually obliged to endure, mugging in true pantomime dame fashion throughout his few brief appearances and being about the only entertaining aspect of this otherwise risible, rotten piece of mutant, celluloid drivel.X-ceptionally X-cruciatingly average in every conceivable way! Avoid at all costs.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1707,kid_naste,X-Men: The Worst Stand,1,28 May 2006,"I am twenty-seven years old and I have collected the X-Men comics my entire life, and hearing what I had heard about this movie made me very angry. But, I still had to see this movie for myself because above all else, I am an X-Men fan true to the bone.I already knew that my favorite X-Man, Cyclops, was going to die but I had to believe that Brett Ratner, of whom I do like, could somehow make this movie good. Afterall, I know that comic continuity just really isn't possible when adapted to the big screen. That said, there could have been just a little bit of resemblance to what happened in the comics! First of all, if you don't like Wolverine or Storm, then don't go see this movie, because 85% is them. If you like Cyclops or Professor X, they die. If you thought that you were going to see the Phoenix, you don't. What they pass as the Phoenix is nothing like the Phoenix in the comics.I mean, when did the Phoenix get all dead looking when she used her powers? Oh, and somehow the Phoenix is just a split personality of Jean Grey, not a separate entity. Also, unlike the comics, the Phoenix seems to be really easy when it comes to the guys because she jumped Wolverine in 2.2 seconds. Way to mourn your husband. I seem to remember that the Phoenix was in love with Scott Summers, and that is how they beat her the first time. Wolverine did not do the killing. Whatever.Speaking of Wolverine, I will go on record by saying that I hate the character. Unless he's written by Joss Whedon. Wolverine is the most over hyped comic character other than Batman that I know of. But, I do like Hugh Jackman, and I actually kind of like the movie version of Wolverine. Well, I did until this movie. All the guy did was cry and moan. ""I love you,"" he says as he kills Jean. Love? Dude, you barely even know her. Is it just me, or has his healing factor gone to Hulk levels, because he was regenerating way too fast at the end when his skin was burning off. I remember the Punisher shooting him in the face with a shotgun, and it didn't grow back until the next issue.I know, I know, this isn't the comics. I understand that, but where was it a well done plot to kill off the original X-Man and and the Professor? You give a girl some purple hair and you call her Psylocke? She didn't even have the right powers, not to mention at that age she still would have been British! Rogue and Magneto lose their powers. I have to say, the most heart breaking part was at the end when Magneto was playing chess by himself with no Xavier. Poor guy. I think Magneto should turn his hate away from the human race and go after FOX Studios. They're the real bad guys.In the span of one year, FOX has killed off my favorite characters in X-Men and on my used to be favorite TV show, 24. The only good thing I can think of about FOX anymore is that they still show Nascar. I'm sure if they could kill somebody off on that for ratings, they would do that to.What really irritates me is that the X-Men franchise could have gone on forever. There are countless stories and characters. But, no. FOX got mad at Brian Singer and threw a childish fit and rushed this movie out just to get out before Superman Returns. So we got a sub-par movie that was released way to soon. Just look at Colossus compared to in X-2. Quite frankly, I think he looked really bad. And don't even get me started on how bad Juggernaut looked. What was FOX thinking? There is no way X-Men was going to do better than Superman. It's freaking Superman! I don't even like Superman and I can tell you that. So we get a rushed movie that included zero character development, as many cameos as possible, and some 'shocking' deaths. Yay. And what about those plastic guns the military was using. If you look closely, they have Hasbro written on them.I know most people are saying they liked this movie, and that's fine. I'm not going to tell you what to do because I believe everyone is their own person. There was five of us that went to see this and only my girlfriend and I hated it. But that's why I'm with her. She feels my pain. The movie did have its good points. I liked it when Iceman 'iced' up, it was cool seeing the Beast throw down, and Cyclops' motorcycle was sweet. But that's about it for me.I would like to say, that I'm not blaming Brett Ratner. He did what he could. And I will also say that he did leave it open for characters that died to come back, and there's no evidence that the mutant cure is forever lasting. We all know that after the credits that Professor X was in a new body, and we never actually saw Cyclops die. Of course, Jean may be dead, but she never stays dead. My point being that most of what happened in this movie can be fixed, as long as Marvel takes this movie back home and makes a sequel themselves.In closing, I don't suggest you go see this movie, but you have to judge for yourself. You'll either love it or hate it. If you hate it, you can do like I did and drop your ticket in the toilet and show it how you feel about it, if you know what I mean.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1708,arjelle,Wrong director?!,5,11 July 2006,"As a fan of the comic book series, I was very curious how the new director would do the job of directing X3. Would he do a hell of a job as Brian Singer did with the first two X'es. But as I expected of the director of the Rush Hour movies, he made a mediocre movie. The Last Stand storyline is a chance to make a great movie. When it was published in the comic book it was absolutely one of the high -lights in the comic book world. It saved Marvel. I think as Brian Singer would have been the director,he would have made a movie with as much of an impact as the comics. But with Brett Ratner it's a mediocre movie, with some above average Efx, but that's it. Enjoyable on the couch at home with some popcorn, not in the theater.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Ratner's made an ungodly mess of the most exciting superhero franchise around. What's the goddamn hurry anyway? Why rush everything and then skid into a climactic action sequence that simply fails to grab you? Characters and good potential plot lines simply fail to develop and even the ones that debut well simply have no time to sink claws, mitts or anything in before they're gone. Bryan Singer's intelligent, steady and superbly hyper-kinetic style is badly missed. The scriptwriters need to be tonked too. And the last scene!? El cheapo maaan. X-Men RIP.

As a livid fan of the comic books, though, I have to say that I was disappointed.First of all, the film was far too short. Many characters were left undeveloped, and I couldn't help but feel kind of ripped off in that category. There are too many mutants and not enough explanation as to who they were. Only readers of the comics would have recognized some of the mutants who popped up, and even then it takes some thought.Some of the basic principles and values that were in the comics are also missing, which come from the understanding of characters and the empathy you develop. Sure there were some sad parts in the movie, but I didn't *feel* the characters in the movie.The action in the movie was great, with the occasional dash of weird humour or comic-style oddness. The music was so close to being perfect too (it was the sound balance that was off).Overall, though, great fun to watch. Just don't think too much.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1712,offroadinfrontier,Childhood Dreams Completely Obliterated (Rant-Review),1,3 June 2006,"I can't stress how terrible this movie is... so taking it from a non-comic fan, or at least trying to, here we go.OK, so the director must have sat back and said, ""how many different ways can we destroy a character?"" because let me tell you, all character development in the first and second films were tossed out the window when the script was written for this rubble.Xavier's 'character' displayed traits that are on a polar opposite of the character in the first two films (further regarded as ITF2F). Since when did he ever show fear or anger? He blames Wolverine for freeing Jean, and guilt trips her over Cyclopse. And since when did psychic powers and lust, desire, etc. run hand-in-hand?Cyclopse had about 10 minutes of screen life.Jean - poor Famke Janssen's character , who did a terrific performance portraying Marvel Girl ITF2F, after the roughly 100 minutes of my childhood destroyed, she ate (or... something) her husband, killed Xavier, teased Magneto's powers, then sat back, while she's referred to blatantly as a weapon, and did nothing. And since when did desire lead to evil? Her endless powers could have been used a bit more creatively.Magneto shows an acute sense of metal, AND lack-of, ITF2F. He can feel Wolverine out of a crowd of hundreds without batting an eye, yet he can't sense that a bunch of loaded guns lack any metal! During the 'last stand,' Colossus and Wolverine attack him, while he's watching. They were both covered in metal, and he waits to act until almost gutted by Wolverine.Rogue, always showed a bit of resentment for her powers. It's not too far-fetched to see her give them up willingly, but it still sucks, and throws another main character out the window.Storm - excuse me, Halle Berry - should have stayed a background character. Bluntly put, her acting sucked. She overacted in just about every scene. And could her threat to leave the film be any more apparent? Storm is third in line, and somehow in 15 movie-minutes, she's running the entire Mansion/X-Men. Plus, the final battle, she shoots lightning from her hands. The problem; Storm controls the weather; she doesn't projectile-vomit from it from her body! She's as sensitive to physics as anyone else.Wolverine - ITF2F, and as much as he could in the last film, Hugh Jackman has shown us all a Wolverine that not many could fault. Of course, like all characters in this crud, he was given a batch of sour lines and tamed down away from his wild nature. And we all (18+) could have hoped for a better (or worse) rating and maybe a little more 'fighting' with Jean in the subbasement... or was that just me?What was with the Angel scene? Was anyone else bothered by how flashy and overdone it was? The terrible lighting effect was a little out of place, since all he did was run away. The effect was almost holy.Now, I will admit the special effects were pretty cool. Of course, in American culture, a movie lacking in this category is instantly put on the Indie shelf.The US government is flakier in this movie than in real life, and I didn't think that possible. Not to mention, the President completely ignores a US Gov't worker being strangled. 'We don't hate mutants! This FDA-approved vaccine is not government funded!' Oh, wait, the last battle is over, so everyone's at peace, because it's over after One 10 Minute Battle, right?The biggest let-down in this film is the lack-of Phoenix. Given, the movies don't follow the comics accurately, but the end of the second movie did foreshadow fire in the lake. Come on... Give us the Phoenix, not some lusty, beady-eyed, dark witch from some forgotten fantasy flick.I'm not going to even bother spilling out the ways in which this movie screwed up the characters via the comics. Except for... How can you Kill Xavier, as well as Jean and Cyclopse? And taking away Magneto's powers? Obviously, this was where they wanted the movies to end.TF2F don't accurately portray the comics, but I absolutely loved the direction they took with the X-Men. Dare I say they 'Modernized' the X-Men? More were brought into the X-Men world for it, but the last movie ruined the works of TF2FThe part where Magneto moves the chess piece a bit and the scene after the credits have to be there to keep people happy. A fourth one of this caliber can't truly be produced, can it?",X-Men - The Last Stand

Brett Ratner is a true genius to compose such a work of perfectly awful performances by such a talented group of actors.

I also thought Bryan Singer did an excellent job with the first two films. They were both accessible to fans of the comic and newcomers to the franchise. Bratt Ratner didn't do a bad job, however I think he tried a bit to hard to make a great movie, so we got a good one instead. There were too many mutants!!!! It was very difficult to keep track of everyone on screen. James Marsden and Anna PAquin were reduced to almost cameo roles, and new mutants like Shawdowcat and Collosus were not given enough time to establish themselves as major players. The movie did however keep the excellent underlying social issues the X-men comics/movies have dealt with. Issues of Racism, homosexuality etc in the film.

1715,blueguy-1,Shockingly bad,1,28 May 2006,"I couldn't believe what I was watching. This movie is the realization of all of the fears that people who both love(d) the books and are willing to accept that sometimes good comics make bad movies were afraid of. In addition to what I'd consider sub-par effects (shots of angel in flight looked like a bad joke), poor cinematography (far too many posed shots of groups of characters in formation) and poorly thought out ideas from the art department (really poor costuming on the villains... and what gave with magneto's suit in the beginning?) there was virtually no character development after the first two minutes of the movie and events more or less had nothing to do with one another. Somewhere someone decided to shirk their responsibility to any semblance of believability or emotional content in these movies and the result was a soup of meaningless, weird face off battle sequences and an all around disappointing ending. The high point of this film for me was when somebody in the theater with me gave a Quagmire-esquire ""kinkity kinkity kinkity"" during one of the out-of-left-field romantic sequences, and somehow I don't think that that one's gonna make the DVD release.

It's enjoyable as it is, and if they make a 4th one it will be even more awesome. The special effects were spectacular, the final showdown was cool, and watching all the mutants with different powers was great too.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1719,warden_dios,Fun!!,9,24 May 2006,"Just saw X-Men: The Last Stand, and I have to say that I loved what I saw. I've read the comics and saw the cartoon growing up, and have always been a fan of the franchise, and am glad the third movie introduced the characters it did, and faithfully. Seeing Angel unfold his wings for the first time got me grinning, as did the introduction of Juggernaut.The change of director had me worried before I saw the movie, but were partly put to rest after seeing it. I'm not saying it was bad in any way, but it felt a little on the short side. I've got a feeling that will change when it comes out on DVD in some kind of extended cut.All the returning characters were played by the same actors, which helped keep the feeling of continuity in place. I'm especially pleased that both Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman returned to their roles. The new actors filled their roles well, with Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut fitting extraordinarily as Juggernaut.As to whether this really IS the last X-Men movie or not, I can say, without spoiling anything, that the sequel door was left wide open. I just hope any more X-Men keep the same excellence the first three expelled.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1720,donpepei,Let me direct the next one.,4,12 June 2006,"It's like they decided to start filming while they were halfway through with the first draft of the script.Brett Ratner not only ruined this movie, he ruined the next one as well. By randomly killing off or debilitating his characters, he assured that the next movie will have to spend at least thirty minutes showing us everyone standing around with surprised looks on their faces. ""Dr. X is alive? Oh sh*t!"" ""Cyclops is alive? Oh sh*t!"" ""Magneto has his powers back? Oh sh*t!"" There is a lot about this movie that Brett Ratner didn't screw up. But I feel sooooo betrayed. I love this franchise so much. I saw the first two movies just dying when they were over because I wanted to see more. But this one was painful to sit through. I know Halle Berry is a big star, but her character isn't THAT interesting. I mean, when I go to watch a superhero movie, I understand that I'm agreeing to sit through a bit of speechifying, but this was ridiculous. Plus I was never clear what they were fighting for. Why was it so important to have that huge unsubtle brawl at the end? They were so concerned about saving that little bald kid's life that they killed a whole hell of a lot of people. They were like, ""We have to protect this facility...that exists to destroy us mutants."" I was so rooting for Magneto in this movie. Anyway, I still give it a four because of some cool action sequences and because the franchise is so great that Ratner couldn't entirely f*ck it up.

1722,1mperial,"Unfaithful, Ill-conceived, Preposterous",5,25 May 2006,"**This contains very minor spoilers** I was really very excited for this movie, but having seen footage of the Danger Room sequence at the beginning I didn't have very high hopes. If you've seen this scene, you can pretty much apply that to the whole movie. It contains cheesy dialog, sub-par performances (despite good actors), a horrible plot, but worst of all: it completely fails to represent the characters as they are in the comics or other movies. Magneto is a horrible strategist in the film- he doesn't care when other mutants are lost. Wolverine is completely out of character, the Pheonix Force makes Jean look undead rather than- you know- like a pheonix (I didn't see any flames), Juggernaut is a joke, Callisto is reduced to a poor man's Quicksilver (the super speed looks like it's from Smallville). In the final battle, most of the mutants there (Magneto!) could easily win the fight in an instant but instead use their powers in the most inefficient way possible: Magneto and Pyro ""team up"" to launch flaming cars at the enemy. Magneto could easily tear up a car and shoot everyone with a chunk of it, while pyro could BURN THEM. All the time spent on this movie went into thinking up the coolest special effects possible, and that failed too. It's not that I couldn't get past the bad plot, it was that the effects were tied to the plot in a sickening way. Throughout the whole move I was thinking, ""Singer, where art thou"". The best part of the movie- and I REALLY hate to say it- was the new Superman Returns trailer at the beginning. He gets shot in the eye slo-mo and it bounces right off!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1723,alster-4,Ratner Strikes Again,2,25 May 2006,"I'm sorry to say that Brett Ratner has done for the X-Men franchise what Joel Schumacher did for Batman. You can have great production values, special effects, sound, and a whole bunch of excellent actors; but without at least a half decent script, it just adds up to a nice looking noisy commercial for action figures. The basic story of X-Men 3 could easily have made for a much better film. All the key elements were there but I suspect they were left as bullet points on the production notes rather than developed into a script. The characters we once loved in Singer's films now just come across as two dimensional puppets. There's lots of action and CGI etc, but if I don't care about the characters I'm hardly going to be on the edge of my seat worrying about who makes it to the end credits.Won't someone give (the sadly under used and underrated)Rebecca Romijn a meatier part in a movie? Well done to Halle Berry for getting more lines & screen time, but list this on your resume along with Catwoman.I would go on, but I'd rather get busy waiting for Bryan Singer's movie about the Big Blue Schoolboy.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1724,Kensters1,"Fast paced, decent action but terrible character development",6,25 June 2006,"X-Men: Last Stand is the third movie in the X-Men series and is supposed to tie up all the lose ends from the previous movies. While the pacing is fast and the action is decent, i can't help to think that a movie of this caliber is so short. Many new characters are introduced and sadly they never received the screen time that they deserved, resulting in poorly developed characters of whom we as an audience know next to nothing about. An example of this would be Calisto and her group of mutants. Many of the characters introduced had great potential to make the movie more interesting but are wasted down to nothing but gimmicks, An example of this would include ""Angel"" ""Multiple Man"" ""Juggernaut"" ""Spike"".While the concept of the story is interesting, it strives to do too many things at once and unfolds itself rather cumbersome. It mainly follows two main storyline that somewhat overlaps one another, one being about the cure and another being about Pheonix, now both stories have more than enough materials to be a movie on their own but if the length of this feature film would have been longer, it would have been more satisfactory. The killing of key characters in the movies were done rather bland and poorly, inadvertently disrespecting the history of these characters as well as the build up from the previous movies. Now i know that its meant for a shock value, but if they're going to shock their audience, they could have added more tension to the scenes, so that we as an audience would care about what happens to these characters we all came to knew, instead of being in a state of wondering what the hell just happened.Some of the fight scenes were disappointing to say the least, IceMan vs Pyro for example, is much too short to really be consider a duel, which is a shame because in the second movie the rivalry was built, and this is the payoff that we receive? The Pheonix portrayed in the movie is underwhelming rather than overwhelming, at one point during the movie, she pouts like a child and even acted like one. Now i don't know exactly how Pheonix fans would take this but it just seemed ridiculous. Pheonix is used more like a prop set rather than an important character , most of her time was spent seeing her getting angry and powering up, standing still and letting the special FX take over, which is a shame because Famke Jannsen is a terrific actress who never really gets a chance to shine here. I know the majority of this review has been deemed negative but there was some things that i appreciated in this movie that really surprised me. First off, The casting of Kelsey Grammar for Beast was ingenious! He embodied beast in every way (looks, sound, you name it). Ian McKellen as always, was an awesome Magneto who uses his powers in ways that you've never seen him do before (Truck scene, Goldengate bridge) Magneto even gave a convincing speech that made me want to join the brotherhood for once. Overall the movie was quite entertaining and there was never really a dull moment, which to me is a major plus.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1725,mysh-3,untamed women and hairy men,6,29 May 2006,"X Men 3 wasn't a bad movie in any way. It's short, well-paced, when it comes to action, it works very well, and it certainly delivers an hour and a half of entertainment. But... Bryan Singer used the first two installments in X Men series to bring a message of tolerance, accepting of a different and liberation. Brett Rattner turned the third movie into a slaughterhouse in tradition of late 1980s action movies. The movie deals with a woman, who breaks free and thus turns to a grave danger to the world. Her super-powers, totally uncontrollable and menacing, come from her unconscious, and she refuses to be tamed by men. She is about to destroy the world and herself, but hey! There's a way to deal with her! And what is it? Of course, a big, hairy, naked man who can get to her and INTO her. The climax scene of the movie is nothing but a huge, powerful orgasm of two super-creatures. (And if you wondered, what happened to a calm, sensitive, loyal guy who used to be in the picture - well, he won't last in this world. And he doesn't. As well as all those who chose the path of diplomacy and communication and won't give it up) So, naturally, the characters that in first two movies gained some depth get flattened (which is supported by a flat acting of most of the actors, especially Hale Berry and Hugh Jackman. Some of the freshly introduced mutants are actually funny - I'd mention Kelsey Grammar, all hairy and blue, and Vinny Johnes (""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!!!""). But if you expect something interesting from the Angel character, which appears in every trailer and on every poster - don't. He just flies...",X-Men - The Last Stand

They could have gotten a number of other of directors that would have fulfilled the vision much better than he could. Although he does a decent job and the movie is very good..The character development is amazing in this movie..miles ahead of its predecessors. The special effects we great and the fight scenes were intense. If your a die hard X-fan.. strap on for the ride of your life..X-Men 4?... prob not... but if so...

I don't know if it was just me or if Collossus' CG seemed better in the second one. Juggarnaut was prety weak, his helmut looked like 5 inch thick tin foil, I'm not usually a big fan of over use of CG, but he definitely could have used some. Angel's role was way underdone, he was not an important character in the movie at all, they certainly could have developed that story line more. I was a bit disappointed to see some characters from earlier ones didn't make it back, such as Nightcrawler. I was also a little sad to see that Gambit didn't make it again though. I wish a few things had been handled differently, such as the way *ahem* some deaths were handled.

I am a huge X-Men fan and was reading earlier buzz about this film's shortcomings from other critics. I was very surprised at this film's quality. This film was very good especially for a third installment. I would venture to say this film was my favorite of the three, narrowly beating out X-Men United. I felt there would be a lot of confusion in tying in Magneto and Dark Phoenix but the story was very coherent. I also felt like Halle did a little better in this installment, considering better powers and better writing. The action scenes were great, especially in Jean's house. I was pleased to see them stay faithful to certain scenes in the Dark Phoenix Saga comic. The other ""bit-part"" mutants were not as annoying as I'd anticipated, as some of them actually were very impressive. I was very impressed with this film's ""shockers"" and unpredictability. Some things I definitely did not see coming. While not the perfect experience everyone hopes for, it was still well-made and should satisfy the X-Men fan base.

Brett Ratner gets an A for effort - it is clear that this is the best he could have done, but his best is far lower than X-men standards. Save for one excellent sequence midway through the flick, this was a mess.First off, the all-mighty and menacing Phoenix - Wow was this taken for granted and put into the movie as a side-story. Jean awoke as Phoenix, and save for 5 lines we don't see the old Jeany for the rest of the movie which makes one care very little about her fate. She was described as ""class 5"" and the only one of her kind but her performance power-wise was weak - she ashed a few people and raised some water -- no evil, fire drenched bird of death here... very, very lame.A few main characters die here and I cared little about only one of them. Some main characters are cured and I cared about none of them. That's what this director/screen writer had wrong. No character development save for X-men and X2.The available mutants to shove into this third installment are of endless coolness and substance but what we get are some ""pawns"" with powers that make you scratch your head saying ""what the hell is the purpose of this guy"" (ex. pointy sticks emerging from a guys wrists, Multiple Man with two lines, Wolvie cuts off a guys arms and they instantly pop back out about 12 times, and many who were just carrying rifles, I mean come on!). Beast, I must say, kicked major booty. Storm had some extra screen time but with all of H. Berry's crying about Storm's role she had no back story (you know, the claustrophobia and being a goddess and all).The 1 hr. 40 min movie is 30 mins short of what was necessary - that's 30 mins of character development, plot expansion, and necessary X-men. Over all X3 was better than the first (not a whole lot to live up to there) and far weaker than X2 (and with the plot possibilities, III could've been miles ahead of II). A fun, action and FX packed, short and stupid movie is the diagnosis. Go see it to marvel at the screen but not at anything else.

It was way to rushed, I certainly think if Ratner had a few more months with this film it could have topped X2 but it falls short with the progress and character development.It seems to me that 20th century pretty much said ""hey Ratner, here's the film...make it happen"" and with what short time Brett had I think he decided to try and make this movie more of a big action scene movie because with superheros you can usually do that and with X2 in front of that he'd thought he'd have a big enough fan base to come and see the movie and he's right. I like this film on a number of levels such as the action scenes it was more emotional and all it's comic book references but where it falls short is it's pacing, character development and sometimes the dialog which was up and down I would have loved to singers version but i'm certainly fine with Ratner's version he did well with what he hadmy main problems are the deaths. in like a 15 minute interval jeans kills Scott (supposedly) and prof.x and it did bugged me when it took a while for someone (wolverine) to finally ask ""jean, where's Scott?"" but no one else noticed or cared the president seemed like he took his opinions form everyone else and magneto seemed weaker than previous and professor x seemed straight up sassy ""i don't have to explain myself, at least to you of all people"" also COLLOUSUS he could have fought JUggie but he didn't and that pisses me off he was definitely under used so here are the mysteries The scene after the credits is ass follows::Moria Mctaggert walks in room of unconscious patient::::she checks his vitals and whatnot:::: the we hear ""hello Moria"" and she gets this shocked look on her face::who is it? none other than professor x who transferred his consciousness into some coma victimyou'll kind of see it coming early on in the film if you pay attention to him talking about transferring his conscious to his studentsbut his death scene was awesomealso the cure isn't permanent...towards the end magneto as you all have heard moves a chess piece barely and it fades to blackBUT I FREAKING LOVED IT you can't hate it for what it's not but LOVE it for what it is it's better than the first 2 x-films in it's own rightwhat do y'all think?",X-Men - The Last Stand
1731,seraph76,"A Tale told by an Idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing",1,29 May 2006,"Although it would be easy to blame Director Brett Ratner for all of the faults of X-Men: The Last Stand, (and indeed his poor sense of pacing, drama, emotional resonance and anything remotely resembling subtlety does greatly hamper X3), the blame must be shared with the Screenwriters, Actors, crew and the Studio who likely rushed this film through production so that it could land in theaters in advance of Super Returns. Despite its bombastic score, numerous explosions and gee whiz power animations, X3 more closely resembles ""World's most expensive Power Rangers episode"" than a true sequel to either of the preceding X-men films. You can sense that the people behind the film so desperately want it to be more that it winds up being a whole lot less. There is nothing as diabolically inventive as Magneto's escape from his plastic prison in X2, Nor is there is an action scene as kinetically charged as Nightcrawler's assault on the White House. All of the fight scenes seem flat, choreographed and by-the-numbers. Wolverine slices things, Storm does a really ridiculous spinning kick with shockingly bad wire-work; if you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen the movie. While there are a few impressive special effects, (despite its rather blatant use of haunted house clichés, there's one scene that shows the effects of telekinetics in an almost engaging manner) there are also plenty of dreadful ones; an attempt at de-aging two characters early makes their faces look as if they were coated in silly putty, one character jumps into battle so unrealistically it appears as if he'd been rotoscoped in. None of the good special effects make up for the fact that the characterization is minimal. Major characters get few lines, (although this may be a good thing, as the dialogue is trite and cliché ridden) and minor characters may as well be interchangeable. The film attempts to substitute a heavy-handed score for actual development to terrible effect. Worse, some of the characters act in manners completely contrary to how they were portrayed in the two prior films. Professor X behaves like a total bastard through much of the movie.Were this not purported to be a sequel to X3, it would be a harmlessly forgettable bad summer movie replete with orange fireballs, cleavage, mass destruction with little actual storytelling getting in the way. However, since it has placed itself as the end of a trilogy, it ends up being an offensive act of noisy destruction that sullies the other two X-films by association.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I think most people who saw the movie with high expectations were a little let down. The perfect balance that the second film achieved between action and plot was lost here. This one focused mainly on demonstrating the different mutant powers and was filled with some great fight scenes with tons of eye candy. Due to this, character development and plot was somewhat neglected The movie also ended with a lot of unanswered questions, some which hint another installment to the series while others seem to have been overlooked. Overall I gave this movie an 8 for its visuals, new characters and the progression of the series. Its a must watch for fans and an action filled summer movie for the rest.

X3 had some great moments, and many things that will make the comic fans yell ""Hell yes!"" But the ending has left me with a sense of 'this is gay' and hostility, not a good way to 'end' the series Certain cameo's are half assed and you wonder why they didn't do them properly when there was no reason for them to not to be. Other characters are seriously under used and sub lines that could have been better developed. Given the short running time it does leave you with the ""why did they?"" and many ambiguous answers, if this truly was the last stand I don't feel a sense of closure, or that nice ""things will be okay"" that you want to see, or at least get a feeling of.There was a lot of potential, and I just feel it wasn't reached.

1734,jmw23,A Cinematic Abortion,2,30 May 2006,"I'll be the first to admit that I didn't have high hopes for X-Men 3. Bryan Singer did a fantastic job on the first two movies, but with Singer's departure to helm Superman, and his replacement by hack director Brett Ratner, things didn't bode well from the outset.The premise of The Last Stand is interesting. A cure has been found for the mutant gene, and those mutants who wish to be ordinary will be able to go to a clinic, get a shot, and instantly fit in. Some mutants (notably Rogue) are eager for the ""cure"", others, led by Magneto, see the cure as the first step towards a future in which every mutant is forced to lose their powers and conform. This is a situation rife with potential. What is a mutant? Can they really be ""cured"", or is there nothing wrong with them in the first place? There are obvious parallels to the abortion controversy, with long lines of mutants eager to be cured facing down angry protesters and attacks by extremists. None of this gets explored. It's all just glossed over on the way to fight scenes and explosions. The X-Men don't do any soul-searching; even after they learn that the government has developed weapons whose bullets permanently rob mutants of their powers. Magneto is portrayed as the extremist, but shouldn't this be setting alarm bells off for our heroes? Apparently not, as they rush to defend the facility where the cure is manufactured, improbably located on Alcatraz Island.Meanwhile, Jean Grey, killed at the end of the last movie, has returned. This time she has become the Phoenix, and off-the-charts powerful mutant barely capable of maintaining control. Professor X and Magneto struggle over who gets to keep her, and meanwhile, the audience yawns. The Dark Phoenix story from the comic books was a lot more interesting. Here Jean becomes a ping-pong ball bouncing from good to evil and back again in the space of an hour. It's fair to say that this entire plot line could have been dropped and no one would have missed it.As the movie went on, the audience started laughing at the incredibly cheesy dialogue and weak writing. I heard one patron muse that the dialogue sounded like a bad 80's action movie. This was a real disappointment after the last two movies. As X-Men 3 dragged on, the plot incongruities mounted up. Why did Cyclops have to die off-screen? Where did Nightcrawler go? Where were the Sentinels that fans longed to see? How is it in a school full of powerful mutants, the X-Men can only rustle up six team members for their ""Last Stand""? Why did Magneto, a master of metal, need to bend the Golden Gate Bridge to get to Alcatraz? That part really made no sense. It was obvious Ratner wanted a neat special effectI doubt the Bridge could even reach the island, no matter how it was twisted. Angel shows up in the finale just so he can be there with a last-second save when the villains throw his father off a roof. Huh? How did he reach the battle in time? He wasn't in the jet, and he can't fly from New York to San Francisco that quickly. He would have really been out of luck if the villains had decided use their powers to kill his father instead of throwing him off the roof in a dramatic way. It was all just so nonsensical and lame, with one explosion-filled fight after another. The death of Professor Xavier at Jean's hands felt emotionless and dull. Don't worry though, because if you sit through the credits, Professor X isn't really dead! Even Magneto's reaction when his cohort Mystique takes a mutant gene-removing bullet for him felt very out-of-character. It didn't help that random mutants were used as plot devices every time the writer needed to overcome some script problem.Fundamentally X-Men 3 is about what would happen if someone invented a cure for being different. If there was a ""cure"" for being a minority, what would that mean? It's a shame that such a fantastic premise is wasted on a hack director, weak script, and cast of characters so large that none get enough screen time (except Halle Berry who I've had more than enough of). I know X-Men 3 did gangbuster numbers at the BO, but a lot of that was on the strength of the last two movies. I predict a big dropoff as disappointed fans spread word of mouth. Ratner and co. burned us here. We won't be so quick to see another X-movie next time.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1735,lazarchris,Another grand slam for Brett Ratner,5,6 June 2006,"Wow Brett, what a magnificent attempt at wrapping up a trilogy... NOT! What the hell happened here? I'm wondering if Mr. Ratner decided the existing films made too much sense, and decided to put a spin on things by totally screwing up the third one. And what's with the arbitrary casting of Ken Leung as scary blow fish man? I understand that you've worked with him in the past (Rush Hour, Red Dragon), but he's not unemployed. You're probably wondering who is bad enough to roll with Magneto and Blow Fish Man, that's simple; Multiplicity Man, Fast Girl, British Juggernaut and I think they threw Pyro in there(not that it matters, his role is so frivolous).I will hand it to Brett though, there's some great effects, not enough to hide the lame wire-stunts or well placed one-liners, but fun to watch nonetheless. Sometimes all it takes is a few computers and some effects artists to bail someone out of a total train wreck and this is no exception. Top it off with a swiss-cheese story (I should write comedy) with some kid who reverses your genetic make-up if you come near him (mutant? more like wizard). I was under the impression that this kid would have a greater good towards the end of the movie, something along the lines of disabling Pheonix before she ruins everyone, but he just ran away from British Juggernaut with Walk-through-walls girl. Magneto can sense any metal around him and mold it at his discretion, but he can't avoid an ambush from Wolverine, the man made of metal... worst... loss of sweet powers... ever. Ian and Jackman do a great job in this film, but I was so disappointed I really hope Ratner never touches this franchise again.

1736,vitapup397,2nd time seeing it did not help.,4,13 June 2006,"I just saw this movie for the 2nd time and I must say that I like it a lot less than I originally did. The movie starts off great. Interesting plot, all the characters we've come to love in the series are there, every thing is good and jolly. Then at a certain point, I'd say after the scene that revisits the Grey house, the movie falls apart in it's own sloppiness and lack of directorial skill. None of the new characters really are developed. Many of the old characters are absent. The movie becomes the Wolverine and Storm show while the rest of the participants are limited to saying cheesy one-liners over and over again. What's worse the film is sloppy. Many of the special effects look rather pathetic especially the ones involving Colossus, Iceman, and Spyke. The story has too much going on in it. So when it's not convenient for a character to be acting the way he or she normally would, the writers have them just standing in the background allowing the narrative to occur. If there is an X-Men 4, I hope that Bryan Singer returns or at least that fox brings in a director and script writer who will produce a quality product and not this flaw ridden piece of garbage.

The main problem for me was that there were too many secondary characters with their own abilities that were conveniently used to fill in the plot. i ended up not caring about most of the characters which ruined the suspense of the action sequences. This was a real pity because the action sequences could have been really good if i cared about what was happening. Some people will love this movie but that will only be the people who like really dumb action movies. If you are looking for some sign of a script that took more than 7 and a half minutes to write then you should look somewhere else.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1738,Rgoodall09,why?,4,4 June 2006,"i am a huge xmen fan and was a little disappointed by this film for these reasons. Even if this is the last film i do not agree that they should have finished off so many of the xmen. Fist off cyclops dies in the first 10 Min's roughly, then mystique looses her abilities, then the professor dies, then rogue give her powers up, then magneto looses his powers and last but not least jean grey (phoenix) dies too. i was really disappointed in how they did all that in one film. Don't get me wrong the special effects and everything were very impressive but there was no need to kill off so many in my opinion. Then at the end of the film it hints in the direction of magneto getting his powers back, I mean what is all that about have they ended it as a trilogy or not? If they haven't surly the next one will be poor because of all the characters that they have removed from the story!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1739,josh_eisenbeisz,A Great Film,8,28 May 2006,"Well where to begin. In my personal opinion this wasn't the best X-Men movie of them, but was definitely good. With it's story line it had the potential to be great, but with lack of character development, and quite a few main characters missing for the majority of the movie, it just didn't fulfill my hopes for it, though it did come close...Kelsey Grammar (Fraiser) did a brilliant job playing the character of Beast. I admit I was worried he couldn't do it, but he brought the necccessary language skills needed for Beast's character. Not to mention he kicked a lot of butt for a blue ""furball"".The character of Angel, in my opinion, could've been better. He was in the movie for all of 10 minutes (15 at max.) and he was the main cause for a cure being invented, and therefore the main cause of the story line.I was very disappointed at Rogue and Cyclops' characters. I mean Rouge was the main focus of the first film, and Cyclops is supposed to be leader of the X-Men....yet neither were in the movie for more than 10 shots. In fact Cyclops supposedly died in the first 20 minutes. Then Rogue wasn't in the movie except the beginning, and about 2 scenes at the end.I did however like the expansion of Storm and Wolverine's character. I felt Storm needed to have a more in-depth character, being one of the more powerful mutants. Also Jean/Pheonix's roots were explained, which was also good.So because of the storyline and intense action sequences I give this film a 8/10.....could've been better....could've been worse, but overall pretty good.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1740,pyro1633,Brett Ratner had no business in making X-men 3,1,27 May 2006,"It would have been 100% better if Bryan Singer would have directed it. Brett Ratner made X-men 3 all about fighting and blowing up scenes, no character development. Everything happened so fast and confusing that I left the movie theater with a headache and feeling like I wasted my money. I am a HUGE fan of X-men 1 and X-men 2, but X-men 3 was a great disappointment. The dialogue was repeated and unoriginal. Rouge was the main character along Wolverine to start the X-men trilogy, and in X-men 3 you barley saw Rouge and the way wolverine was portrayed completely contradicted his original and classic personality in the comics and in the earlier x-men movies. Another thing was that the character Kitty was just thrown in there, she suddenly became part of the X-men, and again the problem of no character development is resurfaced. All in all if you want to see a movie that has a lot of blowing up and makes no sense, by all means see it. But if you're an X-men fan or at least have seen the previous x-men movies or even have an ounce of x-men knowledge, I advise you NOT to even get near to seeing it. Hopefully if they make X-men 4 Bryan Singer can undo the damage made to the X-men Trilogy by Brett Ratner. And just as a side note I have nothing against Brett Ratner, I mean I really liked the show ""Prison Break"" which he produced. But I just believe he if utterly confused and ignorant towards the making of movies like X-men.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1741,big9284,Calm down my fellow Nerds,8,27 May 2006,"Everyone seems to be picking on everything done wrong with this movie and that it ruined the movie. However, if you watch closely and pay attention you can see from the end that this isn't the end of the franchise but a set up for a 4th movie as long as it does well in the Box Office. First off if you watch the end, the cure isn't 100% as Magneto was able to make the chess piece move slightly and also Xavier's not dead... stay til after the credits to see what I mean. If you know anything about the Phoenix she'll rise again. There's no conclusive evidence Scott is dead. So many of those things can be fixed in the sequel, which should be age of apocalypse. Things I didn't like included the adding of so many mutants with little character development, Rogue accepting the cure at all, the movie's too short and increasing Halle Berry's role in the movie.These few missteps aside I think a some of the best points are Shadowcat, Iceman, the action scenes, and the writing (say what you will but they incorporated a really good plot not in depth but good). Kelsey Grammar as Beast was brilliant. Many of the characters just continued to develop in perfect step Magneto & Wolverine (yes Magneto will stop at nothing for his vision and Wolverine is emotionally driven not logically they are like that quit saying they're not).Overall this was probably the second best one X-men United is far better and X-Men was to much set up for these two movies. Howeve, as long as this movie makes decent money the next movie should be green lit. Also Wolverine and Magneto are going to be great. But quit looking for all of the negative and take a broad view of the movie and you'll realize this movie is pretty damn good and the biggest problems are in what we imagine the movie to be.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1742,nwtheaterkid,People should pay attention...,7,29 May 2006,"So, cry me a river. You didn't get a heart-wrenching and dramatic storyline out of this movie. Deal with it. This movie had more than enough story and enough cool effects to bulldoze any audience member. And more importantly, only two major characters are definitely dead. We know Jean Gray is dead, and we pretty much know Cyclops is dead. The others so often mentioned are not dead or gone for sure.Xavier: For those who stayed after the credits, Xavier's ""soul"" has inhabited another body.Magneto: He is beginning to regain his powers.Rogue: We can assume the same as Magneto.Mystique: See above.So there.

1743,myumyumerle,"A good movie on it's own, but definitely the worst of the trilogy",7,31 May 2006,"After X-Men and X2, The Last Stand had pretty big shoes to fill. And while it did so with direction, acting and dialogue, it seemed to fall short concerning the plot and character development.First, the good points of the movie. Storm gets more screen time and she gets to kick more butt. Very much a good thing. Another thing, we see a few more mutants and a few other things that weren't in the first two movies, like the Danger Room. Also a good thing. We also have a lot of action, drama and political talk. Nice mix, especially the political aspect giving it a more real life like feel, not that the other two didn't have that, except this was more in your face. Now the bad points. There wasn't a whole lot of story, which made me feel a little disappointed since the first two movies had good story development. The movie seemed to focus only on the action, which while it's a good thing because this movie is supposed to be the dramatic finale to the movie trilogy, it seemed to push away the story and make room for only action. Then there's the character development. Rattner introduces several new mutants, but we rarely get to see them develop, which was a shame, since they had potential. Even Kitty Pryde didn't get much development even though she was one of the new main characters. Beast got a far amount of development, but the others seemed to fall short. And since the story was a little nonexistent, the movie felt a little rushed. Which is to be expected since it's only an hour and forty five minutes long. While not disappointing, compared to the other two movies, it is as many people have said the worst of the trilogy. But on it's own, it's quite good save for it's small flaws. A nice ending to the trilogy indeed.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I don't thing the supporting characters like Kitty, Ice, the guy with wings, and Collosus were given any time to develop, and the same goes with the bad guys like Callisto, Arclight and Quill... And what the hell were the editors thinking when they included a shot of Toad, and then we never see him again, that was just sloppy editing. I know from the ending and the clip after the trailer they are planning another movie, but to be honest, I'm just not excited by the idea after this one like I was after the first two. If they are planning a Wolverine or a Storm spin off, they defintaly set it up, because they got all the screen time.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I was sooo totally excited when we got to the theaters for the midnight showing and all I gotta say is that it lived up to my excitement. It was awesome. I liked the first two installments, but this one was way cool. More action, more mutants, more everything. I think X3 rocked! Word to the wise about the end, STAY after the credits. You'll see why if you do.I am a HUGE Logan/Wolverine fan and all I gotta say is that I was very pleased with him. There was a lot of him in the movie. He was hotter in this movie, too.

1746,johnenkosky,An ALMOST perfect movie,6,26 May 2006,"I realize that the dialog for this movie was written using the incredibly important book of Clichés, Puns, and Predictability, which is pretty much essential for any movie to even be considered on par with films like Citizen Kane or Schindler's List, which I should just add this movie certainly is, but what could have made it excel way beyond them, and become the greatest film ever would be if they had also used a rhyming dictionary. Just think how much more tension could have been added to the final climatic scene if Jean Grey had said something like this to Wolverine:Wolverine It'd be keen If you shoved your claws In my SpleenOr better yet, my suggestion for X-Men 4, have the whole movie written in iambic pentameter. Either that or they should all speak in the for of a rap. Also they should have like 30 more kittens licking Wolverine's claws. Also they should have Steve Urkel come in to replace Professor X as they leader of the team, but he can constantly be screwing things up, but seriously, who can really stay mad at him. The big climax of the movie can be Urkel asking a girl he likes out to a dance, and her agreeing to go. It'll be a really touching moment.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1747,theandrewillsley,"No character development, no heart, lots of 'Splosions.",2,12 June 2006,"What a disappointment. I'm not a comic-book fan, but I did really like the first two films. This one was all loud banging. I know people like special effects (part of the reason I wanted to see it), but I like to think people also like story and character development and real suspense. Even the action was murky. It's almost impossible to see what the Beast is doing when he's fighting, it's just a big, ugly blur there's no choreography whatsoever. Plus, Magneto's a very smart guy, a leader, and yet his demise is brought on by one of these ""oldest trick in the book"" routines. Every time a mutant uses a power, it seems to be in a very convenient situation. Everything's staged so simply that you can see it all coming from a mile away. I felt insulted on behalf of movie-goers everywhere. Bring back Brian Singer, he won't phone-in his duty. Brett Ratner should never work in the business again.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1748,reidpc,This one bites the big one,3,24 May 2006,"Never before have I been so prompted to find places to bag a movie... but I think this one takes the cake... and leaves very little for anyone else...A cure for mutants, sure... but a cure that also prevents adding X-Men 4 etc ? Someone needs to give the writer a cure for the dribble that came out for this piece of crap I think when Bryan Singer left the film and took most of the staff with him... the actors should have gone too... hell some of them barely get a 1/4 of the film's viewing time, before they are killed off, so why bother coming in to work at all ? New and interesting characters come in, and *poof* they're gone. Unlike the previous two movies where the bad guys might get hurt a little and we may or may not see them in future movies (or spin-offs), this one decides quite coldly that in order for the story to continue, the character must die. And not just one character, but 90% of them. Old or new...The only logical spin off that might occur now could be called: X-Men: The Next Generation Logically speaking of course, because you would need to introduce a whole new set of characters just to replace all those that have been lost. The universe would already be set up, all you have to do is create a bad guy of the week and voilà, instant spin off.The ending itself sets the tone for the whole movie really, bland and slow. All the characters are getting about their normal lives, which is what I now wish I had done rather than forking out money to watch it.The action sequences were so so, but rather more reminiscent of horror flicks and cheesy sci fi, than the previous sweeping action sequences of the prior two films. The fight sequence left you wondering who was actually fighting who ? Then reality struck me, and I realised it was the ""X-Men"" vs ""The Extras"" To be blunt, the story was crap, the action sequences lame, and the whole trilogy ruined in my mind. I make no apologies for my post, I honestly feel disgusted by the whole movie.

1749,Liquidace-1,X-Men The Last Stand,6,29 May 2006,"X-Men ""The Last Stnd""............ I feel that as a huge Fan of not only the comic but the TV Series it was a let me down. The movie plot is that they have found a ""cure"" to remove the mutant genie cells from mutants, by use Leech (Cameron Bright) cells on mutants. Many new characters are introduced in the movie, Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast (Kelsey Grammar) which played an exciting and excellent roll, Cain Marko/Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) another great add on to the cast, but not up to par, Warren Worthington III/Angel (Ben Foster) which i felt play to small of a role, as did Peter Rasputin/Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). As i was watching the movie i felt that the story line was altered to much.. I found many ""facts"" in the movie that were no where near the comics of TV series, making it seem nothing like the traditional X-Men. And out of the 3 movie's this was not only the shortest but it felt like the were trying to make a dead line and rushed threw the movie...With the mount of add on's and the potential to make an amazing movie that could of been longer, it just left your unsatisfied. If you watch the credits many so called role were played but not really introduced (Jubilee, Rogue's Mother, Omega Red, ext..) all those which could of made the much more exciting...Final Thought on the movie it's a must see, over all it was a fun movie with a lot of action, twist's, and new event that will leave you asking for more, but it will leave real fans upset that they are saying this is the Final Movie to the saga, and to many thing were left undone, as what ever happened to Gambit, Morph, hopefully this is not the ""Last Stand""!..

1750,chrisphins,Worth the Wait!!!!,10,20 May 2006,"I just saw a pre-screening and I have to say this is the best one of the series.The flow of the story wasn't perfect, but it was very good. I have been reading the comics for about 20 years and they went both ways. On some things they were true to the comics but on others they were way out in left field.I liked how they handled the Dark Phoenix origin. It wasn't true to the comic but it didn't really leave any explaining for those who aren't familiar with the original story line. It was simple and easy to understand.I am a huge Wolvie/Hugh fan and I must say I was NOT disappointed with this movie. Hugh looked good as always, but I loved how he handled his character. Wolvie isn't an out of control animal anymore but he does have his moments. In the end he comes through like he always does. He shows more emotion in this one too. There is some language and suggestive scenes in the movie. A few people brought their young kids to it and I'm not sure I would have taken my seven year old. Definitely not without seeing it first.This is definitely a movie you need to see in the theater. The Danger room scene is awesome as well as the final battle.I had heard a lot of rumors about the funeral scene and I don't remember hearing anyone say it was for who it was for. I thought Scott or Wolvie, but never thought it was gonna be Xavier. I bawled when he died. I would have liked to see more of Rogue in the movie and I was sad that they had her choose the cure. The Rogue in the comics never would have done that, but you can understand why she does.The ending will blow you away. I think they left it open a little just in case.",X-Men - The Last Stand

How can jean be more powerful than Xavier? What is level of mutant "" hello my name is Rouge and i am level 3"" How does a potion change the mutant DNA so quickly? and lots of other question.one last thing if you love x men comics don't go to X men 3.Why there is no mutant in Europe or china or japan or Australia or India or in Africa or in any other part of the world so that they always fight in US. look at the odds there is 300 million people in US assume there is a possibility of being mutant is 10.000 / 1 that makes 30.000 mutants the world population is 7 billion that makes 700.000 mutants around the world but why we don't see or know other 270.000 mutants don't they have any skill or gift to change the world.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1754,jpgreenwood,Ratner!! All is forgiven!! (spoilers),7,24 May 2006,"Just got back from a midnight screening of X-Men: The Last Stand. Now maybe i'm only saying this because i'm still on a high from seeing the film, but Brett Ratner has delivered the goods on this one. I'm so relieved that the franchise has been (possibly) concluded with a film as satisfying as this.Let's face it, The Rat has made some entertaining but ultimately forgettable films. However, thanks to a lean and gutsy script, top class performances and a desire to respect the two earlier films. Ratner has crafted not only a cracking summer blockbuster, but a comic book adaptation to be proud of.The story moves along at quite a fast pace but still manages to deliver multiple story components that weave together brilliantly. Granted, I would have liked the film to have been a little longer, and some of the characters were harshly underused. But the sheer unforgiving and relentless nature of the story is so potent, I can see why they edited it to a tight 100 minutes or so.My main disappointment was at the unfair killing of Cyclops so early in the film. He should have been there all the way through, fighting tooth and nail to get Jean back. Just like in the 'Phoenix Saga' story line from the comic book. Also, there could have been more recognisable mutants from the books. Oh, and Vinnie Jones as juggernaut wasn't a very good choice. Whenever he spoke, I cringed.In closing. I thought the ending was so smart. The rebuilding of the Golden Gate Bridge served as the perfect metaphor for human/mutant relations. Magneto looking like a broken man was poetic. And let's not forget the bit after the credits. It made me weep tears of joy. Please make one more?",X-Men - The Last Stand
1755,ajmolis,Why oh why...,1,26 May 2006,I was so excited for this movie. I loved the first two even though I understand there were some differences from the comics of which I know very little.First off killing Scott. All I can say is what the hell where the writers thinking here. Oh my goodness. Don't they know anything about the comics at all or even about what people want to see. The whole thing with the Phoenix and her overwhelming powers was that her love for Cyclops helped her. She would have NEVER hurt or killed him that was the lamest thing i have ever seen. I was so angry at this point in the movie i wanted to walk out.Next killing Xavier. That is absolute crap. I can't believe the folks at Marvel gave the go ahead for this script.I understand there will be some creative license with movies but this was so far off base it was ridiculous. It was choppy and incoherent. The characters were window dressing in the shots with no depth at all.The effects were good and the acting was good but the storyline sucked so bad it didn't matter.The only way to fix this horrible movie is to make a fourth and bring the dead back and give the folks back their darn powers. And toss in Gambit and Rogue as she should be. Please Mr. Singer get yourself back and make a 4th that fixes this depressing letdown.I will have to hit Superman to see the lovely Mr. Marsden and a decent movie looks like.,X-Men - The Last Stand

While X-men and X2 had a good story following the action, X3 seems a bit lost. The special effects are great, and there are some good fighting sequences, but still.. something is missing. A lot of this might be because of the director change. It seems Brett Ratner is trying to hard.But there are absolutely things that are worth watching. Jean's ""transformation"" is really cool, and adds a new specter to the move. There are two scenes with her that almost makes the move worth watching alone.One thing I really missed, was Kurt Wagnes. I really liker his character, and as far as I am concerned, nothing can compare with the fighting sequence in X2 in the White House. Too bad he is left out in the movie.The overall comment would be it's worth watching if you're an X-men fan, but if you are just after action, watch MI:3 instead.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1759,missunique007,Best sci-fi/action movie i've seen in a long time,10,27 May 2006,"I watched it about 6 hours ago and was really expecting a great trilogy, better than the first two and after months of waiting i can say it was worth the wait. The film was excellent for various reasons: 1. the acting 2. the action, which was non-stop through the film 3. the full blown special effects which after seeing a lot of big movies eg. Lord of the rings and Harry Potter was outstanding and the best i've ever seen 4. the drama and 5. the never ending surprises and heart jerking scenes throughout. Although there were many deaths of main characters i feel they were a contribution to the story except the professors death which i still am shocked about, even though that scene was awesome. Let me say that the acting blew me away Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen made this film top grade in acting not forgetting the other great actors Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellen, Ellen Page, Ben Foster etc. I never expected Jean to be that powerful, she was scary and unbelievably cool at the same time. The film went from strength to strength from the fast start into the story, first big shock( Xavier's death), to the explosion of action at Alcatraz leading to a dramatic, powerful and tear jerking final confrontation between Logan and Jean, that was the best scene in the film, still makes me cry when i think about it but it was definitely a great ending ' YOU WOULD DIE FOR THEM' -JEAN ' NO I WOULD DIE FOR YOU' - LOGAN then he tells her he loves her and kills her for the greater good.

My two favorite characters were Angel, because he had the courage to stand up to dad, and Pyro, just because you can't resist pyros. fire haha. Wolverine was arrogant, but not enough. I really could have used some more of that, and also, he seemed kind of mellow. How about some more anger? I also didn't like how... what's her name got healed.

1761,QueenGinger,DISAPPOINTING (to say the least) **Possible Spoilers**,3,30 May 2006,"The first movie in this series was slow, but did introduce everyone not familiar with the story to the characters. The second installment was far better than the original, expanding on Wolverine's background (who by far is the most interesting character of the comics). We even get to see Mystique for more than two minutes... then comes Brett Ratner, the crappiest of all directors to screw up a completely good story. Phoenix was NEVER explored. The effects on Phoenix were crap. Why was she all demon-like instead of FIRE like? Yeah we get she's the most awesome force ever, but she's in the background- much like Colossus. Why wasn't there a fight between Colossus and Juggernaut? HELLO! Awesome scenes would ensue. What happened to Wolverine? His character was much darker in the first two films and then Brett makes him a whimpering dog the entire film. All I have to say is that Halle Berry was miscast from the beginning. It should have been Angela Bassett or Iman as Storm from the get go. Halle whined through each of her lines, trying to hard to be ""tough"". Halle is not regal like Storm. She never understood the character. She suckity sucked sucked. I'm happy I didn't have to see Cyclops for more than a minute. He sucked from the start (but he sucked in the comics too). Mystique was completely wasted and they didn't even explore Raven Darkholme as best as they could have. There were two stories - Phoenix and the cure - both were hurried and not explored to the depths that were possible. Rushed, hurried and a complete disappointment.

Sit back and enjoy.Production took a big risk that was a huge pay-off for some of the biggest fans. Anyone who is a die hard fan has seen the online fan video about Juggernaught dubbed over by some drunk college age guys. If you saw this video, then you got the pay-off. I recommend seeing this video before you see the movie. Go to www.youtube.com and search - ""I'm the Juggernaught B*!@H"" <---- but spell this the naughty way. I have to thank the writers for the unexpected treat and uncontrollable laughter that the people on either side of me in the theater just didn't understand.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1763,x_balls,great disappointment! \|/ >.< \|/,4,29 May 2006,"Terrible, just terrible! I'm a huge X-men fan and I have awaited this third movie with such enthusiasm for all those long months. Then at last when the day came, I and a couple of fellow X-men fans threw a party/X-men Marathon thing. The third movie should have been the climax of the whole day, but instead it turned out into a great disappointment! The first 10 minutes were okay, but then it turned from bad to worse. To start with this movie is nothing like the first 2 (Bryan Singer, you are missed!). The story makes no sense what so ever and it's just a pile up of FX sequences. The movies takes a couple of story lines from the books and mashes them together in a very poor manner and it concludes really non of them. The movie also doesn't feel like the ending of a trilogy what so ever. It makes you feel like this a beginning of a whole new/different set of movies to come. And may this be the case, Gods forbid it will be done by the same clowns who made this one! This movie shows no respect for the X-men universe at all and it shames the previous 2 movies. I guess people who know nothing about X-men will enjoy it somewhat because of all the pilled up FX action scenes, but to true X-men fans it a huge disappointment. If you will see this movie you will leave it with a lot of frustration, huge disappointment and no feeling of completion at all. So it would be wise to save your money on buying a ticket and just wait for the movie to turn up on television or something. Really, you won't miss a thing.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1764,protoman108,X-Men moves grimly and stunningly towards a new future,9,28 May 2006,"The latest installment in the X-Men series continues to do well all that the previous two films did while attaining a deeper level of emotional impact. By casting its conflicts in a realistic, political realm, the X-Men films have avoided the trappings of other superhero movies, eschewing the cliché of a solitary superhuman fighting against an abstract notion like ""crime"" or ""injustice."" Instead, they have been able to weave a realistic allegory that reflects the social issues of our culture instead of overlooking them.The Last Stand is no exception, recasting the mutant-vs-mutant and human-vs-mutant struggles of the prior two films in a new context. When a permanent pharmaceutical ""cure"" is developed for mutations, the mutant community is polarized. For some, this cure is a relief; others, an outrage. For Magneto, a scarred concentration camp survivor who scorns humanity and is fearful of its inhumanity, this is the beginning of the annihilation of mutant-kind, and he uses the fear of it among his brethren to garner an army. For the X-Men, it is an ambiguous dilemma, but they are quickly pulled into one side of the conflict by Magneto's warmongering.This cure plot is coupled with the mysterious return of Jean Grey, presumed dead at the end of the last film. Usually, a hero's return would be a miracle. But instead it proves not to be quite blessing that it appears, and our heroes have to grapple with the internal strife caused by her instability while the outside world is being torn apart by the cure.Make no mistake, this is a grim movie. Stunning, touching, but grim. Following Revenge of the Sith's lead, this trilogy-closer teeters on the edge of tragedy throughout.Each of the new characters is a delight. Kellsey Grammar's portrayal of Beast is perhaps the most faithful rendition of an X-character yet, and his acting is superb throughout. Angel's role, though smaller than anticipated, has its own satisfying arc. Some of the ""junior"" X-Men enjoy greater roles, most noticeably the likable Shadowcat, while another junior X-Man, Rogue, is at her least important. And the Juggernaut is a show-stopper, with Jones proving again that if American audiences like anything, it's a British accent. However, it is, ultimately, Wolverine's movie again--never a problem with Jackman doing the work.That's not to say that the film is without its flaws. The franchise's departure from the text grows as it goes, leading to situations which wouldn't have been acceptable in the context of the comics. Indeed, my only negative feelings about the movie were born out of my knowledge of the original text and the gap between the two.Additionally, there are two underlying directorial motives that clearly impact the way this film spins out: (1) to give Storm a bigger role, and (2) to create a sense of closure for the series, or at least the trilogy. In an effort to woo Halle Berry back into the cast, her role was greatly expanded despite the fact that the plot has no need for it to be any bigger. Because of this, her scenes are the least valuable in the movie. She splits her time between nagging Wolverine and being set up for heroic, reaffirming lines. As far as the second motive goes, well, to explain would be to reveal spoilers. But let's just say that if the franchise is continued at some point, it, like Jean Grey, will have to be reborn in a different form.Don't miss the extra scene after the credits!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1765,micahsherrill,it was okay,6,26 May 2006,"i think this was fun to watch, but a great movie it was not. i am sure lot's of folks will like it, but i never felt engaged. the movie was a bit of a mess. bryan singer is missed in this one! there were some sloppy production errors. also there never seems to be believable motives for many of the characters actions. jean grey has an identity crisis, that never seems to make sense. i think the script on this one could have used some more work and maybe some reason. the plot raises interesting questions, but never really goes anywhere to answer them. the conflict just seems wimpy and silly. lot's of things blow up, but what for?",X-Men - The Last Stand
1766,thedeaconblues,Fantastic,9,27 May 2006,"This movie was the best of all the previously released X-Men films. It built the audience up from the very beginning with a strong flashback opening and ended with a good teaser to keep you wanting more. The only poor part about the opening was the simulation scene which was unneeded. The introduction of certain previously unmentioned characters was a bit awkward, but was covered up by a strong story development. This movie didn't spoon feed you every fact, but instead let your mind imagine certain less important aspects.The emotion portrayed by this knock-out cast was fantastic. Their energy came out of the screen and grabbed you unlike the majority of other 'fantasy comic' genre films.I was worried toward the end... I was saying to myself; ""Shit, they're going to wrap this thing up with a cliché 'fade out on blue sky' mantra,"" but instead went with a very humble and creative cliffhanger.Remember... this is not the comic; this is a CINEMATIC ADAPTATION of the Comic.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1767,bliss_xoxo17,A Disappointment,6,6 September 2008,"I was very excited to see the third movie as I enjoyed the first two very much. However, I was a bit disappointed. It seems to me that instead of X-men 3, it should be called Carrie 3 as Jean Grey goes completely insane on us and starts killing people and blowing things into smithereens. The story was not very good. I really did not like Jean Grey's part in this movie. I also thought it was odd that they killed Cyclops in like the first fifteen movies of the film, and then move onto killing the professor. Mystique, Rogue, and Magneto lose their mutant powers which also makes me sad. Rogue's role in this film was way too minimal with Kitty practically replacing her. Honestly, I did not like Storm's new hair very much. Oh, and Mystique's role was also pretty minimal in this movie. The ending seems to hint there will be another X-men movie but with a lot of the main characters gone, what will happen? I'm disappointed with Brett Ratner, as he made the Rush Hour movies, I believe, and I love the Rush Hour movies. But he did a horrible job with the third X-men movie. Whatever, I'll just pretend that one doesn't exist and just watch 1 and 2 happily.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1768,murdoc7,Big disappointment,2,28 May 2006,"Xmen the last stand was a big disappointment. The story was rushed in a 2 hour period and was done so terribly. As if the director never saw a single xmen episode or comic. The new characters in this movie are given minimal importance and pretty much make what the promotional items show fake. Angel is pretty much insignificant and isn't used at all in the plot. Rouge is wasted and all she does is line up to get the cure. Cyclops is killed around 20 minutes in for no apparent reason. In short so many key characters are killed that the idea of making a fourth installment would be absurd. The plot basically revolves around Phoenix/Jean Grey, who has about 10 lines in the movie, it does contain much action though thats all it has. The great Phoenix saga is the best in Xmen and is ruined here. Beast is given a well deserved part, but thats it. Other great characters like Colossus are wasted. One of the things i hated the most was that there was a punchline or joke like every 4 lines and situations are barely taken seriously. Overall a kid under the age of 10 will probably love it, though a true critic or someone who plain old knows xmen will see it as the disgrace it is. This is all due probably to the change of director, i mean you cant expect much from the man who directed Rush Hour.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1769,datakix,A Setup to X-Men 4 and 5,7,28 May 2006,"While X-Men 3 is action-packed and has a decent (not great) story line, there is a serious lack of character development. Also, the movie leaves waaay too many unanswered questions as the director is so focused on 'carry-over' plot for X-Men 4 and/or 5. This is alarming because we all know what happens when movies get past the second-sequel... Furthermore, casting directors didn't do me any favors by adding Frasier to the mix. The good news is that the one-liners are gone and the FX are well done. All-in-all, it's a decent flick, but I should mention that X-men comic book fans will NOT be as satisfied as other movie-goers.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The story has been so twisted that I can say with out a doubt that it is the worst Comics adaptation that has ever been made, even (and I hate to say this) DareDevil was better. I mean DareDevil was terrible but compared to this movie it is OK. To have made X-men and X-men united though not great still good, yet totally ruin the last chapter of the trilogy.

I though Kelsey did a great job playing the role of Beast and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut. I recommend this movie to everybody. I think the director hated the X-men saga and wanted to destroy it. Mission accomplished to you, you hack. I am not sure but I do believe that they will make another X-men movie but by starting a different trilogy. If this is true, then they can bring in all the other mutants that were left out. Jubilee, Gambit, Sinister, Blob, Avalanch, etc. and give the mutants that they brought into the third installment a bigger role than just a few scenes. *cough angel cough*. Also they need to bring back Nightcrawler!! It would be cool if they did it about the morlocks or apocalypse.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1773,wbilli2,"They ""Matrix 2ed"" it",4,26 May 2006,"OK let me preface my dissertation by stating that I may not be as knowledgeable a fan of the series as some individuals, but I do know a bit about the X-Men and more importantly the prior movies. This is my first post to IMDb and this is moreso an act of catharsis than it is complaining although there is a hint of complaining too.To sum up my feelings after viewing that movie I have the flattened affect of an indidvidual who just got dumped after spending a good two long years in a relationship and here is why.Total number of characters that were either killed off or permanantly altered in some way; Cyclops, Mystique, Magneto, Professor X, Rogue, and depending how you look at it Jean Grey. Now as far as I was aware when making a sequel the goal is to perhaps change a few things and add a few things.Lets imagine you are a fan of the comics and you begin to read the start of the phoenix saga. You have grown accustomed to a certain character dynamic for the last several years and not only their dynamic but the characters themselves. I think Marvel would have been hard pressed to simultaneously introduce this more evil side of Jean Grey while simultaneously killing of cyclops (right on the first page mind you), killing professor X, and depriving Rouge, Magneto, and Mystique of their powers (I think intimating that these mutants may get their powers back is as well a cop out).I liken it to a friend telling you they have cancer and then you struggle with this life altering change only to find out at the end of the day that it was all a ruse. That entire day you thought your friend went through a life changing event, you emapthized with their situation and now that it turned out not to be true you feel betrayed albeit relieved.Where was nightcrawler? Like most fans I thought his opening scnene in the first movie really set the tone for the movie and they just decided to completely not include him? Also lets be careful on introducing too many mutants you don't have a time to fully develop. I thought The Beast was a great addition and well developed, however, he was probably the only one. Lets not go through the whole Mortal Kombat 2 syndrome of trying to jam pack the movie with as many characters as possible.Magneto and Charles Xavier's personality seemed a bit off to me too. Charles Xavier was the picturesque representation of a man of infinite tolerance and wisdom, but his child like reactions to Wolverine's badgering seemed a bit out of place. Magneto as well was always the intellectual who was thoroughly calculating and more imporatantly a loyal leader to his mutants. This I also felt was not really represented as well in this movie with him just abandoning mystique (who had a huge role in the previous movies).Granted taking the entire bridge over to Alcatraz was real cool I really thought the fight scene was lackluster. I mean its magneto how about instead of throwing cars at random he uses bits of metal as weapons. He did manipulate an entire police squadron's arsenal in the second movie. Oh I know we will light those cars on fire. Yeah... thats redeeming.Its a tough bill to take over someone elses work and knowing that I would even play it real conservative because you know your interpretation is going to be different and that alone is enough to alter the movie. But to add to that this removal of main characters prevalent in the series is downright arrogant and far beyond ""poetic license""",X-Men - The Last Stand
1774,dundealin,I'd watch it again!,10,1 June 2006,"I really enjoyed this film. Kept my interest all the way.Looks like some people have criticisms aplenty - under developed characters, pointless characters, the film being nothing more than a wrestling match. Well... whatever.I never saw any of the comics so I haven't seen this comparing it with them. I can imagine the comic fans not being happy with any X-Men (or Marvel) film, no matter how good it is.As an action film it's great. You could have made it longer to develop some other characters but why? The film spent the time it had focusing on Wolverine, Storm (having to take on responsibility), Xavier (and what he'd done in the past), Phoenix, Magneto and Beast. That's a lot in there. Anymore more could arguably be too much.I've seen this once and will certainly watch it again. If you haven't seen it yet then do so.Is it a turkey? Absolutely not.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1775,jps-19,A decent brainless action movie/a terrible x-men adaptation,1,29 May 2006,"It seems likely that no one involved with this film ever picked up one of the comics on which it was supposed to based. I went into this forewarned that as someone who grew up reading the comics I probably wouldn't like it, and was prepared to try and view it objectively and not measure it against the comics. That being so, I was still stunned at what a mess this movie was. It seemed like the writers had two ideas for a plot, and rather than choosing one and developing it, they simply took the parts of each that best lent themselves to extravagant special effects, and mushed them together incoherently. The result is a movie with shallow, inconsistent characters, spouting idiotic forced dialogue, throughout an implausible(even for a superhero movie) plot. It did however, have good acting, and great special effects, and the plot holes and lack of character development are easily ignored if you watch it as a brainless action movie, but if you were ever a fan of the comics you will be very disappointed.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Very poor character development made me not care what happened to professor Xavier or most of his X-Men. Many of the gags in the movie were recycled from the last two and more than played out. Other than killing off most of the important characters in this movie, there were really no original elements.Just a shame. In the hands of better direction, this movie could have shined.Oh well, at least I have the previous two on DVD and can watch them.

The movie was that bad.The script was horribly written, the characters weren't developed, the special effects were only mediocre, and it made me want to erase Halle Berry from the face of existence.The thing that really made me hate this movie more than anything was the fact that is had so much promise in it. There were occasion hints of a great X-Men movie but nothing great over even close to it was ever delivered. That's what so painful about this movie. There could have been a good movie but instead the studio rushed the production of this movie (set a release date before a finished script even existed) and the end result was a smelly, piece of fecal matter.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1778,hailerro,This Movie Did Not live up to its predecessors,1,9 June 2006,"Any true X-men fan--and I mean that as one inclined to stick to the canon created in the comic world--will not like this movie. The writers proved an utter lack of character understanding. Case in point: At the death of the Professor Logan would NOT cry. He would tear it up. It's his nature to lash out when he is in pain. He would not bawl like a baby the instant he knew Chuck was gone. Furthermore Phoenix being a 'multiple personality' really got under my skin. There was no mention of the Shii'ar Empire either. This movie really enjoyed breaking with Canon. Other impossibilities included Jugernaught surviving being phased into a solid concrete floor--even the X-men have a certain proclivity to follow the laws of Physics people! The needles that contained the cure in them would have had to have metal tips in order to penetrate the skin. The Phoenix itself survived off of Solar energy so killing Scott would never have happened in a million years since he is a food source for that particular entity. Xavier would never in a million years leave his school to Storm--her name is Storm for a reason--she's unpredictable and not always in control of her powers. He'd never give up on Scott--since he rescued Scott from an orphanage at a young age and loves him like a son he'd not just abandon him. The moving of the bridge was done purely for the spectacle of the thing--because it would have been much easier for Magnus to summon a metal platform and fly them all over than moving the bridge itself. The number of plot holes, character misrepresentation, and lack of respect for Canon was completely astounding. I admit that I'm glad I didn't pay to see this movie. If I had, I would have demanded my money back for such a poor performance. While I know younger audience members loved the show it was mainly due to their lack of respect for the comic versions of the Xmen and their obsession with SFX that lead to them loving the movie. Hence, their ignorance made them prime candidates to enjoy the film. My advice...watch it at least once so you have your own opinions to stick with...but if you're a devoted fan know that you won't love it. I truly hope they make an X4 and pretend X3 never existed.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1780,neversober_81,"OK, but not Great",5,25 May 2006,"While the underlying principles of the X-men are still here (equality, uniting everyone, etc), it is very hard to look at this film and see the same quality of the previous films.It is very clear that Ratner hasn't taken much from the comics, and this film is probably only being used a hype for the upcoming Magneto and Wolverine films, as hardly any of the other actors were used. None of the other actors were allowed to be used to their full potential, and some characters seemed to be forgotten about until they chip in with one or two lines just to remind us their still in the film.A lot of the sequences in the film felt like it was trying to copy the spider-man films, it failed. Simply because everyone watching, came to see an X-men film.What was good about the film were the special effects, but FX do not make bad films, good! Commanding performances from Sir Ian Mckellen and Kelsey Grammar. If this film was any other fantasy action thriller it would be fine as a story on its own, but it is an X-men film and in my opinion too much of the comic was lost on translation to the screen this time. I am huge fan of the previous films it is just a shame Singer couldn't direct this film before going onto the Superman Returns film.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1782,cwb244,The Brett Ratner Deception,8,26 May 2006,"When I heard that Hollywood was passing the X-men reins to Brett Ratner, a man who decides to sell movies as opposed to directing them so he can fill his pockets with cash to put fuel in his expensive cars, throw massive parties and date supermodels when he isn't having mysterious trysts with Lindsey Lohan, I was naturally a bit worried.All the buzz from X-men was not necessarily negative but it was certainly not positive. The articles I read on the subject were not super reassuring but rather expressive towards the same question on my mind and from what I gather a lot of people's minds: ""Is it really possible to f**k up X-Men?"" After seeing the movie, I personally found the answer to be ""no"". This is definitely the inferior of the X-Tril but that isn't a bad thing. The first two were amazing films, not just super hero flicks. The first two X-Men settle in a realm with Batman Begins, the only three super hero movies that I think live in a world that feels like it could be our own. X3 falls into the realm of the ""super hero-y"" feel but as far as that goes I find it to be the better of most movies of that path.Brett Ratner gets offered scripts and shoots them in a way that will appeal to the majority of people. He is not a nerd, he is not a dork and he is not even a fan boy. I would be surprised if the man has ever read X-Men books or any comics for that matter and I certainly don't care for that kind of passionless director sneaking into a beloved genre franchise. I call this movie, The Brett Ratner Deception. He mimicked the first two films to the best of his abilities and deceived me into thinking it was a somewhat rushed offshoot of the Bryan Singer masterpieces. For this I am pleased and not overly cynical. I didn't quake in my soul foundations and I didn't feel much emotional connection but I found my peace.There be many surprises and though the screenplay did not wow me (when stealing Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men plot, why did they not see it fit to put this movie in the hands of a talented writer and committed human being such as...oh say...JOSS WHEDON...and maybe not give directing duties to Mr. Brett Lohan and instead offer the helm to wonderous genre mind similar to...oh right...JOSS effing WHEDON). Anyhoo...where was I? X-Men 3: The Last Stand is not an amazing film but it a badass action flick with committed actors that are obviously still amazing despite all other aspects. The shout out to ""I'm the Juggernaut, Bitch"" was hilarious as lame as it felt and Kitty Pryde was so great that I want her to have her own spin off. I've always hated Ice Man...Rogue needed to do something else, Storm was way better than she has been in any film and the moment before the click of the credits with Magneto at the chess board definitely put a smile on my face. And make sure you stay until after the credits.As a concluding chapter of an epic trilogy, it's fine. As a super hero flick, it's great. Forget all the negative buzz and try to have a good time with the movie and I think you will find yourself pleasantly surprised. I miss the times when I left a movie and talked about the parts of it that I liked as opposed to the parts that I disliked. Cynical viewpoints are easy to take in this world of imperfectness but when you step back and relax and really absorb what X-men 3 is, I would say it is a far better film than anything we have had in a long time and possibly anything we will be given for a while. I look forward to Bryan Singer's Superman Returns and of course, the next two Pirates of the Caribbean installments which look to me as if they could be the making of one of the better told trilogies of all time. We'll just have to see.Go see the movie. Try and enjoy. If not...well, there are at least 3 more movies from that Universe lined up and I predict the wind in the sails will change.

They left the plot and ruined the characters. They killed off three of the good characters, three lost their powers and it had no guidelines. I am a HUGE X-men fan but they went off and made the movie how they saw fit, leaving everything anyone knows about the actual X-men comic out. It is a waste of movie. I highly suggest NOT seeing it. I waited and waited to see this movie, and i now regret it. I know i am also not the only one that was disappointed with the movie. I went with many others who felt the same as me.

1784,Setay11,"Jesus, Stan, why did you put your name on it?",4,26 May 2006,"The whole movie, while entertaining, was a travesty to the rise of the phoenix . Scott had a grand total of about 6 lines, most of which where pertaining to Jean and whining about her I'm sure he'd have had better lines if he wouldn't have died in the first 25 minutes of the movie. If killing off a founding member, and leader of the Original Xmen, AFTER humiliating him, wasn't enough, (Prof. X said that Scott was a broken, hollow shell of a man after Jean died, which proverbially removed Cyclops' balls) they had to kill Prof. X himself. PROF. X DIES. HE DIES. The man which the Xmen is founded about dies, in the middle of the movie. If this weren't bad enough they do all of this whilst peppering the plot with cheesy one liners that seem to plague the summer box office. IF THAT weren't enough, they also took a shot at screwing with Rogue. Rouge WILLINGLY gives up her powers and takes the mutant serum to be with Iceman, whom she claims is only after her for her body beforehand, and with this knowledge, gives up her powers so that she can ""touch"" Bobby. Wolverine and Beast also take it upon themselves to rid Magneto of his powers with the serum, after they all agreed that it was unthinkable for such a component to exist and even worse to use it. and after Magneto is rendered powerless, HE even gets his own crappy cliché one liner of ""what have I done"" after knowing, full well what the repercussions of his actions would be.

1786,forsakenangel_83,The worst end possible for the xmen series!,3,25 September 2006,"Right where do i start, i can say with a great deal of confidence how awful this film really is. If Singer hadn't left for Superman, this film could have been better than it actually is. OK. The fact that Halle Berry whined like an old mare about wanting Storm to have a bigger role in the film is what brought the film down to it's demise. The whole film seemed to centre more on her and Wolverine, rather than the Phoenix saga which Singer had clearly set up from the first two films. The fact that I am a huge fan of the series from comics to the TV show, every fan should know that the Phoenix is one mega kick ass mutant, so what the hell was Ratner doing by giving her a side part and standing about as Magneto's bloody aide????????? Phoenix had one good scene in the film with her confrontation with Xavier. But this was still not as good as it could have been. The film did have it's plus points, the scene with Pyro and Iceman is one helluva fight that everyone should watch! It derives away so much from the content from comics, with characters such as Rogue, Cyclops and Xavier, they had small pitiful roles which Ratner should be ashamed of. They are awesome characters and not used to the films advantage. Oh I must say Kelsey Grammar was a welcome addition to the cast as Beast! Thats one other plus to the film that Beast finally made his entrance! I do hope to GOD that this film is re-made and made the way which it should be. Scrap Storm all together I say, that will teach Halle Berry a lesson!!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1787,pedro3,"great movie,like the first two",10,26 May 2006,"movie is great,shorter than i would like it to be,but i could watch new x-men movie every day and not every 3 years so this is my subjective opinion. end credits scene and scene where magneto is moving the chess figure gives me hope that there will be more of x-men movies with this great and some new actors. also i don't have a feeling that this is it and this few details give a hope to everyone that there will indeed be more movies and i hope sooner than 3 years. i also hope that movie will earn much money. i can't describe the feeling after i see the new x-men movie for the first time. it is similar with most of my favorite movies,like star wars,terminator and some more. i am very excited and cannot wait to see it but afterwards i am sad because the movie is over. there are probably more of people who have the same feeling. action scenes are maybe the best in all three x-men movies and there are definitely most mutant vs.mutant fights. i don't see why magneto didn't just eliminate wolverine and colossus at the end,but there wouldn't be such a good last fight scene then. wolverine is my favorite character and i think that Hugh Jackman did a great job and can't imagine anyone other taking that part. maybe he should have tried it with storm rather than jean,cause she's got a crush on him i think. and halle is much better than famkee.

The script contains a number of plot twists and tastefully deviates from the original comics allowing for future additions in the movie series. A fantastic job was done with the directing, making this movie better executed than the first two. Although the background of the new characters introduced in this sequel was not discovered in depth, they were given enough space to leave lasting impressions. The special effects were well taken care of though not to the scale of movies like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.

Every thing that occurs in this movie is completely undone by the ending. Furthermore, the plot is so contrived that I only finished watching it because I was unable to receive my money back. They should have waited for Bryant Singer to finish Superman Returns to make this movie. At least he never gave mutants the wrong names or powers. Seriously, since when can Callisto sense other mutants or travel quickly? I call lame on this movie.

The movie is based on a comic book, a normal person would think it's like the comic book, but what do movie goers & Xmen Fans get....they get the feeling of ""that's it"" when they leave the theater and where did this story line come from...X-Men 1 great, X-Men 2 great....X-Men 3 - Pathetic.The only good part of the movie were the action sequences and Storm (Halle Berry) actually kicking some butt. Wolverine was awesome, as usual. I would have never chosen Anna Paquin to play Rogue, she has been a major disappointment over the three movies...Either way, what a disappointment this movie has been for me and I am sure glad that I didn't pay for the ticket because then I would have been even more disappointed.Do yourselves a favor and rent it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1792,Blpropst,Nice But Still Wanting,8,4 June 2006,"I just saw the movie and let me just say this, WOW! I really enjoyed this film, with all the action and butt kicking, as well as the sentimental moments which spring to you from the middle of no where. Let me tell you that I did not expect that some of the things that happened would happen to the people they happened to, very surprising. The visual effects were great and I can see why the movie cost so much to make. I felt that it should have been longer though. I think that they crammed to much into a hour and forty three minutes. Maybe I'm just a geek but I wanted see more power use by some of the other lesser mutants. Over all it was a great movie so I give it two claws...uh...I mean thumbs up. Oh ya, did I mention there's a twist? BP",X-Men - The Last Stand
1793,California-Recall,"Travesty, thy name is X-Men 3",1,1 July 2006,"Please, if you want to see one block buster film this year, and get the most out of your viewing enjoyment don't see this film. Seeing it in the theaters is a waste on a film you would rent for a day and get advanced credit, for an early return.As many people who go and see the X-Men film series, I was an avid fan of the Marvel Universe. The way this movie was presented, I was surprised that Stan Lee even had any representation creatively on this film. Even for the the Marvel Universe this film was far stretched.For the life of me, I still am unaware why it took Rogue THREE films to develop her natural southern accent. I understand that she doesn't have her super strength or ability to fly yet, because she doesn't steal Ms. Marvel's powers until later in her teenage years.I went to see this film, as one of the thousands of Juggernaut fans, and jeez...all that wait for nothing. I give props to the actor that played as ""Sphinx"" from Gone in 60 Seconds for his acting, but what they had in that film, was no Juggernaut...just a guy in a red suit.Juggernaut was an unstoppable force, with immense strength. When Magneto, Juggernaut and crew met at Jean Grey's childhood home, it sickened me. Charels Xavier wheeled his butt right past Juggernaut not even exchanging a glance to him. THEY WERE BROTHERS! For god sakes...Xavier was the ENTIRE reason he wore his helmet! Because Kane (Juggernaut) was completely physically invulnerable, the only thing that could stop him was a powerful psychic...aka the professor.At the very end it saddened me to no length, when Juggernaut was defeated...BY RUNNING INTO A WALL. Supposedly, it was because being in the room with the kid that could nullify mutant powers took away his strength. But, did they over look the fact, that Juggernaut's invincibility, came from a magical crystal...which is by no means mutant in it's origin? But of course they did.All together, if I could give this film a rating lower then a 1 I would have. This film may have the names of infamous Marvel characters, but is nothing more then a cheap knock-off. If this is what is to be expected from future X-Men film (if any more are to be brought out), this is one fan, that's going to take what's left of the charred ashes of remembrance and part ways.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1794,gmtimmons-1,Disappointing at best ...,3,26 May 2006,"I would have to agree with a previous reviewer who said it appeared they would come up with a cool stunt or effect and then adjust the movie to include it. Not only was the story unfaithful to the comics but also the previous movies. I can't imagine Magneto from the first two movies saying ""send in the pawns first"" when referring to fellow mutants. The stunts and effects are spectacular but the movie that binds them together is rather dismal. There are all the new characters that are nothing more than window dressing. Ideas and characters from the comics are dropped in as lip service rather than as any kind of plot. It is far from being in the same league as the first two X-Men movies. but Superman 3 does come to mind. In the months leading up to the release many fans were upset that the director and screenwriters were creating a movie that could not have another sequel. Now the fear is shifting to the possibility that they will.",X-Men - The Last Stand

However, Magneto's object displacements (like the ambush on the convoy) were a bit cheezy and hard to believe. Anyway, it was still fun and I don't think I wasted my money.",X-Men - The Last Stand

This movie was by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen (and I saw an American haunting). The characters were either not explained at all or were so one dimensional with cheesy one liners such as ""that was my last cigar"" (wolverine). I feel sorry for the people who stayed in their seats just to see that five second piece of crap at the end. The director did not stay true to the characters at all.Misteque getting turned into a human WTF. I am sorry but Singer you would have don't a MUCH better job.The supposed CLIMAX battle at the end was so bland. When you think of great final battles, you think of The Chronicales of Narnia. Instead we were forced to sit through twenty minutes of punching and car throwing.The director tried to compile easily three movies into one.Killing off three main character was a horrible mistake. I just feel bad because if/when they come out with X4 they wont be able to bring back these characters without some good screen writing.Ihonestly think that this director had something against Marvel comics because no true X-Men fan would create this monstrosity.This director needs to get kicked in the nuts....HARD! Rogue took the freaking cure! THat was a huge mistake.Iceman was a whiny shallow pussy Kitty cried most of the time and wines.Scott crys and dies.Wolverine: was the only character that i thought did an okay job.Storm: Turns into an angry cold bitch.Beast: FRASIER????? MAGNETO: LOOSES HIS POWERS (only to get them back in the end) apparently he is special and can withstand FOUR FREAKING SHOT OF ""The Cure"" Jean Grey: I easily killed off and this is suppose to be the climax.I was sadly disappointed the only thing that keeps me going is POTC 2",X-Men - The Last Stand

Some of it was alright, but much of it did not really expand on the other movies. The only thing I liked about it was it had a lot of action scenes, which were really good. Some of the characters had totally different personalities, not because they had a secret or anything but because they were just different to the last one. If you liked the first two, then probably don't see this one because it may ruin the goodness of it for you. But it is a good action one, some really good fighting scenes, and new characters, obviously. The only thing I didn't like about the new characters part is that they didn't really expand on the characters, they didn't really show who they were or they're past, except on a select few.",X-Men - The Last Stand

In fact, some of the best special effects ever in any movie. If you like eye-candy, go see this movie. If you liked the first & second film, go see this movie. If you're a fan of superhero movies, go see this movie. There is nothing cheesy about this movie. There is humor from time to time. If you haven't seen X2, then don't see this movie!

1800,wezzo_0702,X-Men The Last Stand Not Only Makes It's Stand But Also Delivers Incredible Acting!!,10,28 May 2006,"I must say having read a lot of reviews i was very nervous about X-Men The Last Stand, but having experienced it on May 26th 2006 i must say X-Men The Last Stand definitely delivers.First of all for those who don;t know the story, basically it picks up i assume form the film about 2 or 3 months after X2, everyone is still shaken up from the death of their former team mate Jean Grey, especially Cyclops. Also there is a cure for mutation which has been generated from the Leech (a mutant who has the power to rid another mutants power in his presence) , so the X-Men must decided whether they retain their uniqueness or become like everyone else.Meanwhile back at the X-Mansion, Wolverine and Storm have discovered the body of Jean Grey at Alkali Lake and also Cyclops Glasses! They bring her back to the mansion only to discover that she is being controlled by her alter-ego persona, the PHOENIX! Jean Grey loses control over the Phoenix and escapes after a raunchy session with Wolverine. Now the world are split into three, the humans who will do anything to cure mutation, Magneto and his brother Hood of mutants who will kill at will those who get in the way of them and the X-Men who are stuck in the middle.The acting in this third and supposedly last instalment is phenomenal, Sir Ian Mc Kellan reprises the role as Magneto and does a terrific job as always, Hugh Jackman gets better with each film, Halle Berry has definitely improved and Patrick Stewart gives acting beyond X2. For the newcomers, we have Kelsey Grammar as Beast who was just absolutely funny, Ben Foster aka Angel who brought some emotion to the film, Ellen Page as Shadow Cat was simply adorable and funny, she definitely kicked ass! Along with Dania Rimerez as Callisto, but if i had to give an award for the best acting, i would without a doubt give it to Fmake Janssen who portrayed Jean Grey/ Dark Phoenix magnificently. from the charming and comforting Jean Grey we all knew from X1 AND 2, to the fierce jet black eyes of Dark Phoenix.In regards to the action, it was simply fantastic, it was so tense, especially the scene in the Grey House, was simply emotional, shocking and xciting, without giving too much away, let's just say Dark Phoenix gives Magneto and Professor X a piece of her mind. The effect of the Dark Phoenix were sensational too, she may not have the flames like the comics but they definitely did justice, Basically whenever she used her powers, everything just disintegrated into ash. Also the Golden Gates Bridge seen is fantastic, all hands to Magneto, oh one thing that i would like to add is Storms battle sequences were satisfying, she flies finally! Along with Magneto and yes Dark Phoenix! I think most of all, the emotion was heightened in this epic instalment, there were some very emotional moments and some pure laughter coming from the Beast.Another thing was the length of the film, 1hr 45mins, it doesn't sound long but it feels ages, definitely OK with time.Another factor was the deaths of characters, well for Cyclops, he was killed about 30mins into the film because Jean Grey killed him by sucking his soul or something, but i thought this really worked caused all the audience just gasped in shock, another character was Mystique, she didn't die but she got shot by the cure to save Magneto, this again was very shocking but really worked as you felt so sorry for her, and most of all Professor X, this was the highest point of my emotions, basically he was killed by his favourite student, Jean Grey! I won't go into detail cause it is really that fantastic but it was so sad cause Wolverine and Storm are battling their way through to try and save him but were too late and the last shocker was Magneto being stabbed by the cure, this was again really shocking as Magento is like the one, but don't worry Dark Phoenix gets her revenge. Literally.Speaking of Dark Phoenix, i've heard that people thought she was too powerful, for god's sakes she the only class 5 mutant and she's the most powerful too, even more powerful than Magneto and Professor X, in the comic she nearly destroyed the universe but in the film she only destroyed the island of Alcatraz, so don;t start bullshitting about Drak Phoenix being too powerful, she's only mutant.Sequels? Well Fox are definitely making Wolverine and Magneto prequels, and X3 left it so there could be sequels so i wouldn't be surprised in a few years time i'll be watching X4, but i think enough has been done with these characters now, as much as i am infatuated by them i think the Last Stand definitely is the Last Stand. Maybe they could introduce new characters like Psyloche, Forge, Gambit, Polaris, Kid Omega, Multiple Man, Arc Light and the Sentinels!! Even though the majority that i said did make a cameo appearance, they could definitely elaborate and develop these characters.Like i said, X-Men The Last Stand definitely delivers, despite losing a bit of 'Singer' touch, Ratner has definitely pulled it off. I think if there were to be an X4, they should definitely collaborate Singer and Ratner, that would be the ultimate X-Men Movie!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1801,Jeangrey94,Great!,9,7 July 2006,"I think this movie was the BEST installment in the X-men series. It's definitely worthwhile to go watch this movie.SPOILERS!!!!! I was very mad that Scott died the first 30 minutes of the movie. He and Jean were in the spotlight during the Phoenix Saga in the comics and they turned it into a Jean/Logan movie. I was very disappointed that a such a great love-story was changed so drastically. It might be good to watch for Jean/Logan fans but sad for us Jean/Scott fans. Although I understand that James Marsden couldn't do the entire film because he was also filming Superman Returns at the same time.I loved how they portrayed Beast. They certainly stuck with the comics with him. Beast was smart and witty and had a great sense of humor. Praise Beast! Rogue was too over-dramatic. I never thought she would give up her powers to be 'cured' in the comics but she did. I think she did that because of seeing Bobby with Kitty, I think that brought her back to reality. Rogue 'cured' herself as insurance, now she can touch her next boy friend and leave Bobby in the dust but I don't that will happen since after the ending it is shown that the 'cure' is only temporary. It seems as though it only surpresses the X-gene.Kitty. I hated how she was portrayed and I hated her lines and I hated how she was acted. In the comics Kitty is kind of an annoying little sister to the rest of the X-men but here she was too grown up. She was too serious to be Kitty Pryde. I understand that directors have to change a couple of things to make a full length film but Kitty was changed TOO much.I liked Warren. He was timid like most people when they discover a drastic change in themselves. And I was glad he didn't take the cure. He accepted that he was different than other people and just because is father had the money, he didn't have to change the way he was.Phoenix was AMAZING! I noticed that Famke didn't have too many lines towards the end but her effect were awesome. She totally reminded me of Phoenix in the comics. I also liked how they copied the Phoenix Saga by having her return to her home. Those scenes were very cool and very breath-taking.The effects overall were amazing I only saw one flaw when Angel (Warren Worthington III) was flying after he jumped thru the window in his father's lab.Overall I give this movie a 9/10 because, although many things were changed, in a unbiased X-men fan opinion this was a great film. IT had lots of different aspects of it and it handles many things at once and done very nicely. The movie had a timeless message: You shouldn't change who you are just to fit in.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1802,zumabp28,People are being way too hard on this extremely fun comic book film...,7,26 May 2006,"I saw it tonight and loved it. Yes I am a recovering comic book geek. No they don't follow the comic book continuity exactly. Name one comic book movie that has! You can't. Instead we got exactly more of what we got before in the last two installments. Characters that we care about i.e. wolverine, professor x etc. Thrilling set pieces and cool bad guys. Some of it gave me chills and even brought a tear to my girlfriends eye. (who isn't a x- men fan btw) There are a lot of cameos and easter eggs in this one for the HARDCORE x-men geeks like me. But its still very accessible to the every day moviegoer. So I give Brett Ratner credit on this. Ratner did the best he could in the limited about of time he had to make this movie(and it was limited) and therefore parts of it feel a little rushed. It feels like it could have used another 15-20 minutes. The good news is though, that you will probably get it on the DVD that is sure to be released later this year. It doesn't follow any x-men storyline exactly but ya know what? THAT IS OK! They got the spirit of the characters right. I'll admit it wasn't as good as part 2 but it was definitely better than part 1 and this is most assuredly NOT the last stand...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1803,RunyonOHS10,Probably one of the worst hero movies to date....,2,14 August 2006,"I myself am i bit of an X-men fan, though not a hardcore one. Being as such i don't know ever X-men and their names and powers etc. Yet, even still this movie was a GIGANTIC let down, so i can only pretend to feel what the die-hard X-men fan boys must've gone through when they witnessed this catastrophe to the films.There were far too many problems with this movie to mention them all here, so ill just go over a few basics. First off, the biggest mistake was casting a new director. Especially one that, if you actually watched the movie you could tell, has no respect for the previous two movies or the XMen universe itself. Why the idiotic producers didn't wait for the original director to finish Superman i don't know. Although that Ratner (or whatever his name is) did have a nice touch in the since of bringing in some nice cameos and new characters, he failed miserably doing them justice. And to make matters even worse, those characters that he didn't want to use he just KILLED off! Cyclopes gets offed by Pheonix within the first 15 minutes of the film, and Prof. X doesn't exactly share too much of a better fate then ol' Scott. As well, guys like Angel and Pheonix herself (to whom one of the MANY fragmented story lines revolves around) are hardly brought to justice. The only thing Angle does is fly out of a window and catch his pops from falling to his death, and Pheonix literally stands around as a big war is going on for 10 minutes, THEN decides to out of no where **** everything up just for the sake of being able to put in 'pretty visuals' in the movie. AS well, when making a movie, don't use multiple story lines and hope to pull it off within an hour n a half, its not gonna happen. You never even really find out any information about the 'Cure' or Pheonix and why she is like she is, or even receive the names of HALF of the characters in the film. It's almost as if this Ratner guy decided to take the gem that is the X-Men movies and crumble it into a lil ball and turn it into a crappy nonstop action movie. It's almost as if its the Action version of a Porn, where there is no story, its all about the action. For example, what in the world happened to Nightcrawler and Gambit? Weren't they both supposed to be in this film? How come it never even hints to us as to why Nightcrawler suddenly decided to resign from the fight and disappear from the face of the world? And i like how it starts off with the future of Sentinels killing off all mutants in the Danger Room, but oh.. never tells you why or whats going on, or even what either of them are. As well, the music just SUCKED HORRIBLY. I'm almost considering that even all the Star Wars Pre-Trilogy were better films then this, and thats saying something-not including the first one, that wasn't too bad-(but Ep. 2 was by far a mockery and the worst scifi movie ever made). A comic-book movie doesn't have to be all action to be a good comic-book movie, take V for Vendetta for example, there's only maybe 4 or 5 action scenes in it and that movie kiss ass, V is by far the coolest hero ever. And how does a movie with so little action manage to be such a great movie? Uhmmm, ah yes, BECAUSE IT'S STORY IS EXCELLENT. No story and character development, no need to even bother with it. I wouldn't even recommend this for buying on DVD after it goes below the 10 bucks mark. It's a rent at best. If they do decide to make a 4th installment, make it right, and hopefully get XMEN outta the whole that the Batman n Robin and Tomb Raider equaled film X3 has put it into.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1804,jelanna2005,Best Movie Ever,10,26 May 2006,"X-men 3 was simply amazing! While I loved Bryan Singers portrayal, I love Brett Ratner's almost better. The movie was very fast paced, very colorful, very interesting. It was in fact darker than the first two, but in a very good way. There were parts that made me sad, made me laugh, made me happy, and parts that were very exciting! A lot of people think Storm got too much screen time, and while she did get a lot, I wouldn't say it was over the top or anything. MAny of the characters had small yet oh so important parts, like Rogue for example: she was the main focus of X1 it seemed but in this was she was a very good supporting role, she was important like I said. And people complain about Colossus, but his role in this one was larger than in the first two, so yeah. Over all GREAT movie!",X-Men - The Last Stand

I say yes.X-Men:The Last Stand is packed with emotional and physical depth, and it needs to be understood. Most people are out there crushing this movie by it's length,and how cheesy it is. At the very end, (SPOILER)Erik after he loses his powers points at a chess piece and it moves, ever so slightly. I thought that was the cheese king of cheesy moments in movies, losing it's perfect movie status.(SPOILER END)(spoiler warning will not happen any longer)One of the most fantastic and memorable moments in comedic history is in this movie.""I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!""

1806,candiegal,I still have butterflies in my stomach,8,28 June 2006,"short and sweet comment...A must-go- and see movie, don't wait for DVDSo there is a few seconds clip right at the end of the credits, it makes you wonder what that is all about.Overall I think this movie was best out of 3, even though a lot of characters like Rouge and Cyclops did not get a lot of scenes, the movie was very magical, it was shocking, it isn't predictable, good animation, its emotional, has light humour and bits of romance. The disadvantage is as everyone else says that it is rushed.People who say this movie is bad, is because it doesn't really have a plot. BUT if your one of those people who don't care about a plot, and just like to watch good movies that make you emotional, and fun to watch then go ahead and watch it(REPEAT:if you have watched a movie and you liked it, but people say it is rubbish because it hasn't a plot but you don't know WHY they don't like it..then you should watch xmen)Definitely a movie you should go out to the movies and WATCH- you wont be disappointed (if you don't care about the plot -if you liked the last two you will love this one. Its 8/10 for me.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1807,carla_g13,I just so x -men III and .....(spoilers),6,27 May 2006,"I went with great expectation waiting to see what Ratner and the new writers were going to bring to this movie. I never thought they could actually made it wrong. But they surely succeed in that. Don't get me wrong, the action part was great, and it is a pretty entertaining movie, but it is NOT at all what I expected. Here is the deal, the movie have still this great characters that we all felt in love with on the two first movies (and for those who new X-men from comic book and cartoons it was even better). You also get excellent new character, beast, Juggernaut, angel, kitty pryde,Callisto among others that like me could not wait to see them in action. But then you see the movie and you wonder why are they even there.... Angle didn't do anything he just showed his wings and THAT WAS IT. the other ones did not do that much. I believe if they could not develop better story lines for the new caracther because worrying about the Leigh of the movie, so the should not include them. About the plot of the movie. there were two different, that they did not actually went accordingly with each other. you've get the part went Jean returns as a Phoenix and the one were they ""humans"" discovered the ""cure"" for the mutant problem. This too written in a MUCH BETTER WAY could have made an excellent movie, but what we got was two different movies that collied one with the other.... you don't know what is going on if you don't pay really good attention. I got nothing against Ratner.I thought that ratner could have made a much better movie cos he has done the Rush hour franchise, he has done Red Dragon which were great movies. I don¡t know what happened to him. We, as X men fan are really hard to pleased. Even more after the first two movies, but you got all the actors from the original two movies, you got the big studios support. AND YOU MADE THIS MOVIE... this is just playing wrong. I don't know what will you think when you wacth it. I just hope you aren't as disappointed, sad , confused , frustrated as me. I just hope, because of the end of the movie. we actually will get a FINAL X MEN MOVIE that will be worth it watching and remembering. So... enjoy.. and then tell us what do you think about it!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1808,longbaugh45,An awful third installment in the X - Men franchise,3,29 May 2006,"This horrible film wastes your time from beginning to end. Everything about this film seems rushed and sloppy. Ratners direction is all over the place, and really has nothing to offer. The acting is very poor, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is far too emotional, Storm (Halle Berry) is bland and boring like she is in most films, and Frasier Beast (Kelsey Grammar) has somewhat the same attitude and emotion through the entire film.It took marvelous hacks of writers to mess this great plot up. There was little to none character development, The dialogue was cheesy, corny, and just plain boring.There were plenty of of characters that weren't even needed like porcupine face, that guy who multiplied, or they just weren't used like angel who could of been used in various parts of the film, and Colussus who also could of been used but wasn't. One more thing is it was a bad decision to not have Nightcrawler in the film, he had the best and funnest part in X2 but for some reason he wasn't in this one and they didn't even give an explanation as to why he wasn't in this one.A huge let down for me and I think many X - Men fans are or will be disappointed by this film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1809,janine53,What the?!?!,2,27 May 2006,"Like many of you, I grew up on X-men: x-men comics, x-men animated series, etc... and like many of you, so incredibly disappointed, saddened, and just plain angry. This movie was far from being the truth when it came to the comics and the animated series! Did the writers think that there would be some actual x-men fans going to see this movie? After the first two installments of X-men I was so excited for this one! Sure, the other two were a bit off but they were still wonderful and this, well... this was just plain ridiculous! Xavier dies? Xavier dies?! Phoenix dies...Cyclops dies... 1/3 of the main characters that made X-men as great as it was died, the other 1/3 of the X-men characters lost their powers (Rogue, Magneto, Mystique....) and who is left? Wolverine, Storm, and Iceman (who had a very small role). Coincidentally, 2 out of the 3 are the ""stars"" of this film.By the way, am I the only one or did I NOT see flames accompanying Phoenix? When she got in her rage her face looked more like a zombie than that of this magnificent ""goddess"". Also, Juggernaut was NOT a mutant yet when he went near the ""leech"" he mysteriously lost his strength and bumped his head against the wall. Because he is not a mutant, he should have been able to break through! How about Moriah? They did not even explain who she was! Pretty much, this film went spiraling downhill once they killed off Xavier. Again: did any of the writers or director give a crap about the actual fans? Oh and, whatever happened to Gambit? Why wasn't he ever introduced?! I think one of thehigh points of this film was The Beast played by Kelsey Grammar. He was wonderful! The effects were wonderful.My boyfriend's family and I stayed until the very end of the film completely shocked and listing all it's flaws and yet, there were three signs of hope: 1) When Magneto was in the park by himself with the chess he was able to slightly move the chess piece (couldn't help but recall how in the beginning of the movie it was said that the ""cure"" is only temporary) and 2) when Xavier was giving a lecture to his students he put on a video of Moriah with an unconscious man and they were questioning whether or not it was possible for a conscious mind to be placed in an unconscious body and right at the end there is a scene with Moriah in the same room and the man says ""Hello Moriah"" and she says ""Charles?"" and lastly 3) The film never really showed if Cyclops died, they just implied it.I am hoping and praying that this is really not ""The Last Stand"". They completely butchered the actual ""X-Men"" stories. Seeing that the film ended so ""openly"" I am hoping they bring it back (with a better director and writing crew of course) and they give actual justice to X-Men. This was such an incredible disappoint being that I have been a fan for so long. This really cannot and should not be the end.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1810,mad_zombie_killer,terrible movie,1,25 September 2006,"Many Spoilers Ahead.What was the director, writers and producers thinking no wonder Bryan Singer jumped ship.I am only going to list some of the major errors these people made.1) Cyclops dies, 2) Professor X dies, 3) Mystique turns human, 4) Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, 5) Rogue turns human, 6) Magneto turns human, 7) Jean Grey/Phoenix is a total waste of time and gets killed in a really rubbish way, 8) The script is terrible and last why did they bother with Beast and AngelAll I will say is No X-Men 4",X-Men - The Last Stand
1811,MithAstalder,Great Movie,9,31 May 2006,I am a great fan of the X-men and the movies. This is supposed to be the last movie. I say that if they do make another movie and include the Storm character they should go with somebody else. My first pick would be Grace Jones or even Gina Torres of Firefly fame. At least then the Storm character would be stronger as I and other readers know Storm as. Even eluding to another movie or open ending a movie is OK which in my opinion they did with the subtle hints. I also agree with some of the other commentator's that I read that this shouldn't be the end of the saga that is the X-men. Also it is my opinion that they should stick with how the characters are and shouldn't stretch the character to make it more realistic. If that means they need more special effects then so be it. Thank you for listening to my comments.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1812,joseffelix,Good Entertainment - Great Special FX,8,26 May 2006,"If you want to see a good action movie with fabulous sfx just choose this one. For 140 minutes you will find yourself enjoying a simple and graphically superb movie. When you go to the cinema and choose a movie like X-Men or Matrix or Terminator 2 you don't expect to see in the credits names like Woody Allen or Paul Thomas Anderson. You just go there for the fun of seeing something that pushes the limits of reality one step ahead and plays a little bit with your fantasies and imagination. This is just what X-Men 3 is. Pure and simple fun even though strong themes like racial discrimination are introduced but only approached superficially. For those that know/read the comics: I've been reading the comics for over 20 years now. Don't expect to see the comics translated faithfully in to a movie. You will be disappointed. This movie is also for you, but mainly is an action movie that depends on the money that everyone pays to see it to generate profits. If you love the comics and will hate to see them torn apart in a movie based on them stay at home. John Byrne, one of the plotters and the penciler of the original stories that were used for X-Men's 3 screenplay (the Dark Phoenix Saga) choose to not see the movie and I can understand why. The original story, in my opinion one of the best comic books stories ever to be published, is almost unrecognizable in the movie. Everything is changed. Don't go to the cinema searching for the comics. Just go for the fun and enjoy a great action movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1813,fernandes369,Worst X-Men movie ever total disappointment,1,29 May 2006,"I always liked X-Men although not knowing all about the characters and stuff, and I liked the first two movies they are not a masterpiece but they're good but this last one loses almost all the quality maybe because the change in direction if I'm not mistaken, all that the film got is special effects and buckets of supposed mutants, I hate the screenplay,I hate the ending, I hate the fact that the director decided to almost kill all the x-men team in this movie that's just stupid, and the movie is full of glitches, I name some of them, at the end wolverine as to kill Jean of course it's logical specially when you just wasted four vials of the cure on Magneto so instead of grabbing one of the ground or saving some and save Jean by taking her powers away and let her live NO HE KILL HER, VERY LOGICAL, Prof. Xavier died of course is just the guy that started X-men so why keeping him it's better to KILL HIM FOR NO REASON, and during the attack at the labs Jean (a level 5 mutant that just think in destroying everything) just stood there and at the end she thought: ""well now that 20 Min's of the film passed I'm going to destroy all this because I just stood here watching the brotherhood and X-Men fight each other while I was sleeping"" who and nice introduction to Angel after all that chat and all his role is to appear for 2 seconds in the film to save is father. oh and the brotherhood had many mutants but the great majority of them had the incredible power of running and dying because that was all they have done. It was better to put 10 or 15 mutants that actually had powers than put thousands of figurines doing nothing. I could go on and on but I made my point so I think it's better to read comics at least they worth the money spent ;)",X-Men - The Last Stand
1814,djgrandfield,"pretty much trash, as compared to the first two. Make sure you see it as a matinée",3,27 May 2006,"Honestly, this movie was such a major letdown. I'm a big fan of the x-men series so far, but this was unreal. The acting was a celebration of mediocrity and the script itself was borderline awful. I mean, ""a cocoon of telekinetic energy""? come on guys, this movie straight blew. What was kelsey Grammar (Frasier and Beast) doing here anyway? talk about your miscasts. Lastly, I don't have a clue why they didn't have Bryan Singer direct this one like he did X1 and X2. Brett Ratner was clearly not up to par. I'm sorry to disrespect those of you who enjoyed the film, but I guess it just didn't live up to the hype or my expectations. Make sure you do the matinée thing, i'd hate to see someone blow $10 when they could burn $7 instead.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1815,chris-3061,Disapppointed...,6,18 October 2006,"I agree with all of the other posts here, that this movie was seriously lacking in terms of story and character development. I felt myself asking a lot of questions throughout the movie that I assumed would be answered during the movie. But they never were.Also, I found it odd that Nightcrawler was not in it, but there was nothing to explain his absence (did he go back to Germany? Is he vacationing in Vermont?).Whether or not you are an X-men fan, you will probably not like this movie. The special effects are great, but that's really all that it has going for it. Most of the actors do a great job with what they've had handed to them (except Halle Berry, who I consider a terrible actress), but I just can't honestly state that this is a ""good"" movie.I received this movie on DVD as a gift, but I doubt I will be re-watching this one very often.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1816,mrbrightside1986,a different direction than the previous 2 movies but fantastic none the less,10,25 May 2006,"I LOVED the movie... I'm from Scotland and it was released here 25th may 2006. I just couldn't BELIEVE the effects that happened, but to be honest the story could have been much better. I don't like how the phoenix story is explained as it is clearly made that jean becomes the phoenix at the end of xmen 1... (for you ppl that don't know, it's supposed to be when magneto's statue of liberty/mutant creator/thing is supposed to turn everyone into mutants that the phoenix force is to come into contact with jean, therefor, that is how we see her gasping/shocked after it is destroyed), not that it has simply been a part of her for the whole time since Xavier and magneto met her as is explained in xmen 3! The story line in the movie jumps from character to character without much inter loop. It can jump from one scene to the other but you can still figure out where the story is going. One thing that really got me was the fact that in one scene, kitty pryde is an innocent student taking part in a classroom discussion with Xavier, and the next after his parting, she is suddenly a main character in a room with iceman, storm, wolverine and beast. Where is the gradual trust/bond that is made up through the previous 2 movies that makes the characters an 'x-man'? It's obviously missed with this movie and throws kitty straight into the limelight which was slightly disturbing (just like the fact that she takes it upon herself to save the mutant at the source of the 'cure').I would love to go into detail about the movie as so many things remain unanswered but I can't spoil it for the other fans who are yet to see it. All I have to say is be prepared to laugh, cry and deal with the demise/rise of certain characters in this movie. They certainly came as a shock to me, even after reading rumours circling the web about their story in the movie, I certainly wasn't prepared for the demise of a few characters and the hurt that was shown by the others. All in all, a FANTASTIC movie that has to be seen by not only x-men fans, but by all to complete this 'supposed trilogy'.The ending of the film (the effects and the powerful end to one of the characters knocked me for six completely!), and by all means, the clip that was shown to me after the end credits also took me by surprise. Like I said 'supposed trilogy' could make it into a 4-some. I've heard certain rumours about different end credits shown to different ppl and the one I was shown featured Moria McTaggart and her patient.... If it's true, I would like to see the 'jean grey/phoenix' ending to the movie, just so it can relate to the comics and build up a story for the 4th xmen movie... but then again.. I think the probability of that is slim to none.From seeing the 'Moria McTaggart' ending and hearing about the 'Jean Grey ending', I would have LOVED if both were shown and they were intersected to create the 4th x-men movie, but that all depends on how well this movie does at the box office and how well the fans receive it.I hope and dream for someone to announce X-Men 4 so the story can continue, but with certain characters gone, it may not be entirely possible. It's up to us, the fan's, to make X-Men 3 a success and for others to make X-Men 4 a possibility..... Here's hoping we can continue the story and resurrect/reclaim the characters' demise in X-Men 3 to be a powerful resurrection to success for a hopeful X-Men 4.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1817,darkwolf2-1,X-men 3 review,8,26 May 2006,"X-men 3: The Last Stand was a solid entry in the franchise; this review will reveal some spoilers, so if you do not want to read further....stop now! Story: As most of you know the plot of the film focuses on the cure for mutation, and the many different perspectives on the issue. What i liked about the story is that for the first time Xavier in the series, is not as innocent as he appears to be, and has his own agenda for the greater good. Xaiver in a sense broke his own moral code of not entering the minds of other people, because it is unethical. Instead it is revealed that he used his power to control Jean Grey from becoming the Phoeniox; even though this was for the greater good he still broke his own teachings, deeming him as a hypocrite. Wolverine has now been forced into Cyclop's leadership role, because Cyclop's goes missing in action in the beginning of the movie. Wolverine is still the same gruff person that we all love, but now he is positioned as a teaching, a field leader, and now as Jean Grey's main love interest. He still does retain his loner personality, and shows off little infiltration abilities. Jean Grey is still very much alive, but now is forced with an inner conflict; causing her to go from a conservative (walk a straight line)person to an individual that represents anarchy. Beast is the person that fills in the gap between humans and mutants by working on a government level; it is shown that his view on the cure is conflicted by his affiliation with the government, his relationship as an X-man, and his own personal problems. Iceman is now caught up in a love triangle between Kitty Pride/Shadowcat and Rouge; he also steps up in the front line as an X-man. Angel is an example of a mutant who is persecuted for being born different. He fears his ultra conservative father for his wings, and is eventually pressured into taking the cure; however that is because of his father. Magneto is the Malcom X of the series, and continues to follow his views with the brotherhood.Good points: The trilogy ties up a number of loose ends, even though some left to be desired. The action sequences were pretty interesting. The overall story was good, and has a lot political and social messages. Got to see more mutant favorites. Special effects were pretty decent. Lots of references to the comics. Lots of shockers. And in true trilogy fashion, has a number of correlations with the first film.Bad points. Movie is to short (could at least had any other half an hour). Character development is only focused on the main group of people such as Wolverine, leaving much more desire for other characters. Arclight is ugly, and looks like Prince. Many changes from the comic books even though i totally expected that, because the material needs to fit into the film with it still making sense.Summary: X-men 3 is a decent film, i would definitely watch again, and i pray that one day there will be a director's cut or extended addition to the film. I really liked the fact that for the first time there is doubt about the way the X-men operate, and that Magneto is'not as bad as you once believed. The X-men in a sense can be view as the rich, and live a good life even though they are persecuted. The Brotherhood live at the bottom of the barrel, and try to fight for equality by all means necessary. The Humans view the mutants as a disease (like being gay), and will not tolerate them. I am sure there is more you could look into (like Xavier is like Martin Luther King and Magneto is like Malcom X, both are fighting for the same goal but by two different extremes).8/10 solid movie, comic book fans may be disappointed, wish it was longer, and that Bryan Singer still directed it (Brett Ranner is not all the bad).P.S. The scenes in the woods reminded me of Endor in Return of the Jedi, which is also the third movie of a trilogy.Do you know who i am? I'm the Juggernaut bitch!!!!!!!!!!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1818,dylan_kidwell_4,Great but not that Great movie,6,12 June 2006,"X-Men 3: The Last Stand was by far my favorite of the Trilogy but their where some things that were not all that good. Like Rogue taking the cure, Iceman and Pyro's battle and Magneto losing his powers in the end. The best parts of the movie is Famke Jannsen's portrayal of The Phoenix. The new minor characters in this film that work for Magneto did not have what was expected. Callisto have super-speed in place of being able to turn her hands into Tenatcles. And Kid Omega was not even Kid Omega. His powers are that of Quill. Psylocke also was disappointing to a fan of hers like me. He powers where only to turn invisible in place of have Telekinesis, Telepathy, and being able to create swords mentally. But again, the best portrayals in the movie are Kitty Pryde, Wolverine, Phoenix and Beast. One thing that makes this movie so great is the secret ending after the credit role. Surprisingly Professor X did not die and has gone into the body of a coma patient of Moria MacTaggert. I hope that their are future installments.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1819,cmonroe-2,Not as Good As I'd Hoped. But Got My Money's Worth,7,25 May 2006,"I think this movie followed the skeleton of a story Singer left behind. Problem is Ratner tried to cram to much in to too small a time. Who honestly would've been upset if that movie were longer than 100 minutes? No one. The beginning (Flashbacks and Danger Room) was awesome. And for a while after that. I sat in awe. How could they be doing this to characters. Now, I knew some had to die, ie Cyclops. But Christ, if you're going to kill a character who fans have been with for 2 other movies and an extended period of time. Do it with some grace. Same goes with Mystique. The professors so called death was done slightly more tastefully but still disrespectful to the fans. Beast's character was one of the higher points of the movie. But the meat of this story was lacking at best. Now. They almost made up for it with the end battle. For the most part. This too was breath taking. Other than a few mistakes (day to night????). And the end scene with Logan and Jean in my opinion was very very touching. But the Phoenix look was totally off. That was what killed this movie. She looked like something out of The Grudge or The Ring. But all in all. A decent film, and i thoroughly enjoyed them leaving it open. In my opinion however. Bryan Singer betrayed the movies that made him what he is by leaving for Superman (which looks terrible). Bryan Singer, does not deserve to come back to these films. Christopher Nolan should be brought in if a forth installment takes place. Now I know you fanboys may freak out because he's a DC guy. But he made one of the best comic book movie adaptations of all time. And Ratner should certainly stick with Rush Hour movies.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1820,JerseyFC,So so so so so bad!,1,27 May 2006,"OK, I was so excited when I got my ticket for this movie and couldn't wait to get into the theater to see it. But once it got started, I knew it was going down the toilet. The movie was too short, the writers did a HORRIBLE job and I blame Brian Singer. I think if he had directed this movie, it would have been great. But it wasn't. Don't waste your time spending the money on the movie. And the extra at the ending of it didn't do much either. If you've ever read the comics, you're going to be greatly disappointed. I have been an avid fan of the comic, especially the Phoenix, she's my favorite character. They didn't even do her justice. On the good side, the fight scenes were good, and there were some funny parts, but overall...the movie SUCKED.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1821,Jenniphur47,"Excellently done, definitely go see",10,28 May 2006,"I don't know what everyone is complaining about. For most of the movie I was in awe and on the edge of my seat. The effects are breathtaking, and for the most part held true to the comics. I think people forget that this is only a movie that is two hours, and that it is impossible to fit everything from a multi-year comic book into such a short span of time. However, it was a lot better than I expected, and I can't see how anyone who saw it can possibly argue that it was anything short of wonderful. To a fan of the comics, it's everything we could have hoped for. The only way that you would find the plot to be convoluted would be if you were both unfamiliar with the comics and had never seen either of the first two installments. People are saying that too much emphasis is placed on wolverine's character once again. I think that only what is necessary is placed on his character, but that his involvement in the events at hand, demand that he maintain a prominent role. Storm finally gets more recognition as do the younger mutants. their characters become more developed, but further development had to be spared as to not complicate and stray from the plot. as i said before, people forget this movie cant be ten hours long, like it would be if they added every inconsequential tidbit to make everyone happy. they do a really good job of delving deeper into the character's lives in this one, than in either of the first two movies.In short, definitely go see it.

1822,fhchesney,A Shame,3,31 May 2006,"I have been a follower of the X-Men universe since before I could spell the word. Now I see my heroes being slandered and botched in a ritualistic manner of a producer's desire for spectacle. Wow, explosions, fighting, power. WHOOPDIE DOO!!! Where was Gambit, where were the twins, where was the truth behind the Phoenix Force? Yes, Kelsey Grammar gave a perfect interpretation of the beast we have all come to know and love, but what about the rest? I feel that the producer could have put Brick Tamlin from Anchorman out on the Battlefield screaming with a grenade and it still would have been More relevant than the stuff they put out. I honestly pray to the god of comics and nerd media above that Stan lee's input wasn't part of this creation. yes, for those that aren't the most familiar with the film it's pretty, it's nice, it's good. but this would be like expecting Star Wars and seeing Lord of the rings-esquire stuff instead. I myself spent the following seven hours after seeing the pre-release with my brothers discussing the film until past dawn. It was like seeing a man with such potential to be unique being cut and conformed to Hollywood's desires.

1823,mike-2974,Can Wolverine get love off his mind?,9,27 May 2006,"The third and final? episode of the X-Men movie trilogy? brings us to the resolution of Logan's quest. Will he stay the lone wolf or get with the girl? The X-Men movies are all about the Wolverine, and whether true to the comics or not, X3 is true to telling a very satisfying story about love lost, love regained, and the challenges of relationships with telekinetic supermodels.This movie works for me because I am a fan of the Powerful Moment (PM). That's when the movie subtly grasps you by your emotional gonads and smoothly jerks you gratefully to your tiptoes. It seemed that every scene when Wolverine tries to ""get"" the girl, the movie pulls off this PM effect. She may play some head-games and start throwing a few dishes, breaking a few windows (awesome CGI here), yet you can't help but love her too. (Stream of Consciousness: What if Galadrial /had/ accepted the One Ring?) A few minor quibbles: The movie is a little too quick. Some characters from X1 and X2 are underused. The minor bad guys are a bit one-dimensional (unlike Sabertooth and Toad from X1, of course). Yes, Storm needs a boyfriend (the new hairdo is working). I also felt the X1 and X2 music was a tad more inspirational, but the X3 version wasn't bad and it grew on me as the film progressed.Whew, okay, now for the good. Lots of new characters and mutant abilities are introduced in X3. I had no preconceived notions going into the theater (no, I have not read the comics), so I found the new mutants easy to accept and enjoyed all the imaginative variations on their talents. The Beast stands out as a winning new character who takes on depth as an intermediary between humans and mutants. And the question is answered: What happens when you put someone who walks through walls, someone who is super dense (in body and mind), and someone who negates mutant abilities together in room? A little lowbrow and predictable, but it does entertain.No X-Men movie would be complete without Magneto wielding great monologues and large metal objects. Even his most tiniest of manipulations have great import (I gasped). It was also nice to witness Charles Xavier do his thing without Cerebro. Do we see that he has a hint of the dark side? Probably not, may be just a shadow on the screen. Finally, Mystique is always easy on the eyes, and I thought she played a nice key role although more minor than in the previous films.I know I haven't given out a plot summary or listed actor and director credits, but I feel you can get those from other reviews or when you see the movie. See it you should. I am a big fan of the Wolverine and he doesn't disappoint.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1824,theusedfan,"If you've read the comics, be prepared",8,26 May 2006,"This movie has me torn. On the one hand, it was great - the story idea, the ""cure for mutants"" was a great theme, the action sequences were interesting and enjoyable with new characters involved, seeing a plethora of mutants with different abilities, and just seeing another X-men movie in itself was satisfying. And yet, on the other hand, I felt a little let down - the story was great, but it felt like a bunch of mini-movies all sewn together without a lot of direction and continuity. It felt like emphasis was placed on some characters unnecessarily while major character arcs were happening elsewhere. And above all else, it strayed so far from the comics that I can't even justify that this is the ""movie version"" and that its okay to twist things to make it work on film. The first X-men movie was similar. It felt as though the writers/director were caught trying to find where to start out with a movie in this huge comic saga. Also, Marvel is not known for keeping things consistent or realistic, so they were faced with the difficult task of bringing in characters that have been written about for 20-40 years. You felt the pain in the movie of just learning. Plus, the budget wasn't nearly what it was on X2 or X3, so the special effects are not nearly as good as they could have been. X2 was another story. This movie found where it needed to be - it had a great story line, introduced characters appropriately, and overall allowed the audience to get engrossed in this mutant world and make you really care for the characters. It felt as though the writers had figured out how to make a ""mutant movie."" X3 will show that it obviously wasn't that simple, and they didn't learn from what X-men vs X2 could have taught them. If you liked the first two, chances are you will like this one as well. But be prepared to be disappointed by the loss of direction and the fact that the prequel, once again, was better than the sequel.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1825,shinwillyx,"X- Men made by focus groups, very very sad.",1,26 May 2006,"The only answer to this movie is a sequel, that goes back in time to prevent the events from ever happening, or a sequel that denies the the third film from the outset. Just a waste of time money and talent, don't blame the actors, I actually liked them. The blame falls on the director, writer, and producers the film feels as if they had no real concept of the comic, or what a good movie is.Peoples frustration with this film are and will be valid, the characters and issues that have made the x-men so beloved deserve a much better production that what has been cut together in this film. I really hate to sound so negative, but however down this comment sounds, whoever approved this storyline and script should have said no way!!!",X-Men - The Last Stand
1826,hoodystardust,pros and cons,10,31 May 2006,"yes, i had a few problems with this movie. it was too short and the characters were underdeveloped. everyone pretty much agrees on these points. just like everyone else, when it comes to sequels i'm a huge advocate of consistency. i told myself going into this movie that it was gonna suck b/c of the new director, writers and pretty much everyone else with the exception of the actors, obviously.but there are so many more positive points. this movie, although it doesn't strictly follow the plot outline of any comics, is more like the comics than its predecessors. the mutants actually flew, battled a sentinel in the danger room, and the threat that magneto posed was actually a serious one (unlike the mutant machine in the first installment). they didn't tack on characters, they replaced them. this kept it from getting too saturated with new mutants, even though there are a lot of cameos but that's just to satisfy the die hard fans. yeah i miss nightcrawler and cyclops did get shafted but that's nothing new. he's been a worthless character to this entire trilogy. beast was awesome, just like the comics. wolverine and jean had a great relationship. they found a different way to portray logan's ongoing pursuit of something he could never have. they could have done better with the iceman/kitty/rogue relationship. storm was worthless but that's nothing new. giving her a bigger role was a mistake. the elimination of key characters was quite jarring at first but they wouldn't have been useful in the end anyway. plus, death is always gonna stir up emotion so it's a good thing there was plenty of it. also, i'm not sure if anyone noticed but when they started this trilogy, the x-men were more or less the same as the ones in the uncanny x-men series. however, by the end of the third movie, the majority of the x-men left standing were the ones from the original comics in the sixties. so when you were watching them introduce new characters to the movie sequels, they were really going back in time in the comics. once again, this doesn't apply to all the x-men but you get the point.ratner shook things up a bit and that's exactly what this series needed. i definitely enjoyed this movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1827,socalcolonel7,An Incredibly Weak Portrayal of the X-Men,3,3 October 2007,"First off, I'll say that the first two X-Men movies were more or less well done considered what they had to work with: two and a half hour films and tons of characters that could've been worked into the screenplays. Now to the garbage known as X-Men: The Last Stand.A movie that was advertised seemingly 24/7/365 as the epic final battle of the X-Men movie series turned out to be a huge piece of crap. The writing was horrendous, jam-packed with cheesy lines to go along with weak characters, an infinite number of loose ends, a seemingly endless number of incorrectly portrayed characters, a terrible plot, and basically no ending (for a film that was supposed to be the end).I could go on for hours so I'll specify just some of my biggest issues with the movie:1) Although it's already been explained why, Nightcrawler was a no-show. Not cool. 2) Kitty Pryde is useless. 3) Iceman's realization of his full power is a pretty cool scene but doesn't come until the very end of the movie (the second movie that he has appeared in, mind you). Along the same lines, you'd think that by the third movie that they'd be able to develop Rogue as a viable character, but I guess I'm wrong for thinking that they actually would have put thought into this movie. Who am I trying to kid? 4) I find it hard to believe that Callisto, Arclight, Multiple Man, and Quill were the best characters the makers could manage to use as Magneto's best. 5) There was no point whatsoever to killing off Mystique. I'll take one Mystique any day over Callisto, Arclight, Multiple Man, and Quill combined. 6) Since when would The Phoenix and Juggernaut be characters who'd simply obey Magneto? Very weak writing. 7) Was it necessary to kill Cyclops, Jean, and Professor Xavier? 8) Way too many tough guy lines for Wolverine, Storm, and Beast, especially in the scene where Wolverine gives his big speech about being a team, about being X-Men. Not only was it completely out of character for him to do that, but the fact that he stressed the whole team aspect made them look like the Power Rangers, faceless and only distinguishable by their powers and costumes (laugh - don't even get me started). 9) Why even bother putting Colossus and Angel (both cool characters) in the movie if you plan to make them nothing more than a part of the scenery? 10) Lastly, why tease us with the Sentinel in the beginning of the ""last movie"" if you have zero intention of having the X-Men fight some bad ass Sentinels? They're obviously setting up another movie with this because they even included Trask, the guy who started the whole Sentinel project. Trask's inclusion was dumb however because he was basically a nobody in this movie while he was a major antagonist in the real story.I don't know if Brett Ratner is at fault for any of this, but it may be more than coincidence that he didn't direct the first two, and they didn't suck. As nerdy as this may sound, this film may ruin future generations of X-Men fans. It was that bad. Grrrr. I'm done now.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1828,Movie_Ben,Props to Brett Ratner,7,25 May 2006,"I watched this movie today and thought it was done quite well. The ending was superb and Phoenix kicked ass. As shown in the final shot, this cannot be the end, and I look forward to a continuation with either Bryan Singer or Brett Ratner directing. The best scene is the first fight between Juggernaut and Wolverine. Watching Vinnie Jones kick the crap out of Hugh Jackman is amazing, plus humorous. There are several cliff hangers in the movie, but they are taken almost straight from the comic series, and not really a surprise. I work at a movie theater and do not have to pay for my movies, but I would pay our going rate of $7.50 in order to see this movie. See it, you will enjoy it.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1829,de_gonzaru,"Good, but doesn't live up to previous installments",7,30 May 2006,"I was extremely depressed by this movie - not because it was really bad, but because of the plot. I won't go into any details about what happens, but the movie reminded me of the later Dragonlance novels. -_-The movie was a special effects showcase more than anything - though one notable thing they did not CG was the literal Phoenix shape (I never really read the comics, though I remember being rather fond of the phoenix-shaped fire surrounding Jean in the cartoon series). So yeah - Phoenix is basically Jean with red hair and really cool eyes + skin when she releases her power.The story was simplistic, but does deliver surprises (mostly because they were unthinkable prior to watching this). I missed the mystery elements found in the previous installments which added so much more depth to the story. This turned out to be a big action/special effects movie which had some decent acting, that shocks the viewer rather than entice them with a mysterious plot.So I'm probably a bit biased in this because I was so depressed with the way the story went, but this movie is certainly a better watch than many other superhero movies that have made the theaters *cough*Daredevil*cough*. So it's a good movie, but prepare to be depressed...7/10",X-Men - The Last Stand
1830,ndoro6,Did you like Fantastic four?,5,25 May 2006,"Then you probably will like this movie. It lacked a decent plot, had tons of special effects, and numerous characters you didn't care about. The dialogue was sub par and lacked any sort of wit. There were several punchlines where the entire audience was silent, and several serious moments where everyone was laughing. Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman do decent jobs, but the rest of the performances were weak. Overall it felt as if the movie had been cut down, leaving a few loose ends that they never tie up, and then filled with computer generated destruction. And in a great effort to be just a little bit more mainstream, it also quoted a popular internet video from youtube.com for a few cheap laughs.",X-Men - The Last Stand

They left it wide open for a part 4, and I really hope they do a better job making the movie. They need to bring back Toad, Sabretoothe, and Nightcrawler. I also hope they bring a better storyline; something to do with the Kree and Skrull conflict. I also hope they bring back Cyclops and Jean Grey, and give Cyclops a bigger role.

1833,jrwalker14,Quite Possibly the Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,1,29 May 2006,"Allow me to explain.Within the first 20 minutes, a despondent Cyclops is back at Alkali Lake, having been called there by Jean, who was presumably annihilated by the Lake collapsing on her in the last movie. She's OK though, (we know she's the Phoenix and will be back, but how will they do it...read on) and we find that out by Cyclops taking off his glasses in a fit of Vaderesque ""NOOOO"" rage and blasting his beam full bore at a random spot in the lake. Then, some non-sensical special effects ensue, roiling water and the like, and oh, it's Jean, and she's OK. They proceed to make out until Jean morphs into some kind of zombie while kissing him and then she kills him. No dialog, no ""what happened,"" just the completely egregious write-out of Scott Summers' character, a pivotal one. He gone. Next Jean wakes up with Logan standing next to her in ""the mansion"" as he called it. What idiot writer calls that place ""the mansion."" I swear to god this movie was written by 12 year olds. So they're in there, and now they start making out, and she tries to kill Logan. Then she blasts out the door and walks out of there in her little hot-pants. WTF? As the movie goes along, there is just one moment after another of sheer idiocy. This movie reeks so bad of the rush as a consequence of the studio not changing the release date after Singer bailed on the project for Superman. It went to another director before it wound up in Brett Ratner's lap, and he did with it exactly what was expected of him. It went to him because the studio knew he was a big name that could get a passable version of the movie done by the release date, that people would be excited about seeing, and they (studio) wouldn't have to dump a ton of money into changing all the marketing and promo for the movie because they get to keep their release date. So Ratner's main goal is to just get the movie done, however possible. He also had to generate enough excitement with certain teasers in the trailers. We see Angel prominently in the trailers. He looks to figure like a big character in the movie. I even just saw Ian McKellan do an X-Men III plug on TV. It's him talking about Angel, and how he's such a spectacularly powerful and amazing mutant who will have a huge part in the X-Men. He literally had 5 minutes of screen time. Maybe less. Next, it was Ratner's idea to throw ""the cure"" in the there, perhaps the most ill-conceived plot device ever. It ruined any possibility of an authentic X-Men story, betrayed the characters (consequently Magneto came off as a complete moron while Professor X came off as an arrogant ass), and dictated the whole ""Dark Phoenix"" toss in that just put the fecal icing on the poo-cake that this movie was. Rogue, one of the most powerful mutants in the comics, is written out of the movie just like Cyclops when she decides to get the cure. Then, Jean Grey kills Professor X by pixelating him. Un-frickin-believable. But at the end, Ratner hints that the cure isn't really a cure by Magneto, who had been stuck with a cure needle, being able to subly move a metal chess piece without touching it. Wait til after the credits and you'll see that Professor X has transferred his consciousness into a vegetative hospital patient in a nice little teaser. So basically, Ratner is like ""Ha! Suckers. I was just kidding. It wasn't REALLY a cure. Their powers will come back. And Charles? He's not dead either. But Patrick Stewart wanted too much money for the 4th movie, but he agreed to provide voice-only at a price we can afford, and he can do it from home, so we'll us his voice and some-no-name's body in the 4th movie, which I will definitely be directing. BWAH HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!"" The guy really is an evil moron. Those two things, the cure not really being a cure and Professor X not really dying, prove perfectly that the movie accomplished nothing whatsoever but killing off or writing off some of the most important other characters while moving along the story and lives of the characters in exactly no way whatsoever. This has the equivalent effect of a moving be so bad, so brutally wrong and horrible on every level, that it collapses under the weight of it's own ineptitude, like a star collapsing into a black hole under that weight of its own mass. A void is what remains, an anti-thing that will kill you if you get too close. Please don't go see this movie. Don't give them any more money. But if you do, please come back to this board and write what you honestly felt about it. Thanks for reading.",X-Men - The Last Stand

1835,wildwombat-1,Xmen 3: The Last Stand,5,12 June 2006,"I can't really give this movie that many stars. The special effects in this movie were amazing, but the writing wasn't that good. There is so much that both directors could have did with this movie and they didn't. I think that is the biggest problem with anything anymore. People have to make things in their own vision. They should have stuck with the story more.The first mistake was making Jean Gray, Scott Summers, and Storm teachers at the school. They should have been students and they should have been the only students there at the beginning. This includes Iceman, Beast, and Angel, and they could have even added others like Gambit and Kitty. Wolverine, on the other hand, must be added to the movie because people would be looking for him. If mutants weren't just becoming a problem then how would parents know that sending them to a school like this would be a good idea. As time went on they would add more students and have Cyclops, Jean Gray, and Storm as teachers because of there age.Wolverine was too soft in the movie. OK he did a little bit of slicing and dicing, but he cried when the professor died in X3. That is not like Wolverine at all. He would be upset, but he wouldn't cry. The Professor dying was just crazy. I don't really know where they are going with this, so I cant say too much about it. All I can say is that he better look like Charles Xavier, not some guy in a coma somewhere else. Also I am curious about Moria and him the next installment, and will Proteus be a big part of the story.If you are a big fan of X-men, you know about the Savage Land. That I think should have been in one of the movies. Also Sentnels were really under used. Having them only in the Danger Room was stupid.There were just so much more these movies could have had, and they just messed up. This movie entertaining, don't get me wrong, but it just doesn't stick to the real story very well. In a way I find it very disrespectful to the people who work on this comic book. It just isn't Xmen. The second movie was the best at sticking to the story.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I saw X-Men 3 with thoughts in the back of my mind that this movie may not be all it's cracked up to be, for one, it's from director Bret Ratner and not Bryan Singer. Also, I had heard before I watched the movie Cyclops died really early in the movie. Anyway, so I went to go see the movie, still wanting to go see it. In the first five minutes, I knew I wasn't going to like this movie. I saw the little, ""cameo,"" of the sentinels, and said to myself, ""I didn't realize we were watching Transformers."" Every part was acted poorly, I though. Especially the part of Kitty Pride and Professor Xavier. Every time Professor Xavier spoke he seemed to blame other people a lot and get irritated. He couldn't give a reasonable argument, but only said, ""I can help you,"" a lot. And the part of dark phoenix was bad as well. In the final battle of the movie she just stood there like a statue looking like she had ADHD. Then the part where Phoenix rises was just bad because it happened all too fast.

The nurse tending to the unconscious man was the same at the end. So, in a nut shell, Xavier transferred himself into another body. HE'S NOT DONE YET.

1839,elissa-21,Extremely disappointed.,3,10 July 2006,"Plucking a few appealing ideas from Joss Whedon's stint on the X-Men comics, The Last Stand fails to impress. With unbelievable special effects, but a mostly talent lacking cast, the final movie in the trilogy leaves you pondering if money was spent in all the wrong areas. Halle Berry brings back her character of Storm and Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame returns. The script writers fail to provide on adequate script to showcase talent for most of the cast, though Ian McKellan brings the script to life with his charismatic acting, though Magneto is not unlike any character he's played in his long career. James Marsden's characters heartbreak is shown by the growth of a beard on his usually clean shaven, boyish face; though a thirteen year old teen could have grown as much in a matter of weeks. Kelsey Grammar's character Beast, though with a small role in the movie, acts as if he really was a monster, instead of an unfortunate man dressing up in steaming hot blue plastic prosthetics.The Last Stand attempts to draw the audience into a serious ethical debate, which really has no place in a comic book movie. The X-Men movies have made their money out of brilliantly choreographed fight scenes, original story lines, and amazing locations. To see the third forsake this formula, and instead try to have at least a dozen side stories going, and overdone drama, not to mention character inconsistency, is really disappointing, for a person who's read the comic books, followed the TV series, and the first two films eagerly. The film also touches upon petty teenage issues, allowing Anna Paquin to display her poor acting ability to a fuller extent, as if the first two films hadn't taught us anything. Since the release on the 26th of May, thousands of discussions have spawned online, with young and old, longtime and relatively new fans ripping all aspects of the movie to shreds. While the idea of ripping the Golden Gate Bridge from the ground, and moving it throughout the harbor may have seemed genius at the time  I'm sure the employees who spent endless months digitalizing the scene, as well as the majority of the audience disagree. The budget was wasted in prettying the movie up, yet they can't quite cake on enough to conceal that beneath a somewhat attractive exterior, lays a hideous film. Not unlike Australian fashion week, actually.With pathetic one liners, and loopholes in the plot large enough to drive a convoy of trucks filled with Halle Berry's hair products through, what could have been a masterpiece has become a disaster. Brian Singer, director of the first two movies did a most intelligent thing, which leaves him most likely laughing now. He left before having to associate himself with the rubbish that is X-Men 3. A poorly executed and poorly conceived movie can't expect to receive a high, so I'll give it three stars out of ten. No movie with geographical errors and crew from the ingenious film Snakes on a Plane should receive a rating above four stars, so I think it's much more than fair.",X-Men - The Last Stand

The movie didn't move in any way and I could give a crap about any of the new characters. Beast was probably the only cool new mutant, as for Kitty and Arch Angle, they were pointless and added nothing. The battle scenes were lame and the special effects were so clearly computer animated I felt like I was watching toy story, I was glad to see the little girl who played Nancy from Sin City, and Stan Lee was in the beginning so that was kind of neat.

I can NOT believe that Stan Lee not only approved of this crap, but had a cameo in it. I enjoy taking SMALL liberties on the graphic novels (Like in Spiderman where he has the organic web shooters, it was a nice little change up for the readers that did not really change much)....It's not even NEAR the story in X3. Next time the X3 crew makes a movie maybe they could tackle the bible and put some sexy car chases and sex scenes in it...cuz you know that's how they roll in the Bible. You can't just change a story the way YOU think it should be, there are rules set, there are story lines and time lines, and if you can't stick to them maybe you should just write a new crappy movie with new crappy characters rather than ruining characters that are known and loved.

1843,wmyeoh,Somewhat anti-climatic and non-affective,5,25 May 2006,"First and foremost, I have to say that I am NOT someone who knows a great deal about the original Marvel Comics. Although I did read a lot of comic books as a kid, this whole series completely escaped me. This review is based on having seen the first two installments, and being very impressed with both, in particular the second.The problem with this movie is exactly the same as the difference between a fantastic thriller like Seven, and a mediocre thriller like Saw. It lies in character development (or lack of). When a ""good"" character dies in a movie, particularly a central character, and the audience hardly responds to this at all, there has been a clear error of judgement in the production of the movie. Sure, the special effects of this movie were at times mind-blowing, but they couldn't mask the fact that as the death toll piled up, we cared less and less about the people dying (and losing their powers) - even though these characters were more and more central as the movie progressed.In the cinema where I was sitting, there was audible laughter through a lot of the ""serious"" dialogue - again, another sign that characterisation hasn't been fully accomplished.The accomplishment of a good comic book movie is being able to successfully depict scenes that would ordinarily be laughable and trite. Some movies achieved this - Batman Begins, Sin City, while others failed - both Spiderman movies. Xmen 3 is somewhere in between. All comic book movies contain clichéd dialogue, but because we don't really get a feel of a lot of the characters in this one, it becomes harder and harder to believe.Overall, the special effects are fantastic in this movie, and the characters that we are familiar with from previous installments all fare well, in particular, Storm, whose role is greatly expanded. But those whose characterisation is sub-par, such as Cyclops, and virtually every new character introduced in this movie, suffer greatly from the director's lack of vision.Not too bad, but it could have been a lot better.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1844,goodolwt,Solid from Top To Bottom,7,26 May 2006,"Around the country, in the Game Stops, the Comic Book Stores, and the action figure aisle at Wal-Mart, one subject has been on the minds and lips of every geek, nerd or dork in America: X-Men: The Last Stand. From the time it was announced, to the director changes, all the way up to today, opening day, it has been a people divided by one question: Will this film suck? It didn't, as I'm sure you can see from the score. My advice to movie goers: Don't go in expecting Schindler's List. The third installment of the X-Men series is a fun, energetic, popcorn movie. But that's it. The subject matter of the film, a supposed ""cure"" for the gene that gives mutants their powers, seems heavy from the outside, with some people I spoke to drawing an allegory to gay rights. While handled with finesse, there's so much going on in these 104 minutes that it's not given time to get too deep.Speaking of, the pacing here could quite easily be described as breakneck. From the start, this movie puts it's foot on the gas and doesn't let up until the credits roll. A few times it's almost too much, but at these points things dial back for a moment with the tiny, inconsequential bit of character development given here. And precious little there is. One could venture to guess that at this stage in the game, the creators felt that plot was more important.All around? This is a solid movie, a good addition to the series, and a credit to the genera.

I also didn't like the fact that they made a big deal about certain characters in the trailers but then they only played minors roles in the film. They could have done better with intros for knew characters because they just appeared and then died so fast (Plus the movie was only 1 hr 45 min). Overall I was very disappointed. I would recommend seeing it just because it is an X Men film but don't get your hopes up. I'm not saying it was horrible, just that I was disappointed.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Even so... you all have to recognize that this is a FILM ADAPTATION of the Xmen realm, not a transfer. SOOO, I've read a couple comments asking about Night Crawler... rent the game... it'll tell ya(its called marketing). And did all of you stay and see the WHOLE movie? even after the credits roll? If you did, you'd see that Proffesor X embodies that ""braindead"" guy. hmmm.. makes you think... magneto gets what looks to be his power back... X comes back in another man... hmm. seeing how Jean/Phoenix is more powerful than the two... dontcha think shes not dead... shes the most powerful mutant. AND, doesn't the Phoenix become a good guy? And did you see minor glimpse of Arc Angel? well, the next Xmen will have Apocolyse for sure, phoenix will come back just like magneto and Profes X. and Cyclopse will return. its like a different realm of star wars... you know what going to eventually happen... but you wanna SEE it happen.

The charm of some of the characters is just gone. My expectations were low to begin with since Singer was gone but I HOPED it would be as good as the 2nd one. At least better than the first one and it failed to deliver. Sure the action was fun and the one saving grace but they introduced too many new mutants without a chance to really care about their plight.

Whats good with this movie is that the young characters is developing there powers and shows off with there enemies and the saga is quite interesting with Jean finally transformed into the Phoenix, and Xavier And Magneto is just as good as always although some unnecessary quotes in some part of the movie. Brett Ratner maybe didn't do the first 2 other movies but still he is holding the story's together while he's taking the story to another level, Kelsey is doing doing a very good job on playing beast and Ben Foster would e nice too but doesn't get enough screen time in Last Stand, but what i can say is that this movie is nice enough and if you are an X-Men movie fan, you should be watching this one because you don't want to miss minute after minute in this banger, and don't believe the retards that say they are disappointed on this one.Why i don't give the 10 points to the movie is mostly because of the quotes and some bad effects in some parts of the movie.7.8",X-Men - The Last Stand

But it wasn't all downsides one of the greatest things in the film i think was the introduction of the FAMED ""Danger Room"" and the fact that they introduced sentinels also.

1851,karlhungus1979,A true fans opinion,6,26 May 2006,"The latest X-Men movie is disappointing to say the least. I don't know who had the final say on the finished product, (Brett Ratner, the producers or editors, or the studio) but the end result is an eyesore that has been rushed through production.The movie is full of unexplained cut scenes that run into each other, that leave you frustrated and a little confused. The plot is sub-par with very poor dialog. The plot is not that difficult to follow, it's just full of holes. Holes that leave true X-fans wanting more. The music score throughout the entire movie is horrible and off. Music makes a movie. The writer of the score of X-Men 3 should be ashamed of the final product.The unexplained introduction of a dozen or so new mutants was attempt to cover up the lame plot. The new mutants come and go without explanation or warning and spout a cheesy one-liner of dialog before they are rushed of the screen. There is an occasional curse word that gets all of the prepubescent teens in the audience a chance to chuckle like a little schoolgirl in their Sunday's best.Brett Ratner was a poor choice to direct the third installment of the X-Franchise. With his not so impressive track record of Rush Hour movies, with Rush Hour 3 in preproduction; he should have been last on the list to direct this highly anticipated movie. It's like the powers that be just drew his name out of a hat and said lets go in that direction.I'm not saying it's the worst movie out there, but it is defiantly the worst of the three. It was a poorly planned and over rushed movie that doesn't live up to the standards of true fans, such as myself. I've been reading and collecting X-Men comics for years and I know all of their back-stories and sub-plots and I expect it to at least live up to the standards of the previous two movies.The end result is a movie that does not live up to the standards of the trilogy. The bad plot and dialog is replaced by CGI and special effects that try to district you from this poor movie that you shell out your hard-earned cash to see. It's worth seeing, but try to go see the lower priced day showing of the film.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1852,reuben_88,What the Hell!!!,1,4 June 2006,"This film wasn't good. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as X-Men 2, as Brian Synger wasn't directing it!!! (why? i don't know). One of the main things that struck me as odd was the severe lack of action and the character Night Crawler!!! (again why?). I at least thought that they would make up for that by adding in Angel, but no, he is on the screen for about 3 mins, (if that). Storm and Beast were fantastic, and the portrayal of the Phoenix's power was good, but the actual visual character was lacking something.Also i wasn't quite sure why cyclops was killed off so early, i didn't see any reason for it...",X-Men - The Last Stand
1853,leviathank,"Had its cheesy moments, but overall FANTASTIC",7,30 May 2006,"What gives this movie the edge compared to the other two is the emotion. The story of the Phoenix was done extremely well, and I think thats what stole the show. There is a scene (won't go to into it so I don't spoil anything) where Jean and Xavier have somewhat of a showdown. It is a very powerful scene and I have to say its my favorite scene in all three of the X Men movies. This movie really got into the Wolverine/Jean storyline and thats what helped this movie become more dramatic than the first two. I got a little teary in a few spots of the film. The score really helps get into the story as well.While this movie had some cheesy moments and lines, over all it was done very well and I think what made it so good was how emotionally powerful it was, especially for a comic book movie.

Mystique, Rogue, and Magneto didn't actually lost/loose their powers because the cure that they got from the mutant kid with a power to make mutant loose their power is actually a short term drug/cure, so the cure won't last long... you can see it when Beast tries to get closer to the kid, his hand back to human, but when Beast isn't near him, his hand and power is back to normal. So that means Magneto, Mystique, and Rogue will be back.... 2. Professor Xavier wasn't actually died, if you guys wait until the movie credit gets over, you'll see something.... 3. Cyclops not dead! In the comic book there's a story where Phoniex sends Cyclops to the future, because she ""can"" do anything but, she ""can't"" control her power. So Cyclops fan... don't worry be happy. 4. Phoniex/Jean Grey isn't dead too...she's a mutant level 5 how can she be dead with only one stab of Wolverine's claws...

It shows that the X-men and followers aren't ""freaks"" as the world thinks they are. They end up saving the day and showing everyone that what they have isn't an illness. The saddest part is what happens to mystique, and Rogue- who makes -in my opinion- a bad decision. This movie really is an edge of your seat thriller.

The special effects were great as to be expected. The character development was nice, for the most part. The story line was pretty good also. I guess why I rated the movie a 3 instead of an 8 or 9 had to do with character development. There were too many sad moments in this movie. The first 2 X-Men movies were great stories, and I liked where the characters went. When watching this movie, I couldn't get into the story or enjoy the special effects as much because I was too sad from the deaths of some of the characters.",X-Men - The Last Stand

Don't get me wrong, the fight scenes were great, and Beast and Angel were amazing, (although considering that the film was short, the could have added more then 5 minutes of screen time for angel, who has fantastic wings and great potential). Unfortunately, I found the film boring at parts, the story had faults, and I was really disappointed with the ending. (spoiler starts now) I know they wanted drama, but was it really necessary to get rid of half of the main characters, either by killing them off or getting rid of their powers?

I just hope that they end it there as i think one more would really be pushing it. Also one bad thing about the film was Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut! All i can say is please Hollywood no more Vinnie.

1861,darklordofbass,X-Men 3: a rope of sand: spoiler free,2,26 May 2006,"Well, there are few things I can think of that have been as disappointing for me as X3. This is a let down on par with Star Wars Episode I, finding out there is no Santa Clause or being turned down when you ask your squeeze to prom. The first and biggest problem is that of the score: the ridiculously grandiose score made parts of this movie unbearable. I would have preferred no music at all to the deafening, corny, atrocity that was unleashed from the speakers. Second was the directing and cinematography style. These meaningless, over-the-top, grand shots work for Rush Hour; not X-Men. Bryan Singer (director X-Men 1 & 2) created a world through style that, in making a sequel, Ratner (direcor X3) should have based his direction off of. This movie reeks of bad directing choices. The style is TO BIG and has lost the real world quality fans loved about the first 2. Next up I have no idea how a screenplay like this ever got approved. This IS the last x-men movie and that is the biggest mistake of all: this franchise could have easily yielded up to 4 more (very profitable) sequels. This movie has a lot of what Singer and David Hayter (writer) did a great job of avoiding in the first 2 films: lots of sub-plots that go nowhere and have little to do with what is happening. Zak Penn should know better having collaborated on X2. He and Simon Kinberg should be kicked for the horrible dialog, disgraceful plot and unnecessary changes that appear within. (Not that I think these movies should be exactly the same as the comics, X1 & 2 proved that, but they should bear SOME resemblance to the source we know and love). This movie seems to have a lot of nothing and not enough of anything. Additions like Angel, Beast, Kitty, Colossis, Calisto, Juggernaught, Mardox, Leech, Dr. Rao, Moria, Trask and the danger room were not used nearly enough and just felt kinda squeezed in without serving the plot. Another factor on my S list is the Special Effects: Ratner got sloppy. It is clear that little attention was paid to this aspect of the film and without demanding a higher quality and harder work of CGI the SFX fell FAR behind that of X2 and the Spiderman movies. Directors like Rami (spiderman) and Singer worked extremely hard in this department to make SFX shots seamless and realistic but Ratner let that fall to the waist-side in a way that is reminiscent of the FX in Mortal Kombat.The only thing this movie has going for it is good fight choreography and stunt work. Now the big question: WHO IS TO BLAME? I will tell you simply where the blame lies: 20th Century Fox. By pushing for a 2006 release, in spite of Singer's Superman involvement, and rushing this movie out they have killed an extremely profitable, loved and (most importantly) good franchise while trying to make more money quickly. They should have waited for Singer & Hayter to be available and in 2008 we would have had a strong third film and a much more enjoyable, concise and pleasing movie.

1862,jakethegreat,way to ruin a franchise. Thanks.,2,26 May 2006,"Really can't believe Stan Lee let them make this. No wonder Singer left. Whats the point of building characters to just end a trilogy like this? I'm very disappointed especially since its not as if there isn't a large amount of storyline already created to draw from. With the ending of the 2nd movie, for some reason I really thought they were going to be doing these right. This movie ruined it for me, and I'm sure other fans who grew up with these comics will agree. As a movie, its not bad. Its entertaining, and its not badly done by any means. In fact, if you forget who these guys are, its fun.With that said, it should have been called ""people who look like the xmen: The Last Stand"" because there was nothing character wise that had to do with them in this movie. I gave it a 2 star instead of a 1 because Beast had some good scenes.Another thing, could FOX have cheeped out anymore with some of the effects? Colossus looked worse than the 2nd movie and could have been created in the early 90's and brought back into this movie. He looks horrible, like some half-wit knock off studio at the last min. put him in. They didn't bother building him as a character or Angle at all.As far as the missing Nightcrawler...they could have put Efren Ramirez, Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite, in some makeup and called it a day instead of just ignoring he ever existed. All you needed was a small Spanish guy with an accent.Anyway, I'm pretty easy on movies but when you ruin something with decades of lore behind it, that's pretty inexcusable.

In my mind, at times I found myself thinking, ""This isn't in the comic books!"" but it didn't matter... I was hooked. There were plenty of special effects, but none would compare to the scene to come; a scene that would leave any fan speechless.***************************** ! Spoilers! *****************************The effects were good, the acting even better. But the most amazing effect wasn't created by a computer.

At this moment, the makers of this film chose the most shocking thing to do. The Phoenix kills Charles Xavier.The crowd is silentNo one moves, no one speaks, we hardly even breath.Nothing, not acting, nor special effects, can cause such reaction.

1864,earlobe-1,"Man, did somebody drop the ball",4,30 May 2006,"Who was the corporate idiot that green-lit this script? Did they ever bother to read one single X-Men comic book? Was Stan Lee involved at all, beyond his obligatory cameo? What a massive letdown from X2. Now I'm not such a purist that I expect no changes for the screen, or that the Marvel Universe can't be re-imagined. (Any comic fans remember the ""What If..."" series?) But wonderful backstories and relationships that have been written about for decades were completely erased. Someone actually wrote out Anna Paquin AND Patrick Stewart in the first hour? (Please send this writer over to Sci-Fi Channel to pen ""Tremors 6"" rather than touch another pop-culture treasure.) I'm glad to see that Storm got some deeper character, but Ms.Paquin has an Oscar too! And it wasn't for sweating it out with Billy Bob. I can get over taking the Kitty/Colossus relationship and handing it over to Iceman. But the ultimate sin - some clown made Dark Phoenix into Dusk Phoenix: Once able to destroy entire planets and stars, she now has the incredible ability to levitate water and trash Alcatraz! And with all the special effects at their disposal there wasn't a shot of the classic flaming Phoenix behind Jean Grey? Come on, now. Cyclops gets 10 minutes screen time before dying a horrible death at the bottom of a plot hole, dropping him right into Metropolis. Aaaaand where was Nightcrawler? Did he just ""Bamf"" off into the ether? Magneto has cronies galore with non-descript powers, to jump real high and stick on stuff, but Professor X's awesome offshoot New Mutants weren't even hinted at.

1866,avatar_shaw,What do you expect? Fine cinema?,6,26 May 2006,"I read a lot of ""professional"" and user reviews of this movie, most of them tearing it to pieces. Well, when the original director leaves with most of the production crew that made it what it was and then return with all new people, what do you expect? A bad decision by Fox, as Singer agreed to do X3 after he decided to salvage something out of Superman Returns (which, by the way, I expect to be a good film, especially after the last two). Then again, Fox has never made good decisions. Futurama? Family? Firefly? These all strike cords as being good shows canceled before their time.But I digress from the point: X-Men III.Now you need to note that this is a comic-book based film. No matter who is writing/directing/acting in it, it will never reach fine cinema. Jst look at comic books. They're packed with action and mostly fantastical stories that relate to the readers with common ideas and beliefs.Sadly, X3 failed at this. The movie was filled with corny lines even a comic book wouldn't touch.""You of all people know quickly the weather can change."" Hahahah, oh my god! The professor made a pun off of Storm's mutant powers. How appropriate. *note sarcasm* There were many other instances such as this. I'll spare you, though.Unlike the first two films, character development was highly absent. A key character was busy with their own career and was given a short role before being sadly killed off (even though, personally, I always hated the character in the comics and was glad to see them die). Along with them, two others were lost as well.Halle Berry reprized her role as Storm but threatened to leave unless she got a bigger part. Sad that. I wish she didn't return. The character development they tried to give her was ruined by her alone. I remember precise attempt at a very bad attempt at an African accent in the first one which was ditched soon after in the next film.Cheesy lines abound and too many characters are introduced and never developed. Fortunately, the actors make up for bad writing and directing. Even Sir Ian McKellan made his horrible lines seem believable. Hugh Jackman once again proved who is the pushing power in the films, And Famke Jamsen (I never quite knew her name well) did a very good job as well, despite having barely any lines. Anna Paquin was nearly snubbed out of this film. I never liked the rendition of her character in the film (I miss southern accent, flying, super strength Rogue from the comics), but she did a good job at the role that was given to her regardless. Instead, she seemed to be replaced by the role of Kitty Pride, aka Shadowcat, aka the role that's been played by a different actress in each film.There are some good fan moments. Beast's role was played perfectly. Even his small part of reciting philosophy in the heat of battle well suited him. Even the Juggernaut recites a line everyone should know if you're a fan of internet spawned fads.But if you know the comics and look at any of these films, you can spot a lot of clashing material. Beast appeared in the films earlier by a different actor on a TV screen in the background, minus the blue fur. And wait...Colossus is Russian right? Couldn't tail from the films...But it's comic-book based movie. For the $5 or more you payed for the ticket, its worth it. You get action, cheesy lines, and mutant powers galore. It's not fine cinema, but if it comes between seeing this or MI:III again...I'll choose X3.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1867,ibanezbtb5,Almost Offended,3,26 May 2006,"I was fearing the thought of another director when I first heard about it, but i didn't think any new director would do what this guy allowed. I do agree that the special effects were amazing, every one of them. But that does not help a story line. It felt as if Ratner never even read a comic book. No, not just a X-Men comic but any comic for that matter. For comics you have a serious fan base. Therefore you can not just make stories up that are so far fetched and put endings on them that feel like all you want is for it to be over. Ratner didn't develop his characters, the ones we all have come to love have very little lines or advancement in the story. This man flat out did what ever he wanted.I wont rave on anymore so the story line isn't given out, but don't expect to be feeling that awesome feeling when you left X-Men 2.

1868,UniversityOfPhoenix,X-Men: The Last Stand is incredible,10,4 October 2006,"X-Men: The Last Stand is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time. I don't know if a movie has ever excited me as much as this one. X1 and X2 both left me incredibly disappointed. But X3 delivers everything that I've always hoped would be in an X-Men movie. I love how X3 finally focused on the team as a whole, and not just Wolverine. I love how Bobby and Rogue are official X-Men now. I love how Jean Grey gets superior character development- Jean/Phoenix is the best thing about an amazing movie. Her reunion with Scott is magnificent. She finally looks like Jean Grey, standing there with her long flaming red hair and her skin tight suit. And that scene is the only time in the whole trilogy where there is any passion between Scott and Jean. Then the scene with Jean and Wolverine is the sexiest comic book movie scene ever. Watching Jean switch back and forth between her personas was an amazing experience. Add in her killer lines such as ""this is where we first met"", ""He would know wouldn't he"", and ""Kill me"", not to mention the telepathic belt removal and the sexiest walk ever- and this scene is perfect. And the battle at Jean Grey's house is the most thrilling sequence ever put to film. The emotion, the drama- Jean finally asserting herself, taking her revenge on the man who held her back for so long, who robbed her of her childhood, who harbored a naughty crush on her, meanwhile Magneto looks on in horror, Storm and Wolverine battle downstairs and Wolverine stabs his way up- this is epic cinema.I could go on and on: Magneto's exhilarating rescue of Mystique, finally seeing some Danger Room action, a pitch perfect Beast. welcome aboard Kitty, Colossus, Angel, and Juggernaut! it sure is nice to see you. heck i'm even excited to see Moira McTaggert and Psylocke. the shot in the finale of our six heroes all lined up ready to take a last stand was awesome. the team focus was awesome. Bobby icing up was awesome. Kitty vs. Juggs was awesome. and did i mention Jean Grey looked hot? hopefully i covered all the reasons why this movie is the best in the trilogy. don't listen to people who say it's no good- this movie delivers in a major way.",X-Men - The Last Stand

No really favorite mutants were introduce yet all I want to know is how in the hell do you show new characters before old ones Gambit has yet to hit the sense Beast just made his big show up (with a crap costume i've seen stuff on SicFi that looked better). The major characters haven't even gotten a piece of the spotlight Halle was talking about leaving the movie because she wasn't getting any attention maybe thats why they came up with the whole Xavier death thing just to get her into the movie a bit more it also looked as if the writes were tring to put in the whole Storm and Wolverine lover story. Marvel has lost points from me with this Spiderman 3 i'm looking to you to save them.,X-Men - The Last Stand
1870,jasonjklaus,Hmm Disappointing...YES!,5,26 May 2006,"So 1st of all I expected to see Gambit. WRONG! 2nd of all it did not follow the story as it's previous have. I feel let down, mislead, and disappointed. There was not any real ""plot."" Only one long struggle over nothing in which everyone is forced to make the same choice to a hardly substantial ethical question. They (the creators of the first two) Laid down solid foundation for a rocking trilogy but lost it in they're own ""creativeness."" See it and form your own opinion. My opinion is just that my opinion. This movie is just another one of Hollywood's look at all of these cool special effects. Ignore the fact that we no longer follow the story but rewrite it to fit our needs.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1871,dazednconfusional,More Than They Could Handle,7,29 May 2006,"X3's title, ""The Last Stand,"" and it's premise, which I'm sure you all know about by now, gives the impression that this is it for the franchise, and the war between humans and mutants will be that of WWII, but instead of ""The Big One,"" it becomes Greneda.I'm not saying it is all bad, there are high points, but in the end the bads outweigh the goods, and this becomes one of the most highly anticipated disappointments of the year. Everything that the fans had asked and/or waited for, such as The Danger Room, The Sentinals, and especially, (this is what I was waiting for) the return of Jean Grey as Pheonix, was there, but was handled with a ""Here you go so stop bothering me,"" attitude, meaning they were there, but just enough so none of the fans could say anything else, and there lies the problem. As readers of the comics know, the X-Men universe has a mind numbingly huge roster of heroes and villains, and with so many, everybody is bound to have a favorite they want in the movie. So, i guess they tried to appeal to everybody, adding about 15 mutants as main characters. Add to this, the overall continuing plot of the war between us and them, the main plot of this movie about a ""cure"" for mutants and their opinions on the subject, and two sub-plots involving a new mutant who is reason for the ""cure"" and Magneto's quest to capture him and The X-Men's attempt to stop him, and finally the return of Jean Grey as Pheonix, who is now one misunderstood word away from disintegrating the entire world, and the X-Men having to track her down too, and it just becomes too much, and the movie implodes, not giving enough time to flesh out anybody, except Wolverine, who learns about teamwork, and more less assumes the role of leader/mentor.That's not even all of plots. There are several other issues going on. Such as the triangle between veterans Iceman, Rogue, and the newbie Kitty Pride, which causes Rogue to branch off into a side story of her own, Mystique and her unfortunate accident, and another newbie Angel and the issues with his father, who is involved with the ""cure,"" and finally Beast, another highly anticipated new character torn between the opportunity of finally ""fitting in,"" or remaining the blue hulking animal that he is. There aren't even soap operas that have this much going on, it is just too much. You would think that with all of this, everybody would have something to do, but amazingly, nobody really does much of anything, because it's all crammed into the span of about 90 minutes, so all potentially good ideas are ended in very anti-climatic ways, and new mutants introduced are thrown by the wayside or used solely for one or two reasons, and never heard from again. If thats not enough, because of these new angles, old ones built up from the first two, such as the triangle between Jean, Wolverine, and Cyclops, and the potential sparks that flew with Strom and Nightcrawler, are NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!!!!!! last but not least, since this is supposedly the last movie you would think that all questions would be answered, but instead of ending like that, the movie throws us for a loop, and ends with unresolved issues that only bring up more questions. I think they lied, and if there is a 4th (which, if they don't want to be hung, there should be) they will have a lot of explaining to do.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1872,logan_1984,Great and emotional movie..but it should have been 20 min longer..,7,27 May 2006,"As X-Men fan i was expecting a great movie. Even with the various problems during the production phases i never lost hope in a memorable movie. Here it is. And when the ending title scrolled in front of my eyes i felt like something was wrong. The movie is very powerful and stunning, with at least two scenes that make you stay locked on your sitting place...but some little particular should have been focused better. Some characters (like colossus or angel) and some events VERY important in the movie (i don't want to spoiler, just go and see the movie...) didn't have the right time on the screen, making that feeling of having an incomplete movie. However, the positive points are more than the negatives and watching the X-Men in their Last(?) Stand is something great. In the end, X3 doesn't reach the beauty and the evocative power of X2 but it is an amusing and entertaining movie that delivers us moments of powerful drama.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1873,capobrian,the biggest disappointment in movie history.,1,26 May 2006,"I have been an x-men fan since i was 7 years old. I love the first two movies, and after seeing this piece of crap i feel many things. Betrayal, Anger, a desire to kill Mr. Zak Penn. With x-3 they seemed to decide to throw out any reason to stay faithful to the comic book... and I'm not being a whiny fanboy... they really went nuts with this. I would say more but i wanna keep this spoiler free. And forget any hopes for a decent sequel, they destroyed the entire series with this one. And this is not the only problem. The previous films were filled with dialogue and character development, this film has none. There is a scene in the x-jet where we have storm, wolverine, beast, iceman, shadowcat, and collosus... but there is next to NO dialog. The rest of the movie follows this closely. Colossus probably has two lines in the whole film. Iceman and Rogue who were previously very deep characters have almost nothing here. Pyro has become a caricature. Angel makes Lady Deathstrike look like a lead character. And forget about Cyclops and Jean. Though Jean certainly has some good moments, as do Xavier, Beast, Wolverine, and Magneto... they're far to few, and they do not outweigh the bad. Storm is depressingly dull. I honestly have always felt that way about the character.. but she has a very large role in this so it's highlighted. I can't help but think part of this movie's bad plot has to do with Halle Berry's demands for a bigger part, which is sad, because i would rather a good movie with no Storm than this POS. As to the story... it involves a cure to mutation, which sounds ridiculous, against everything the x-men stand for. Like the government giving out vacines to gays that makes them straight and minorities that will turn them into White Angle Saxon Protestants. But not only do the X-men end up defending the people behind this, they end up fighting alongside them. They have turned the message of tolerance for individuality on it's head in this movie and I was disgusted. I found myself cheering on the Brotherhood. I don't even understand why they went this way, they could have made a great movie focusing soley on the Phoenix or about the Sentinels, but instead they went with this. While the X-men have always been about protecting mankind in general in this plot they feel way to establishment. They actually seem to be working with the government. Not only that but it seems as though the films creators want us to be on the government's side. It's really sad that what was probably my favorite film franchise had to end like this. I personally want an apology from Fox and my money back.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1874,mt6486,Last Stand stands alone,8,26 May 2006,"Comic fans will be disappointed by the movie, but it's important to realize that the movie follows a storyline far different from the comics - there are plenty of characters and events that happen, both in this movie and the last one, that mark it as a separate franchise. If you're looking for a direct movie adaptation of the comic book, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for an all around good action movie, then you've found it.The movie was more emotional in parts than it's predecessors,and also more violent (at least, when the fight scenes roll around). The cast, both for the X-Men themselves and their counterparts, the Brotherhood, were greatly increased, with satisfying results.I'll keep things short and just say this. If you're a fan of the movies - or of action movies in general - you won't be disappointed by X3. If you're a fan of the comic books, you'll be upset by everything that happens - but if you can put you preconceived ideas behind and realize that the movie story is not the comic story, then you're in for an enjoyable time.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1875,the_truth_886,Who jacked the storyline,4,25 May 2006,"Being from one of the first countries to see this movie i was rather disappointed with this third installment of the x men movie franchise,The opening 15 minutes of this film see's a main character get killed off,There is no storyline between xavier and his half brother kane marko aka the juggernaut a lot of new characters are introduced into the mix with only one thing in mind join magneto and fight against the oppressive humans my gosh its roots,And if any of you's know the comic storyline you know damn well what will happen if professor xavier dies!! i do agree the phoenix being an alter ego of jeans unlocked and hidden potential runs a lot better then her being chosen by an intergalactic being and empowered with supernatural powers,and dis girl is one tough cookie,and my god did Fraser pull off the beast roll good.

1876,diogoprado,"Really, really good!!",6,18 May 2006,"I think this is one of the best comic adaptation for the cinemas. A lot of mutants, a lot of power. The Phoenix is the best of the movie. The final battle is perfect. Kelsey Grammar like Beast is very good. Halle Berry has a more important participation in the movie, but Hugh Jackman is the center of the attentions. And a note for you... don't leave the cinema until the end of the credits, it's a surprise after them. One more thing. Ben Foster (Angel) don't do anything in the movie, he's just a support character. Colossus too, but by the way, his transformations and his classic Wolverine throw are very good. And the scene with Wolverine and Jean/Phoenix is one of the bests that I ever saw in a movie.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1877,byl-cote,damn fine,8,3 June 2006,"I always liked the idea of The X-Men but was never a big comic book guy. I thought comics were cool but never seemed to have the time. That said, I enjoy the films, this one probably the most. I've read some of the reviews on here and it seems most of the negative ones are from comic book fans. As an action film, this one works the best. The length is perfect. It doesn't get bogged down with the over-indulgence that makes X2 an inferior film. About halfway through the second film I start getting sleepy. And I gotta say that Cyclops is really boring and I'm glad they kill him off in X3; sorry folks, but he's just not that interesting. The only thing that is annoying is how many of the decisions in 'The Last Stand' were made because of contracts and egos. I think Brett Ratner did a fine job considering the mess he was left with. Nightcrawler was obviously gone because Alan Cummings wanted out...maybe they should have made up a brief explanation just to acknowledge his absence. Otherwise, good stuff!",X-Men - The Last Stand

1879,ocmurer,Terrible,1,3 November 2006,"While this movie wasn't as bad as some of the movies that have come out today, it was by far an unfitting end to the possibly epic X-Men Series. When Bryan Singer dropped out to instead direct Superman Returns, they should have just scrapped the script, because it was total sh!t. The script was a convoluted reference at best to a very creative comic book story arc about a 'cure' to the genetic mutation. Unfortunately, that's where the similarities end. The cure is supposed to be a hoax, created to help an evil mutant bring about the end of the world with the help of mutants that he brainwashed. All of our favorite characters were either killed off or not in the movie. Nightcrawler didn't even make an appearance. And who picks Storm to lead the X-Men? She's Storm. Her powers suck. They're stupid and nobody in their right mind thinks to themselves, ""I think Storm is probably the best X-Men character."" And my complaints don't end there- not only was the script awful and the choice of characters to receive major roles unintelligent, it was also inconsistently related to the other two movies. Characters changed drastically between the second and third installments, with no explanation given. Like, what the hell happened to Mystique and Storm's voices? Accents don't just go away. F--, Brett Ratner.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1880,xxlatigressxx,Pretty good but first two were better...,7,27 May 2006,"I have to say that it was not what I expected... Overall it was pretty good, but I felt that maybe they had tried to have too many characters, so they didn't really focus all that much on the X-Men but instead on Magneto and his army. There was so little screen time of Rogue and Cyclops that it hardly felt like they were in the movie, and the new character of Angel was pretty much unnecessary, because all he did was fly around a few times. Although Angel was important as the reason for the cure's creation, I don't think that he should have been a feature on the posters etc for having a very small role. And what happened to Nightcrawler? Both my sister and I were sad that they killed off so many major characters, and I felt that Cyclops shouldn't have died so soon. Maybe it was because of the new director, but X-Men: The Last Stand just didn't live up to the first two.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1881,fusz432,wtf?,1,8 June 2006,"wow! this movie is absolutely horrible. There were so many loopholes in the plot that it isn't funny. They killed off two main characters Cyclops and Prof Xavier early in the movie. The danger room scene sucked ass, i firmly believe it would have been far better story if they actually fought against the Sentinels. We don't even know what the hell those robots are or why they are fighting Sentinels in the danger room. The main thing also they screwed up royally is how they portrayed one of my favorite characters, the Juggernaut. Why in the HELL did they get a British guy with a thick British accent to play the Juggernaut, when it is firmly clear that Cain Marko is an American, heck, personally i feel the only person who should have been the Juggernaut is The BIG SHOW from WWE, he is the only one i know of who clearly resembles The Juggernaut from the comics in size and stature, very important because a large part of his character is his size and ability to intimidate others, and has the most accurate mannerisms, hint, why do you think they had Patrick Stewart portray Prof. Xavier?. Also since the cytorrak gem makes Juggernaut extraordinarily powerful(enough to go through beams, survive in outer space, etc.), how in the hell can he be so weak in the movie, he apparently died by banging his head into a wall! Another thing was that MAGNETO was so weak in this movie, it isn't funny, there is no way in hell Beast could have been able to jump at him and inject the anti-mutant serum because Magneto would have had a forcefield around him. This whole movie was a total disgrace to X-men fans and even casual fans can see how incoherent the plot was.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1882,felixdmeier,"Good movie, it just doesn't seem to work...",4,1 June 2006,"I saw this movie a day after it came out in France and I was stunned. The action was great, the plot was obvious though interesting none the less. Yet two days later it was already out of my head for the most part. After LOTR ROTK I was thinking for days about the movie; but after this I talked about it for 15 minutes after and then I was pretty much done. All things considered the script I find is a bit our of character. It just seems that it could have gone differently (maybe it was just because the professor died).In a movie I often look at how the soundtrack, the acting, the script etc etc... work together to make a lasting impression. It is usually these movies that are nominated for best picture. Otherwise a movie just disappears into a Minor category such as ""Special Effects"" (Rather like Kackson's ""King Kong"". I feel this movie could have done better. The fact is the good actors have roles hat don't feel to influential to the plot such as Pyro, Rogue. They kill Prof. X to early and I think he is the best actor in the series after Magneto. Maybe this movie lacked character depth. I find storm or Wolverine could have been much more developed as they are the main protagonists after the Prof dies. This movie is worth seeing but I deer will not cause a big as a buzz as some people would have hoped.",X-Men - The Last Stand

I did see it because about the same amount of people said it was the best so far. I would have to agree that this movie was utterly fantastic! The special effects and action were far from cheesy or fake and it was funny, the characters haven't been manipulated by the new director and the story line flew with the last two movies, and every emotion known to man shot through the screen into everyone in the audience. I enjoyed every aspect of this action-packed (forgive the cliché)film.

1884,rapidfiire,"big, actiony, and shallow",5,28 May 2006,"Overall, the movie was mildly entertaining. But nothing compared to the first or second one (probably because the original crew, including the director, and director of photography, didn't have anything to do with it). Which is too bad, because I was looking forward to new displays of power, cool fight scenes, more of the interesting character stories,new suspenseful situations, etc. Instead, I saw a high-budget generic action movie with lots of explosions and one-liners meant for cheap easy laughs with occasional moments of teen drama spliced in. There were a couple of fairly moving scenes (that I can't talk about without spoiling it) and Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart all did a great job in it (as usual), but I came away with the distinct feeling that the people who made this film didn't really love and understand X-Men the same way Bryan Singer did. They just wanted a simple way to amuse a crowd for 2 hours. If you liked the first two, you should see this one, at least for the sake of satisfying curiosity, because it's not all terrible.

I would have rathered colossus to have a bigger part. Mystique also went too early i think at least. and thats about it.

I give it a nine out of ten because because I was sure that miss Grey was dead for sure. I was lost on that, but everything else was good. Not a dull moment at all in the entire film.

The younger x-men seemed misplaced on the set, and gave the appearance of simply introducing them for a later movie rather than developing some sort of conflict/resolution with meaning. Why was Rogue's role so trivialized? Why did Wolverine remain so calm and civilized? And, Storm's new role was given away in the beginning. Wow, I wonder what's going to happen to Xavier?

Now I'm not saying there aren't problems with this movie. Corny lines, direction a bit unstable at points. But if you love X-Men, you SHOULD love this movie! Ratner captured the use of their powers wonderfully. Which was my biggest problem with the other two films. Their use of powers were not as grand as they could have been.There were points in the movie where I was stunned at how absolutely powerful Jean Grey was! As for people who aren't fans of X-Men, they should enjoy it simply for the spectacle and decent storyline. You won't walk away thinking this is the best movie ever, but you should be happy you saw it.The acting was good...nothing incredible or bad.You have to believe the characters, if you can't, then don't bother seeing it because you'll just be one of those people who can't get it and writes a bad review.Loved the movie!

It is definitely the darkest one of the three X-Men movies.The special effects are absolutely amazing (as they should be). I found myself going ""wow"" a few times during the movie.As for the story, I guess it's OK, but all in all the movie seems kind of empty. And it was way to short, in the sense that you didn't really create any kind of relation to many of the characters. On a more positive note; there were a few twists which I found really interesting. The movie had a few clichés (a few comments in the movie) which I didn't like especially much.I rated the movie 7/10 because I DID come out of the movie theater satisfied with my experience, but they could have done a much better job with the movie.

Although this is the last movie of XMEN (?), I think that series of killings was unnecessary, specially Xavier's. Also, Cyclops was absent almost in all the movie.I heard the the movie was very short (104 minutes) and I thought that there wasn't enough time for the movie but when I saw it I realized that the movie couldn't last more because: the budget of the action sequences shown in the movie, the awesome number of action sequences and, the death of many important mutants, like I've mentioned before.After all, the movie is great, even better than the previous movies. 9 of 10 is the score for X-Men: The Last Stand.

I left your movie with so many conflicting thoughts it isn't even funny. Here are some reasons your movie angered me and made me wish I had spent the money on something else: 1) Cyclops dead within minutes of the opening. Seriously, you had a good character there and you just killed him off for what purpose? Dramatic effect? Oi...2) So, they find Jean and NOBODY bothers to ask where Scott is until a bit later in the movie? They didn't even bother looking for him did they? Some friends huh? I mean, Kitty and Collosus didn't even appear to notice he was gone until they strapped on their uber cool suits and prepared for battle as shown by their dumbstruck faces when Wolverine announces he's gone. You'd think that if you hadn't seen him in at least a week you'd notice something was up, but not our dear X Men! 3) If Nightcrawler was in this, I must have blinked and missed him. Oh wait.... he wasn't and that makes me a sad panda.4) Juggernaut=magical. Thanks for trying to pull a fast one on me by pretending he's a mutant, but I'm smarter than that. Did you even read ANYTHING about the X Men before taking this on? 5) When I saw the trailer I was in awe of Angel and hoped that he would play a big role in the movie but once again you slapped me in the face and said NO. Seriously, what was with that scene at the end where he swoops down to pick up his father? I was WAITING for some confrontation, something... ANYTHING. But no, they exchange glances and BOOM Angel's out of the picture and so is his father (unless you count a random flyby at the very end to be worth something).6) Wow, Jubilee was in this? Holy crap, so was Psylocke! Wow! Omega Red made an appearance? Seriously? Could have fooled me.7) You successfully ruined many main characters for no apparent reason other than to further this piece of crap you call a movie. Mystique: human. Magneto: human (OR IS HE? DUN DUN DUN DUNNNNNNN!). Jean: Dead. Professor X: Dead (although somehow alive somehow though the lamest 3 seconds I sat through your stupid credits to see). Cyclops: Dead. Rogue: Human. You insult my brain, Mr. Ratner.8) I'm Jean Grey! I'm horribly powerful! I can do anything I want! Including standing here at the final battle of the movie with a blank stare on my face for 20 minutes while everyone around me dukes it out! *sigh* 9) Plastic guns huh? Are the needles made of plastic as well? Unless I'm wrong, they appeared to be metal, which makes the idea of Magneto not being able to manipulate them preposterous.10)Magneto: Hey Juggernaut! Hey Multiple Man! I just saved you! Come join me in my quest! Juggernaut and Multiple Man: Yeah, sure, whatever, I just really need to pee and don't really care about what's going on here.Mr. Ratner, I wish I could stop there. I really do, but there's just so many things about this movie that made me fed up with it. I gave you a 4/10 simply for flamey car chuckage (which also hurt my brain slightly)(He's called ICEman for a reason and no, that reason isn't just because he can make ponds into skating rinks and have horrid love scenes with 13 year old girls) and Super Mega Freakout Phoenix which entertained me for about 5 minutes.Where's Mr. Singer?",X-Men - The Last Stand

1895,Spidy8,X-men 3,6,28 May 2006,"I liked a lot of things in this film, and hated just as many. I went and saw it on the midnight showing baring a false hope for this film to have the same fell to it as the first two. I knew that Ratner had taken on this project and loved all of his films he had done to date(Rush Hour, Rush Hour 2, Red Dragon). I thought that I was even lucky to get such a good seat at the showing. I sat own watched the starting, which started like the others had(for the most part). As I watched certain characters die that I had come to get used to in the previous films, I noticed that someone had sat in front of me with a giant afro. While I struggled to see the WHOLE screen, I realized that the story was not worth struggling for. So as the movie went on, I really just waited for the action, which at times was a let down as well. But mostly a great achievement. I go a little too far when I say i struggled to see. But I did only see about 2/3 of the screen. My point is, that when watching a more story worthy film, I might have struggles to see the other 1/3 of the screen for the rest of the time. Overall, it really fell victim to the it's publicity. I had such high expectations going into it, that it did hurt my review of the film a little. The most annoying part came when ....SPOILER..........the Brotherhood was taking the bridge, and as they got to Alcatraz....it went night-time. Just another overlooked, or lazy decision on Ratner's part.",X-Men - The Last Stand
1896,bham9598,The bonus after the credits-not worth waiting for....,8,30 May 2006,"I was told to wait for the bonus scene after the credits, which was hard to do considering I had a consumed an extra large coke during the movie. I would have rather sat through more previews, than have to see who the production assistant, costume assistant, and catering company were during the credits. The bonus could have been a lot better however, I think the movie was the best out of the three. The way mystique and magneto are defeated was a surprise. I think Storm's role was weak, she basically just spun around and brought some rain in for wine growers in napa valley. Beast and Wolverine were the best characters in the movie, while jean grey walked around looking like she had a migraine headache.",X-Men - The Last Stand
