0,TheLittleSongbird,So much better than I was expecting- great cast,8,15 August 2012,"Not that I was expecting it to be bad, just that the idea in hindsight was somewhat on the derivative side. However, I found Outlander to be a very entertaining movie. True, the second half is not as good as the first half, some parts of the storytelling seemed a little forced and the ending was predictable(I'll give you this though, the action is quite well choreographed). However, while the story is not the most original on the block(others have mentioned the parallels to Beowulf and Lord of the Rings) the first half is actually very interesting and entertaining with a noble stab at making the characters likable. It also looks great, the effects are good with a very menacing-looking monster and scenery and costumes that do at least have a sense of wonder and grit. The soundtrack is not too overbearing and has a good atmosphere, and the script has some snap and flow. Outlander is not entirely accurate perhaps but I have honestly seen movies that have done far worse jobs that are nowhere near as entertaining as Outlander. The characters have depth and likability, none of them are complex as such but they didn't feel like underdeveloped clichés either, which I personally thought was going to be the case. The cast was great on paper, and on screen I was also impressed. James Caviezel is an excellent lead, and a supporting cast that includes Sophia Myles, John Hurt and Ron Perlman promises much and the film delivered as much also. All in all, a great cast help to make Outlander a worthwhile film, the second half is not as well done as the rest of the film but wasn't a complete waste either. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Outlander
1,Leofwine_draca,Vikings meet Predator,5,15 November 2011,"Essentially this is a high-concept sci-fi flick with a simple premise: it's PREDATOR, done in Viking times. Having an intense love of both Vikings and rampaging alien monsters, I hoped I'd be in for a treat with this movie. It turns out to be an entertaining if not remarkable vehicle that goes through the motions in a calm, assured way without ever offering much in the way of novelty.The main problem is the script, which never seems to tackle some of the more interesting challenges the concept offers (such as the parallels with Beowulf or the stuff with the warring tribes). It's strictly by-the-numbers, with a clichéd view of the Viking age and art design that at all times is 'borrowed' from the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Realism/historical accuracy doesn't seem to be a high priority, either, with characters sporting such distinctly un-Viking names as Wulfric (Anglo-Saxon), and (God help me) Boromir.Saying that, the monster design is strong, and the special effects are often dazzlingly spectacular. Another plus is the cast, which is better than you might expect for a traditional B-movie such as this. Jim Caviezel (THE PASSION OF THE Christ) is a strong silent type as the alien hero, John Hurt performs well as a 'crinkly old elder', Ron Perlman is unrecognisable as a frightening warrior-chief, Jack Huston is charming as a youthful leader, and Sophia Myles is lovely as, well, the love interest.Altogether I found the film enjoyable if not profound, and if it pales in comparison to the classic monster movies of yesterday, it feels a lot better & more interesting than much similar fare (such as THE RELIC).",Outlander
2,SnoopyStyle,Good idea for sci-fi,6,15 December 2013,"Kainan (Jim Caviezel) is an alien who crash lands on Earth bringing with him an animal called Moorwen of immense power. He must convince the local Vikings led by King Hrothgar (John Hurt) to join him to battle the creature. Love interest is played by Sophia Myles.There is some good action, and a good premise for sci-fi historical drama. It starts off relatively well. There is good action and good drama. The monster is revealed a little too early. They could have saved it for some place more powerful.Then there is the middle where the tension is almost all drained away. Kainan knows the creature is still out there, but he barely protests as the Vikings parties. It makes little sense. And Jim Caviezel isn't able to maintain any suspense there. It reveals one thing during the feast, but it's hardly worth the time wasted. I rather have more hunting action.The final hunt is a little muddled and too extended. After the big battle, it feels too repetitive. It seems anti-climatic to have the best action happen so much earlier. And the final blow isn't quite so great. I would have expected something more head chopping.",Outlander
3,claudio_carvalho,Wonderful Adventure,8,14 March 2009,"In 709 DC, in the Iron Age, a spacecraft crashes in Norway in the Viking kingdom of Herot, and the pilot Kainan (James Caviezel) survives. He turns the beacon on; learns the language and culture of the planet using a machine; and finds that the predator called Moorwen that he was transporting had escaped. While chasing the alien monster, he finds a village completely destroyed and he is arrested by the warrior Wulfric (Jack Huston) that believed he killed the locals and is brought to Herot as prisoner. But sooner he proves his innocence and courage to King Rothgar (John Hurt) and his daughter Freya (Sophia Myles) falls in love for him. Kainan and Wulfric become friends and together they chase the Moorwen.""Outlander"" is a wonderful adventure and a great surprise for me indeed. The cast is excellent, leaded by James Caviezel; the lovely Sophia Myles, from ""Tristan + Isolde"" and ""Hallam Foe""; the veteran John Hurt; the always efficient Ron Perlman; and the unknown nephew of Anjelica Huston Jack Huston. The engaging story has elements of ""Starman"", ""Beowulf"" and ""Predator"", and is developed in a perfect pace. The special effects are decent and this movie is a great entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Outlander  Guerreiro Vs Predador"" (""Outlander  Warrior Vs Predator"")",Outlander
4,kosmasp,Standard (issue),5,24 March 2009,"The cast is really well chosen and it has a pretty neat script for a genre movie. Nothing to get too excited about, but many flaws get hidden by the passion that the actors portray their roles. Jim C. and Ron Pearlman should be mentioned at this point. Even if sometimes the motivation of the characters seem non-existent, you still stay with them and care for them.If you like movies who mix many genres and combine many things from other movies (could be called ""Tribute""), than you might enjoy the movie. But getting all those things into one movie, didn't really worked out very well. Still as a German saying goes ""better well stolen than badly invented"" ... and I've seen worse movies!",Outlander
5,ma-cortes,"Bloody Sci-Fi/epic with a lot of action, impressive battles , gore and guts",6,12 May 2020,"Set during the kingdom of Vikings in Norway, as an aircraft crash lands on Earth, there appears a man from outer space, James Caviezel. He is imprisoned by the Vikings, later on, he is freed by the king : John Hurt who has daughter : Sophia Milos who falls in love for him and whose jealous suitor results to be a tribe's brave warrior : Jack Huston. And all of them join forces to vanquish a feared monster that's consuming everything in its path. As the man from a far-off world along with the Vikings face off an enormous beast, a huge panther-like creature that emerges from the night to slash, maul and and eat their victims' remains. It destroyed his world. He won't let it destroys ours.This is a mixed bag mingling Vikings, extraterrestrial person and monsters in Alien Predator style . There is also a brief exploration of Viking life with rites, traditional habits and Gods .Taking parts here and there of other films as 13th warrior, Predator, and Beowulf . Some overwhelming wide screen images linger in the mind. At its best, this achieves the grandeur and beauty of a breathtaking Viking epic, at its worst, however, it feels an extravaganza blending various genres. Well starred by James Caviezel as a hero who's not from North but from outer space and relunctantly throws in his lot with these hairy-arsed, hard-drinking Nordic types to tackle a monstrous evil. He is finely accompanied by a nice cast as Sophia Milos, Jack Huston, John Hurt, Cliff Saunders and special mention for Ron Perlman as a two-fisted and tough warrior chief who seeks vengeance for death his wife and son.It packs a moving and thrilling musical score by Geoff Zanelli. As well as evocative, though dark cinematography by Pierre Gill. The motion picture was well written and directed by Howard McCain. He is a good writer and director who has written and shot a few films. As he has written : Underworld rise of Lycans and filmed : Unspeakable, No dessert dad till you mow the lawn and this Outlander. Rating : 6.5/10. Well worth watching. The flick will appeal to Science-fiction and fantasy enthusiasts.",Outlander
6,paul_haakonsen,Action and excitement,7,24 May 2010,"This movie took me by surprise.The story is nice, right from the beginning, and you will easily get caught up in the storyline. Which is good, so you will not get bored throughout the movie.The setting for the movie is nice as well, lots of details and it is all very believable.The cast was good and the acting was alright as well.As for the monster (or predator - call it what you like), it was very nicely made. And again, lots of detail and super cool effects. They did a good job at keeping you in suspense for the better part of the movie before actually revealing it fully to the audience.There is a lot of action scenes in the movie, and they are nice to look at. But there is also a lot of suspense as well, as the movie builds up gradually as more and more of the story becomes unveiled.The only bad thing about this movie, that I think anyway, is that it all ends way too soon. Although it is at normal length for movies, it just seems to be over way too soon. The movie could have used a little bit more time on something like character building and such.In overall, the storyline is a bit far out there, but hey, this is fantasy, not real anyway, so who cares? Enough action to keep most people satisfied and effects to keep you glued to the screen. I think that ""Outlander"" is definitely a movie that people should check out.",Outlander
7,hitchcockthelegend,Outlandish!,6,9 August 2015,"During the reign of the Vikings, a man from another planet crash lands on Earth and unfortunately brings with him a giant alien beast known as the Moorwen. Not only that, but once assimilating himself with this particular Viking faction, he finds that he is now part of a war they are engaged in with another Viking race.Yep, it's predator in the Viking age, berserker sci-fi played purely for entertainment and cheese sandwiches. Jesus Jimmy Caviezel brings the broody macho posturing, John Hurt the ham, while Ron Perlman picks up an easy pay check for growling a lot. It's still a lot of fun, though, the mixture of TV movie type production values mixing with a cheeky idea that sees the creation of a genuinely cool monster (effects not half bad at all). Good genre action for the undemanding genre faithful. 6/10",Outlander
8,Scarecrow-88,Outlander,6,9 January 2011,"How's this for a plot only Hollywood could come up with--an alien humanoid follows a voracious creature known as a Moorwhee to Planet Earth during Nordic times, joining forces with Vikings in order to kill it! James Caviezel(THE PASSION OF THE Christ)is Kainan, the alien humanoid whose space ship crashlands near where a Viking village is located, their king, Hrothgar(John Hurt; THE ELEPHANT MAN)in turmoil with a fellow Nordic leader, Gunnar(Ron Perlman), both trying to negotiate a peaceful co-existence, which will be put to a test when the Moorwhee arrives to feast on villagers. Hrothgar's daughter, Freya(Sophia Myles), is to be wed to future king, Wulfric(Jack Huston), but she, being an independent minded young woman, doesn't like the idea of her husband being chosen for her. When Kainan appears, first as a prisoner until he helps the Vikings slay a giant bear, they will all(including Gunnar after his men are vanquished by the Moorwhee)have to band together or else fall to extinction. Kainan has a plan to trap and destroy the Moorwhee but will need help from Hrothgar's men in order to do so. Well, one thing's for certain, the plot is unique. Viking warriors, along with an alien humanoid, in a war with a giant monster from another planet. The filmmakers shoot most of the action scenes at night, so that the creature's visibility isn't as strong, to hide the fact that it is a computer generated alien menace. The backstory does include why Kainan is out to kill the creature and how this adds to the Viking mythology such as his relationship to future leader, Erick the Red(Bailey Maughan), a child during this time of the movie. Kainan explains to Freya, his obvious love interest from the moment they lock eyes, that his people were actually responsible for the near genocide of the entire Moorwhee race, having invaded their world, nearly destroying every single creature who lived there. It gives the Moorwhee a sympathetic angle, yet they always remain the center danger of the movie. The creature lets of a red, fiery glow at night which gives away its location..when it comes after the humans, extra tails which whip and slice anyone in its path, not to mention, it has these slobbery, sharp teeth, revealed when its slimy mouth opens. Caviezel fulfills the ""quiet, steely"" warrior archetype, a silent, brooding hero who speaks with little words, letting his actions do the talking. Huston, on the other hand, is all ""fight and kill"", not cerebral as much as he is courageous and brave..the problem with their current threat is that the creature will have to be stopped through the use of cunning and skill, not just men with swords & bows and arrows charging after it. Myles is all ""warrior woman"", even going toe to toe with one of Gunnar's men when they intrude upon Hrothgar's village(Gunnar believes Hrothgar was responsible for the massacre of his camp), resistant to her father's ideals about marrying Wulfric and becoming a ""proper, obedient wife"". I think the problem with OUTLANDER is the fact that it's hard to see what's going on when the action ensues, such as when Gunnar and his men raid Hrothgar's compound in a night assault, or the two major battles with the giant Moorwhee(along with it's smaller offspring) where it's hard to make heads or tails out of who's winning or losing. I sound like a broke record, but if I am to get any enjoyment out of action scenes I should be able to see them. Squinting my eyes and trying to penetrate the dark becomes taxing on my patience particularly when I want to see the Vikings in combat with the alien creature. There are faint images of beheadings and bloody carnage, but not enough to come away satisfied. Too bad, the premise is rather imaginative and I figure there's a lot of potential wasted.",Outlander
9,poolandrews,Not bad I suppose but nothing special.,5,19 December 2011,"Outlander is set in 709 A.D. & starts as a spaceship crash lands in Norway, the only survivor is Kainan (Jim Caviezel) who is an alien buts looks exactly the same as a human man. Also crash landing on Earth with Kainan was a huge vicious alien creature called a Moorwen & Kainan sets out to hunt it down & kill it, however Kainan is captured by a local Viking tribe. The Viking tribe is then attacked by by the Moorwen who kills everyone it comes across, the Viking tribe didn't believe Kainan at first but soon change their minds when they see the alien creature. Kainan & the tribe decide to work together to try & hunt, trap & kill the Moorwen before it wipes them out completely...This German American co-production was co-written & directed by Howard McCain who had originally pitched the idea around Hollywood back in the 90's but didn't get made until this was produced, McCain apparently always wanted Outlander to be based on the epic poem Beowulf translated into Viking culture, a heavy science fiction horror aspect was also added with alien monsters, spaceships & the like. I have to say that I actually feel quite indifferently about Outlander, while I sat there & watched it & enjoyed it enough for what it is I didn't love it & I doubt I would ever want to see it again & I will probably have forgotten about it within a week, at almost two hours long it moves at a decent pace, has some good action & horror scenes but never really amazed me or had me on the edge of my seat. The script is alright but I have the same sort of complaints as many other's, the Moorwen is at first shown as a slobbering monster but when Kainan recites his story about how his people brutally exterminated them by the millions then your sympathy switches & you end up feeling a little sorry for the Moorwen, none of this is it's fault & in a way by setting out a territory it's just doing to the Vikings what it's species had done to it by Kainan's people so are we really meant to root for Kainan? The parallels between what happened on the Moorwen planet & what starts happening on Earth are clear enough & the themes of acceptance & family & friendship are all touched upon but the script & character's aren't really deep enough for this to be that effective although the slight depth it does offer is welcome if not exactly groundbreaking.The CGI computer effects in Outlander are really rather good, the Moorwen looks great while the bombing of the Moorwen planet & the bulldozing of the charred corpses is also impressive. There's some good gore here, there's a decapitations, lots of ripped up bodies & severed limbs, plenty of blood splatter, a sword plunged through someone's throat & the makers seem to have a fascination with showing dead, ripped up animals including a Whale with it's stomach ripped open! The sets are also good with an entire Viking village. Visually Outlander looks great, shot in 2:35:1 widescreen the entire frame is used & there are some nice images & shots here as the icy locations, dark caves & a huge waterfall stand out.With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 Outlander received next to no publicity when it was released in barely a handful of cinemas in the US & made a mere $160,000. Ouch. Filmed in Newfoundland & Nova Scotia in Canada despite being set entirely in Norway. The acting isn't the best, Jim Caviezel makes for a bland hero, Sophia Myles is alright as the obligatory love interest while John Hury doesn't particularly convince as a tough Viking king although the bulky Ron Pearlman does in a cameo that's too short.Outlander is a decent enough historic science fiction monster film that was better than I expected but at the same time I didn't love, a good solid film for sure with some good gore & CGI effects but it just lacks a little something & Jim Caviezel's dull hero doesn't help.",Outlander
10,CinemaSerf,"""Predator"" meets ""Lord of the Rings""",6,7 February 2020,"Actually quite a classy looking adventure yarn about a man from the future (Jim Caviezel) stranded after his spaceship crashes and who befriends a group of Vikings as they fight against the deadly ""Moorwen"". It isn't at all original, but is a passable action film with some suitably rousing music to accompany the determined resistance of our band of heroes. John Hurt, Ron Perlman and Sophie Myles leading the Norse alliance. Jack Huston is way too good looking to be convincing as a warrior (a bit like David Wenham in ""LOTR""). There's no doubt about the ending; and at 2 hours it really does stretch the theory a bit - but if you like fantasy escapism then you could do a lot worse than this.",Outlander
11,dbborroughs,The first half is about the characters the second is about the action,7,7 August 2009,"Norway 709. In the middle of a Viking war a space traveler crashes to earth bringing with him a dragon like beast that likes to kill and destroy. This is a good action film that the Weinstein organization seemed to dump into theaters as an after thought. I don't remember the film ever playing around New York, though it may have played in the city. Better than its one sentence description makes it out to be, this is a rip roaring action film that is really good once it gets going. Slow to start, the film actually takes time to set out characters and situations so that you actually care what happens about them when their lives are put into danger. The violence is bloody and graphic (though I really wish they had not used computers to put the gore effects in since it never fully looks real.) Once the film got going I found that I actually liked the film a great deal. Granted its not perfect, there are bits of illogic and some silliness, but quibbling about the small bits when I was happily accepting the central premise of aliens running around the frozen north seemed rather pointless. Worth a bowl of popcorn and soda.",Outlander
12,zardoz-13,Vikings & Aliens,8,16 March 2012,"Writer & director Howard McCain's bloodthirsty sci-fi saga about an alien who plunges to Earth in a spaceship that harbors a murderous ""Alien"" type monster qualifies as above average. John Hurt and Ron Perlman are Norse warriors fighting each other until they discover that there are bigger things about to munch on them. The worst that can be said is that this ambitious epic needed more than the $50 million that the producers pumped into it. The CGI looks obvious but it doesn't slow down the narrative. Basically, this is about a deadly hunt and the usual characters who set out to kill the beastie die in the process. Predictable but interesting outing finds Jim Caviezel adapting to Earth's atmosphere and helping rugged Viking warriors as they try to corner and kill a rather devastating lizard with an insatiable appetite for humans. The Dirk Blackman & McCain screenplay shuns sexuality and profanity but ladles more than enough blood and gore. Unfortunately some major plot points are sacrificed, but ""Outlander"" doesn't suffer too much. Hurt plays a Viking king and Perlman is cast as a rival patriarch who smashes skulls between his hammers. Initially, these characters believe that they are trying to wipe out each other until our hero tells them about the ""Alien"" type monster that is killing them off by the dozens on both sides. Eventually, the two leaders form an alliance, but this alliance comes too late to discourage the predatory monster. McCain takes everything right down to the wire. ""Outlander"" is definitely worth watching, especially if you like to see people with their heads taken off at the neck.",Outlander
13,view_and_review,Dull,4,30 October 2021,"I remember when a couple of aliens came to Earth hunting some predatory aliens. That was called ""Critters"" and it was pretty good. It was funny as well as exciting. Then there was a movie in which some menly men hunted an alien predator. That was called ""Predator"" and it was also good.This movie was rather cliche and boring. This was some LOTR, Vikings, GoT type stuff with no compelling story. The outlander in this movie was Kainan (Jim Caviezel), a man from another planet who brought a bloodthirsty predator with him. When Kainan and his new friends weren't hunting the beast they filled it with other time-passing scenes establishing Kainan as a good guy and a hero. In the end it was predictability abound and really quite dull.",Outlander
14,neil-476,Very enjoyable,8,22 August 2010,"Vikings vs alien monsters - what's not to like? Not much, actually - this is a very enjoyable movie which successfully blends two very disparate genres.Spacefarer Kainan crash-lands, not realising that he has a deadly hitchhiker on board. Oh, and he crash-lands in 8th century Norway. So he has to help the Viking settlement combat the monster he has brought with him.Production values are high, set and production design are good, and effects are generally well produced (the creature is well designed albeit the CGI is a bit naff at times).The script and direction are workmanlike, in service of a simple but effective story (there is a bit more depth to the monster than one might expect). The cast are serviceable, but there is a standout turn from Jim Caviezel who brings a mournful vulnerability to the displaced Kainan.I have only two criticisms. One is comedy drunk Viking Boromir who, I felt, was misjudged. The other is the fact that Kainan has a piece of super whizzo equipment which teaches him the entire language of the place he has landed, and apparently the first word it teaches him is - well it begins with ""F"". How unnecessary.But overall, this is a highly enjoyable romp.",Outlander
15,siderite,Beowulf 2009 - lame,4,15 March 2009,"At first I thought maybe this would have like a very original script. It featured James Caviezel so it couldn't be bad, right? WRONG! This is the lamest Beowulf adaptation since forever... and I have seen a few.Imagine that The 13th Warrior was an alien from space, Grendel was a monster from space, the vikings are like small snacks for aliens and in the end the vikings win.However, none of the intelligence of 13th Warrior was present, nor the ingenuity of Christopher Lambert's steam-punk film, nor the philosophy of the Grendel book were present in this one. The acting was poor, the script was ridiculous, and whatever John Hurt and Ron Perlman were doing in this movie, they didn't do it right. The monster effects and design were decent enough, all 5 minutes of them.I mean, you have an Alien like monster, you have at least three decent actors and a great story like Beowulf with its myriad adaptations and reinventions. And what do you do? A poor-man's remake of Alien 3 with James Caviezel doing his Jesus routine (getting beaten all movie, then almost rising to heaven).Bottom line: stay as far away from this. Yuck! Phooey! Phuthew!",Outlander
16,sddavis63,I Didn't Care For It - But If You Like This Kind Of Fantasy Film It Might Be Worthwhile,2,1 April 2010,"I suppose if you're up for a good Moorwen hunt, this is a movie you'll love. Moorwen are large, nasty creatures from an alien world who were wiped out by humans. One managed to stow away on board a space ship that brings Kainan (Jim Caviezel) to earth - the opening of the movie suggests that earth was originally colonized by Kainan's people. They arrive in the year 709AD in Norway. Not surprisingly, the Moorwen wreaks havoc upon the poor Vikings and Kainan - after having originally been captured and imprisoned by the Norse - leads them in battle against this terrifying creature, eventually emerging victorious, and being made the tribe's king.After that brief synopsis, I have to confess that this movie did little for me. I found the story strangely dull, even though it did have a lot of action in it. The best part of the movie - to me at least - was probably the recreation of the Viking village, which did have an air of authenticity to it. I suppose if you're into this kind of fantasy film (the ""point"" to this - if there is one - might, I suppose, be to explain the origins of the dragon myths) you'll enjoy this, but it wasn't for me.",Outlander
17,The-Sarkologist,A Hidden sci-fi gem,9,18 October 2013,"This is one of those secret gems. What I mean by that is that the movie was not a blockbuster and in many cases didn't even appear in the cinemas, but you may stumble across it at a video shop, a friend's house, or as in my case, as a part of a collection that somebody was getting rid of because he was going to Japan. Even then, you will look at the cover and think about whether you really want to watch it, but decide that you will do so, and as such, when you do, you suddenly discover that this is a really good movie.Outlander is about a spaceman (Kainan, play by James Caviezel, of the Passion fame) who crashes to earth during the age of the vikings. However on his ship is an alien monster that escapes and he has to then, with the help of the vikings, track it down and kill it. As such this movie is sort of a cross between an alien movie and a dragon movie as the alien creature, not only is it incredibly powerful, but has reminiscences of the alien (without the acid for blood, though one is expecting this to happen a number of times during the movie).There probably isn't much to write about, except that the vikings must swallow their pride and learn to trust a stranger, and Kainan must also overcome his guilt for being the member of a colonising race of aliens who will simply destroy a planet so that they may colonise the planet. In the end though, it is a modern swords and sandal fantasy film, though one does not necessarily call such films that anymore. In this age of computers we are able to make even the lowest budget film look top class. I have also noticed that the acting quality of a lot of films has also substantially increased. I remember hiring films from the video shop and grimacing because the acting was atrocious. That simply does not seem to be the case anymore, though one can easily get around that by having what I generally call a 'silent' film. That is, not a film that has no sound, but a film where the main characters simply do not say much.",Outlander
18,paulclaassen,Underrated action adventure fantasy drama.,6,2 June 2021,"I've seen 'Outlander' a few times already and - although by no means a perfect movie - I'm entertained every time I see it. There's just something about the action adventure element I really enjoy. I love the medieval setting for this futuristic movie. The naïve nature of the Vikings makes the film more exciting in a way, and more suspenseful. The cinematography is beautiful, and the film has a really great score, too.We follow Kainan (Jim Caviezel) who crash lands on Earth, and becomes the hero he never thought he could be. His back story is told in bits and pieces throughout the film and we root even more for him once we learn of the heartache he had to endure - fighting his inner demons and battling to come to terms with what happened, and what he did as a soldier. The film certainly has a great deal of heart and soul, with emotional impact, and good character development.There's action galore and also the occasional brutal scenes. The visuals are also fairly good. I enjoy 'Outlander' for its many different genre elements, and beautiful scenery. This is an underrated gem of an action fantasy film.",Outlander
19,Tweetienator,Entertaining Mixture,6,14 April 2021,Outlander is a surprisingly entertaining affair.

20,thinker1691,""" The Thirteenth Warrior, Beowulf and Alien, . . . mix well """,10,11 August 2009,"John Hurt has plays so many roles it is difficult which he personally would select as his best. For Me, I've seen him play mad emperors, tyrant Dictators and pleasant storytellers all with the same conviction of a true Thespian. In this film "" The Outlander "" his role is relegated to playing the courageous Rothgar, the Danish Chiefton of the Northland Vikings. From out in the distant galaxies and far from his own home world, comes 'Kainan' a space traveler (James Caviezel) who's spacecraft has been damaged and sent careening towards Earth. Upon crashing, he discovers he is on 'Old Earth' circa 10th century, Norway. Unfortunately, he quickly ascertains one of the creatures he was battling in space has joined him when he lands. Here he must not only adapt to the Viking way of life, but hunt down and destroy the last of a race of creatures called the 'Moorwen.' Sophia Myles plays Freya, the chieftain's strong willed daughter and Wulfric (Jack Huston) the brave heir apparent. Ron Perlman is Gunnar and displays some excellent acting as does young Bailey Maughan who is Erick. The movie is a surprising blend of Alien, the 13th warrior and Beowulf. The dramatic action theme is way above par, while the physical confrontational scenes and special effects are incredible. A superb movie and a worthwhile entry on it's way to becoming a memorable Classic. Highly recommended for all! ****",Outlander
21,JoeB131,The Whine-steins strike again...,2,1 June 2009,"Someone please stop the Weinstein brother from making films... please. Stop them.Okay, the bottom line here is that a space dude played by Caveziel crash lands in 8th century Norway. After making nice with some Vikings, he is accepted into the tribe as an alien monster he brought with him called a Morween is picking off the villagers.Almost unrecognizable in this film are John Hurt and Ron Perleman as rival Viking kings. Hurt is quite good, and almost completely disappears into the role. But the problem is that despite the actors, the movie is predictable. The Monster acts like it is a first cousin to the monster from the Alien movies. You have the typical romance, the typical set up for the trap at the film's climax, and so on.And the monster itself is such bad CGI that it lacks credibility.Even the Whine-Steins realized they had a stinker on their hands, and released it in January quietly in a few theaters so they could rush it to DVD...",Outlander
22,MBunge,Even the best studios plop out crap like this every so often,4,19 June 2011,"Whenever someone at The Weinstein Company starts to get a big head about all the critically acclaimed, award winning films they've brought to the screen, someone should remind them they're also responsible for unleashing this turd on the movie-going public. It's like the script was strapped down to a table and had every ounce of intelligence and creative integrity cut out of it, as though it were some hapless victim in a torture porn flick. Jim Caviezel appears to be trying to even out his acting karma for The Passion of the Christ by turning in a performance that starts out taciturn and petrifies into stone-faced. Outlander has the moral center of George Armstrong Custer and the storytelling finesse of Chuck Norris. Its only ambition is to hit the lowest common denominator for action cinema and it fails even at that.Kainan (Jim Caviezel) is a spaceman whose ship crash lands in 8th century Norway. He falls in with a tribe of Vikings led by the aging Hrothgar (John Hurt) and his reckless nephew Wulfric (Jack Huston). These Vikings are currently at odds with another tribe led by Gunnar (Ron Perlman), but that takes a back seat when an alien creature that was aboard Kainan's ship starts slaughtering everyone in sight. The Vikings turn to the stranger in their midst to help them kill the beast and Hrothgar's handsome daughter Freya (Sophia Myles) turns to Kainan for more than that. Then the creature has a baby, we find out Kainan is guilty of genocide and there's a final clash between Viking and alien that looks like it was conceived as a level in an Outlander video game.This piece of crap does have a few good nuggets sticking out of it. Sophia Myles is very appealing in the entirely generic and predictable role of Freya. Ron Perlman as the rival Viking chief looks like an awesome badass. The way the alien creature generates light to use as a hunting/defense mechanism is also kind of neat. Put all together, however, and it doesn't add up to more than 10 minutes of quality in this nearly two hour long drizzling stink of a film.Let's start with Kainan being from an advanced civilization yet, aside from a momentary outburst of martial arts, fits in with the Vikings as though he were from the village down the road. For about 95% of the movie, Kainan being an alien from outer space is completely irrelevant to the story and to his character. All of the possibilities of suggested by dropping a spaceman into the midst of primitive warriors are utterly ignored, except for one occasion where it satisfies a plot device.Then there's the whole subplot about tribal rivalries. Great expositional pains are taking to establish how much Wulfric and Gunnar hate each other, giving the audience every reason to believe that dispute will play some significant role in the film. But not only do Wulfric and Gunnar have virtually no interaction, Gunnar is summarily dispatched in the middle of the story and the whole rival tribe thing is forgotten. It's almost as if these filmmakers simply needed more people for the creature to kill and this rival tribe thing was the best they could come up with.There's also a list of clichés that get checked off as the movie unfolds. Comedic side-kick for Kainan? Check. Young boy to whom Kainan becomes a father figure? Check. The creature dangling off the edge of a cliff and trying to drag Kainan with it? Check. About the only cliché missed in this script is one that's set up and then vanishes down the memory hold. At the beginning, Wulfric is eyeing Freya for a wife. When Kainan enters the scene, the whole love triangle nonsense is right there in front of everyone's face but nothing happens. Wulfric never gets jealous of Kainan and, in fact, I'm not sure he and Freya say two words to each other the rest of the movie.And I can't leave out the fact that Kainan was part of a colonization effort that killed off the rest of the species of the alien creature. So, he's not just the guy trying to make up for accidentally bringing the beast to Earth. He's also a bloody mass murderer. Why the viewer is supposed to overlook that and empathize with Kainan and his plight is never clear.Outlander was a massive box office bomb when it was released. I've seen many films that suffered similar fates and deserved better. This one doesn't. However much money it lost, it wasn't enough.",Outlander
23,sauravjoshi85,Good and entertaining movie!!!!,8,13 April 2019,The outlander is a period movie set in the Viking period and it's amazingly entertaining movie. The plot is gripping and will keep you engaged. A special mention to be given to it's screenplay which is impeccable. Story is good so as direction. There are very few avoidable loopholes but this will not spoil the movie watching experience. Acting and background music is nice. Overall an entertaining action packed movie.,Outlander
24,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Absolutely loved it,8,15 June 2016,"""Beowulf meets Predator"" boasts the enthusiastic critic blurb on the poster of one of my favourite sci fi genre benders, Outlander. It's pure outlandish fun, and better yet it knows it is and therefore doesn't feel any need to spend a bunch of time on grasping exposition to convince you of any shred of authenticity. It simply hums along on a pure rush of unchecked adventure, always aiming to please and for the very most part, doing so wonderfully. Jim Caviesel stars, and he's an unassuming Ken doll of an actor who has more intensity than anyone gives him credit for, which always makes me spring to attention when he's in the driver's seat. Here he plays Kainen, a voyager from a far away galaxy who has crash landed his spacecraft on earth way back in the time of the Vikings, stranded and in need of refuge. Only problem is, he's been on the run for some time from a large, hideous and very dangerous creature from his home planet called Moorwen. Moorwen has a very personal and deadly vendetta against Kainen, one which threatens the Viking tribe who give him shelter, led by noble king Hrothgar (John Hurt). Kainen comes from a planet with technology and civilization far advanced from Earth at that time, which makes him a hit with the tribesmen and even more so with Hrothgar's daughter (Sophia Myles). Moorwen threatens their way of life in its rampage against Kainen, causing tragic collateral damage to a rival clan led by Gunnar (Ron Perlman makes heartbreaking and stone tough work of what is essentially an extended cameo). It's an awesome movie no matter what anyone says. Any film about an astronaut from a far off galaxy who bands together with friggin vikings to battle a fluorescent space dragon is just automatically a winner. In all seriousness though, this one really is something special,and almost seems like a Dennis Quaid vehicle if it were made in the 80's. Fun, thrilling and never too serious, it knows it's place and owns the genre shelf it sits on.",Outlander
25,Enchorde,Viking vs Alien. Pure fun.,7,24 November 2009,"Recap: Kainan is from a futuristic society that has mastered space travel and has conquered other worlds. But during a mission his ship suffers a malfunction and he crashes on Earth up in Scandinavia, right into the 8th century and the Viking era. With him he unknowingly brings a stow-away. A morween. Morweens are a hideous and blood thirsty monster that instantly goes on a rampage. Now Kainan must adapt to his new backwards technology and ally himself with the Vikings to bring this monster down.Comments: Will not ever be mistaken for any kind of serious movie, but taken correctly it is all good fun. Or who could ever oppose the splendid combination of Sci-Fi monsters and spacecraft with Viking swords? The story is not unique or stellar in any kinds, it resembles a little of other movies depicting the Viking era like the 13th Warrior, but it works. A little predictable but enough to keep interest and to motivate the action.Unfortunately the CGI and the special effects are uneven in quality. Most of the times it is quite good but at times it becomes cheesy, plastic and plain bad actually. Not the kind you would expect from a movie with a little higher ambition.The cast is not bad at all. Jim Caviezel is good in the lead, but doesn't shine. Then veteran John Hurt impresses more but especially Ron Perlman is great as a Viking chieftain, he looks made for the part! Sophia Myles does well as the female lead but unfortunately her character falls back to the stereotypic, woman in need of rescue, after a strong beginning. I hope she gets more chances, she seem more than competent to handle the female lead in action movies.7/10",Outlander
26,bob-rutzel-1,As good as Beowulf and others,10,1 August 2009,"Kainan's (Caviezel) space ship crashes to earth in the year 709AD and he is the only survivor. The beast (read monster) he was transporting to his home world escapes and terrorizes a Viking town.This is every bit as good as the movie Beowulf (gave it an A) and could become a classic as it has all the ingredients: town afraid of the monster, a good king Rothgar (Hurt), a beautiful woman, Freya (Myles) who won't marry the man the king, her father, wants her to marry; someone (Kainan) who is new to the kingdom and catches Freya's eye, a bad king or leader (Pearlman) from another town in the country and he blames the good king for everything. The only thing missing is Kainan's adversary. Wulfric (Huston) would have become that guy, but he and Kainan become friends. Who would have thought? These new classics are becoming more epic friendly. Chummy.You now know everything and can see all the way to Russia and you know what will happen from here on in. But, it's in the telling, the dialogue, the looks, the movements, the fighting, the looks, the dialogue. (Is there an echo in here?) that counts. Very well done. This movie ranks up there with Beowulf, King Arthur, Braveheart and the 13th Warrior. It is that good. Good story, great acting performances by all, nothing wasted and I was on the edge of my seat when they got serious about going after the monster. The action scenes and CGI were terrific. I was even ducking blows and staying still so the monster wouldn't see me. You have never seen a monster like this one. You'll be hiding too. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, one F-bomb by Kainan in the early scenes when he crashes.",Outlander
27,nancyldraper,Suspend disbelief,6,21 November 2020,"If you can suspend disbelief that Vikings could be susceptible to an Alien menace, then you might enjoy this movie. The draw for me was Jim Caviezel. The surprise and welcomed casting was John Hurt and Ron Perlman. John Hurt always brings a sense of gravitas because of his vast, classical stage background. Sophia Myles is a fine actress but not very convincing as a Viking Chieftain's daughter. That may be more a casting, direction or scripting failure. The part needed more grit and less doe eyed beauty. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Fantasy Action]",Outlander

29,Vomitron_G,"About vikings and a giant monster from space... nothing to get all grumpy about, is there?",7,24 February 2010,"Here we have a film about two viking tribes going berserk in an ongoing clan-vendetta on the one hand. On the other hand, the plot throws in a huge alien monster, crash-landing on earth, followed by a human hunter (not from this earth) – in the form of James Caviezel – determined to kill off the giant booger. Call me whatever you want, but a film bonkers enough to mix these two elements, is bound to raise my interest. And I'm sure there's other people thinking exactly like me. As a bonus, we also get to see John Hurt and Ron Pearlman in this epic monster picture (sure, both perhaps slightly underused, but at least they're starring in something decent enough, so who cares?). ""Outlander"" is much closer to mindless popcorn entertainment than anything else, but as far as monster movies go, it delivers. What matters most in a film like this, are the special effects, and these are outstanding. Naturally, the monster is made mostly out of CGI, however, you can clearly see (especially near the end) the CGI regarding the creature was based on very detailed sculptures of the beast. It looks great, even changes color and above all, has some form of intelligence. Kainan (James Caviezel) his background story was even decent too. Him and the creature are here on earth for a reason, and the vikings are merely along for the ride. And their odds are not looking good. Further more, ""Outlander"" plays it straight-faced. No stupid attempts at humor were made, and this helps things a lot. In my humble opinion, ""Outlander"" easily surpasses other recent 'alien creatures running amok on earth' films like for example the two ""Alien Vs. Predator"" installments. When going into ""Outlander"", just switch off your brain, and have fun or allow yourself to be impressed. It's slick, solid & polished enough to be so.",Outlander

31,ElijahCSkuggs,"Grab some friends, drink it up and then laugh it up!",5,12 February 2009,"If you're looking for a mix of action/adventure/scifi/fantasy, look no further. Whoop scratch that, you can find much better. But if you've seen a ton of films, then there's really no harm. But honestly, Outlander is as average as it gets.The movie is about Caviziel aka Outlander, crash-landing on Earth. To be more precise, Norway 790 AD. The era of Viking power. I love Viking stuff, they're pretty much the epitome of manliness. F@ck the pirates, the ninjas and all those wimps. Brute strength and beards is where it's at. Anyways, he crashes with a blood-thirsty creature on board, and now it's loose. Now it's up to him and the Viking people to stop it.I really didn't expect much going into Outlander besides some cool special effects and some nice cinematography. Well, Caviziel's a good actor so I was hoping he'd be good as well. All of that was fine. The creature was cool looking, the shots were stylish, and Jesus Boy did an alright job. But boy-howdy is this flick cheesy. Holy crap. The writing and characters in this film are seriously laugh worthy. Watch it with a friend and just sit back and make fun. During the film my brother and I were shouting out things like, ""I am Sh!t-Beard."", ""Outlander? More like the Pedophiler."", and just simply screaming ""Outlander"". Trust me on this one, this is one movie NOT to take seriously. The emotional scenes are sooo laughable. The lines are predictable, the characters silly, the action too dark....but the movie was still kinda fun.It's rare when you get a big-budget flick action flick like this and it turns out to be a cheeseball. It's pretty startling some people actually fell for the emotion, but if you've got any of your wits about you, your first reaction will be a smile. Sit back, get a funny friend, maybe some brews, enjoy the action, and laugh at everything else. Oh, Ron Perlman was in it too, and played a pretty sweet part as a huge viking!",Outlander
32,ajs-10,"Blood and guts, some swordplay and a touch of Sci-Fi thrown in.",7,31 May 2010,"I bought this disc on a whim, I hadn't heard anything about the film but something about it appealed to be. Too often these types of purchase end up quite disappointing, but fortunately the gods smiled on me this time. Don't get me wrong, it's far from prefect, but it does what it says on the tin. It's exciting, entertaining and there's a dragon (of sorts) in it.In the year 709AD a spaceship crash lands in a lake in what is now Norway. Two occupants make it to the shore before the ship sinks. One of them removes his helmet and passes out, the other does not move. When the first one awakes, he finds his companion has died. He retrieves a device from the lake and discovers where he has landed. The device 'downloads' all the available information about the language and culture of the region directly into his brain. Exploring, he finds a village, totally deserted; it has been attacked by some large creature. Catching sight of riders in the woods he starts to run, but is run down by one of the riders. Waking up in another settlement, he gives them his name, Kainan. The settlement is ruled by Rothgar, whose daughter Freya is promised to Wulfric who will be the next king. The village that Kainan had found was ruled by Gunnar who is away trading. They fear that Gunnar will blame them for the raid. Kainan tells them that the village was destroyed by a Moorwen, an alien creature he had inadvertently brought on his ship. Before long the Moorwen attacks the settlement and it also attacks Gunnar returning from his trading trip. The leaders combine forces to fight off this alien foe and they turn to Kainan for help.It's a very well made film with, for the most part, some excellent special effects. The story, although slightly predictable, was quite enjoyable and the fight scenes were all very well done. Pretty good performances from all of the main cast; James Caviezel as Kainan, Sophia Myles as Freya, Jack Huston as Wulfric, John Hurt as Rothgar and Ron Perlman as Gunnar.I guess my only criticism is with the accents. Why do half of the cast seem to think Vikings spoke with Irish accents? I find it really irritating! Apart from that it was a pretty good effort. It did tend to get a bit baggy in the middle, but over all pretty entertaining, if a bit gory at times. If you like a bit of blood and guts, some swordplay and a touch of Sci-Fi thrown in, then it's recommended.My score: 6.6/10",Outlander
33,Darkside-Reviewer,A high quality B movie,4,26 October 2020,"I never saw Outlander in theatre's or even when it was released on DVD & Blu Ray back in 2008 I had little to no interest in watching it. Then after over a decade of forgetting this movie even existed I came across Outlander on Blu Ray brand new for only 50p so I thought I'd give it a watch it can't be all that bad I thought to myself.Outlanders story is just bizarre it's about a man named Kainan (Jim Caviezel) who's ship crash lands on earth in the Nortic Viking era. The ship he arrived on was unknowingly carrying a dragon/beast type creature from another planet called a Moorwen. Kainan discovers that the Moorwen is now carving it's way through villages killing and eating it's occupants leaving no bodies only destruction in it's wake. Kainan is captured by a tribe of Viking settlers who think he is the one behind the attacks on the villages but soon after his capture the Moorwen attacks the Viking settlement killing many of the settlers. Kainan is soon freed and offers to help the Vikings hunt the Moorwen down with them before it kills and eats everyone and everything in it's path but this proves to be easier said than done when the only weapons they have are swords, spears, shields and bows & arrows not enough to kill the Moorwen.The story is loosely based and say that generously on the 19th-century epic poem Beowulf. This movie ""Interpretation"" tries to make an old story more modern by basically adding a clique science fiction element to the story. The mash up of Science Fiction in the Viking era is certainly an interesting mix that stands out from other movies in the Science Fiction genre but it's hard to take a movie with such a ridiculous storyline and concept seriously.Outlander is basically a high quality science fiction B movie that's clearly not meant to be taken seriously it's just an hour and a half of swords, made up creatures and unintentional comedy moments. The only reason Outlander had a cinematic release was because it boasts a few famous names attached to it like (Jim Caviezel), (John Hurt) and (Ron Perlman) if they weren't in this movie then it would of simply been laughed off as a B movie and would have been released straight to video like every other science fiction B movie. The movie is now over a decade old and you can find it in every discount bargain bin at every movie store where it was destined to end up.The special effects are somewhat decent the Moorwen creature doesn't look terrible and there are some pretty gory scenes that show the creature taking bites out of dead bodies aswell as a few beheadings one which is a scene of (Ron Perlman) character getting his head sliced off which is arguably the best scene in the entire movie. There is also a scene that shows a man's stomach being ripped open while the creature feasts on his innards. The only thing that really let's this movie down are some of the obviously fake backgrounds that are used in some of the outside dialogue scenes.I recommend giving Outlander a watch if you've got a couple of friends over and need a so bad it's good movie to laugh and make fun of over beer and chips.",Outlander

Searching for movies or whatever else I could find. Unfortunately there isn't a whole lot. The Vikings show is great. I always heard that this was a retelling of Beowulf. Which it is but very subtly. There are the very main story points and little things but I don't think the writers held themselves to Beowulf.And it's actually very accurate to Vikings history. I was surprised. Of course I can over look the many British accents. This really feels like a B movie that they made with the intentions of being an A movie.John Hurt really adds a lot to this.

43,ExpendableMan,Vikings Versus Predator,6,19 December 2013,"Stupider than a Viking warrior wearing a helmet with the horns on the inside and drenched in just as much blood, 'Outlander' is a fun but forgettable romp through Dark Ages Norway. The actors don't seem to know if they should be speaking in an olde timey manner or not, the plot is full of holes and by the time a Priest explodes like an offal-crammed water balloon, any hint of serious film making has long since disappeared. That being said however, if you've got a six pack in the fridge and want something to take your mind off the mortgage for two hours, Outlander is far from a bad choice. It's just a shame the monster isn't a bit more impressive.Kicking off with a spaceship crash landing in a lake, the film revolves around Kainan (Jim Caviezel), a distinctly human looking space marine who finds himself stranded on Earth alongside the ferocious monster that was hitching a ride with him. Faster than you can say ""are you sure you shouldn't leave that impressive space armour on,"" he's been accosted by Jack Huston's Wulfric, a Viking Prince who hungers for the crown and brought to the attention of King Hrothgar (John Hurt). At first, Kainan is blamed for the slaughter of a nearby village but it's not long before the real monster turns up and starts butchering all the extras. Kainan teams up with his captors and they start trying to find ways to kill their seemingly indestructible foe with an array of spears, arrows and swords. This results in a couple of very messy set pieces (the 'whale oil trap' scene is terrific) but any trace of subtlety disappears very early on. The special effects team also seem incredibly proud of their monster, a sort of giant crocodile thing with a bio-luminescent tail, but unfortunately this means they want to show it off. A lot. They don't believe in teasing the audience with fleeting glimpses and instead show it off repeatedly as it leaps through the forests ripping warrior's arms out. It's not surprising then that suspense barely gets a look in and the film instead turns into a long game of ""who dies next?"" And while it leans on Predator for inspiration the creature is nowhere near as iconic as Stan Winston's legendary hunter and instead feels more like it's been cobbled together out of bits of lesser movie monsters. 'Outlander' therefore isn't a film to watch if you're after an instant classic, but for a drunken bloodbath with a much better cast than it deserves, it'll definitely fit the bill. Any time it requires more than Norsemen being torn to pieces it struggles, but any film which features Ron Pearlman as an axe wielding lunatic with a facial tattoo has got to be worth a glimpse.",Outlander

No Beowulf. No Grendel. No Bad, cheesy FX.Space Marine crashlands in 6th Century Norway and brings along with him a alien enemy that starts tearing havoc through the primitive viking people there.The story is simple enough, but the execution is VERY GOOD. The lead character is solid, believable and likable. The Viking hold that takes him prisoner is actually pretty believable with a lot of nice historic touches (If you can excuse the British accents here and there). The angle about the Beast stirring up a feud between settlements makes a lot of sense. And they carried over the acceptance of the Space Marine (Outlander) into the clan in a manner that made social sense-- at least as far as Sci-Fi films go)The FX were very well done, especially the back story where you are filled in on how the Hero came to marooned on this planet-- and the delving into remorse on the part of the spacers for what he did to the creature's homeland was an interesting sideline. . .it added character to the script.The Monster. . .now the monster was GREAT.

In between we have Sophia Myles as Rothgar's spunky daughter and Jack Huston as her would-be suitor, the impetuous Wulfric.Huston descends from a legendary Hollywood clan but his talent doesn't go much beyond flaring his nostrils and playing second fiddle to steely-eyed Caviezel - he resembles Russell Brand after discovering he's been chatting up a tougher, much better-looking bloke's girlfriend.There's plenty of mead-swilling, hearty cheering and gratuitous gore, most memorably when Myles finds herself in the creature's lair atop a mountain of half-eaten villagers.But it's no better than the sort of schedule filler you can see any night on the SciFi Channel. It could have been a cult classic but anything saddled with a plot this unimaginative rightfully belongs in an XBox, not a multiplex.",Outlander
47,Simon_Says_Movies,Outlandish!,7,1 June 2009,"Outlandish. Howard McCain's Outlander may be the best B movie you never saw. This release dumped unceremoniously into theaters in the early year scrap heap is certainly a movie that is fully aware of its preposterous nature and approaches it with a straight face, a talented cast and premier production values that all work oddly well to produce an entertaining if far from perfect Sci-fi cult classic.Originally slated for a normal wide release, a series of setbacks plagued production to an extent where it was deemed no longer feasible for such distribution. Why is this important you may ask? Well, thanks to the original and best laid plans producers threw a whopping $50 million into the film which provides us with some damn good effects for a film you would all but assume to be a low budget, straight to DVD release.The plot is as tantalizing as they come; an alien, Kainan played by James Caviezel crash lands in ancient Nordish territory in the age of the Vikings. But along with his technology he brings a foreign parasite, a deadly creature known as the Moorwen. Caught in the middle of two warring Viking clans headed by Rogthgar (John Hurt) on one side and Gunnar (Ron Peralman) on the other, the primitive tribes must ban together to defeat their new common foe. oh yeah, it is in fact that awesome. The 'modern' story is framed by an interesting if slightly preachy back-story of past betrayal and genocide throughout the history of Kainnan's homeland.After all this financial mumbo-jumbo is put to the side, what we are left with is a deliciously acted, well made period/sci-fi/creature feature/action film that only works at all due to all originality and the bizarreness of the plot. A few elements keep Outlander from being a cult-masterpiece however; it is too long, there are too many false climaxes and the goofy plot only just holds up. That being said the good news is that this film will make a quick trip to your local movie store bargain bin which means that you can score it for about the cost of a rental. Outlander is worth a look and even if you don't like it, you can't deny how perfectly it defines the so-bad-it's-good adage.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",Outlander

49,futuretype,Skinny Ugly Vikings fight Fat Ugly Dragons,8,10 January 2018,"It started out real good until the dialogue commened with look-a-like Natalie Portman was fencing her thin father, Chief of the viking clan (played by John Hurt). Wulfric, a Nicholas Cage clone, also a skinny looking viking, (although his bio says he is 6' he looks 5'6"") finds the Outlander after crashing his spaceship in AD 709, Norway (like there was a Norway then and it is supposed to be AD 709 not 709 AD). The Outlander inadvertently brought along a dragon like monster, who is reminiscent of species 7284 (Star Trek Voyageur) in being unjustly misunderstood and decimated. The clan takes to fighting the alien dragon with help of the Outlander and along the way kill a bear.There is a young fellow (ten ish) in the story akin to the token kid seen in ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" in that he is the only youngun visible.Despite the Dragon thrashing them good they settle into a drunken feast whence Ron Pearlman makes a brief appearance as leader of an oppossing clan bent on warfare. The story proceeds to a ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" type sequence and the dragon does a ""Lord of the Rings"" type ending falling into a chasm (or over a cliff). If there had been any justice the Outlander would have saved the Dragon and the Dragon and Bear would have lived happily ever after.",Outlander

51,kekca,My rating: 6,6,30 July 2013,"The film focuses on action, surprise and many effects but manages to put a few serious issues - slaughter beasts in order to seize their land, is that right? Before human intervention in their territory are they beasts or are they just beings other than humans? In this sense, it is clear to what extent the person tries to act from a position of the only omnipotent ruler of the planet. From this film becomes to us our pity for the beasts that were slaughtered and what if they were animals, even humans (as historical memory always brings dark tales from almost five centuries or about 60 years)? While watching this movie is nice to know to what extent it is important to be tolerant with others and how to be dependent on the nature around us, the one we breathe, eat, dress with, the one that cure us and we move through it, that one we exist from. Because beyond these positions stands the symbol of equality, full gradient between us and nature, two elements which do not war and competition and live in harmonious balance and unity.In conclusion, we use the words of the protagonist: ""there is no fortune, no gods, only me.""

53,kols,Claudio got it right,9,22 April 2012,"Not much to add - except to say how pleased I am that Jim Caviezel has managed to resurrect his career after the Passion of Christ.Since I need to fill at least ten lines, I'll mention the negative reviews I just surfed through. While no one is required to agree with the positive reviews, many of the negative reviews require you to either agree or be sent to 'Can't tell a good movie from bad' Hell. It doesn't seem enough to say, 'I didn't like it for these reasons' and detail the movie's flaws. Instead, vitriol seems the fuel of choice and irrationality the engine.The comparisons to Lord of the Rings (which I think stunk, especially Elijah Wood's Frodo and his one-note angst) and Beowulf fall flat; Outlander shares nothing with either. Beowulf is, more than anything else, about the isolation of the individual (a constant theme of Old English poetry) and LotR is a grand epic (book, not movie) of massive forces playing out the battle of Good vrs Evil. It does share a lot with The 13th Warrior and, in terms of atmosphere and general story line, suffers from the comparison. Warriors is tighter, has better atmospheric effects, like the first attack of the humanoid creatures, with its stream of lights winding down the hills culminating in a truly terrifying battle, but suffers from the lack of a 'Hero' you can identify with; the Muslim 13th warrior doesn't behave like a Muslim, which is a problem, and left me flat (feel free to disagree). Caviezel gives Outlander that 'Hero' and, in my opinion, makes, along with Sophia Myles as Freya, the movie; both providing reason to ignore the movies flaws (such, as with the over-long lingering-in-the-cave that climaxes Warrior, the messy, over-long final battle with the Moorwen in Outlander).Another constant of the negative reviews is historical accuracy, lack of.Folks, we don't know how 8th Century Vikings (Norse, Swedish or Dane) lived, in detail, and so they're always portrayed as boisterous, lustful drunks except when they're raiding: the best example I know of being The Vikings (1958), with two ethnically inappropriate actors (Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis, neither of Scandinavian ancestry) being caste as Norse. Even if we did know the day-to-day details of Norse life, we're talking fantasy films, not documentaries.So, I've done better than ten lines and I'll repeat that Claudio Carvalho, Wonderful Adventure, got it right.My nine stars is based on Caviezel and Myles' performances along with a script that doesn't embarrass them.",Outlander

55,bennyhagen,"Not too intelligent, but highly enjoyable",6,18 October 2010,"For me this kind of came out of nowhere and I was expecting it to be terrible and cheap. Well, turned out that I was absolutely wrong, as it is actually pretty awesome if you can just not put too much attention on a few things.The first few minutes summarize quite well what this is going to be about. Cool special effects and James Caviezel looking awkward. But really, if this movie has one major flaw, it's the leads. No problems with the supporting actors, but Caviezel is totally miscast and just terrible for this movie. The script doesn't really give him anything to work with either, on the other hand he looks downright idiotic when he's fighting. Especially the fancy stances with the sword... horrible. This character, the highly skilled, silent warrior from a distant planet is something Vin Diesel can pull off, but not Jesus. Teaming up with face- and hand model Jack Huston playing a big bad viking here, they instantly nominate for the MTV best gay couple award (major uncalled-for downer scene regarding the subject has not been avoided). If you have problems getting over these things, leave them wave around with their pretty little swords alone as you'll get p*ssed rather fast and the movie is almost 2 hours long spending a lot of time senselessly developing these characters relation.Now on the other hand, the creature here is plain fantastic and beautifully animated as all the CGI. And we get a lot of creature scenes and CGI and if anything, in terms of action, the movie delivers frequently and generously, handing out tons and tons of quality creature fun, blood and even really cool gore. The sets, the costumes, the requisites and pretty much everything looks great, there is really no space for complaints regarding the production value which is generally very high.And that's it. The well spent budget, the awesome Moorwen creature and a relatively decent plot make this movie stand out in several ways.If you're into Sci-Fi action movies or creatures, do not hesitate.A very enthusiastic 6/10 (I can't get over the leads here)",Outlander

58,Sjhm,"Stunning scenery, gripping story in the Beowulf mould",9,19 April 2014,"In terms of realism, it perhaps lacks something in the depictions of the Vikings, but come on, this is a science fiction actioner. And as such it works very well. The characters have dimensions to them, the plot is straightforward, and in terms of the big set pieces this is done very well indeed. Jim Caviezel is excellent as the ""human alien"" Kainan, whose space ship crashes in 709 AD Norway, and unleashes the monster, the Moorwen, who destroyed his own people. The gradual acceptance of Kainan into the vikings' group forms the emotional heart of the story as he comes to care for the people he's landed among. This isn't Shakespeare, and it is a great deal better than many bigger budget and more highly advertised films (Beowulf itself, for instance). It is well worth checking it out on DVD. A good evening's entertainment.",Outlander
59,JRmf,A rather different Monster Movie,7,1 February 2009,"A hi-tech alien in 8th century Norway, hmmm... what to expect? But it becomes quickly evident that Kainan (the alien) is going to survive not by virtue of any sci-fi gadgets (his ""ray gun"" is lost in the first few minutes) but through old-fashioned courage, fighting skills, quick wits and a noble spirit. The movie centres a great deal on how this Outlander earns respect, acceptance and affection with this ancient people.John Hurt convinces as Rothgar, King of the tribe, as does Sophia Myles as Freya, the movie's only significant female. Though physically attractive, as Rothgar's son Wulfric (Jack Huston) observes, she is not in any sense ""soft"". She looks robust (but still feminine), fights likes a man, punches out Kainan in one scene, and displays an independence doubtless uncharacteristic of the women of her time.If Kainan displays any unearthly qualities it would have to be in his selflessness, devotion to common sense and rationality. Of course he wants to survive, but there is no sense of resentment to the harsh treatment he initially receives. He's obviously a rival for Wulfric, but is happy to save the guy's life, while risking his own.The Morwen monster adds colour and distinctiveness to the movie but in many respects is its weakest point. How would the Morwen have stowed aboard Kainan's ship, apparently remaining docile for the long voyage to Earth and not broken out and decimated the crew long before? This creature (and it might be a Mommy Morwen, because it has at least one smaller sidekick which is never explained) is able to withstand 1000+°C fire, even though Kainan and his people destroyed the Morwens on their home planet with fire (again silly as it takes millennia to develop that top foot of soil and ecosystem). In the final scene, the big Morwen is destroyed apparently by falling over a waterfall (doubtful?) plus some sword injuries - Kainan seems sure of it (or maybe it wasn't dead, but being kept for a sequel??).The movie has a small amount of gore - the worst is Gunnar losing his head by a flick of the Morwen's tail as it whips by - no sex (just a rather modest kiss), a good deal of swordplay and displays of male testosterone. Special effects are good though the Morwen looks perhaps too much out-of-this world, complete with flashing LEDs.When Kainan first landed, he activated a homing beacon. Finally a ship hoves into sight, but he destroys the beacon and the ship recedes. This again seems far fetched: after coming a gazillion miles, you'd turn back at the last few just because the beacon stopped? Anyway he's made his decision, after earning the right to be King, with Freya as his Queen, he would rather stay with this ancient tribe on a pre-tech world than return to his own - again a decision somewhat hard to understand without adequate explanation, he gave no hint of being an outcast with no other choice. In one of the final scenes, Kainan again visits his sunken ship and exposes the casket containing his dead wife - presumably this is meant to help explain his decision to stay.Despite these flaws, the movie has some solid drama, strong characters, entertains well and is an enjoyable way to kill a couple of hours.",Outlander
60,Wikkid_Gamez,I was very skeptical... But pleasantly surprised!,10,11 June 2019,"When I stumbled across this title while going through the SciFi list I was on... I decided to give it a shot for two reasons, the first being Ron Perlman and John Hurt... The second, because it just sounded so far out there I didn't see how they could possibly pull it off.
After seeing the movie, which I really thought was going to be another horrible B movie similar to the junk SyFy throws out these days only to find out that this movie seriously had an estimated $50 million budget?!? Yet I had never heard of it? It was never in theaters here... I seriously thought it was a straight to video or made for TV movie. Wth was wrong with the marketing department?? I mean seriously?? ... Reminds me of when I stumbled across the movie Stardust at the Dollar Tree (that was the best $1 I ever spent!) I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it either! Whose bright idea is it to make these movies then never even give them a chance to be seen in the theater?I had never even seen them advertised. No trailers on TV, nothing .... They should be fired!True, there wasn't too much to the back story as it was only touched on lightly a couple of different times. Although it was enough to tie things together and give an understanding of how things got to where they were. The creature wasn't a ""prisoner"" or whatever some have said, I don't think they were paying much attention. He actually said that it had snuck onto the ship and eventually killed his crew causing them to crash while they were passing
by that land (he left out the whole planet part). Any action fans will probably be thankful for the brief backstory as it left more room for some really good action scenes. I absolutely loved the creature! I would say that it had an almost Avatar like influence in its design and it was quite a creation on it's own! (Except that this movie actually came out a year before Avatar so there is no way it could have been based on it) I loved the way its glowing pulsating colors would change and shift depicting its mood, and anger. You could see the hatred it held for the main character especially, which also showed the amount of intelligence it had. Officially one of my top favorite SciFi creatures now!The SciFi aspect of the movie was a bit muted and it became more of a Viking saga type story. Yet it worked well and ran smoothly together. I thought the acting was good, I'm not sure why some reviews were so hard on it saying it was poor. Or why they say the ending was typical, in my experience with most of these types of movies the female (or male at times) love interest usually dies somehow at the end. I actually kept expecting something to happen during the final fight. For it to strike her with one last fatal blow with its tail as it fell or something. I was pleasantly surprised that it did have a happy ending. It just seems like so many people judge things so harshly, even going on about the names of the characters and such. Yes they used fairly typical names for most of them, yet those were the types of names used then. Trying to make up new names would have been out of place for the time and place. No, the movie wasn't completely politically correct with a few things such as them referring to themselves as Vikings in a time when that was not what they were called... But why must we always pick apart every little thing that isn't 100% accurate? Just have fun with it and enjoy it lol! I know I did! Not even the best historical dramas are 100% accurate...Overall a very enjoyable movie that I would definitely watch again!",Outlander

If you liked Beowulf, you may enjoy this movie but I personally find the story very weak and I am still amazed people could make three movies out of that. No surprise, boring dialogs, predictable plot. I wish I could evaluate it without knowing Beowulf but I do. I feel like this is the only Nordic myth and some people think it is so cool but it is not.

John Hurt is great as the leader of the Vikings Kainan runs into, opposing another group of Vikings at the time lead by Ron Pearlman's character.

You cant blame the distributors, its an understandable business decision. On DVD, however, well thats different, there's a humongous market for this!I sure wish I saw this in the cinema, though. The movie sounded stupid but instead I found it was tremendously entertaining, exciting, and thrilling. In fact, as absurd as this may sound, I found the whole plot plausible! When you see the movie, you'll know what I mean. Its done in a way where this could have happened in Normandy 700AD.The movie had a mix of subtle humour, drama, romance, SF, horror, gore and action. Not many movies can boast all of those ingredients and mix them this well. The lead performances were excellent (and handsome/beautiful) as were the heavyweight supporting cast including John Hurt and Ron Pearlman (who are of course, not so pretty but they sure as heck have a mighty presence).The action is of the fast editing style which to be honest is not my cup of tea. I prefer lengthy action takes. But the momentum of the action scenes are relentless and thrilling. The visuals were excellent and the monsters were pretty damn frightening.The story is basic but its a great one and has the the audacity to take itself seriously!

The protagonist of the film isn't from earth so he speaks with a more Scottish American accent. I could let this much go but half way through the film all character depth is completely disgarded and new characters start having American names. All the technology within the film is quickly lost or thrown away within the first 10 minutes, either to keep the budget down or slow the pace of the plot. It's not a bad film, it has a nice gory atmosphere and a lot of genuine viking aspects but the heavy periods of just completely disregarding the authenticity of the period really ruin the immersion. The fact that they chose a monster that looks cool in the dark but never appears in full light really adds to the feel that this film got a budget way below what it deserved.

Outlander is an alright sci-fi action adventure movie although it's far from great or even that memorable. Too many clichés, generic script, problematic acting, a low budget and some other related problems have hurt Outlander which has an interesting premise to build a story around.

69,beastwarsfan,Beowulf from Outer Space,10,27 January 2009,"""Outlander"" is a great surprise by director Howard McCain - honestly never heard of him before, but I'll be keeping an eye on his work from now on! The movie opens with a spaceship crashing down on Earth, Norway 700 AD. The only surviour from the crew, Kainan (James Caviezel), is soon captured by vikings, who blame him for the slaughter in a nearby village. The outworlder claims he is not responsible and he has come to these lands hunting for dragons. The vikings don't trust a word... until their own village is attacked by a mysterious creature - something that Kainan brought with him from outer space...Proving himself in battle Kainan gains the trust of the vikings and gets himself some trusty friends... and some interest from the King's daughter Freya (Sophia Myles). Together they have to face the alien beast Moorwen and find a way to destroy it. But Kainen is hunted not only by a monster, but by guilt and memories as well. He couldn't protect his beloved wife and son from the very same creature.The story is simple and yet gripping. The idea that a pack of vikings and a spaceman battle an alien beast was exciting enough to make me interested and willing to see the movie. I approached it with no great expectations and I found myself pleasantly surprised! The movie is in fact very entertaining and involving. Jim Caviezel is an excellent choice for a tragic hero haunted by his past - a true Beowulf from outer space. The rest of the cast does a good job as well. I loved Sophia Myles in ""Tristan & Isolde"" and I was pleased to watch her again, this time as a bold Viking princess. In the supporting cast we have John Hurt and Ron Perlman (they've collaborated before on the Hellboy movies).The Moorwen is designed by Patrick Tatopolous and if you're familiar with his work you can sense his style in it. I'd say there is some Godzilla-nuance to the Moorwen, but the luminous abilities of the creature were something new and exciting.The production design, the sets and the costumes were also very good, but what really impressed me were the flashback sequences of Kainan's life before falling down to Earth. The Moorwen planet war scene is truly great and the only thing I regret is that they were not longer - I can enjoy out-of-this-world landscapes anytime! The CGI was impressive. I would play the movie again just to watch them once more.The movie could use some faster pace at times and I find it slightly longer than it should have been, but by no means boring or trying. ""Outlander"" delivers an excellent sci-fi action-adventure - something we don't see too often these days!",Outlander
70,bharath-karthikeyan,A Great Movie after all...!Perfect Entertainer!,8,1 May 2009,"I had never seen the trailer of this movie nor any much publicity whatsoever,but it came as a clear surprise for me after getting to watch it,i liked it very much.So sad that i ended up watching in a DVD. You have the Viking battles,good storyline,very good CGI and special effects,with equally complementing soundtrack. The actors have rendered their skills to the best,the screenplay was great and overall the characters are well delivered. The story is of an Outlander from a different planet who ends up in a ship crash on NORSE territory-planet earth!But the ship has brought along an alien trouble-a species called Moorven/Moorwen.Kainan(James Caviezel) is treated as an Outlander,he has to prove his worth and also tell the vikings of the alien trouble he has bought along.And henceforth the plot flows. The Movie has got breathtaking locations,viking costumes,""the shields"" game,all was just entertaining.It has abundant gore too,of course its a viking movie after all! Anyways guys its a perfect perfect perfect snack for your pop corns!Rent it or buy it!",Outlander
71,petsteph1,Very Entertaining Movie,7,15 December 2008,"Like a previous reviewer I don't know why this had a limited release. It is MUCH more value for ticket money than a number of other recent offerings and its faults are minor compared to the good qualities.The story is basically a sci-fi plot but since the lead character's space ship crashes in the Iron Age, among Vikings, you can understand that most of the movie takes place with Viking themes and scenery.The basic plot is quite sound and for the first 40 minutes the movie is VERY gripping. It tends to go a little flat at the end of the middle act and the start of the third act but effects, gore and very tense action compensate for those not too engrossed in the intricacies of the story. A pity about that because it looked like the story had more to offer and was chopped up somewhat to fit in a bunch of set pieces. I realize this is now making the movie sound a little lame: it isn't Lord of the Rings, but it is definitely worth the price of the ticket. See it expecting to be entertained for about 95% of the time and you wont be disappointed.",Outlander
72,antileft,A new science-fiction genre ?,8,19 June 2009,"This is definitely the greatest science – fiction surprise of 2008 , little advertised, having been made on less than a modest budget, but still having all that a good movie of this genre requires , namely : visuals ( Fantasy II ) ,acting ( J. Caviezel in the leading role , perhaps the most underrated actor in H-Wood today ! ), and , believe it or not , a story that IS quite original : a space craft crashes on Earth ,and only one survives , well, two , but the other thing is nonhuman , very nasty and rather horrifying- H.R.Giger would be proud - and , yes , has a huge appetite for humans, but even that is brilliantly explained , as the human race in its quest for resources obliterates anything that lives on any planet,and not asking any questions , but simply sending the fleets of colonizers after the campaign 's been done ! All well and peachy unless you find yourself somewhere in the Scandinavia in the 10th century without any fleshy super zap guns or any other useful electronic device that would give you an edge!Briefly , a hodge-podge of classic movies from The Dark Star, Alien series –you simply can˙t beat that – to Predator , combined with none other than the literary classic Beowulf , and it takes quiet a lot to do that !

74,eatfirst,Vikings vs. Aliens vs. Disappointment,3,28 December 2010,"Let's be clear about this: As concepts go, Vikings vs. Aliens is indisputably the finest idea in cinematic history. How could such a perfect storm of genre-mashing possibly fail?Well, let's start with the limp and creaking script; barely functioning to join the dots of the minimal story it offers us zero characterisation, even less wit, great black holes of logic or just plain common-sense, and has everyone talking in a steadfastly modern parlance that might be anachronistic if only it could summon the energy.Then there is the acting: Nary a flicker of emotion to be had from among any of the weary looking cast. Everyone speaks earnestly about something, but it might as well be directions to the bus stop for all the meaning that is imparted. Jack Huston as Wulfric in particular seems to have been shipped in as part of the set and accidentally given a speaking role instead of ""door frame no.7"" as was clearly marked on the box. John Hurt however is an old hand at giving weight to grizzled royal pronouncements, but even he seems to be out to lunch for most of this one.The effects are very much in the modern b-movie-cheap-CGI mould. Things are kept dark and mostly indistinguishable for much of the running time, with good reason, as when the monster is fully revealed in the light of day it comes across as a flat cartoon mash-up of bits of The Host and Godzilla, with none of the sense of weight or menace of either.The story is essentially Beowulf, with a bit of Predator thrown in to the mix. But it totally misses the brooding atmosphere of the former and the outlandish fun of the latter. It has no memorable characters or frightening monsters. It is neither funny, nor scary, nor exciting. Nor for that matter is any of it even slightly original. When it's not stealing plot points from the above, it's playing out familiar scenes nabbed from The Descent, Reign of Fire, War of the Worlds and most criminally, several shot-for-shot sequences stolen wholesale from the excellent Disney fantasy Dragonslayer.The film has just two moments where it momentarily threatens to spark in to life. The first is the apparently welcome entrance, half an hour into the proceedings, of the wonderful Ron Pearlman, who arrives by crushing someone's head between two massive war hammers. He then gets to make one brief speech which alludes to intriguing events which are never referred to again and then exits the film five minutes later to zero effect. The second is when the nominal hero of the piece (Jim Caviezel, scowling in neutral throughout) gets to explain his back story with the monster to the proto-feminist heroine (Sophia Myles), and of course, us. He words his story in ways that her native people might understand, but we the audience get to see through his memories scenes of intergalactic genocide that put a modern and more sympathetic spin on the monster's plight. While hardly Kieslowski, this is a momentarily interesting concept, which is also then promptly abandoned for the remainder of the film.All of this might still be forgivable if the movie actually had a sense of fun, but it is a long, flat and dreary stumble through deeply familiar territory to an underwhelming finale. Some stuff just happens, people speak just enough to direct us to the next scene, some more stuff happens and two hours later it ends, finally.",Outlander
75,ohroonoko,Total Thematic failure,6,19 October 2021,"This film is slick enough to entertain many sci-fi/fantasy fans, even though it fails on so many levels, not least of all thematically.So the Outlander (Kainan) comes from an alien civilization that conquers foreign lands and takes everything even though it belongs to others; in this case, killing off all the Moorwens with fire and hunting them to the last before settling on their planet. Any sense of guilt he has for his role in barbarianism and xenocide is totally lost in the fact that he crashlands in Viking territory and becomes a Viking king, presumably to raid foreign lands, taking everything and killing everyone in the way. Kainan learned nothing. He didn't even have a semblance of remorse for his hand in xenocide, killing the last Moorwen. It's probably a good thing that the screenplay and the director does such a poor job of portraying Vikings as the historically savage, violent sea-faring raiders that they were. These Vikings lived by a lake, not by the sea, so they must have been relatively peaceful Vikings. The only indication of their might is the exposition that they defended themselves against the Franks. Maybe it would have been better for Kainan's spiritual journey to repent if he had crashlanded in an Eskimo village instead. Oh, but he told Freya he didn't believe in gods. Well now he's a Pagan King, so how will he cope with that challenge? It might have been an interesting theme, but this director and screenwriter don't seem to care about themes.Why didn't it occur to Kainan to find his bazooka? He lost it where he was captured by Wulfric. It fell into a creek but it didn't float away down stream, it's a metal bazooka. It would still be there. And it's better than swords. If the screenwriter wanted Kainan to fight with a sword forged out of metal from his ship, he should have addressed the bazooka first. And Kainan didn't know how to ride a horse, but suddenly he knew how to fight with a sword? These missing details are the stuff of B films.Besides the poor screenwriting, lazy directing and generic but competent acting, Ron Perlman plays a Viking with a Scottish accent almost a century before the Vikings fought the Scots. I'm sure Ron Perlman thought a Scottish accent was close enough to a Nordic accent for the director, and the director didn't seem to notice or care.",Outlander
76,JungleBunnyBastard,Very clichéd for such an original sci-fi epic.,4,3 July 2009,"Let me start by saying the great things about this movie. The creature effects, the creature itself, the very original plot, the Norwegian scenery...but that ends there.What could have been an amazing, emotional sci-fi epic turned in every predictable cliché and character outline. It wasn't necessary and I found myself extremely bored by it. Not to mention that the horrid performances (especially by Caviezel) helped tune me out.A good story, a great creature, bad camera work (I've had enough of the ""shaky-cam"" crap in action films), and clichéd writing. Such a disappointment, yet I can't help but think of so many other filmmakers who could've made this little sci-fi indie a cult classic (auteurs along the lines of Peter Jackson or Guillermo Del Toro...hell, even Tim Burton could've done it better).So far 2009 just keeps getting my hopes down.",Outlander

With so many films today being based on generic content the time is well overdue for a new IP. It reminded me of Silicon Knight's 'Too Human', Predator and 'Beowolf' reflecting their good points strongly while remaining true to Outlanders vision and never committing overt plagiarism.

81,tvsweeney-39052,"Well-acted, Authentic settings",10,18 February 2017,"This is not to be confused with the TV series, but is an excellent SciFi film. The entire movie is formulaic and we know what's going to happen right up to the end, but since it's well-scripted, that doesn't matter. At first, Jim Cavaziel looks a bit out of place at first but the audience, as well as he, settles into the part. The scenery is beautiful. One can almost feel the clean, crisp air coming from that snow-capped mountain. The sets and costumes authentic-looking (except for all those shaven heads.) All in all, this is a very good movie, well-acted, authentically costumed. Too bad a couple of the clichés couldn't have been ignored, which might have called for a sequel. It's also too bad it didn't get a wider distribution in theaters.",Outlander
82,armin-durakovic,A worst sci-fi movie so far,5,5 August 2014,"Well, I don't know if it can be called a ""sci-fi"" movie. You have at most 5 minutes of science fiction in the almost two hours that I lost by watching this movie. Also, it is not that exact historic if I put it that way. I'm not sure if these filmmakers know how real vikings looked like ? To recap, real vikings lived in Scandinavia, in subarctic climate (where it's damn cold). This movie shows us vikings in an unrealistic environment with volcanoes and lava, in an almost Mediterranean environment. The vikings walk with short sleeves, look like Americans, behave like Americans and have almost nothing in common with vikings, except few viking shields and a viking village. Come on, the filmmakers could do better than that. At least some effort would make the movie much more realistic. And I haven't seen one viking that is naturally blond or at least to look like one. Most of them have brown or black hair with some hair parts that are colored to blond. I mean everybody knows that the Scandinavian people are blond with pale skin (due to low levels of Melanin because they are not exposed to sun). It's because they live in winter lands :) Except these simple geographic and scientific facts that have nothing to do with this (not science, but more of a fiction) movie, it also lack creativity. It's full of plot holes. The story is undeveloped, so at least to say, and it has no twist at all. Action scenes have not much creativity in it and the whole idea of the movie ends where it has started: at the beginning. I won't recommend it to anyone.",Outlander
83,Sevenmercury7,Terrific genre mash-up,9,2 September 2011,"Vikings versus an alien monster.Still reading? Good for you, because you're in for a genre treat with Outlander, an action-horror that knows exactly what it wants to be and makes no apologies. James Caviezel plays Kainen, an alien warrior whose spaceship crashes in Iron Age Norway. Captured by a Viking tribe, he quickly realises that the atrocities visited upon local villages are the work of a Moorwen, a deadly creature from his home world. The monster stowed away on his ship and is now wreaking havoc, unopposed. It's up to Kainen to help these poorly equipped people hunt and kill a far superior foe. The Viking King (played by the always brilliant John Hurt) and his sword-wielding daughter (lovely Sophia Myles) recognise the outlander's worth, while other members of the tribe would rather blame him for the bloodshed. An uneasy alliance begins.It's an old, old formula but the sci-fi bent gives this hero tale (Beowulf from outer space) plenty of juice. Caviezel plays it deadly serious, and the story's much stronger for it. Kainen and the Moorwen share a bitter history; this isn't a straightforward hero versus monster scenario. Apart from the well-done action scenes and special effects, Outlander has a solid script, a strong visual look (misty forests, caves, waterfalls etc) and four or five good actors. Add to this a fascinating creature and you have one of the better 'B' movies of recent years. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Outlander
84,limona_razvan,"Aliens,swords and heroes",8,19 December 2008,"Outlander is a movie who deserve better than the lack of interest around. Caviezel and Miles show a lot of power play and carve two strong characters from scratch, building up the momentum to the last confrontation between vikings and aliens confused with dragons. Kainan (Caviezel) is from outer space, a military officer responsible, along with others of his humanoid species, to the destruction of a race called Moorwen with fire. After terraforming, Kainan's people settle without knowing some Moorwen are still alive and loose their families to the vengeance. Eventually his ship, with a Moorwen aboard, drift into space and crash land on Earth, without any explanation why. The rest of the movie is a fast paced action, worthy to see instead of explaining, playing the Norwegian vikings an Kainan against the rampant dragon look alike alien. Ron Perlman is ,as always, a force of nature and John Hurt a perfect king - intelligent, tired and full of hope. In the end i have to mention the interesting look of the Moorwen species, a mix of legendary dragons and Alien from the movie with the same name.",Outlander
85,Acolin_f,Plot Twists and Writer/Director Weaken Sci-Fi Dragon Slayers,4,30 August 2009,"Plot Twists and Writer/Director Weaken Sci-Fi Dragon Slayers The weakest aspect of Outlander is the same plot twists that make it unique. We have seen much of this plot before. It is Beowolf meets Aliens. It is a science fantasy of ancient warriors battling horrific demons. It is Road Warrior leads a backward tribe against evil incarnate. There is some predictable man versus man sub-plots, but by and large Outlander is man versus mean and cruel nature.Except for one twist; the hero and the monster are from an incredibly advanced space traveling civilization and the setting is Norway in 709 AD. But this is no lovable monster, like Sean Connery as the dragon in sweet Dragonheart. This is a loathsome space predator with teeth and tail like Sigourney Weaver's ugly foe.This twist weakens the movie the most. While some of the plot twists are good, many are unexplained. We don't know how the monster came to earth. A trap for the monster fails, but we don't know how it can escape. A monster is killed by falling into the water – except it can swim. The hero loses his plasma blaster, but instead of going back for it, he gets some metal from his ship to make an unwieldy sword. The flashbacks to his previous life don't work. A child follows him around like the feral one in Road Warrior, except that nothing is done with this sub-plot. Not only is the aggressive heir apparent suddenly not jealous of the beautiful princess, but he never leads the way he could. A sudden change to the monster's point of view about ¾ of the way into the movie is annoying. So too is the summing up voice over narration at the end. Although dark, like many movies relying too much on CGI, initially there is a good use of color, but this devolves to over-splattering of gore. These are classic director's mistakes.Writer/director Howard McCain wrote the screenplay for Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009). He has not directed much and it shows. McCain does not know how to get the most out of the script and his actors.Ron Perelman is engaging in Guillermo del Toro's wonderful Hellboy movies. He has ½ a dozen movies coming out. John Hurt is equally powerful in a dozen roles, including the Hellboy movies and V for Vendetta. He too has ½ a dozen movies coming out. They both give excellent supporting roles in this movie, with the limited dialogues they have.Lead actor James Caviezel followed up strong performances in I am David and Mel Gibson's controversial The Passion of the Christ, with the charming and hardly moving tale of Bobby Jones, the legendary golfer. Caviezel's character loses his family, ship, plasma blaster, and friend - almost loses his girl - but Caviezel never unleashes his dogs of war. Unlike Daniel Day Lewis, William Hurt, Jeremy Irons and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, he still does not have the dialogue or scene to turn his stoic, implacable reserve into the emotional outburst of raw acting talent that super-charges his career and saves this movie. Neither does Caviezel have the body, like Vin Diesel in XXX, Daniel Craig in the latest Bond or Brad Pit in Troy, to create a sheer physical presence.Wanna watch dragon slayers? I wouldn't give this one a pass. I am sucker for a three-four dollar sci-fi rental. But I would rather have Angelina Jolie tempt me as the naked golden goddess in the classic tale Beowolf. (Hell, anything with her in it since Gia is worth a rental and a pause here and there!) Or see Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey in the futuristic Reign of Fire. Better yet. I could see the first installments of Aliens or Predator again. That is spectacular sci-fi monster fighting at its best.",Outlander
86,warren-1976,What Could Have Been...,9,10 June 2009,"It's always frustrating to hear of how the Hollywood 'suits' treat some films, whilst throwing money at others. Outlander has been the unfortunate victim of bureaucratic idiocy.Outlander was an independent feature, made on a moderate (by today's standards) budget of nearly $50 million, around which $35 or so went on actual production, and the rest on various legal fees, etc. The production, direction and effects help it stand out as a much more professional film than many of the recent crop of bloated big-budget pictures. Yet as a result of the 'Weinstein' company's decisions (The 'Weinstein' company in America gained the rights to cinematic and DVD release in the U.S.), it was essentially forgotten. They had apparently made little initial investment, and therefore (presumably) decided just to make a chunk of money back through the minimal effort of a DVD release, while avoiding the expense and effort of giving it a cinema release. So it is a tragic shame that we didn't get to see this as a sleeper hit, which I believe it may well have been, along the lines of something like Pitch Black.But what of the movie itself, you ask? Spaceship crash-lands amongst the Viking Fjords on Earth, during the iron age. So enters our hero, the lone survivor of said ship, who joins with the local populace to defeat the terrible alien that was also on board, and has started slaughtering the nearby inhabitants. Yes, it sounds cheesy on the surface, but it's great fun. It's all been well thought out, and given far more depth and story than you would otherwise expect.The production has managed to gather a fantastic cast, including James Caviezel (Frequency, Passion of the Christ) John Hurt (Alien, Nineteen Eighty Four, Hellboy, Harry Potter), Sophia Myles (Underworld, Thunderbirds, TV's Moonlight) Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Alien: Resurrection) and promising up-and-comer Jack Huston. They all have great fun with their parts, without hamming it up (Though Ron Perlman's role is somewhat shorter than expected).In terms of general production, oft-used creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos (Stargate, Godzilla, Pitch Black) has created probably his best creature design since 'They', trying to come up with something original for the alien. Its face is perhaps a bit too reminiscent of his earlier Godzilla design, but the fiery glows and shapes really make the Moorwen (As the creature is called) stand out. Meanwhile Geoff Zanelli (Hitman, Disturbia) has written a suitably stirring and epic soundtrack score. Since this is one of his first few feature film scores, he could well be one to watch.There are plenty of interesting characters in Outlander, all used in ways that are not too stereotyped. For example, Kainan (The lead character, played by Caviezel) bonds with a young boy, 'Shane'-style, yet this is not forced or overplayed. Likewise the slight hints of romance with Freya (played by Myle's). Other characters start off with certain stereotypical expectations, only to turn out more nuanced and interesting than you thought. Even Kainan has a story that you enjoy learning about, as he tells it in hushed tones. His personal tale is nothing original, but uses those types of cliché that only become that way because there are few better ways to motivate and emphasise a character.Outlander is a wonderfully fun adventure in the greatest old style. The action is gory and exciting. The characters are interesting and make you want to follow their story. The filming is slick and polished, modern while not bowing to over-used 'trendy' techniques.The director, Howard McCain, should be applauded for the job he's done here, considering he has only really started his career, and created a movie that, given a chance, puts to shame most of the recent blockbusters. There's not too much to say about Outlander, other than just enjoy it for what it is. There are so many films you could say it has similarities to, from Alien to Lord of the Rings, but even they have their own prior influences. Outlander adds enough of its own twists and fairly original turns stand out, and hold its head proud. If you get the chance, just enjoy an old-fashioned science-fiction adventure.",Outlander

88,Playbahnosh,"The Space Marine, the Vikings, and the Alien Space Dragon",9,3 February 2009,"I stumbled upon this move by accident, but being a sci-fi and fantasy nerd, I watched it, despite the fact that sci-fi movies nowadays tend to be rather poor.The story begins with Kainan (James Caviezel) crash landing his spaceship into a lake, in the middle of Viking-land, in 709 AD. With his co-pilot dead, and his ship in ruins, sunken to the bottom of the lake, he uses his only working piece of technology to teach himself the norsk language. (I laughed my head off, when the first word he utters in Earth language is the ""F"" word :D) Wandering around in a forest, he is found by Wulfric (Jack Huston) and brought back to his village. They think Kainen is responsible for brutally ransacking a nearby village, and when Kainen tells them he is hunting for a ""dragon"", he is labeled as a liar and enemy. When in fact, the ""dragon"" he is referring to, is a monster from another planet, now hunting the viking populace and fauna of the land. Soon, when the villagers start vanishing and turning up as mutilated corpses, the vikings realize that Kainen might be telling the truth after all...I gotta say, combining space marines and alien monsters with a fantasy Viking setting intrigued me to no end. Outlander is the living proof, that such a combination can result in a very good and entertaining 115 minutes. Although the story is a little shallow, lacking in huge plot-twists and deep character development, but it is enough to keep the attention between the awesomely gory fight scenes.The acting is good enough, with the Christian Bale look-alike Caviezel, and the great but short performance of Ron Perlman, it manages to be captivating. We see far more swordplay than pulse rifle shoot-outs, so the sci-fi part of the film is largely suppressed to make way for the epic battle between the vikings and the moorvens, but that's just how it must be in this movie. The fight scenes are nicely choreographed and acted, the special effects are more than awesome, and the whole is movie is just great.I'd like to point out, that the Moorven is most astonishing space monster I've ever seen. With the clever colored pulsing and the well thought-out anatomy of the beast, it manages to be best so far.It's not the best movie I've seen, but it's still great, and every sci-fi and fantasy fan should go see it.",Outlander
89,botev1921,Very dark and dramatic. Better than Reign of Fire,8,22 February 2012,"It is shocking that a movie that good was not well accepted in the US and hardly saw the screens. I assume is the lack of a Hollywood cliché-bad ass as the hero, but yet American audience is known to be immune to quality cinema. The movie is extremely close to Reign of Fire in character with the story being more flat and to some extend predictable. Still, the dark and dramatic goes on and on with Jim Caviezel putting up a stunning performance. The visual effects are not bad and unlike the typical Hollywood blockbuster trash not used in every second scene. There is just the right amount of blood and suffering that do not distract from the dramatic side of things. It is a 2 hour movie, but it really flows quickly as I hardly noticed the length, which says a lot. Very good directing helps the dark feeling and Stone Age Norway is well portrayed. The love story is again totally anti-Hollywood as it is not given the usual cliché attention that only would have distracted us from the free-flowing action. Some of the supporting cast, although completely unknown to me, left a good impression. A must see for fans of quality dark, dramatic science fiction and action movies.",Outlander

Ron Perlman shows up/blows up as an enemy King...but then he joins in with them minutes after BRUTALLY murdering several...(and they ain't even mad at him, LOLOL!!!) Wow....but at least Ron's acting was good. The rest are just THERE....3) The ""monster"" was SO CORNY-LOOKING, it wasn't even FUNNY. Seriously, it looked like a Mothra/Alien/Predator combination...WITH CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS attached...Bwahahahahaha!!!!Kainan had nothing to offer these straw hut dwellers AT ALL from his so-called advanced technology, oh wait, he did have something to ""offer"" to that princess....IF you know what I mean??? Bottom line:
Overall, this piece-of-crap movie is a pathetic wanna-be parody/combination of all the following: a) Beowulf
b) Alien
c) Predator
d) StargateLike other reviewers have stated: Why? Why was this even made? The whole premise of the storyline is utter BS. At the beginning, Caviezel's character Kainan doesn't even know what to do with a horse, then , VIOLA, he's up and ridin off into the sunset...w/hands tied....Ughhhh....and can he PLEASE STOP trying to act/talk like Clint Eastwood? He IS NOT Clint, and he really sounds ridiculous...This dull, predictable movie is an absolute BOMB, the acting is so sub-par, that not even greats like John Hurd/Ron Perlman could save it. The only reason it got any good reviews here on IMDB is because of all the ""Christians"" that always 10-rate any piece of garbage starring ole rabid bible thumping Jim. It sucks/he sucks, and we fast-forwarded through most of it, so do yourself a favor and HARD PASS.",Outlander
93,turk_rooster,Out.,5,7 February 2009,"Once in a while there comes a movie that leaves absolutely no impression of any sort whatsoever. The performances are average, the storyline is reminiscent of many movies that one has see (in this case, perhaps, that would be say the noble stranger in Norseland of The Thirteenth Warrior, the salivating alien of, well, Alien and the chivalry and romance of say Beowulf), the special effects are nondescript, the emotional content is not engaging. In the last half an hour, I guess I had ceased caring about who, including the salivating evil (something called the Moorwen that looks like a Komodo Dragon with lights), lives or dies. Some amount of originality, and a storyline where the producer/director took a few chances with some out of the box thinking, would definitely have helped this movie",Outlander
94,svetlastoyanova,Out of This World,9,12 April 2009,"At first I thought aliens in prehistoric times; this is going to be one hell of a non-sense. I was very pleasantly surprised though. There is no hi-tech jargon or far-fetched sci-fi plot, everything is neat and straight to the point. And the most importantly there is no meaningless dialogue or cool stupid one-liners.Kainan (James Caviezel) lands on Earth in his chase of an alien monster which killed his family. The year is something hundred BC, there is nothing superhuman or extraordinary about him, armed just with a gun version of a lightsaber , soon he is captured by the local tribe. The prehistoric people are nothing out of the ordinary either-a wooden fortress, animal-skin clad villagers and monarch based ruling system. I really liked the political element in the tribe's interactions with the opposing tribe and the logical tactical choices made by its leaders. It comes to show that politics in its essence is just a plain and simple common sense for the people's well-being.The two fighting tribes eventually join forces against the common evil-a pretty red illuminated monster that kills and eats everything on its way. The monster is CGI but it is given almost a human name Moorwen, I have to admit very well done CGI. It blends very well with the rest of the sequences and the monster itself is quite original. All the encounters with it are really gory, though, so I do not recommend it for the faint-hearted. There is the must-have love story as well, between the outlander and the daughter of the king of the tribe, who eventually took over his throne after the monster, killed him mercilessly. There is a little cameo from Ron Perlman doing what he does best as a ferocious leader of the opposing tribe, i.e. acting really tough.This movie has everything you want in one –aliens, great action sequences, politics, pretty female, romance with the pretty female, a bit of gory horror and a happy ending with an inevitable casualty of a loved one-what not to like?",Outlander
95,deletewindowson,On a scale of Yea or Nay I giveth this flick a hearty Yea.,10,3 December 2012,"Wonderful adventure flick. I use a binary review method, ie ALL or NONE, ie ON or OFF which on IMDb translates to 10 or 1. This long sword flick by me gets a 10. The criterion I use is childishly simple (minded).. 10 means NO Fast Forwarding through cringey parts or 0 (ie 1) which means Yes Fast Forewarding required. Thus a 1 from me does not necessarily mean a bad film. It just means that I couldn't watch without fast forwarding over unwatchable (by me) parts. OUTLANDER gets a 10. I had no desire to fast forward over any of its parts. No icky squishy parts, no cringey baloney parts, no hideous revolting parts, etc. This movie is just entertainment. That's what I want from a movie. Profoundity not required. Historical revelations not required although I like to see at least an attempt at some kind of historical accuracy. This movie has lots and lots of juicy historical type details. Of course the lead characters are too pretty, but that is to be expected in almost any movie. The rest of the players are pretty much what you could expect from Norway in the 10th century. I would have preferred to see someone more physically impressive than John Hurt in his role here but oh well. You can't always get what you want. Boromir is a Slav name so why does Borolmir speak with a sort of wacky Geordie accent? Picky picky. Oh alright. Bottom line this is a good old fashion Saturday afternoon matinée adventure flick. Were I a kid I would absolutely love this movie BUT that being said I can see that small children would be scared witless by the monster which is a pretty horrible customer to say the least although really no worse than anything in the Jurasic Park franchise.",Outlander
96,GloriousGooner,alright-ish,6,4 April 2010,"Outlander, being the Beowulf-Predator-Lord Of The Rings spin off that it is, isn't anywhere near as bad as it could have been. OK, so there's not really enough of the beast - the Moorwen - to satisfy most monster movie appetites and the final third is ridiculously melodramatic but the action, for the most-part, is fairly well captured. John Hurt hams it up nicely, chewing as much scenery as bear, and Caviezel is as good as anyone else could have been with such limited material as the protagonist. It goes on longer than necessary and never once treads into the realms of the brilliant but for the brainless piece of 2 hour entertainment that it is, it delivers the majority of the goods intact. Not one to go out of your way to see, but neither when you've seen it will it feel like a total waste of time.",Outlander
97,dan_marsala,Worth Your Time,8,11 April 2009,"This was the first time I saw that movie, but I'll comment while the good impression still there. I didn't understand why I'd never notice when movies like this are release in Mexico till I saw movies like Minotaur, Anaconda 2, Snakes on the plane/train, etc. I like when I'm not expecting anything pleasurable or funny in a movie and then they come with this. This is a very well done movie, action-packed, nice drama and the best part: Its not senseless.Simple like this: Kainan is a traveler from another world/galaxy/universe, who used to be a member of a greedy and conqueror kind (very similar to the humans), whose starship crash into our world, in the Vikings Age, bringing with him a violent and uncontrollable creature (a ""Godzilla"" looked Dragon) named Moorwen, thats searching revenge against the exterminator of his breed. Afther Kainan is accepted by a Viking community that is being attacked by the Moorwen, he decide to help them kill that beast by the old way (no guns).Probably the special effects seems to be very old, like ten years ago, but the action is not affected for it. I'd like the way the Moorwen was made, in some cases it almost look cleaver. Its not the typical killer creature and if its not a completely serious matter in the movie... well, I guess the name of the movie is Outlander, not Outlander and the Moorwen. And about the outlander, I think that Jim Caviezel is to much for the role. He did a good job and he brings some prestige to the film (not enough, thought). He plays Kainan, the alien guy who become prisoner of the Viking who hate him and reject him. At the beginning he's just trying to warn the beautiful King's daughter (Sohpia Myles) from the trouble they're facing with. Time after, he falls in love with her, he becomes part of the village and earn the King's trust, and thats why he fight for their protection. Thats all the drama I need, not the perfect drama of course, but this is not a perfect film, just way to good. The action is the best reason to watch this film... and maybe the best is see it thinking it will sucks, it work for me. Again, this s just the first impression but like I said, I was not expecting the best picture, just a few action, a few drama and how to spend my time. Ya, I like it.",Outlander

A spaceship crashes in a lake and the only thing he salvaged is scrap metal? Our main character is so sad of losing his wife and child that he engages with the main female character immediately? Got over his wife real fast. No reason is ever explained as to why our main character never tells the others enough to really help them defeat this creature either. And the party scene, wow.

Typically inaccurate Viking clichés then ensue which when combined with terrible CGI produce a very dull movie that not even good performances from Ron Perlman or John Hurt can salvage.

For a B-movie, there's a bunch of good and seasoned actors such as John Hurt and Ron Perlman in addition which are all solid in their roles. Caviezel's appearance is stiff at best, in a very Steven Seagal-ish way, and almost 'non-present' at times.Aside of that big flaw with the film, it's a quite entertaining old-times sword wielding action flick with a decent monster, interwoven with some sci-fi elements.

Jim was believable as the hero, not to mention he's not that hard on the eyes :) Sophia Myles was fantastic as always. Somehow she is totally believable in every character she portrays.

107,JulianMHall,Intriguing Fusion of Norse Myth and Science Fiction,8,8 December 2011,"There is a lot of snobbery in the movie industry, and among critics and viewers that unless a movie has a massive budget choked to bursting point with special effects and Hollywood A-list actors that it's no good. Time and again this is disproved and nowhere more so than in Outlander.First of all the precept is, to the best of my knowledge, unique. Always a good place to start. The script is well written and situations believable and engaging drawing the viewer into the story. The characters have depth and interest to keep the viewers interested in them so if any die it actually *matters*, unlike other movies where the body-count and interest level head in opposite directions.The acting: Whilst there is - to me at least - a mix of greater and lesser known actors involved all produced an equally enthralling level of performance.Jim Caviezel: Kainan the central male character. As always a superb performance from him giving the character the full extent of his talents. He manages not to be simply a blunt instrument especially when discussing his family, or in interaction with Erik or Freya and gives the character depth.Sophia Myles - probably the one I was familiar with most, other than John Hurt, from her roles in From Hell, Underworld, Dracula, Thunderbirds etc, and of course Beth Bailey in Spooks 9: The sole female character as Freya - daughter of the king, Hrothgar - yet she still manages to make her character command attention with the strength and skill of her performance. In some ways a harder task than the male parts - swing sword, kill, save helpless woman - in that she had to show the full range of emotions from warrior maiden - in the Eowyn mould of Tolkien - to terrified victim of the Moorwen. However the quality of her performance never wavers whatever is thrown at her. Another fine performance from a superb English actress.Jack Huston: Wulfric is the nephew (I think - it's never actually stated but generally hinted at) of Hrothgar and appears to be betrothed to Freya. It seems against her will or desire. He is devoted to revenge against Gunnar for his father's death - who is at best indirectly responsible. He seems a very single-minded character, but as we see later on minds can be changed.John Hurt: Hrothgar the king. As always he brings a presence to the role which makes you believe 'Yes this is the king and he *will* be obeyed', despite the fact that any one of the others - including his daughter - could probably beat him in a sword fight. His innate ability to understand the character and portray exactly what the viewer expects of that character is once again impeccably displayed.I mentioned above low-budget. Now I freely admit that's a guess, and looking at the IMDb figure of $50,000,000 possibly not even a very good one. I am however very surprised at the gross figure of $160,641 as of March 2009. Lower budget does *not* mean low quality and I hope I have adequately illustrated that in the above review. Granted much of the $50,000,000 may have been expended on the CGI for the Moorwen, but in my opinion it is more than made up for in the quality of acting, script, dialogue, scenery and costume design.My only real quibble is with originality of character names. Why on earth call the king Hrothgar - straight out of Beowulf - and another Boromir - as all Tolkien aficionados will know from Lord of the Rings? Why such easily recognisable names? Everything else was near perfect.This is a movie *well* worth watching if you get the chance.",Outlander

I'll be brief - this is no special-effects extravaganza (though it hardly slouches), it is not cerebral, and it is most certainly not strictly sci-fi; sci-fi elements serve merely as plot-enabling devices for what is essentially a Vikings-and-monsters adventure romp.If you loved The Thirteenth Warrior or Beowulf, you should at least enjoy this. If you've got your head up your backside or are expecting a run-and-gun sci-fi epic... you're watching the wrong movie. It's predictable, yes, it has some small holes, yes, but it has gore, violence, romance, enjoyable characters, passable acting, and a 'monster' that is at once menacing and tragic.Leave your brain at the door and enjoy this movie as the light entertainment it is - I thoroughly enjoyed it!",Outlander

What the heck? Since I had never heard of this, I thought it was a direct to video until I looked it up in the IMDb.Between movies like this and the 2007 movie Stardust, with what has to be one of the best performances of robert deniro's career, you have to wonder what these people are thinking to try and make money?

The surprise achievement here is the conflating of several genres so successfully, and then adding some real heart and soul to boot. Had there been just a bit more confidence behind this smart, solid undertaking (the momentary theatrical release was a likely indication of doubt), the filmmakers might well have avoided a few of the gratuitous genre elements and produced something quite rare and fine indeed.

Spaceship carrying terrifying bloodthirsty monster and a mysterious hero (well, not that mysterious) crash lands on Earth during Viking times. I repeat - Vikings! Swords, battles, mead- drinking and all-around Norse badarsery are featured prominently. The acting is good for the most part, the writing isn't stupid and formulaic, and the director keeps a brisk pace throughout the film. And the space monster is simply terrific, imbued with the perfect amount of personality. If I was 10 years old when I watched it, I would have been running around on the ceiling for months.

This movie about a spaceman/alien who crash lands with a ferocious monster in the time of the vikings kept my interest for the most part but it's nothing I'd want to see again. It didn't seem like a movie released in theaters. The cinematography lacked color so even though the sets were well done they still looked bland. And unfortunately the CGI effects were blurry probably due to too low a budget for the subject matter. The monster was alright and had a neat hunting mechanism but its overall design wasn't terribly inspired. The spaceman who lands in this ancient time seems to forget about all of his spaceman technology he had beforehand until the end. The love interest who is shown to be a tough princess and a great fighter spends the end of the movie screaming a lot and getting kidnapped. Ron Perlman shows up to be angry and then goes away. The king spends most of the movie talking, nearly dying, talking, nearly dying again. I don't know how he lived so long without the spaceman to save him. I did find you could make an intoxicating drinking game outta this flick if you took a drink every time somebody says 'Freya' (the princess' name).

It might not have a broad appeal outside of SF fans, but it is one of those under the radar modern day ""B"" movies that actually has a lot to offer (think Pitch Black or Reign of Fire). The cast, direction, and cinematography are all solid to very good. While the story falls a little too often into genre clichés, the characters are interesting and there are enough plot twists and new additions to warrant this movie a star or two for small innovations. I'm thinking especially of the clever way the film makers address the language barrier and the origin of the feud between the Moorwin and humans as providing interesting twists to what could have been rote clichés. The film is a little over-long by about 15 min, but that's quibbling.The monster itself, the Moorwin, is worth the price of admission alone. Although it resembles in form some of the more well-known alien menaces from the last 20 years, it's phosphorescent skin and blood are a very cool innovation and are also visually exciting.Bottom line is if you are interested in a film whose subject matter is Vikings fighting an alien monster with lots of action and some small sparks of innovation, then you will not be disappointed.",Outlander

It horrifically shows that from this point forward there seems to be not the slightest desire to actually create anything fresh, new or creative. In this debacle, a spaceman crash lands on Earth, with a bunch of bodies of his family all killed by a monster, that yes, oh by the way, he was also carrying on the ship! Yes, it not only stinks of the movie ""Alien"", but that monster seems to be getting lots of work these days. Since it's the same damn monster. Sure it glows in the dark and at some points has a ""stingray"" type tail, but when you finally see it in the light, yep, it's the same monster. You'd think he'd give the work to some of his buddies.This spaceman is from the future, and another planet, where supposedly things have evolved, you'd think that after all those years, he would have evolved. You'd say: just think of what he could bring to these people now, with what he knows. You'd think that. But ""thinking"" is not something these ""film makers"" have obviously ever done. They are amebas that just keep going foreword without thought, feeling or soul.Oh, see I forgot to mention see this staggeringly unoriginal claptrap takes place in the days of the Vikings! So, you see it's different. Alien monster is not a few years in the future but he's gone back to the past. See, that makes it all different now! Except now you have this spaceman from the future from another planet, dealing with the ""primitive"" Spam loving folk of two thousand years ago. Gee, you'd think there would be something interesting here. Did anyone see ""Starman"" a beautiful little movie that actually used that premise? No it was just another way of combining all the Sword and Sorcery movies with the ton of ""Alien"" rip-offs. I mean, you'd think this spaceman's advance abilities would help these ""primitive"" mead drinking warriors? Actually no. Nothing. In fact, he seems to know just how to parry-thrust with a sword like any good warrior of the iron age. There's a quick second where there's some kind of mention that he can't ride a horse, but that's given up quickly, and he jumps on (even with his hands tied!) and rides like the wind.In fact at one point, he's the one who devises the trap to try and get this monster, as if he's been out on the range his whole life barnstorming and digging wells. Shouldn't that be the other way around? Shouldn't they show him a thing or two of how to live off the land? Shouldn't both of the cultures either clash, or teach each other something? Nope. That would mean some kind of creative thought. No, this one has the benevolent old king with the braids in his hair (oh, and are you ready played by ""Alien"" actor John Hurt), the dashing king-to-be, the king's daughter, who doesn't like the king-to-be, the battling leader of the other tribe, and yes, the little orphan boy. And the boy learns to no that would again be too much. The boy doesn't learn a thing except how to cut his hair.There's a great bit of Déjà vu in the scenes of the alien creature in his lair gathering bodies like squirrels to nuts (it gets cold in the winter up there in Norway, you have to be prepared) along with guys not with guns and flashlights, but swords and torches running around dripping tunnels (why do they all have to drip just because Ridley Scott did it once, does EVERYONE have turn around in drips!!!) and being eaten.Yes, one does think again and again of ""Monty Python's Holy Grail"", except, in this case it's the audience who needs to be shouting: ""Run away run away!"" I watched this with a crowd of Sci-Fi people, who really tried to like this movie for the first half but even they began to hiss and boo, as one overused scene after another vomited its way onto the screen. At one point when you have the proverbial girl dangling off a cliff, being held by two fingers by the hero screams: ""swing me!"" it was over. The crowd burst into gales of laughter. Yes, they were laughing AT the movie. Then, started the mass exodus through the dark (they ""film makers"" put all their money on bad CGI effects, and didn't have enough for lights, so it was always dark in the theater), without the slightest interest in seeing what they knew was the obvious ending.However the few that stayed, were rewarded in that they got to see one of the most unintentionally hilarious send offs of the end of ""North By Northwest"" ever filmed. But I'm telling you this monster is no Eva Marie Saint.I've purposely not mentioned the names of those responsible for this junk food called a movie. Check it out above you in the credits. And do whatever you can to keep them from doing this again. These are not individuals who should ever be given money and shout ""action"", or ""cut"", or ""less light"", or ""we can't do that, it's never been done before!"" No, there needs to be ""stalker laws"" for non talents like this. They need to have an injunction to keep them at least fifty feet away from any studio, sound stage, CGI shop, or DVD Player. The last so they can't continue to make movies solely by imitation.",Outlander

124,leducdor-1,Surprisingly good flick!,7,9 June 2009,"I didn't have many expectations for this film and so was very pleasantly surprised that it was so good. A twist on the Beowulf & Grendel story that is both imaginative and colorful, it even manages to intertwine sci-fi and old Norse legend in a creative and ""yeah, that works!"" kind of way. The cast is professional & decent, with the leads doing yeoman work with their parts. The FX are very good, the monster is as horrifying as one could wish, more dragon than 'Predator', the scenery beautiful and the plot decent enough if a bit patchy here and there. My only reservation was on the pacing - I found myself pausing often during the first 2/3 of the film to do other things, but remained glued to my seat for the last 1/3. Most definitely worth watching!",Outlander
125,mamcglinn,awesome movie,8,5 March 2009,I had heard nothing about this movie and I have no idea why.Who would have thought a movie having a plot of a man from another world crash landing on earth hunting a dragon with Vikings would turn out to be so good.This movie left me wanting more I really hope they make a prequel id like to see more of where the outlander came from Good special effects good story and good actingand the way it put together made for a really entertaining moviethe only problem i had with it was the predictable ending other then that this was a surprise smash hit for me best movie i have seen for quite some time .... Awesome movie,Outlander
126,luca-annone,Just complete crap,2,3 December 2012,"First things first: technically the movie is well made, besides the acting. As usual American ""products"" are super nicely done, with nice special effects and great monsters... As for the acting, its a little below average I would say. Especially Jim Caviezel, he has to stop acting like if he was Clint Eastwood all the time. Dude, your not half the actor he is, so quit it.That said, I like sci-fi and I usually know it requires some kind of acceptance of the context created by the authors. In this case, its too far below acceptable. Basically, there is an outer space dude (no mention that he is from the future, but it seems he is from a far far away world), that crashes on earth in 700 AD, with a ""prisoner beast"", I think I understood... that caused the crash by the way. No mention as to where he comes from, why he is so human and yet so technologically advanced, whats the story with his apparently ruthless civilization, etc... So you just got to accept that this is the situation besides all kind of reasonable questions that apparently just don't matter.But then comes the story which reminds of (I assume, and hope at this point, intentionally) Beowulf. So nothing new under the sun, including the ending. I fast forwarded most of the final combat and looked eagerly for the few final dialogues for clues as to the what and why of the whole thing. But sadly with no success.So I give it a 2/10 for the effort. Thanks guys, but your story makes no sense. Its not even entertaining anymore, so much stuff just thrown in for the sake of making... something.",Outlander
127,gordon-meadows,Sci-Fi Fantasy mish-mash done properly,9,21 August 2020,"I'd say this is an A-minus movie instead of a B movie simply because of the achievement of execution here.The acting is good. The effects are good. The premise is well thought out.It's got the sci-fi philosophy angles combining with the viking sword & shield setting with a dash of monster horror on top and they all just compliment each other in a rare and wonderful adventure that satisfies.Usually someone would come along and mess it up and make things more complicated than they need to be by overwriting or insulting the viewers intelligence.It's not oscar-worthy but it's Saturday-night-fun-worthy.This is just a well done lower-budget action packed adventure with heroes, villains, twists, and monsters.Pretty decent violence presence but it isn't for it's own sake and everything just works.A+ for me. Would very much recommend. Better than a lot of huge budget adventure movies out there.",Outlander

129,topsfrombottom,An Under-Appreciated Gem,8,3 March 2013,"For what this movie is, it's horribly underrated. In fact, for what this movie is, it's awesome. Actually, I WOULD have granted it a 9, but for only a couple of reasons. I might breech the spoiler-clause by telling you one of them, but suffice it to say it has to do with repetition - and the other would have to be a little bit of foot-dragging in the script - but not much.But these minor flaws easily fade next to all the Good Stuff in this movie... The plot; the casting; the acting; the costumes; the sets; the choreography; the action; the stunts; the camera-work; the lighting; THE CREATURE and SFX... ALL top-shelf. Yeesh, I could spend the whole review praising any one of them. Notably, the creature/SFX talent they had working on the film deserve definite kudos. There is a balanced amount of gore in this movie, I might caution, and it looks 'good' and by 'good' I mean, pretty convincing. There were lots of closeups and even a decapitation - and all were done with the skill and 'just-enough-to-look-real' finesse of true professionals. Those who have seen this will know what I mean when I say that the Lighting Effects during the creature scenes were mesmerizing.Yeah, there were some funny goofs - such as the 'Magic Horse-Blanket' and the 'Vanishing Extra' and silly moments, like free-climbing a rock-face in a 30 pounds of wet, slippery studded-leather whilst deftly wielding a 15-pound longsword and continuing to free-dive for minutes after exhaling a gallon of bubbles - but those sorts of things are in every, comparable movie.And, despite its dashes of superfluous/over-the-top dialogue and somewhat jerky pace, it held me for the entire ride.Lastly, one thing to remember before reviewing this film too harshly: imo, NOT ONLY does it stand up well against any of today's efforts, but the technology and knowledge they had access to make this movie with was whatever was available and current leading up to its release of '08 ...and all in - according to IMDb - only 82 days of filming.Under-appreciated, imho. Because - in my book - it's up there with my faves of the genre; the originals Predator, Terminator & Alien.",Outlander

131,bendi_in_luv,Not your average Viking movie. In a good way.,7,10 March 2012,"In short, surprisingly good. I come from a very proud Viking ancestry, so I was really worried that this movie would butcher Norse mythology like so many other stories have. This movie, in my humble opinion, does a very good and very accurate job of portraying Viking life. There were very few discrepancies, and I am picky. Even the swords and helmets matched what has been found in Viking burial mounds. And the village culture seemed everything I knew it to be; not a bunch of blood thirsty savages pillaging all day and drinking all night, as Vikings are often portrayed. If you are particular about authentic historical fiction, you will not be disappointed. I was also pleased with the story and the direction the creators chose to take it. Many of the twists and turns that movies go through that often get hounded as cliché were not taken by this movie. I found myself thinking over and over again, oh, this is going to happen next, and over and over again, I was wrong. I was actually only right once in the first hour. The movie opens with an out of control space ship hurtling through the atmosphere and into a lake. Except for flashbacks, that is pretty much all you see of modern technology. This is not a laser show. There is some very well choreographed action, some pretty intense moments, a little bit of comedy, and for the romantics, a little bit of love. As I mentioned earlier, the movie does not follow the same metaphorical road as other movies. If you try and guess what is going to happen next, like I did, you will most likely end up wrong so many times that you will start assuming you're going to be wrong and let yourself be drawn into the story instead of remaining on the outside as an observer. One quick note, the R rating is appropriate. There is no sex or nudity, almost no profanity, besides mead, no drugs or alcohol, but the action is a little gristly at times. Its not bad at all by my standards, and I don't think it would be that bad for many people, but I know some are more sensitive to it that others. This is no Starship Troopers, but if you have a weak stomach, you may want to skip this one. Very well told story. I went into this one with low expectations, but I had a hard time choosing between a 7 and 8 out of 10.",Outlander
132,zaludan,Who needs a spoiler?,4,2 February 2009,"Come on! It's one of the most predictable movies I've seen. 95% of the story is predictable. The other 5 isn't just because you think it can't be that predictable. I've looked at my watch every 20-ish minutes, and wondered ""what next"" only because it was still long way to go (I knew how long the movie is) and I just couldn't believe it's gonna be that simple. ""It"" wants revenge, he wants revenge. ""It"" is the last of it's kind, he lost his family - ""It"" killed them. ""It"" strong, he weak. ""It"" has a baby (remember Godzilla?), he meets and likes an orphan kid. Their weapon is not good enough, he thinks of better one. She is dead. Oh, no, wait, she isn't... Helloooo?? The only original idea is that he brought ""it"". I guess my high expectations were due to relatively high ratings here on IMDb (6.8 at the time). I can give it only 4, and even that is just because it's technically and visually good. To that, I'll add decent cast and actors' performance, but that's it.",Outlander
133,jasonford1987,"Overall run of the mill, but with some redeeming qualities.",7,7 February 2009,"First impressions: mediocre. Uninvolving characters, mostly unconvincing CGI, and expectantly less-than-stellar dialogue. Jim Caviezel does do a good job of portraying the mysterious hero, and John Hurt aptly pulls what he can out of the writing. I was quaintly surprised at Ron Pearlman's appearance, who pretty much just does his thing.I have mixed feelings about the monster. The red and blue glow it emits is somewhat imaginative, as well as some of it's abilities (particularly the Priest's death). In the scene where Caviezel first meets the monster, it opens it's menacing jaws and lets out a roar which did make an impression on me. Overall, however, the beast has a familiar feel to it. The core attributes which seemingly all of the movie monsters have drawn from are amply present. Add to that the equally familiar and practically ineffective CGI, and you have a monster that is mostly unremarkable.The soundtrack is in some places a bit cut and dry, but others is very striking and enjoyable. Specifically it was one of the culminating factors in undoubtedly the best scene of the movie: the slaying of the beast. The waterfall setting, Caviezel's believability, the music, the cinematography (such as when he draws the blade), all come together to make for a truly impactive scene. If the rest of Outlander had this sequence's fresh feel, it would be a highly respectable work.So in places, this film does have a bit more over other like movies. In others, it shares in their mediocrity. I should say, however, that if it weren't for the waterfall scene, I probably would have voted this a 5.",Outlander

135,Sharkwave93,Not a boring second! Still it falls short from being the perfect movie.,8,1 December 2011,"Kainan, the main character, crash lands on Earth in the Viking Age. What he doesn't know is he brings along a disgusting, and dangerous creature called Moorwen, and this is the start of a great movie indeed. James Caviezel who plays Kainan gives an excellent performance. Kainan is an ice cold man who is not afraid to kill, but still he is a warm hearted man and father. Having a main character like this is one of the things which makes this movie good. There are also other characters played by John Hurt and Ron Perlman to name some. And they all give a solid performance as Vikings.The visual effects are good, so are the sound. The script is well written, and the story holds on to you during the whole movie. But the story is missing a lot of background info, which I believe would have given the movie something extra if given. You end up with some unanswered questions regarding Kainans past. Although the movie shows you some of the things which has happened, it still leaves you guessing for the rest. With that said, this movie is one of the few movies I've seen which keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It's never boring! There is always something going on! Even where most movies fail in keeping the excitement up, for example when showing a romantic scene or providing key information about the movie, Outlander still manages to keep you interested. And that is what makes this movie so great!With all this in mind I give it a 8 out of 10.",Outlander

It may have a few flaws that other reviewers have picked on, but I was too dazzled by what I was seeing to notice any holes. It really is a visual feast and the acting is terrific too, plus there are real relationships/bonds created between the characters, meaning that it's not just all superficial action without any substance or reason.Added to the solidity of the whole thing and its knock-out concept we're also treated to first class SFX and a fantastic creature!

I hadn't been expecting much, to be honest (the trailer does the film a disservice), but I was really taken with what they did, considering they had to make it on a smaller-than-intended budget (no WETA Digital/Industrial Light & Magic, folks). The story was very compelling and it had some great performances, including Jim Caviezel as the hero. Mr. Caviezel was excellent, and I wish we saw more of him, he's like a rock in this picture. But the rest of the cast are every bit as good: Sophia Myles, John Hurt, Jack Huston – brilliant! The trailer did something of an injustice to the cinematographer Pierre Gill, with it looking rougher than the badger's proverbial. This bears no relation to the finished product, which is so beautiful as to be jaw-dropping, and then some. And, while SPIN VFX is no WETA or ILM, their work was great enough that I didn't miss them (although the baby Moorwen wasn't as good as the big one). All told, it was a great film that is much better than the crummy marketing and support would suggest. Give it a go and, on this score, I can't wait to see what all you guys do next!",Outlander
138,jdrakeh,Beowulf hasn't been this much fun for years!,9,23 February 2009,"I had been interested in seeing Outlander ever since I heard it described as a fantasy re-telling of the Beowulf legend. It did not disappoint in this regard. From beginning to end, Outlander is an action-packed genre mash-up that manages to make Beowulf more fun than any retelling in recent history (including The 13th Warrior). All of the above having been said, there are some things to keep in mind before viewing Outlander. First, the film is not historically accurate. Anybody who goes into a film that features aliens and spacecraft in its advertising and expects a faithful historical reproduction of Beowulf will be disappointed with Outlander  rightfully so, I might add. A lack of historical accuracy in a film that showcases spacecraft and aliens? How unexpected! Second, Outlander is an action movie first and everything else second. This being the case, some laws of physics have been suspended in pursuit of entertainment. Anybody going into Outlander expecting to see a detailed, painstaking, recreation of real world physics or a seminar on the chemical properties of whale oil will be just as disappointed as the aforementioned history buffs (and, again, rightfully so).Outlander has never claimed to be a history text or a physics class and it (unsurprisingly) fails at being both of these things. Outlander is, on the other hand, an entertaining piece of action cinema. If the idea of Vikings fighting aliens sounds like fun to you, go see Outlander. If you're looking for a historical docudrama or recreation of Viking Age warfare, go see something else.",Outlander
139,jameschastain47,Viking Scifi tale of heroes and dragons,8,23 May 2013,"Loved this movie in a general way. But somehow the editing seemed flawed. So much was left unsaid or untold. I keep feeling like there is a better (possibly a directors cut) that leaves in more of the details and parts that would have fleshed out the whole story in a more exciting way. Somehow the Advanced culture tech seemed to have been cut short and left me guessing and wondering about what was going on before he arrived on Earth. The historical aspects of life in a viking village were as authentic as one might hope for. Seems that was the best imagining of viking village life since ""13th Warrior"". Some of the older movies, Like ""The Vikings"" with I think Kirk Douglas did the typical Hollywood thing and made up the actual anthropological descriptions to suit the times the film was filmed in. But Outlander managed so very well in the description of life in the times department. I really love the movie! Hated the missing parts feeling.",Outlander

It is obvious that the story is quite a clumsy remake of the Beowulf and Grendel story. I recommend ""Beowulf and Grendel"" (starring Gerard Butler) if you wish to see the real movie.The crew there comes from Iceland that makes the film looks authentic. ""13-th warrior"" by John McTiernan was also much better. It reveals quite fascinating theory of the origin of the vendols in the Northern Europe mythology and their connection to the Beowulf legend, expressed in the first anglosaxon written poem ""Beowulf"" Effects were at a high standard, but apparently they were the only worth in the movie.

141,JCPadmore,Bit boring,4,7 March 2009,"OK, here's what I thought....with some questions along the way! This was a thoroughly boring film. Another Alien from a distant world, crash-lands, gets beaten up and hated and then later becomes a hero, falls in love with a single girl in the village (there's ALWAYS one available for some reason??!!?) and then leaves to return home with his people who come and rescue him.....then, predictably, the legend ""Lives On"" via an ancient writing, legend or a child they left there to carry on the bloodline or some other rubbish! Plus, there's ALWAYS a ""take this and think of me"" type scene involving the girl as well as a jealous rival within the clan. So formulaic and predictable.The character names have been lifted from other sources, i.e Boromir (Lord of the rings), Rothgar (Beowulf), Morwen (Tolkien's Silmarillion). Yes, I know that Tolkien's ""Moorwen"" is a slightly different spelling, but it's still an uninspired similarity.Also, why is it that character names ALWAYS try and sound cool, but end up sounding rubbish? ""KAINAN"" for example. Sounds like ""Kane"" (a name used in WAAAAY too many movies) as well as sounding like the ancient country. The name of ""Wulfric"" is also lame, especially when they're inside the hall just before the 'shields game' shouting it - it sounded like ""Baldrick, Baldrick, Baldrick!!"" (Blackadder reference for UK users).Calling him ""Outlander"" throughout the film just sounds like a copy off ""Highlander"" or Sean Connery's Sci-Fi movie ""Outland"". It's just a term that smells. If you've ever watched Highlander 3, then the repetitive use of the name ""Highlander"" just really starts to get annoying and, after about the 4th time it's mentioned, you just end up making a note of how many times it is said during the film instead of following the story! OK, so the Monster ""Moorwen"" itself - what a rubbish piece of CGI work.Why are the ""Vikings"" calling themselves ""Vikings""??!?!?!?!?! ""Viking"" is a term that only goes back just over 100 years. ""Northmen"" / ""Norsemen"", etc would be much closer to the truth.Why, in an isolated clan / village, were there so many different accents being used? American, Irish, Pseudo-Danish, English, etc? Rubbish.Why the hell was Ron Pearlman getting involved in this film??? After Hellboy, you'd think that he'd be up for higher quality work.Why was the work ""OK"" used???? I don't think that particular word featured in 8th Century Europe! Why is it that young boys in these types of films ALWAYS have stupid looking wigs of HUGE blonde hair??!?!? Looks ridiculous.The only redeeming feature of this film is that it shows that Kainan's people destroyed nearly every Moorwen and took their planet. Ultimately, demonstrating that you simply must not take what isn't yours.So, I give this film 4 out of 10, purely for the moral of the tale. Everything else smelled. Still, watch it if you want.

It is a little over-long but it's got that sort-of fun b-movie type charm of some of those 80's fantasy movies, like Dragonslayer, Conan the Barbarion there are some others I should mention but their titles escape me at the moment. I don't no, something about this film just gives me that sort of eighties vibe even with the fantastic special effects. I like the way the actual creature design works with the darkness to give you a kind of impression of what the creature looks like without fully revealing it until near the end, thats how monster movies used to be done, now everyone just wants to show off the special effect right away to sow how realistic the creature can be, whatever happened to building a little suspense.Okay so it's not going to win any awards or anything but if your in the mood for an action romp you could do far worse than catch this fun albeit just a tad over-long (I'd say they could have shaved off about fifteen mins) adventure.",Outlander

It was a typical quest film; a bland fill-in-the-blanks adventure. The usual characters died at the usual times, and in the usual ways. The love story panned out with tedious predictability. The monster(s) appeared in the usual tired, hackneyed places and times, and were fought in the same old ways, with the usual results. I've seen this film 50 times before, with different names but the same old story.The actors persevered with a script which was, at best, average - poor John Hurt. From shining acting beacon of a generation, to plodding along repeating Americanized ""olde worlde"" language. Even the names the characters were given were from the usual thoughtless school of tragic cliché - I mean, WTF, is it so difficult to spend 10 minutes on Wikipedia checking out some real historical names? I prayed for some humour amidst this yawn-fest, but alas, any attempts were only leaden, dismal and tired. Except for the wardrobe department, which provided its usual pathetic attempts - it's not as if the knowledge of Vikings looked like isn't out there. Why can't it be used?The saddest thing is that there is so much talent out there, just waiting to do something more that join the dots film-making. I hope they get the opportunity.

148,james-bennett,Don't spend money on watching this............,1,29 November 2008,"Just watched this on the off chance that it would be good, given that I have enjoyed Jim Cavielzel in previous films, and it inspired me to write my first ever review. I can really get into these movies, loved reign of fire, lord of the rings etc. This film does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. The sheer implausibility of the script beggars belief, completely destroying any chance to suspend disbelief. Considering the calibre of the actors involved (Hurt, Cavielzel) the acting jars and situations arise that they respond to in amazing and implausible ways. There must be at least 50 events in this film that the characters respond to in ways that could not and would never happen. My advice to anyone considering watching this 2 hour plus ramshackle, cobbled together, random, sci fi, meaningless, redundant, boring, display of film autism, would be to stay at home and watch reign of fire again, or just sit and watch the walls. It's cheaper and more fun.",Outlander
149,darkvalleyrecords,Groundbreaking Indi-film,9,1 June 2009,"When my friend brought this over and described it to me my first reaction was ""What the hell!? Man, this is going to suck."" But I'm a sport and usually will give indi-movies a chance. You never know when they will surprise you. Equalibrium is a good example of this. Shortly into the movie I knew this was turning out to be pretty good. By the end, I realized this film was a complete gem.OK, so the CGI wasn't major budget for 2008, fire was made obviously by a mid-grade generator. It was still well within my acceptance level of good CGI and some of the background compositing was awesome. I know that the artist who worked on this put nothing less than love into what little they had for tools.I call the story Groundbreaking in that NO ONE ever before has truly combined Sci-fi and Vikings, and pull it off so well. Yes, I could see a lot of Borrowed ideas such as Predator, Pathfinder, Alien and Beowulf but that only added to the fun, beauty and down right authentic, Pagan and Scientific styles that are blended. The story was in depth enough to keep you interested and well mixed with action. Ron Perlman once again demonstrates how great an actor he is. Like always, you do not see his prior roles (There's no Hellboy or Reinhardt here). Also the very HOT Sophia Myles made a great love interest to create a spiritual pull between the two heroes.This is the best Straight-to-DVD movie I have seen in years.",Outlander

The entire film is a rip off of other films most notably predator, 13th warrior, the vikings and the godfather, (watch for the horses head).i can't imagine why some of the actors that are in it agreed to appear other that they needed to pay some bills.That said the first act is fairly interesting however the rest of the movie fails to follow suit.No doubt some people will enjoy this movie and will get on my case doe the bad review but I'm a bit of a purist and this was a waste of my time",Outlander

This film ticked an awful lot of the boxes for me. The special effects are very ""of our time"" and pretty seamlessly integrated with the live action. James Caviezel seems to be the same kind of character in each of the movies I have watched him in - he's pretty economical with his dialogue. Sophia Myles started well, but I thought she faded a bit towards the end - not enough to spoil her part in the movie though. Jack Huston was very good (John Hurt also) and Cliff Saunders gave me a few things to smile about. I am a great fan of the Lord of the Rings. This had a little bit of that magic but not all of it. The characters were filled out more than enough to support the action and I will be watching this again sometime I am sure of that.",Outlander

I did not rent this movie expecting much, effects were really nice and it was ""turn your brain off"" action. But the ending sorta required some SERIOUS ""turn your brain off TOTALLY, please"", more than the rest of the movie. Never minding oriental dragons on viking buildings, or that vikings look like they have a team of makeup artists. The end was so much... deeper.. Oki.. Try to follow me: You are in a viking village. You go down the well in the center of the village. You swim under water and end up in a cave, that, really, happens to be volcanic! I mean, ACTIVE, as in RED LAVA! Everyone knows of course that all viking villages are based upon volcanic caves, and you can get into them via the well! Oh, wait, it gets more interesting. You run through the cave and end up in an opening, and manage to stop before you FALL DOWN INTO THE FJORD, because you are standing on a plateau far over the fjord, in a waterfall. Oki, follow me. Down the well, through a volcanic gave, out an opening and look down at the fjord. Lets do this again... Volcanic cave... Overlooking... the fjord...Being Norwegian, I can state we do not have volcanic caves, but I could forgive that, if THEY DID NOT OVERLOOK A FJORD! Now, you did not notice the opening would take you to such a dangerous place, since it was just an opening, but when you turn to look into the opening, you can not, because now the opening is covered by... the waterfall. It did not cover it when you walked out, but NOW it does. You walk into the cave again and suddenly there is a ton of water from the waterfall.. that was not there before. But the moving waterfall just does not compare to.. Down The Well... Into Volcanic Cave... Out Opening...

Now the bad things....actually for the first time it wasn't so obvious,but later a realized a couple things.How the pilot could not see the horseman coming?the bush wasn't so dense.Why they thought that the beast was a bear?The village had at least 6 m high walls.How the bear could have cross the wall?How can a girl with a body of a model raise a heavy sword with one arm and fight?How could one beast kill all of the people from the colony?They didn't leave a single guard?How could a beast with the size of a truck just hide in a spaceship with the size of a commercial airliner? And finally the real deal! A single beast was able to kill all of the people from the colony and the spaceship (which was so advanced,with guns and other stuff),yet it was killed by a single man(and of course a lovely babe) with a sword which was crafted by a viking blacksmith from the iron age, with viking technology(a hammer and fire)from the remains of a spaceship?C'mon!!!!!!And the list just goes on....",Outlander

Their acting look bad anyway. The amount of cheese and clichés that arose during the film made me want to be sick as well... Terrible special effects and I can't stress more at the sheer waste of talent!! Why agree to the script?!?! The closest comparison I can think of to this movie is Attack of the Sabretooth which is probably the worst movie ever made. Watch that first and you'll laugh harder at this. The goofs were also very obvious. Seeing as the protagonist can read English in the beginning of the film yet he speaks 'alienese'... strange.OK, there was some amusement that came from the movie.

159,riddicules,great little monster flick,7,4 February 2009,"I voted 7/10 for this movie, because it is a good movie, but it lacks something to be claimed a great movie. Definitlly worth your time and/or money! The story is simple: space ship lands, monster follows, people scream, hero helps :P But it's not that simple really. I really loved that in this movie, the bad guys aren't necessarily the obvious ones. To say more would be a spoiler, so i won't. So it is a monster flick, a viking flick (not really), a story about courage and surprisingly about love and family (not kidding). It is also a two way revenge movie. Why two way...well-you'll see. So the story is good, not epic, but good. The acting is good, and whilst i do like the choice for the main character I do not like some others...remember vikings are supposed to be big and strong, not pretty and small - that really sucked :( The monster: not bad, i'm not a fan of the flashing light's, but OK, why not...looks powerful and mean, and believe it or not...also intelligent...and as I mentioned, there is a story, a reason for it's anger or blood-lust if you will. The movie will most likely, pull you in, and it will be over way to soon... A PREQUEL WOULD BE IN ORDER! I would love to see the history between our hero and the monster's planet in a separate movie!

At first I tried to give it a chance but some parts of the plots are really puzzling - some of the dark shots relied on you being able to tell who was doing what and it was hard to tell. I think they were trying to go for the '300' approach but it didn't come off and some parts were just cringeworthy. Really, this wasn't the worst film I've ever seen but damn close, I would recommend wasting however the film lasts were there are so many great films.

161,BraveFront,A Predictable Drama,1,23 February 2009,"From an interesting if not ambitious premise, this film manages some visually atmospheric scenes and grandiose scenery that is cleverly underlined by a generally superb musical score. Unfortunately however, that is where the superlatives must end.Aside from some isolated moments of authenticity from Myles and Hurt, the acting is comprehensively wooden, the script infinitely shallow and the plot riddled with enough cringe-worthy clichés to warrant clenched teeth and wrinkled nose on more than one occasion.Even so, this film might have escaped with a less scathing review if it wasn't for the sub-standard quality of the action and lack of overall pace.Whether due to the expense of special effects involved or simply poor workmanship, most of the action scenes are poorly shot - often in dim or obscured surrounds not to mention bland camera work - and the approach is far more identifiable with that of a drama than what you might expect from an action genre film.Equally, the sci-fi element is almost non-existent in that it is used to introduce us to the setting, but quickly sinks into obscurity along with the rest of the plot.If anything, this is more a generic love-triangle story in a picturesque setting than a high paced adrenaline-laden romp through the ages.When all is said and done there are still some fleeting moments of excitement amongst the predictability and clichés, but if you're expecting a roller-coaster ride you may want to replace your seat-belt with an uncomfortable pillow to avoid disappointment.",Outlander

At times parts of this film reminded me of The 13th Warrior, with a little Beowulf sprinkled on top. You certainly won't get bored watching this film.

The screenplay has generic dialogue, forgettable characters, and an uninteresting hero. The thing that caught me right off the bat, was how terrible the Production Design was. That's the part that most reminds me of shows like ""Xenia"". Everything just looks too clean and too much like a set. The cinematography is decent, but also on par with ""Xenia"" quality"". Director Howard McCain must know somebody, because from his credits he goes from Production Assistant to Writer Director. He's a newb director/writer, and it's obvious. Just terrible. And what's funny, Pierre Gill, the Director of Photography, most of his credits are in Television, no wonder everything looks like Xenia. The only saving grace is decent CGI, which is sometimes impressive, but the green screen scenes are pathetically obvious at times, especially because they kept the audio from the take. This is bad because you can hear the distinct room quality echo when they speak loudly, versus what it should have been, being on top of a tower over-looking the land.

It has vikings and it resembles the 13th warrior, but with much more technology, and frankly, with a very good story combining it, it made me remember ""Storm"", the comic books that i read when i was a boy(they should do a film about storm).I hope they make a story with kaenan race in the stars against some advanced technology alien race hehe",Outlander

I care not to say the worst because there must be some other I'm forgetting. I watched the movie based on the IMDb score, and also the proposal sounded interesting for an action movie. Sincerely disappointed. Bad acting all around. There's absolutely no depth to the characters. The film proposes this transparent ""translation"" of Norse to English, which was badly implemented,being that modern terms and slang English could be noticed. Vikings speaking modern U.S English. Also, the cultural Viking setting was very poorly implemented. It looks based on a very very shallow stereotype. The sound track was as if recorded from a strategy video game. Etc, etc, etc. Well, to say somethings good, the ""Outlander"" wasn't so incredibly awful as the rest of the cast, and that were some nice special effects.To wrap the whole thing: more than one and a half hours of corny story layout, bad acting, and a messy salad of clichês.",Outlander

Big mistake.The basic idea is taken from ""The 13th Warrior"" and the alien part from ""Beowulf and Grendel"". Almost everything is predictable, the interaction between the characters boring and the ending, well it is not even worth talking about.

Quite authentic from what we know and very similar from what we speak today. The film let some areas untouched which to me seamed a bit dis-logical. But what to expect from an American production where most part of the move is supposed to be in (US)English (almost). But the aliens speaking ancient Nordic viking tongue, well.. Anyway, if you like the plot I think the money spent is well worth. You get 1h30m+ minutes worth of descent Sci-Fil/action plus some questions that might reach your mind.

For a while, I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but then it hit me: this is the exact same story as in The Ghost and the Darkness...

There is a believable element in the opening scenes after the crash landing. The Outlander is obviously distressed and disoriented in a land that is far back in time. Loss of his weapon engages him at a physical level only with his captors, man to man. The Viking side of the story line has plenty of characters, fighting, and village details. But the village sets are only barely constructed. This is surprising given that most of the movie takes place with the Vikings. The flash backs to the future world have much more elaborate sets (well designed and complete). But overall this is an interesting and engaging movie. The characters are interesting, the story line progresses fairly quickly with quirks and turns, and the effects with the dragon are decent.",Outlander
182,pithan42,Outlander review,8,20 August 2018,"I watched this because of Jim Caveisel, I've been a fan of his since ""The Passion of the Christ"" which shut his career down for years, but not for good! He actually gets to talk more than usuall in ""Person of Interest"" which is a really good series, prophetic really. This movie was pretty good, not as great as I'd hoped, but definately worth watching. I reccomend it, there's only 1 curse word in the whole movie! Enjoy...",Outlander
183,davidaq,Berlin Fantasy Film Fest,7,19 August 2008,"Caught a screening of this last night in Berlin. Cinema was completely packed, not a spare seat in the house, and the crowd really seemed to enjoy it. I thought the film was great, really cool genre pic that comes across as a nice mixture of Predator/Braveheart/Beowulf, all the while managing to feel quite original on its own. Nice cast, Nice Script, and everything is handled a hell of a lot more intelligently than what you'd expect from a movie which is essentially 'Giant Alien Vs Vikings'. Why this is only getting such a limited release is beyond me, I think it could actually do quite well if given the chance. Basically anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi Action/Adventure done well should be looking forward to checking this one out when and if they get the chance.",Outlander
184,gregariousjb,One of the best monster movies I've ever seen,10,7 June 2015,"I've been watching movies for over 30 years and I'd humbly consider myself a movie buff with a penchant for perfectionism. I tend to pick out plot holes that others don't see, although I'm not infallible.I've tried to find a plot hole in this movie, but I can't. It certainly stretches the limit of the unknown, unique, and absurd, but it does it extremely intelligently. It does an excellent job of laying out the plot within the confines of its own making. As simple as that sounds, there are innumerous movies that fail this.The monster itself was thought up by creative genius. It has the similarities of most monsters in most movies - the big teeth, the intelligence, and the brutality. But this one is something altogether legendary. It is not only intelligent, it is calculated in its actions to ensure that fear is spread as wide as possible. And while most monsters hunt with darkness, this one does the opposite!After a wild ride of intense action, humor, connection, and sadness, a single blink-and-you-miss-it scene leaves a significant thought-provoking idea - who really was the monster? That's for you to decide.",Outlander
185,jonesrafferty,its great,10,15 May 2016,"this movie is outstanding it was great and spectacular, i hope they make a second one. It was very touching how it ended i literally just got done watching it on syfy. originally when i started the first 15 minutes made me not wanna watch it but then the movie got suspenseful the ending was great. ill tell you this if they make a second one i will watch it for sure that's a fact. if anyone else agrees with me and thinks they should make a second outlander give this review a thumbs up please it would be appreciated P.S. i'm not a movie person i cant sit still for a whole movie, but this movie is the only one I've watched the whole thing of without getting sidetracked or changing the channel, its the same way with me for shows too.",Outlander
186,Waldgeist,Don't get yourself wrapped up in history - this is cinema at its best: Entertainment,9,31 January 2009,"Let me start by saying that negative comments motivated by it being a reinterpretation of the Beowulf story and not being historically correct are simply mistaken.All movies that exist are influenced by old tales, some rip them off blindly, some even claim to tell ""the true story"" (King Arthur*shudders*). But looking for historical correctness in a movie that says ""Aliens vs. Vikings"" is like going into an Helly Kitty movie expecting some good action scenes and blood.You choose what movies to watch, stick with the genre you like, then you will not be disappointed so often._Now to the movie itself_ I expected this movie to be cheap, cheesy and uninteresting but watching it together with my even more skeptical girlfriend changed our both minds. This movie is well done, well shot, well produced, the props look good enough, the sets are good enough, the CGI is well done and the actors do a decent job.The Screenplay seems to be cut just right, it does not have too many lengths or shorts, the conversations have the needed information without venturing off too far into the romance story within the action. I like that most of the romance is portrayed simply through visuals and not words. The action is well cut, though i would have liked it to be a bit less ""shaky"" but it seems this trend will have to develop to its extreme before it starts to vanish again (hopefully soon i wanna see the effort the actors and stuntman put into their swordplay more clearly!).**Minor spoilers** The story has some nice tones to it, especially an untypical rivalry between the main character and a male side character, that does not include the typical ""i will kill you if you touch her"" or the typical fistfight and alcohol to make them friends again, very well done! :D The background story to the beast and its motivation close before the final and the portrait of it really gave the whole thing more depth to it and i liked it very much, because that way you can just be all ""alienhating"" over the course of the whole movie and get this slight ""oh noes i feel bad for them"" feeling right before it ends :D I like that the viking cast does not only consist of 2 meter man with 1 meter broad shoulders grunting and shouting, but that they are more displayed as humans, normal men (unlike Pathfinder / King Arthur), which i honestly had expected to happen, because of the ""B-movieish"" kind of nature of the main idea for the movie.As i said in the beginning, this movie is just cinema at its best. It does not have many faults, most of them are because of the lower production values of the movie, but they really pushed themselves and I wish this movie the best of success and want to see more of this kind of well-done-entertainment!",Outlander

An amazing journey, truly one of the best TV series to watch.Outlander is truly worthy of running like Law and Order.Love this series, I can't wait for the next season and beyond.....",Outlander
188,opticgaming-50281,good start and plot but bad end,6,23 July 2018,"When i watched this movie the plot and at the start of the movie i got interested as the story went on, but after seeing the hole movie i felt that the sent all budget, effort and time on the first half of movie and the second half not so good, the second half felt like a washed out cheep version of the hole movie and that left me with a bad after taste. 
Like one glass of coke and the second glass of 1/4 coke and the rest with water and some food color and some bad sugar. What i think they did wrong is they should have a more quality stable than stretch it out with clips no one cares or likes. I would like 1 hour movie with interesting content and story beginning to end, than 2 hour movie that is very washed out that is very bad and boring.I give it a weak genuine point of 6/10",Outlander
189,ernieleestafford,"Bad, but good enough to watch through in lockdown",3,15 November 2020,"So much money was made a waste by holes in plotlines, dialogue was poor, acting was limited by the dialogue, the plot had a lot of potential but I was constantly asking myself throughout WHY!?!? Topped off by a corny death at the end 👍",Outlander
