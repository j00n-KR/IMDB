0,TheLittleSongbird,What an institution indeed,7,6 July 2017,"Part of me did want to see the first 'Police Academy' film for a while now, but the bad reputations of the sequels and that the style of humour 'Police Academy' has has been done really badly elsewhere that it did admittedly put me off.Seeing all the films recently, for curiosity and giving the benefit of the doubt, while the sequels are really not good on the most part the original 'Police Academy' is and is rightly considered the best of the series. 'Police Academy' is never going to be one of my favourite films, and won't be in my list of favourite comedies any time soon, but, taking it for what it is and what it set out to do, it entertained for most of the just over an hour and a half running time.It is a bit hit and miss in places, not all the jokes work (most do though), due to going a little too heavily on the childish and cheap low-brow factors. That said, nothing is distasteful at least, nothing makes you want to gag or make you go to the bathroom and throw up copiously (which is more than can be said for stuff like 'Freddy Got Fingered' and the worst of Adam Sandler).'Police Academy's' story is rather thin, with less eventful parts leaving some rather draggy stretches, and gets a bit silly. Kim Catrall does a good job being sexy and sassy but she is given little to do and the film didn't seem to know what to do with her.However, 'Police Academy' is competently made visually, not stunning but hardly cheap. The setting looks good too and is well utilised. The soundtrack is catchy and infectious, fitting the tone perfectly.While it has been said that not everything in the humour works, most of it does, the crudeness is mostly not overdone and the silliness is mostly endearing. Much of the dialogue is hilarious and there are set pieces that raise at least a couple of big belly laughs, the highlights being the speech scene (absolutely hilarious and to me the single best and funniest scene of the whole 'Police Academy' series) and the scenes with Copeland and Blankes.Steve Guttenberg seems to be really enjoying himself, and is a fun and amiable presence. Easy to see why his role here made him a star at the time, even if somewhat briefly. George Gaynes is a hoot and GW Bailey is suitably hard nosed, which provides some entertaining conflict. Everyone else is fine too.Overall, good fun film that never tries to be more than it is and knows what it wants to be. Hit and miss perhaps, but when it hits man isn't it entertaining. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Police Academy
1,bkoganbing,Affirmative Action For Idiots,7,27 December 2008,"Police Academy and the subsequent films in the series is a guilty pleasure of mine. The films are puerile, vapid, stupid, gross beyond belief and I laugh my Glutteus Maximus off at them. So apparently did a large part of the American movie going public.The premise for the film is right at the beginning off screen narration where it is explained to the audience that a mayor's executive order in a quaint metropolitan area has said that the police academy will not discriminate on any grounds. Apparently that also includes intelligence as well. So we find that a whole lot of people are now applying to be cops.What a class they are too. They're headed by Steve Guttenberg who is given a choice by another police captain friendly to his late father who is concerned about Guttenberg's lack of direction in life. We've also got Kim Cattrall the rich débutante who's just bored with her life, David Graf who takes the gun/penis dichotomy to the extreme, Bubba Smith the peaceful florist, Bruce Mahler the henpecked husband, and little Marion Ramsey who has voice projection problems and my favorite Michael Winslow the human sound effect machine.Of course we have to have a villain and in this case and in a few subsequent episodes it's G.W. Bailey better known to today's audience as Lieutenant Provenza in Kyra Sedgwick's squad in The Closer. He will stop at nothing to run this group off the police force and they, especially Guttenberg, will stop at nothing to goof on him.Another favorite is George Gaynes the absolutely clueless commandant of the Police Academy. What that man can do with the word 'many.'Confession is good so embrace your inner grossness that allows you to enjoy the Police Academy series.",Police Academy
2,Leofwine_draca,A surprisingly funny comedy given the reputation this series has,6,5 November 2015,"A lot of criticism has been levelled at the POLICE ACADEMY franchise over the years, but I've never thought the films were all that bad. They've dated, yes, but their mix of slapstick goof and the occasionally raunchy gag is a good one, and this first instalment in particular feels fresh and invigorating. I reckon POLICE ACADEMY is the closest that America ever got to having their own CARRY ON series.Anyway, this is a typical early '80s production, about a bunch of new recruits and their hapless taskmasters, and the inevitable adventures and mistakes they end up making along the way. It's similar to the likes of STRIPES but far funnier. Steve Guttenberg holds everything together back when he was popular, contributing a likable everyman charm, but it's the supporting characters who really shine here. Bubba Smith's Hightower is a fan favourite, but I particularly enjoyed David Graf, whose voice box is worth its weight in gold.The well-judged performances continue in the form of G.W. Bailey's delightfully frustrated antagonist, Lieutenant Harris, and George Gaynes's hilariously befuddled Lassard; that classic podium gag involving the latter is still the highlight of the entire franchise for many people, including me.",Police Academy
3,SnoopyStyle,Fun 80s comedy,7,3 January 2014,"The mayor has open up the admission policy of the police academy. This has led to a myriad of different characters trying out for the force. Lt. Harris (G.W. Bailey) is the hard nose trainer determine to break the unlikely recruits. Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg) keeps trying to be kicked out from this program that was forced upon him. Karen Thompson (Kim Cattrall) is a rich girl. They and the other misfits will turn the force upside down.This is a fun 80s comedy. The characters are good nature. The movie has the heart in the right place. If there's any needed improvement, it's the need for great wacky comedian. Other comedies of the era like 'Animal House' has John Belushi. This one has Steve Guttenberg. He's more a comedic actor rather than a full blown wacky comedian. It just doesn't get to the next level for a comedy.",Police Academy
4,kosmasp,Everyone can do it (?),8,26 April 2021,"Well that is at least what the movie is suggesting or at least what we get told at the beginning. I watched this back in the day and had really good memories of it. And by rewatching it I was not dissapointed. There is a reason the very first one is considered a classic ... and I would argue that it is. I had forgotten so many things and I couldn't have told you that one member of the later infamous Sex and the City show would star in this (but apparently not in the following movies, but that is a story for another time).It is how the characters get introduced, the fact that it does not take any prisoners and the fun that translates from screen to the viewer. There are cringe worthy moments or at least moments that nowadays seem outdated .... or might rub quite a few people the wrong way. Like how gay people are portrayed/used for jokes or in a diminishing way. Try not to overthink it - I've seen worse, but I understand if you can't overlook certain things. We are all wired differently so there is that.Then there is also the music ... the theme song is imprinted on anyone who has watched the movie(s). This spawned another 6 movies ... this tells you everything. But none was as out there as this is. Nudity and sexual innuendos included ...",Police Academy
5,Sleepin_Dragon,It's still riotously funny.,9,16 January 2020,"I was obsessed with this film in my childhood, and having re-watched it today, I still see why I loved it.The premise is funny, and the jokes have all been done before and after, the humour comes from this wonderful bunch of characters, there are some really funny lines, but they're all charming and outrageously funny. It's well made, and still holds up well. The first was the best, although two and three were fun, five was dire.Kim Cattrall was wonderful as Karen, but the real star was Steve Guttenberg, everyone over the cheeky and handsome Mahoney, he was great as the focal character. Lassard also, comedy gold.Favourite scenes always involved those with Lieutenant Harris, particularly with Hooks.A wonderful film that brings back childhood memories, love it. 9/10",Police Academy
6,gavin6942,Iconic 80s Comedy,7,6 September 2017,"A group of good-hearted but incompetent misfits enter the police academy, but the instructors there are not going to put up with their pranks.This is just one of those iconic 1980s comedies. Between this film, its six sequels, a TV series, a comic book and more, it really became part of popular culture in a big way. Heck, Steve Guttenberg was sort of the defining comedic actor of the 1980s (and then disappeared).Although many of the actors are best known for their roles here, it is worth noting that Kim Cattrall plays an important role and she remained popular right up through ""Sex and the City"". Leslie Easterbrook also stayed strong through the 2000s, something many of the cast cannot claim.",Police Academy
7,lee_eisenberg,This shows that movies can be stupid and funny at the same time.,10,29 September 2005,"Okay, so ""Police Academy"" is probably the ultimate manifestation of the word ""witless"". But it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: nice, silly fun. The plot basically has a series of goof-off misfits enrolling in the police force and turning it topsy-turvy. Steve Guttenberg, as Cadet Carey Mahoney, may have to remember this as his peak in movies, and he does a pretty good job here.Anyway, the movie is pretty much an excuse to be silly. And they do just that. With hilarious one-liners and one gag after another, you won't be disappointed. Of course, I advise you not to watch it if you're the type who only wants to see ""important"" movies.",Police Academy
8,jboothmillard,Police Academy,6,6 January 2008,"Many sequels have followed, I do remember seeing one or two of them, but the original is obviously the most loved and successful, all the others only have tiny moments of humour. Anyway, basically with rises in crime, the mayor to open the door of the city's Police Academy to anyone who wants to join (obviously we see how silly this decision was, but at the same time how fun). Chief Henry Hurst (George R. Robertson) does not agree with the mayor's decision, and soon enough the academy is overrun with misfits, including parking lot attendant Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), forced to go there for causing trouble, his only other option is jail. Other cadets include Karen Thompson (young Sex and the City star Kim Cattrall), who Mahoney has his eyes on, tall flower loving Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Leslie Barbara (Donovan Scott), George Martín (Andrew Rubin), gun loving Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), Douglas Fackler (Bruce Mahler), Chad Copeland (Scott Thomson), and of course, my favourite (the only actor I would to see the sequels for, and who is in all of them) Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), with the ability to make literally any noise just from his mouth. Lt. Thaddeus Harris (G.W. Bailey) is least impressed with the new recruits, and at first he is making sure Mahoney in particular has the least fun, and then he switches to wanting him out. All the cadets become more determined to make good, especially when a riot starts in the near town. In the end, the riot is stopped, and also some robbers caught, and all of them graduate, it's just a shame the films that follow are not as successful (or possibly as popular). It was number 42 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Good!",Police Academy
9,Woodyanders,"A very silly, but still extremely funny 80's comedy hit",8,23 March 2010,"A motley assortment of lovable losers and misfits enroll at a police academy in order to become law enforcers. Rascally troublemaker John Mahoney (winningly played with affable charm to spare by Steve Guttenberg) tries to get kicked out and clashes with hard-nosed chief instructor Lt. Harris (robustly essayed with lip-smacking ferocious bulldog aplomb by G.W. Bailey). Director Hugh Wilson, who also co-wrote the blithely inane script with Pat Proft and Neal Israel, maintains a snappy pace and an appropriately good-natured tone throughout. Granted, the giddy screwball humor ain't exactly sophisticated, but it's often amusing in its cheerful lighthearted silliness just the same (the Blue Oyster Bar and the climactic riot in which our engaging bunch of kooks' flaws prove to be their secret strengths are especially amusing stuff). Moreover, the game and lively cast have a ball with the broadly pitched material: George Gaynes brings a perfectly pompous attitude to the role of Commandant Lassard, Michael Winslow does all these great off-the-wall sound effects as the zany Larvel Jones, Marion Ramesy is simply adorable as the timid and squeaky-voiced Laverne Hooks, plus there are neat turns by Kim Cattrall as fetching, thrill-seeking rich gal Karen Thompson, Bubba Smith as gentle giant Hightower, David Graf as gung-ho firearms fanatic Tackleberry, Leslie Easterbrook as the tough, imposing, but gorgeous and enticing Sgt. Callahan, Donovan Scott as the meek Leslie Barbara, Bruce Mahler as the bumbling Doug Feckler, and Andrew Rubin as suave ladies' man George Martin. Popping up in cool bits are 70's porn star Gloria Leonard as a brash hooker and Debralee Scott as Feckler's doting wife. Michael D. Margulies' polished cinematography does the trick. Robert Folk's spirited military marching band score boasts a catchy and effective marital drum riff. Okay, this picture certainly isn't an exceptional piece of cinematic art, but it does deliver a steady supply of solid laughs and never gets too crass or vulgar. A total hoot.",Police Academy
10,BA_Harrison,Cop this!,7,23 February 2019,"The numerous sequels might have been a step too far, but the original Police Academy is a very likeable screwball comedy that benefits from a memorable collection of eclectic characters, the myriad of misfits who sign up for the academy when the mayor decrees that anyone can become a police officer regardless of height, weight, sex, education or physical strength.Steve Guttenberg leads the cast, but don't let that put you off: he's not THAT irritating. Guttenberg is joined by Kim Cattrall as rich girl Karen Thompson, Bubba Smith as Moses Hightower, who lives up to his name, David Graf as trigger-happy Tackleberry, Michael Winslow as human sound machine Larvell Jones, Marion Ramsey as meek Laverne Hooks, Donovan Scott as chubby Leslie Barbara, and Andrew Rubin as lothario George Martín.In true underdog fashion, this motley group of incompetents look set for failure, but eventually rise to the occasion when a riot breaks out downtown and they are called into action. It's clichéd stuff, for sure, but extremely good natured and hard to dislike. Not all of the gags hit the mark, but there are enough genuinely funny moments to ensure a good time. And even if your funny bone isn't tickled all that much, there's always Cattrall in a police officer uniform, which is nice.",Police Academy
11,paul_haakonsen,A great classic comedy of the 1980s...,6,8 August 2020,"The 1984 comedy ""Police Academy"" is a classic in its own right. It is one of those early 1980s comedies that never seem to loose its value. I just sat down in 2020 and watched it again, for the god-only-knows how many times already since it was first released.It is a combination of the storyline, the events in the movie and the characters that makes ""Police Academy"" a timeless comedy. It can be watched again and again, and it never seems to get old. So on that account, director Hugh Wilson managed to do quite well.Funny that even now, 36 years later, the music that played in The Blue Oyster Bar still is stuck in my mind. Yeah, that was just a hilarious scene in itself.And we all love the likes of Steve Guttenberg, G.W. Bailey, Bubba Smith, George Gaynes, David Graf, Leslie Easterbrook and Michael Winslow in their respective roles of Carey Mahoney, Lt. Harris, Moses Hightower, Commandant Lassard, Tackleberry, Sgt. Callahan and Larvell Jones in this movie and the movies that followed.The comedy aspects in ""Police Academy"" are also timeless. I still laughs at the things that transpire on the screen, so writers Neal Israel, Pat Proft and Hugh Wilson definitely struck something great back in 1984.If you haven't already seen ""Police Academy"", I can warmly recommend that you do so, because this is one of the classic comedies to make it out of the 1980s.I am rating ""Police Academy"" a six out of ten stars. It is well worth the time and effort to sit down and watch this 1984 comedy.",Police Academy
12,BandSAboutMovies,Total love!,7,4 May 2020,"You may not know the name Hugh Wilson, but you probably know his work. He created WKRP in Cincinnati, Frank's Place and The Famous Teddy Z, plus he directed The First Wives Club, Burglar, Blast from the Past and Guarding Tess.He was the director of the first Police Academy, a film that every movie this week is really all about.Producer Paul Maslansky got the idea for the film while making The Right Stuff, as he watched a gang of mismatched police cadets getting screamed at by a sergeant. He claims that the group was ""an unbelievable bunch-including a lady who must have weighed over 200 pounds and a flabby man of well over 50. I asked the sergeant about them, and he explained that the mayor had ordered the department to accept a broad spectrum for the academy. ""We have to take them in and the only thing we can do is wash them out.""""Boom. Police Academy.The mayor wants to improve the police force, so he asks that the academy accept willing recruits, regardless of gender, body weight, skin color or age.One of those unwilling recruits is Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), the everyman who we follow throughout the first of these movies and their sequels. He keeps getting in trouble for standing up to authority and his father's friend Chief Hurst - out of respect for a fellow cop - demands that Mahoney either go to police academy or prison. Mahoney agrees if he can bring along a noisemaking man he just met, Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow).Guttenberg was made for this, as just like his character, his father was a cop.Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris (G.W. Bailey, an enemy cop in nearly every one of these films) wants to wash the candidates out. Mahoney wants to quit. And when he's not daydreaming, Commandant Eric Lassard (George Gaynes) wants his cadets to do well.As I always say, hijinks ensue. Mahoney sends the two mean cadets to a gay bar called The Blue Oyster that I promise you, most Japanese people still use as a cultural touchstone for what gay bars look like. Hightower (Bubba Jones) is protective of the quiet Hooks (Marion Ramsey). Tackleberry (David Graf) loves guns. Leslie Barbara is chubby. George Martin is a ladies man. Douglas Fackler (Bruche Mahler) is accident-prone.Pretty much every character gets a one-note that they will use for the rest of the film if not the rest of the series. But hey - it's honestly really funny. Maybe it's because I was twelve when I first saw it. Or it could be that I'm still twelve inside.For the first film, Leslie Easterbrook's Sgt. Debbie Callahan isn't on the side of the good guys, but she will be soon. And Georgina Spelvin from The Devil In Ms. Jones has a memorable cameo.The Police Academy movies often feature people before they become famous and then are sore spots on their resumes. For this movie, that person would be Kim Cattrall, who plays Mahoney's love interest. She will not be the last big star to wander into these films, often in one of their first starring roles.I also love that the ""shoe polish on the megaphone"" came from a prank played on British director Michael Winner (Death Wish, The Sentinel) on the set of one of his movies.President Bill Clinton told Guttenberg that this was one of his favorite movies, and that watching the films helped him through a difficult time. We can only assume that this was during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. I wonder how hard he laughed at the oral sex joke.",Police Academy

14,Theo Robertson,Hard To Believe But This Is Rather Amusing,6,23 May 2004,"It's amazing the number of film franchises there's been in the 1980s and 90s where a relatively good film has been turned into a long running franchise , so long running that the franchise has dirtied the name of the original movie . Take HELLRAISER for example which is a twisted morbid love story which has the iconic Pinhead in only a couple of scenes disappointing people who think he's the star of the movie unlike in later HELLRAISER sequels . DEATH WISH is another movie that you have hazy memories about and rewatching it after a gap of many years you're somewhat surprised that Chuck doesn't run around the streets of a city mowing down crowds of scumbags . HALLOWEEN and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STEET are other movies that would end up mutating into something else but perhaps the best example of sequels spoiling the reputation of the original movie is POLICE ACADEMY Okay the original POLICE ACADEMY isn't Oscar material but it is 90 minutes of solid amusement . A young man called Mahoney has the choice of either becoming a police cadet or going to jail and I guess being a good looking young white boy Mahoney doesn't really have the choice . There that's the set up and it's a simple one perhaps too simple so the screenplay gets padded out with what can best be described as "" patchey sketches "" . In many ways the film is structured like CADDYSHACK and like CADDYSHACK the jokes may fail more often than not but there's still plenty of laughs involved due to the politically incorrect humour . The best bits feature two redneck recruits called Copeland and Blanks most especially the Blue Oyster Bar scenes and the scene featuring the fence A comedy that is very funny in parts and I'm surprised to have enjoyed it years after seeing it . I 've never liked the idea of sequels and like franchise movies even less and when you compare the likes of MISSION TO MOSCOW to the original it proves that turning a fairly good movie into a franchise is one helluva bad idea",Police Academy
15,jotix100,Get Mahoney!,4,13 November 2009,"""Police Academy"", a 1984 film, was a film that pointed out to a trend of the ""gross out"" genre that will follow. Notably the contribution of the Farrelly brothers and its imitators. It was one of the first films that showed a lot of nudity for the enjoyment of the young crowd it was targeted to. Seeing it recently on a cable channel, we thought how sadly dated this picture looks. There were more sequels, but this one stands out as being the original which all the others imitated.Carey Mahoney is the principal in this comedy in which he does everything possible to get out of getting out of the training facility he has been sent. He has it for Lt. Harris, the control freak in charge of training. He also discovers the gorgeous new recruit Karen Thompson who is first repulsed by his antics, but eventually sees a good side to this man.Hugh Wilson directed the film. Steve Guttenberg is Mahoney, the orchestrator of everything that will get him expelled. Kim Cattrall is Karen. G. W. Bailey plays the obnoxious Harris. Best thing in the film is Michael Winslow, who displays a talent for making all kinds of noises and announcements. George Gaynes is the academy's Commandant who has the fortune of getting a blissful moment while delivering a slide presentation.",Police Academy
16,Hey_Sweden,Enlivened by its memorable bunch of characters.,7,21 February 2014,"Keystone Kops type humour was kept alive and well in the 1980s with this now legendary franchise starter, a sometimes raunchy and often silly but still reasonably engaging comedy that gave birth to six (!) sequels, a live action TV series, and an animated TV series. As is usually the case with most film series, the first film is the most inventive; things would only go downhill with each successive entry. Things aren't always terribly funny, but as was said in the summary, this is an entertaining cast playing police cadets with one quirk or another.The premise was simple: a mayor in an unnamed city (this was filmed in Toronto, Canada) decides to allow just about anybody to enroll in the police academy. This leads to the predictable enough development of various oddballs signing up, including trouble maker Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg, in his star making role), former florist Moses Hightower (football star Bubba Smith), vocal sound effects specialist Jones (the hilarious Michael Winslow), meek voiced Hooks (Marion Ramsey), and gung-ho weapons nut Tackleberry (David Graf). Mahoney tries various means of getting himself kicked out, but changes his mind when he falls in lust with female cadet Thompson (and she's played by Kim Cattrall, so you can't blame him). The cadets all get tested when their services are required in dealing with a riot.Other series mainstays we meet for the first time are grumpy instructor Harris (G.W. Bailey), doddering old Commandant Lassard (delightful George Gaynes), and buxom blonde Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook). Winslow provides the brightest moments; although the pacing lags at times, he can always be counted upon to generate some hearty chuckles. Bailey is a good sport considering Harris's fate in one scene. One amusingly ribald moment occurs when a hooker played by porn legend Georgina Spelvin performs a service on Lassard while he's trying to make a speech.The payoffs are all satisfying - including the final gag - in this enduring bit of 1980s pop culture.Seven out of 10.",Police Academy
17,utgard14,"""Back in the old days there were johnsons as far as the eye could see.""",7,22 June 2014,"Due to more relaxed requirements, the police academy is now accepting anybody who wants to be a cop. This leads to an assortment of misfits and oddballs signing up, as well as one guy (Steve Guttenberg) who's forced to join or else go to jail. Despite expectations that they will all fail, the recruits actually do pretty good. This doesn't sit well with a hard-assed instructor (G.W. Bailey), who's determined to flush the academy of all recruits he deems unworthy to be police officers.An '80s classic with lots of funny lines and scenes, as well as very memorable theme music. Yeah, it's followed by a series of derivative sequels of varying quality but this first one is really good. It's helped by a very likable cast, many of whom would stay with the series. Steve Guttenberg, Bubba Smith, Michael Winslow, David Graf, Bruce Mahler, Marion Ramsey, and Leslie Easterbrook are all great fun. Kim Cattrall would only appear in this one. She doesn't get as much of a chance to be funny as the others but she sure is beautiful. People make a lot of jokes about Police Academy like it's a crappy movie. Perhaps that's because the sequels kept coming long after there was no gas left in the tank. This first movie is the best and stands on its own. You can watch the sequels if you choose to, and some aren't bad, but it's not necessary in order to enjoy this one.",Police Academy

You don't need any deep thought; you are just looking to relax.After final exams yesterday, that is what I wanted and Police Academy fit the bill. Nothing spectacular, but it did provide two hours of laughs with juvenile jokes starring Stve Guttenberg, who made four of these films; the gorgeous Kim Cattrall, who racked up a whole room for of awards and nominations for her role in Sex and the City; G.W.

19,view_and_review,Diversifying the Police Force,6,16 July 2019,"When I was younger, I never understood why such a wacky and largely inept group of individuals were ever allowed into the police academy. Now, having watched it again I understand. The mayor of Metropolis, Mary Sue Beal, lifted all restrictions on new police recruits. That meant no race restrictions, no gender restrictions, no height restrictions, no weight restrictions, and--based upon Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg)--no criminal record restrictions, and--based upon Tackleberry (David Graf)--no psych eval restrictions. This can be viewed as very progressive or very pro-pandering.Not to say that the mayor was wrong in thinking the police force needed some diversity-- the problem is the mixture of legitimate conditions with groundless conditions. But it was clear that the old guard preferred to keep the police force precisely as it had always been: white males.Upon looking at the wagon trail of new cadets descending upon the academy grounds Chief Henry J. Hurst (George Robertson) remarked to Commandant Lassard (G.W. Bailey), ""Look at that scum. When I went through this academy every cadet was the right weight, the right height, the right color, and they all had johnsons Lassard. Every single one of them.""""Johnsons?"" Lassard asked.To which the Chief replied, ""you know..."" while pointing at his own johnson.It was clear that this dinosaur of a chief was trying to hold on to the status quo. He was a dying breed going down with the ship. He wanted every mayor-permitted recruit out of his academy, but he wasn't going to boot them out. Oh no. He wanted them to quit. For that he would need the help of the ball-busting drill sergeant Lt. Harris (G.W. Bailey). Lt. Harris' job was to make life so difficult for these recruits that they quit, thereby preserving the purity of the police force while sticking it to the mayor.The recruits were all from various backgrounds and it was clear that their attempts to become police officers was going to be funny.It was mildly funny and mostly sophomoric. To me it was a police version of The Dirty Dozen, or you can say an 80's version of The Dirty Dozen. Some of the situations were funnier than others but nothing was funny enough to justify a million sequels.",Police Academy
20,Uriah43,Somewhat Crude but Funny Just the Same,6,30 January 2016,"Due to a severe shortage of police officers, the mayor of an undisclosed city decides to issue new guidelines for the local police academy which essentially abolishes all normal standards. As expected this results in a large response for applications but when all is said and done those finally accepted aren't exactly the cream of the crop by any reasonable standard. Consequently, the chief of police orders the man in charge of the police academy, ""Commandant Lassard"" (George Gaynes) to weed them out. However, since he has been prohibited from firing them he has to make them quit instead. Yet even then this goes against his temperament and knowing this the chief of police turns to two of the meanest police cadre by the names of ""Lieutenant Harris"" (G. W. Bailey) and ""Sergeant Callahan"" (Leslie Easterbrook) to essentially get the job done. But none of them fully comprehend what they are up against. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that this was a decent comedy for the most part and from what I understand it has garnered more than $100 million and spawned at least 6 sequels. So it has been quite successful in that regard. That said, about the only criticism I have of it is that some of the humor tended to be a bit on the crude side which I thought was completely unnecessary. But that is just my opinion. In any case, there is some good humor here as well and because of that I have rated this movie accordingly. Slightly above average.",Police Academy
21,Aaron1375,A rather good start for a whole lot of sequels.,7,12 April 2009,"Yes, these Police Academy movies would become rather weak, but I thought they started out rather good with this one and part two. This one in the series is also the most risqué, as this film series would actually become more of a family type comedy series when this one is an R rated one that has nudity and one rather funny speech scene. It kind of did the opposite of the Meatballs franchise that went from family friendly to more adult oriented. The gist of the story is simple, a lot of people who should not be in a police academy enroll in one and each is a misfit type in his or her own way. Granted I do not seem them enrolling someone like Mahoney as they kind of frown upon people with troubled pasts becoming police officers. You have your gun toting security guard who always wanted to be a cop, your giant strong dude becoming a cop and a womanizer along with a host of others. The comedy is good and for the most part it works. I enjoyed the two idiots who shaved their heads bald in the one scene and when they got caught up in the bar. Lots of funny stuff, unfortunately the sequels would mainly just repeat what was in this one and the next film and the jokes would become rather stale as the series went through six sequels I know of.",Police Academy

Bailey and Leslie Easterbrook play trainers while George Gaynes is on hand as the commandant.I judge comedies by how funny they are and ""Police Academy"" has a few laugh-out-loud scenes with the rest being consistently amusing. Steve Guttenberg is a strong protagonist and it's cool seeing Kim Cattrall when she was so young. I like the fact that you get to know many of the recruits; you start caring for them and whether or not they'll make it. There's a little bit of nudity and raunch that I could do without, but that's to be expected with a movie like this. In any case, it's not the bulk of the picture, which focuses on goofy and dumb humor. The ending leaves you with a good feeling.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Toronto, Ontario and nearby Brampton.GRADE: B-",Police Academy

Anyway, I saw Police Academy in a packed cinema when it was first released, and the cinema burst into laughter big time.

24,Mr-Fusion,Sophomoric classic,8,7 June 2014,"""Police Academy""'s got it all: part sex comedy, part screwball, a wide array of novel characters (and the great actors that bring them to life) and that great '80s finale when the misfits must unite to save the day. Steve Guttenberg's at his finest here, playing the class clown incarnate, and Michael Winslow is a gag machine unto himself. Kim Cattrall is super- fine and George Gaynes fits the Leslie Nielsen mold to a T. It's just one memorable scene after another (the sexy Amazon drill instructor, Hightower's Drivers Ed, Lassard's podium scene, Tackleberry in . . . well, any scene he's in).

But when it comes to big laughs, there is nothing like the original Police Academy. I had not seen this movie in a long time, so I figured I should give it another watch before commenting on it. May I say that I was just on the floor laughing with the original humor and wit that only the original can hold.I just loved Steve Guttenberg, whatever happened to that guy? :) But every scene he had was just so brilliant and laughable. I especially loved the scene where he and a hooker were hiding under the podium where the leader was giving a speech about the academy, and the hooker performs some interesting acts on him in front of the crowd!

Aside of Guttenberg's horrible acting rip-off of Murray's character from Stripes, Police Academy has some funny moments, but after the sequel it just got horrible. I mean what, didn't they make 7-8 films? Then a cartoon show? The funniest thing, is watching part of Police Academy- Mission to Moscow, on the local Spanish channel I get.

28,OllieSuave-007,Wasn't impressed by it.,4,17 February 2015,"The Policy Academy Trilogy is one of the most memorable cinema work in the 1980s, so, I naturally was hoping that the first movie in the franchise would be a good one.This first movie, about a group of good-hearted but incompetent misfits who enter the police academy after the city's mayor allowed for virtually any one to apply, was just one gag after the other, with little or no plot. The excessive sexual innuendos were over the top and the movie takes a very long time to gain any steam. You might get a few chuckles here and there from the ongoing jokes, but you probably won't mind much excitement or thrills in the action-less plot.The acting, though, was as good as it can be in the film, with Steve Guttenberg, Bubba Smith, Michael Winslow, Marion Ramsey and George Gaynes being the highlight of the show. David Graf's Tackberry character was a little too overzealous and Andrew Rubin's oversexed George Martin character was a turn-off.If you would like to watch the Police Academy movies, stick with the sequels, particularly Parts Two and Three.Grade D-",Police Academy
29,Robert_duder,Made Itself Famous for just being stupid!!!,7,30 October 2005,"I just read someone elses review on here and it was brief and to the point and made a lot of sense. Police Academy is just harmless fun. Is it stupid?? Oh my yes!! Cheap, dumb, pointless, low budget?? Yes, yes, yes and yes. Does any of that matter?? Not when it comes to the Police Academy. I mean you gotta give it some credit for spawning no less than 6 sequels!!! This is the film that started it all and for whatever odd reason you will find it will endear itself to you when it's all over. Something has to be said for the fact that it was made for just over 4 million dollars and grossed well over 100 million world wide. That pays for as many ridiculous pointless sequels as they want.The plot and premise is actually pretty good....the mayor lifts any and all restrictions on police academy recruits enabling people of all shapes, sizes, skills, and intelligence to join the academy. On top of that Carey Mahoney gets himself into trouble with the police and is forced to join the academy for training and he can't quit or he'll go to jail...but he can get thrown out, or try anyways. Police Academy really only works because of the characters. It's not even really the actors because let's face it the acting is campy as hell but the characters are so outlandish they are memorable. Steve Guttenberg who was really at the height of his career plays the wise cracking, prank pulling Carey Mahoney. His sarcasm, wit, and caring for his fellow cadets make him a great hero to the film. He probably does the best job in the film of acting which isn't saying all that much but the film is not about acting, it's about comedic timing and Guttenberg does a good job. I won't go over the entire cast but rather just the ones who the film kinda used as main characters. G.W. Bailey is the perfect protagonist to the film. He's mean, and you love to hate him and he's the perfect balance to Mahoney's character. Their characters are fun to watch square off. Bubba Smith as the larger than life Moses Hightower, is quiet but funny in his own way and his size brings him a lot of great funny moments. Donovan Scott is great too as the underdog, overweight, made fun of guy who you wanna see kick some butt and he does. David Graf, Michael Winslow, Bruce Mahler, and Marion Ramsey all play some diverse and funny characters each one with their own schtick and shortcomings. You'd think with all these characters it would be too much but they are all used in small doses to keep the comedy rolling and it works pretty well. George Gaynes plays Cmndt. Eric Lassard, the rather unintelligent, aging, senile leader of the Academy. His role is kind of a cult classic and he does have some great moments and he adds a touch of class to the cast.Director Hugh Wilson hasn't really done a whole bunch before or after Police Academy, nothing that stands out anyways, but he did put together this great cast and made a really stupid movie that people seem to love. As I watched it I couldn't help but think how incredibly dumb it all was but then something would happen to really make me chuckle and when it was done I realized that for some strange reason, I liked it. It just has a little something and I think it's the cast and the way the movie is put together, it absolutely doesn't take itself too seriously. If you're looking for an eighties comedy that has everything you would expect then Police Academy is the one to look for. 7/10",Police Academy

The crazy characters are as adorable as ever, but there's just nothing much for them to do.Police Academy is more of a raunchy frat-house pic and not the lovable family comedy that the later movies became. There's barely any plot to speak of and the scenes come across as a bunch of awkward vignettes with terrible comic timing and pauses for laughs that I didn't make. It's strung together very loosely and gets boring after a while. The Blue Oyster bar jokes, however dated, still make me giggle though.Despite their, somewhat deserved, bad reputation as low-brow trash, some of these movies were much more fun than the original, especially the cartoon show that followed (and a live-action one too).

41,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Over-crowded cast and mild laughs: The '80s saw better.,5,1 August 2009,"After watching ""Police Academy"" for the first time, I'm amazed at how more six sequels were spawned from it. There's very little original and very little funny about this film of misfit cops-in-training, but somehow it warranted more ventures. The only explanation I can surmise is its memorable characters and incredibly diverse cast.There are a lot of characters in ""Police Academy,"" some funnier than others, but ultimately too many for any of them to gain our sympathies. The potential with some of these characters is pretty good, but picking 5-7 instead of 10-12 could've made for a real band of likable cadets and officers. Instead the characters are sort of wedged into the script for a few dull laughs where their individual quirks fit best.There's Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), the troublesome rebel trying to get kicked out who serves as the main character for all intents and purposes and Lt. Harris (G.W. Bailey), the nasty instructor he drives up a wall. There's his love interest (Kim Cattrall, formerly the infamous howler from ""Porky's""), the only normal cast member and his hand-picked best buddy Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow) -- a human sound effects machine.Let's not forget the gun-crazy Tackleberry, the pudgy mama's boy Leslie, the gigantic musclebound Hightower (former NFL player Bubba Smith), the quiet and squeaky Hooks, womanizer George Martin, accident-prone Fackler, Police Commandant Lassard, the rough but sexy Sgt. Callahan and Lieutenant's cronies Copeland and Blankes. Writers Hugh Wilson, Neal Israel and ""Police Squad!"" writer Pat Proft clearly have no idea which characters will be a hit and which won't, so they cram them all in.Naturally, we pick our favorite characters and hope to see more of them and these characters help us stay sane, give us something to look forward to. In general, however, most of the jokes they are involved in are nothing more than amusing for a couple seconds and very few actually have the set-up and payoff that comedy is built on. The only time that actually happens makes for the best scene in the movie where a prostitute mistakes Commandant Lassard for her customer.In general, there are so many better screwball comedies from the '80s -- like the ones Pat Proft would later work on -- that ""Police Academy"" ends up really low on the totem pole. Watch all the John Hughes comedies before considering a taste of this one.",Police Academy
42,Anonymous_Maxine,"""I'm trapped here?"" ""Oh yes, we all are!""",8,8 March 2008,"There is a pretty good documentary included with the DVD collection in which it is revealed that producer Paul Maslansky got the idea for the whole premise of Police Academy when he was working on Hot Stuff in the late 1970s. Evidently there was a police force in charge of crowd control during the making of that movie that was, ah, interestingly diverse to the point that it caught Maslansky's attention and inspired him to approach a sergeant and ask him why there were so many gym class drop-outs on the force. The sergeant replied that they had a fair employment policy in place that compelled them to accept any applicant who took an interest in becoming an officer, but then with a wink he explained that they could flunk out whoever they wanted after three weeks. Instantly, a light bulb popped on above Maslansky's head.Do you see what this means? Police Academy is based on a true story!!In response to public discontent as a result of a crime wave that has been sweeping the city, the Mayor puts in place a new rule forcing the Police Department to accept any new applicant regardless of age, height, weight, sex, background, attitude, religion, nationality, IQ, criminal history, or SAT score, which causes the police academy to be bombarded with societal aberrations the likes of which would surely cause the public more concern than the criminals causing the crime wave in the first place. No nonsense Police Chief Henry Hurst is immediately and thoroughly appalled at the new ruling as he watches the dregs of society flood his beloved police academy, while Commandant Lassard sits in his chair and cheerfully allows the curious developments of life to happen around him as they will. Most of the recruits that become central to the story are honest people who really want to be police officers, except for Casey Mahoney (Steve Guttenburg, in a career-making-and-then-breaking role), who is forced into the academy as an alternative to jail. How could anyone at any time ever be offered the choice of becoming a police officer or going to jail? Watch the movie and you'll find out, but it doesn't really matter. It has to do with Mahoney having a powerful father, but the point is that Mahoney is a smart-ass who has not a scrap of respect for authority and who is determined to get himself booted out of the academy before lunch on the first day. The academy is equally happy to be rid of him, but for circumstances beyond either of their controls, this is not an option. It's a preposterous situation, but you have to admire it's simplicity and effectiveness in paving the way for a whole movie full of slapstick hilarity.The rest of the relevant cast provide the springboard from which six sequels sprouted in subsequent years. Indeed, the plots of the movies run a distant second to who is back for each subsequent movie. Moses Hightower is a towering black man who became tired of being a florist, of all things, and decided to become a cop. His counterpart is Cadet Hooks, a mousy black woman with the voice of a stretched balloon who, among other things, must learn to speak with authority. Larvell Jones comes from a background similar to Mahoney's in a lot of ways but is better known for his ability to imitate the sound of almost anything (this was also a career-making-and-breaking role for Michael Winslow). Then there are Tackleberry, the trigger-happy but hilarious gun fanatic, Karen Thompson, the attractive cadet played by Kim Cattrall who provides a welcome distraction for Mahoney, the overweight and perfectly named Leslie Barbara (a man), and Doug Fackler, a priceless geek who is prone to cause accidents that don't affect himself. And overseeing them all is the delightfully creepy Lieutenant Harris, who is determined that they shall all fail miserably. This should seem like an exceedingly easy task, but as they say, never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers!The first movie in the Police Academy saga follows little more than the adventures of the recruits described above as they work their way through the police academy. There is a delightful competition between Lieutenant Harris, who treats his job with deadly seriousness as needed to ensure his own advancement, and the rest of the recruits, with Commandant Lassard popping up occasionally to fulfill the duties of a man clearly more interested in goldfish than law enforcement, but it's impossible not to love the guy.Speaking of which, Lassard is the, umm, ""victim"" of one of the movie's more childish and unamusing jokes. I am not sure how successful the joke was when the movie was first released (I was 5 years old at the time and can't remember my initial reaction), but it is an unfortunate representative of much of the rest of the movie. Police Academy is a milestone in the evolution of the cheesy comedy, there are no two ways about that, but the comedy in the movie has, ah, not dated well. Modern audiences will find not a single genuinely funny moment in the entire movie, but it would be madness to say that this means the movie isn't any fun.I remember when I was a kid I used to drive my brother nuts because I always wanted to watch Police Academy movies over and over again, but at some point I lost interest, and didn't gain interest again until about a week ago when I stumbled across the Police Academy DVD collection. But for an amusing trip to the comedy of the past, you can hardly do better. Grab a couple beers, bring your buddies over, and relish the comedy of your childhood. There were never any Academy Awards in mind, but I'm willing to bet that you can't watch this movie without having a little fun",Police Academy

The 1984 hit, was pure slapstick, meant to take digs at the police academy. It's as entertainingly addictive as 1985's Night Patrol. Of course, nearly in all cases, the original's the best: same case here. We're introduced to a bunch of richly written characters, delinquents, wannabes, who we grow to love over the next chain of sequels, each character, totally different from the next. Sadly most of the actors, and they are good, didn't go very far after this. Of course, the chief character or the main dude of our story, is the delinquent Mahoney, who as a valet driver rightfully drives an abusive customer's car sideways. He's arrested (not the first time) and forced to do community service, via a police academy program, which for Mahoney, is what you could call hard time. He butts heads with a nemesis lieutenant, Harris (G.W. Bailey- Major Crimes) and this is where the real fun lies, but also we have a little revenge, a liked for two kiss arse students, who like to be pain in the arse martyrs, where Mahoney and them square off in one scene. I loved Bubba Smith in this too, as Hightop. I could spend hours going on about the wonderfully meaty formed characters and the gags, but P.A. is a see for yourself comedy, another reason that just made the eighties great.

Mahoney wants out, but when the riot hits, he changes his mind and gets the glory.

46,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: The franchise film!,8,9 January 2005,"Police Academy (1984) was the first of many films from this series. Since this was the 80's and this film was very successful there was only one alternative, milk the cash cow until it was dry. Like most of these films, the first one is the best and most creative of the bunch. The film follows a bunch of losers and outcasts who join the local police academy for various reasons. The main character is Mahoney (played by Steve Guttenberg) a man with a shady past who enrolls in the academy as an alternative punishment for a previous criminal act. He becomes the motley crew's leader and representative.This movie made Guttenberg a star and it started a film series that would live on D.T.V. and make the producers a lot of money. It also gave people jobs and made others into minor stars. I found this movie to be very entertaining. If you're into juvenile humor and a bunch of cheap laughs, then I recommend this movie. Others need not apply. Followed by six sequels!!Recommended for some laughs and low brow humor. Hey, it's one of the essentials.xxx",Police Academy

You will love Steve Guttenberg, Michael Winslow, and George Gaynes's characters and all the escapades everyone gets into as they try to pass the academy and get into the police force. It is basically a frat movie in a police film and a modern day classic. Hilarious too.*** out of ****",Police Academy
48,kluseba,Switch your brains off and have some entertaining fun,7,22 February 2011,"This cult movie is a must see for any fan of humorous movies even though it won't beat ""The naked gun"" series or the Monty Python movies such as ""Life of Brian"". It's maybe on the same level as the ""Vacation"" series minus the cultural part of those ones. But this movie deals with many clichés of the eighties and presents a couple of absurd, superficial and yet very funny characters that guarantee for many laughs, slapstick humour and absurd situations. At the end of the movie, you begin to appreciate those simple characters with all their weird behaviours, forces and weaknesses. The story and the reactions of the characters are simple and predictable, but maybe just because of that very entertaining and funny. This is a movie where one might switch its brain off and just laugh out loud as this comedy doesn't take itself so serious.A positive point about the movie is that there is also some action and some well hidden social criticism in this movie if you take a look beneath the surface. Another plus is the fact that the jokes are not all sexual as many movies of that kind but in fact quite simple but still diversified so this movie is a perfect entertainment for the whole family if you're not too severe and conservative with one or two slightly sexual scenes. That's why I highly suggest to watch this first part of the cult series.",Police Academy
49,Samuel-Shovel,Comedy Classic a Bit Rough Around the Edges,5,28 October 2017,"Police Academy seems like one of those movies where a screenwriter thought of one good joke and decided to write an entire movie around it. Unfortunately this isn't the correct way to write a screenplay.Don't get me wrong, this movie does have its moments. This one's filled with about 1,000 jokes so at least a few of them are going to stick. And if you can look past all the casual racism, sexism, and homophobia, this movie probably has some charm to it, which I guess is why it spawned so many sequels. Watching this in 2017 had me cringing at a few of the jokes and words used. Different era I guess...The best part about this movie is the memorable characters. The plot is flimsy at best so these actors are the only thing keeping this movie afloat. Guttenburg and the gang are all one dimensional characters with some type of odd character trait played for laughs but for the most part this works to an extend. All the ""good cops"" played their parts well. I can easily see these characters getting old sequel after sequel however.Conclusion: An okay comedy that's a bit rough around the edges. Not something you should go out of your way to see but you could do worse.",Police Academy
50,gcd70,Misfit Police Force,6,11 March 2010,"From writing team Neal Israel and Pat Proft, this was most likely their finest hour. They came up with the idea of sending up, or making a comedy out of, the training program at the police academy. Simple really: put a bunch of misfits through academy training and see what happens. Result: a very funny film.Fortunately the writers have peopled this comedy with some quirky, enjoyable types who will consistently have you laughing. Steve Guttenberg, Bubba Smith, Michael Winslow, G.W. Bailey, Leslie Easterbrook, Donovan Scott and George Gaynes (especially good as the bumbling Commandant Lassard) all keep us entertained.The thing is, Proft and Israel started something that looked like it would never end.Tuesday, November 3, 1998 - Video",Police Academy
51,aidanratesmovies,"Very stupid, but pretty enjoyable",7,19 April 2020,"Generally amusing, entertaining, and endlessly goofy- it has a hard time taking itself seriously, but Police Academy is for the most part a pretty good time. The acting varies from descent to subpar, and the script is full of gags, but none that are terribly funny. The film can be funny from time to time, but it never reaches the lengths that other cop comedies have in the past. That being said, the film is really entertaining to watch, and even though it may not be particular funny often, it is nearly always very amusing and enjoyable to watch. The plot is more than a bit thin, but somehow works in terms of situations of the film, never feeling like too much drama or tonal flaws take the best of it. In the end, Police Academy is not a great movie, nor is it a great comedy, but it is a decent film to watch. It's methods may be repetitive, but they are consistently amusing, and its broad sense of plot and characters can lead to some absurd but very entertaining situations.

I remember wanting to be him and be friends with him and probably some other confused feelings about seeing him in that towel when I was so much younger.Back then these films were so much fun and essential viewing for anyone from the age of 8 or above. You were not cool in the playground if you didn't know who Mahoney and Tackleberry were.Most of it actually still works and if you aren't a snowflake you can take it for what it is and enjoy it.There are a lot of elements that would never be allowed by today's standards. References to racism, sexism and homophobia are just a few, but I have to say that it was done in a way that showed up those prejudices even then.Lots of laughs and classic characters.

It works due to the wide range of frankly bizarre characters. There's no real plot, just a series of events, but the battle of the wits between Bailey and Guttenberg is worth watching. Anyone who grew up on these films knows these characters without knowing much about them. Winslow, Smith, Raynes etc. All add to the charm and simplicity of it all. Never as funny as I remember from being a child, it's still highly enjoyable and impossible to dislike. Nostalgia?

54,Galina_movie_fan,"I've said it before and I say it again, original Police Academy is a lot of fun.",8,19 January 2010,"What do Police Academy (1984) and Amadeus (1984) have in common? Well, apparently they were released in the same year, 1984, and for me, as different as they are; they both belong to the favorites. That's right, 8 times Oscar winner ""Amadeus"", the work of Art, the movie that deservingly has made the countless top lists, and the comedy Police Academy which received zero stars from Roger Ebert who called it bad and idiotic. He suggests in his review, ""It's so bad, maybe you should pool your money and draw straws and send one of the guys off to rent it so that in the future, whenever you think you're sitting through a bad comedy, he could shake his head, and chuckle tolerantly, and explain that you don't know what bad is.""Well, I've sat (or at least I tried to sit) through my portion of bad comedies and I swear, the original Police Academy is not bad. I wonder if very respected by this viewer critic ever changed his mind because I personally sat through original PA dozens of times and I like it a lot. I laugh, I have a good time and what is the most amazing thing, I remember the characters' names - it does not happen to me often. I see them all vividly and think of them with the smile - such a colorful crew of misfits who tried to make it to the Police Force. The first and the most charming is of course Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg will be remembered for this role. And for Diner, of course), a repeat offender who was forced to join the police academy as punishment and tried to get kicked out for the first half of the movie. Then there is gun-obsessed Tackleberry, David Graf, RIP (Son, where did you get that gun? My mommy gave it to me). Next, the sweet, shy and soft-spoken Hooks; the intimidating by his size but gentle ex- florist giant Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Jones (Michael Winslow), the guy who could imitate any sound possible and make amazingly realistic sound effects using only his mouth; the young and sexy long before she was not so young but still very sexy in the City, Kim Cattrell (cadet Thompson), and those two idiots who look like grown-up Beavis and Butthead and who were the frequent visitors in The Blue Oyster Bar where they did a lot of dancing, mostly dancing. There were also memorable staff members at Lassard Police Academy, starting with oblivious forgetful Commander Lassard who liked to give the public speeches...with some special help from under the podium. There is very diligent and strict Lt. Harris who took his job in forcing new cadets to quit very seriously. There is also Sgt. Debbie Callahan in the full Valkyrie mood. To make it short - Police Academy is fun, always has been and I believe will be. I've seen it so many times I know the lines by heart and I still watch at least the parts of this classic when they show it on TV. I'll tell you what - the second and the third movies are also funny. In the second, the new character, Zed, a leader of the local gang of punks, (Bobcat Goldthwait with Ozzy -like voice) enters the series, and in the third, the reformed Zed returns as the cadet and has the funniest scenes with Tim Kazurinsky (Sweetchuck). The rest of the series get repetitive and boring but the first three movies still hold tight.Now back to the question at the beginning of my review. What do Police Academy and Amadeus have in common? Both are the winners of the Golden Screen Award which ""is presented to the distributors of domestic and foreign feature films - including documentary and children films - with more than 3,000,000 admissions within 18 months since their release or re-release in Germany"". Looks like Police Academy made it internationally, and even more - the second and the third movie also won the same award. So, Mr. Ebert, I think it is time to admit that Police Academy is very far from being a bad movie not worthy of even a star from you. Silly, witless - yes. Bad? Absolutely not.",Police Academy
55,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The Cannonball Run (1981) of police genre comedies,7,23 June 2015,"Numerous comedies have been made involving a group of misfits coming together under one roof for a common reason. This specific plot has been used in countless comedies and for countless genres. It is by far from the greatest movie made but the one that comes to mind that was quite popular during the 1980s was Hal Needham's The Cannonball Run (1981); a ragtag group of zany car drivers set out on the biggest race of their lives to reach the finish line. A few years later, this movie would be released and its plot isn't a stranger to what was previously mentioned; an ordinary group of schmoes from the city join the police academy after it becomes legal for anyone to join for any reason. If they pass, they are officially apart of the police force. Simple as that, and as bare bones as it is, the movie gets by just fine for the most part. The only difference between the two movies is that one is in an actual race of who will win, while the other is a race of who will graduate.Written by Neal Isreal, Pat Proft and Hugh Wilson (who also directed) have put together a decent script with a number of positives and only a couple of negatives that clearly needed to be changed. The biggest issue with its script is that it's not a whole story. Since there are numerous characters, there are just several subthreads that run parallel to each other. This also means some characters will have better developed backstories than others. This is usually the sacrifices that are made for bigger ensemble casts. Unfortunately with that come a number of clichés that have been seen in other comedies. Some of which most filmgoers would expect because of how predictable the typecasting is. Yet, this is forgivable because all the main actors who have the majority of screen time are all likable in their roles. This is due to their distinguished personalities. The big three characters belong to Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), a labeled troublemaker but only for the wrong reasons, Karen Thompson (Kim Cattrall) as Mahoney's love interest, and Capt. Harris (G.W. Bailey) who strongly loathes Mahoney and wants to remove any other rejects. Bailey continues to be funny in his roles. Every character that he has been cast for remains comical in their own way with his clumsy facial expressions. Then there's gentle giant Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), the shy Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey), sound effects master Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), the innocent dough boy Leslie Barbara (Donovan Scott), the tough and attractive Capt. Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), the old forgetful Commander Lassard (George Gaynes), hispanic man George Martin (Andrew Rubin), the gun-totting crazy man Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf) and a couple others. With all of these personalities on screen it is hard not to find at least one thing to exploit from each character when it comes to comedy. For the majority of the time the comedy works efficiently. It's not falling off your seat hilarious but there are several moments that will create some good laughs. A lot of the gags and slapstick are stupid and goofy but they work because of how ridiculously quick the situations get. However, there are some jokes that are a bit crude. Humping and butt jokes are bit immature even if the tone is to be goofy. For its time, yeah maybe it was funny but now, those kinds of gags are just ehh. One of the bigger surprises is when there's a racial slur thrown out in the spotlight. Umm,...OK, since when did one of these antagonists become filled with that much hate? Thankfully, it is resolved (somewhat). Come on, there's no reason for that. Keep it classy.Michael D. Margulies was the director of photography for this feature. Although most of his work was shooting for TV movies, it seems as though he handled it well. Margulies gets a lot of the surrounding police campus and the city scenes don't look boring either. They're not beauty shots but they do work. The music was composed by Robert Folk who would be better known for scoring music to the Jim Carrey vehicle Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995). Although Folk's work isn't easy to physically find other than a couple areas, he at least makes it catchy and easy to listen to. The main theme for the franchise has a memorable motif involving flutes and snare drum to emphasize the military aspect of the police academy. The rest of the tracks have more jazz themed tunes, which isn't the usual way of producing a film score but it works nonetheless.Its large cast of comedic talents are clever in their own ways even for a largely thin plot. However, some jokes are bit silly and ill-advised even for its goofy tone. These flaws are thankfully made up with music that is unique and memorable and focused cinematography.",Police Academy
56,alexanderdavies-99382,The best of the bunch by far!,7,7 August 2018,"Before this particular film series went on for too long, the first one is actually capable of being funny at times. It is a madcap, rather crude and broad kind of comedy. Subtlety clearly was never going to feature in the story. Some of the laughs tend to result from some decidedly explicit and vulgar humour. For those who can take it, you will enjoy this film.
 My favourite performance is that of G.W Bailey as the rather kooky Lieutenant Harris. Being a classically trained actor of the theatre, he still displays a natural flair for comedy. Steve Guttenberg is very much a name from the ancient past. In his day, he appeared in a few films that were successful at the box office. By the early 90s, he had practically vanished off the scene. He makes for a good leading man in ""Police Academy"" and wisely uses a different acting approach regarding the comedy. Most of the main cast are totally unknown in today's world, apart from Kim Cattrall. She is no actress but a good distraction all the same!
 The pace is a steady one and it helps to maintain the comedy.
 You will never see these kinds of people in jobs that require responsibility, including that of being a police officer. Such a geeky and offbeat motley crue but they manage to get by - just about.
 The climax is a good one as I enjoyed the action.",Police Academy
57,Sandcooler,"The defining 80s comedy, though not really the best",7,5 September 2011,"It's hard to say what exactly makes ""Police Academy"" such a classic. Sure, it was a massive box office hit, but check out the massive box office hits from this last ten years and see how many you completely forgot existed. Maybe ""Police Academy"" remains so well-known because it spawned such a ridiculous amount of knock-offs. If you wanted to make popular horror in the 80s, you could do it easily by lazily rehashing ""Friday the 13th"". If you wanted to make a successful comedy, you just had to make this one but with a different kind of academy. Who can forget Rick Sloane's ""Vice Academy""-franchise? I can't. I've tried. It may just be a lot simpler though: ""Police Academy"" is just pretty funny. It's not the most intelligent movie ever made, but it does have a lot of jokes good enough to live through six sequels and stay relatively fresh. The characters are all stereotypes (there are attempts at giving them some depth, but I gotta say those are pretty stilted and pathetic), but at least their one characteristic is usually really funny. Pretty much everyone with a pulse likes to sit back and watch Tackleberry be completely insane, or hear Jones do his Bruce Lee routine, because the actors are so good at what they do. Classic stuff. I don't think ""Police Academy"" is the best movie ever made, but it's easy to get its popularity.Hey wait, maybe it's the brilliant theme song. I've got it stuck in my head right now, and so do you.

He is impervious to her pleas, and drives off, ignoring her efforts to run, hop, and jump for miles just to keep demanding he not do this. Eventually she winds up on the hood of his car, but by then he's already at the academy.Descriping this scene doesn't do it justice; it is very funny, and almost certainly the work of Pat Proft, known for his contributio0ns to the films by Abrams and the Zucker bros.If only the rest of the film could be this funny! Alas, despite the presence of Proft, the film is really just one among a hundred ""Animal House"" imitations of the early eighties - you know, a bunch of losers out-do the savvy pros, etc. (See also ""Nerds"", and Dangerfield's college film, and a couple beach movies, one of the ""Porky's"", etc. etc.) - a genre itself inspired, not by the great comic visions of the past like those of the Marx Bros., but cheap mildly gross television shows like ""McHale's Navy"".""Mediocre"" is the word here folks - and it's really baffling why some people like laughing at films like this rather than spending the time developing their taste so they can appreciate something finer. The reason why they might is because finer comedy is funnier comedy - so, do they want to laugh or not? The answer, I fear is, they don't want to laugh - they want to snigger. If male, they would rather get drunk at a topless bar than make love to a real woman. If female, they would rather a boy buy them a cheap but gaudy ring rather than a thin band made of real gold.But looks are deceiving; despite its popularity, this isn't either an amusing film or an interesting one.",Police Academy

63,blott2319-1,"Pure fun, and a good start for the franchise",8,13 April 2020,"I have a deep love for the Police Academy franchise, and I'm sure there is a great deal of nostalgia in that adoration, because I watched them when I was young. The style of comedy works for me because the movie is presented as if it takes place in the real world, but the kind of things that go on are a bit sillier than you would see in reality. It's almost cartoon-like in the slapstick, but lands just a bit higher on the believability scale. The characters are so goofy, but my entrenchment in the franchise means that each one is like an old friend to me, and their odd quirks just make them more lovable. I also appreciate some of the running gags that were started here, and would continue throughout the series. There are some surprisingly solid aspects to this screenplay, particularly for a comedy. It creates some actual drama in the final act despite the fact that most of the characters weren't taking things seriously up to that point. I also love how most of the major characters get their moment to prove they have what it takes in the climax, despite the shortcomings they showed earlier in the film.I do recognize there are some significant failings in Police Academy, though. Probably the biggest problem with the script is the inconsistent rules about when and why Lieutenant Harris is allowed to kick people out of the Academy. The entire tension for him up to that point is that he wants to get rid of all these unqualified cadets, but he is not allowed to let them go, so he must try to make things harder so they will quit. Yet, in order to create some conflict for the third act, suddenly that changes. He can threaten Hightower with expulsion if he fails a driving test, and he can finally let Mahoney go for nothing more than getting in a fight. The movie also has a rather dated attitude towards homosexuality. While the Blue Oyster Bar isn't directly mean-spirited towards gays, it feeds into some terribly dated stereotypes and is seen as a humorous punishment for bad behavior. I recognize these flaws, but I am able to overlook them because I have such a fondness for everything else that happens in the movie. It's goofy, ridiculous, even stupid at times, and I enjoy it for all of those reasons.",Police Academy
64,mentalcritic,An example of how much better the world was without political correctness...,6,10 December 2003,"Ask any cinemaphile and they'll doubtlessly tell you that the best films come from the biggest risks. Terminator 2 was a risk because it was the first film with an official budget of a hundred million. The current Lord Of The Rings adaptations were a big risk because they entailed nearly a third of a billion dollars and a principal photography stage equivalent to that undertaken for Apocolypse Now. Speaking of Apocolypse Now, well, anyone who knows enough about cinema won't need to be told about that one.Police Academy is nowhere near in the same class as those films, but even the most intelligent audience needs some mindless fun every once in a while. Instead, Police Academy's big risk was in managing to squeeze in a lot of jokes that were certain to offend at least someone. People claim that the film discriminates against gays, women, and blacks, conveniently ignoring that the stereotypical nerdy white man and the NRA-endorsing, gun-toting white man also get a good serve here. Nobody is safe. And please, don't read past here if you care about what happens in the film as well as having not seen it yet.Unfortunately, and there always is an unfortunately about adult-oriented comedies of the 1980s, Police Academy does not give its audience a lot of credit. No joke is too low-brow here, and ones like the ""queer dog"" were pretty off, even in those enlightened days. The launching of Harris into the horse's butt is a pretty divisive moment in the film, causing fans and critics alike to battle over whether it is just good fun or a moment where the film sinks so low that it will never return. I prefer to see it as an excellent use of trick photography (ie creative problem solving in film, a lost art these days) that, given Harris' character, is pretty damned funny when seen in the right frame of mind.There's also a lot of whining these days that the Blue Oyster scene is discriminatory against the gay. Well, I'd hate to break it to these self-appointed defenders of the outsider, but the Village People pretty much opened this door long, long ago (or at least a few years ago when the film was made). The stereotype of the leather-clad gay man with the handlebar moustache is still firmly ingrained in the mind of every human being who speaks English. It isn't because they are homophobic, but more because gay people (yes, the Village people are gay) put it there in the first place.Pretty much all of my favourite jokes in the film involve Tackleberry, and this is a good example of how wrong these politically correct drones get it. As a mental patient who has been in and out of hospital on and off since adolescence (the handle isn't just for show, guys), I should find Tackleberry quite offensive. I don't. This is because I keep my head on straight when thinking about his character - the writers were well aware that even under the most undiscriminating guidelines the police (at least in states like New York or Los Angeles) can allow, Tackleberry would not come within cooee of passing their psychiatric screening process. In spite of this, he delivers the biggest laughs of the film, all of them revolving around gunplay or the missing thereof. He is funny because he only has to turn it down a notch, and he'll fit right in with Texan police.I saved the best for last, however. George Gaynes' performance is the gold in this troph that gives it true comical bite. At the time, he was known, especially among children, for a children's television show that was so sickly sweet that it gave everyone involved a Play School sort of reputation, including George. George rises above that here and plays the single most oblivious commandant ever depicted on film. He and Steve Guttenberg play off each other so well that its a pity we haven't seen the two of them work together since. ""I want out of here, right now."" ""Out of this office?"" - It's just two people talking, but the whole exchange induces chuckles every time.Overall, I gave Police Academy a 6 out of 10. There are some notorious shortcomings in the writing (Kim Cattrall's character is only there to give the leading man a moment of character motivation), and it might as well have ""this is a product of the mid-1980s"" stamped on every frame, but underneath all of that is a genuinely funny low-brow comedy that is only guilty of not caring about what people might say about it in nearly twenty years time.",Police Academy
65,Karl Self,Welcome to the Blue Oyster,8,19 December 2008,"Perfect light comedy. The humour is decidedly slapstick but there is also much subtle fun and the tone is (almost) mature.

I also liked the idea of a ragtag band of losers proving their worth.The plot, as if you didn't know it already, handles a bunch of social dropouts joining an elite academy which is intent on dropping them off the roster; they inevitably find their bearings eventually and become good serve-and-protect coppers.Look out for ""The Devil In Miss Jones""'s Georgina Spelvin playing, well, the hooker.",Police Academy
66,Mister-6,"Up the ""Academy""...",7,9 February 2000,"Yep, this is the one that started it all.  The right one to blame.  ""Police Academy"" - never duplicated, countlessly imitated.But before you go throwing any stones...this one is funny.Yep, believe it or not, its joke success ratio is amazingly high.  Is it because it's R-rated?  That's a lot of it, but it also has a good pedigree. 
Director/co-writer Wilson also created TV's ""WKRP in Cincinnati"", Israel and Proft have written ""Bachelor Party"" and some other funny stuff you may have heard of (they had a hand in the ""Naked Gun"" films).And the cast, in this instance, is fresh!  Guttenberg has seldom been better, nor has Cattrall (well, maybe except for ""Porky's""), Gaynes, Bailey, Smith, Winslow or Easterbrook.  There are a handful of good lines, more good scenes here than in any four of the sequels you can name and plenty more opportunity for good old raunchy ""Animal House""-style guffaws.You don't believe me?  Think about the scene with the hooker (Spelvin) in the speaker's podium.  Then think about the punch line (""Good speech.""). You see?  Ah, memories.Take it from a hard-bitten veteran of the series.

67,Hollywood_Yoda,Hilarious,9,2 October 2018,"Police Academy is a modern day classic comedy, reminiscent of the days of Bob Hope and Laurel and Hardy. It's comedy stylings are similar in nature to Mel Brooks films, but not quite as risque as Blazing Saddles. Steve Guttenberg stars as Mahoney, a troublemaker with his last resort being police academy!The casting for the film is pretty good, they are mostly very comedic actors. Even the Capt. Lassard character is hilarious with his interactions with the cadets. The language and tone in the film however, garnered it an R rating; although the sequels would all receive PG-13 due to the new ratings system established by the MPAA in 1985.Definitely not a film that children should watch. But the R rating is a stretch compared to films nowadays. Parents should use their own discretion to whether or not to allow their children to view this film.",Police Academy
68,gab-14712,Absolutely Funny!,9,10 April 2020,"When it comes to movies, everyone has a guilty pleasure. Even though they may be bad in its own right, people may enjoy them for whatever reason. One of my big guilty pleasures is 1984's Police Academy. Yes, I'll admit that I practically love the movie. It just has a lot of heart and its extremely funny. Some people may find the jokes tasteless, but then I must have a tasteless sense of humor. Oh well! These kinds of brash comedies are prevalent nowadays, but this was a rare kind of movie for 1984 and maybe that is why reviews were not as kind when the film was originally released.The film got its premise when producer Paul Maslansky was in California shooting his big prestige film, The Right Stuff. He noticed these strange-looking people wearing police uniforms. He spoke to the worn-down police sergeant, and it was confirmed that these people (including an out-of-shape woman and an older gentleman past 50) were part of the police academy and all they could possibly do is wash them out. Neal Israel was hired to write the script, and Hugh Wilson came on board to direct the comedy. Wilson despised Israel's script because it was too dirty, too raucous. It made him sick just to think about these foul jokes. He edited the script, but the studio would not produce the film if it was too serious. I'm glad they came to that artistic choice because the horse butt scene had me drowning in tears.In one California city, there is a crime wave that is so bad, that many new members are needed for the police force. A decree was made by the mayor that anyone can join the police training program. The academy is now filled with these misfits including: Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg) who is a parking lot attendant and after being arrested, was given the choice of the police academy or jail, Karen Thompson (Kim Cattrall), the pretty woman that Carey likes, Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith) who works as a florist and is one intimidating man, Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow) who can imitate any sound, Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf) who has a thing for guns, and Leslie Barbara (Donovan Scott) who is often bullied. The leader of these gang of misfits are the often-confused police commandant Eric Lassard (George Gaynes) and his right-hand man, Lt. Harris (G.W. Bailey). Harris wants to weed all these misfits from the program, but that may be a bad idea when one of the police cadets accidentally sets off a riot around town.I wouldn't say any of the individual performances are something spectacular. Instead, I think the interactions between each character is what makes the movie so darn hilarious. For example, I love the relationship between Lt. Harris and Carey Mahoney. They loathe each other and both Bailey and Guttenberg do a great job playing up their characters. My favorite character is definitely Lt. Harris. He's a guy who tries to assert his authority but to no avail. He bears the brunt of all the physical comedy in the film such as.....ahem.....the horse behind scene. Michael Winslow also deserves a shoutout for his sound-making technique. The classroom scene where he imitates bullets....to poor Lt. Harris is comedy gold.I am one of those folks who says Police Academy is a 1980's comedy classic. It's light-hearted fun and an early spoof movie. Airplane! may be a better-made spoof film, but this particular one has won my heart. I think they did a great job choosing the subject to spoof. I mean, can you imagine these kinds of misfits foiling a robbery attempt? This movie did so well at the box office that it spawned six sequels. I hope to check them out myself but I hear.....not too great things about them. But then again, this film also received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert actually gave this film ZERO stars! Yeah, no kidding! Thankfully, movies are subjective! There's nudity, there's cursing, but there are many laughs and it has a heart of gold!My Grade: A-",Police Academy
69,Maziun,"Not very sophisticated , but funny classic comedy from the 80's",7,11 October 2014,"I'm not necessary a fan of low brow , unsophisticated humor. I avoid toilet and vulgar humor. ""Police academy"" isn't an intelligent or sophisticated comedy. However I like it because the humor is pretty much innocent and never crosses the line of good taste. Yes , it's R rated comedy but most of the jokes here actually make this a good family entertainment. It was made in era where similar movies like ""Caddyshack"" (good) , ""Porkys"" (bad) , ""Stripes"" (bad) ""Bachelor party"" (decent) or ""Revenge of the nerds"" (decent) gained popularity. From all of them ""PA"" was the most popular and is the best. Funny thing – The plot was actually inspired by real life ! Paul Maslansky got the idea for Police Academy during production of "" The Right stuff"" (1983). A group of police cadets arrived to help with crowd control for the filming of a street scene. When the cadets piled out of the buses to take their posts, they were diverse; men, women, tall, short, black, Chinese. Maslansky found it humorous, asking the sergeant, ""Are these all going to be future San Francisco's finest ? "" The sergeant looked at Paul and said that due to an equal opportunity recruitment policy, ""We've got to take them all into the academy, but we can flunk them out.""The movie has got some kind of plot , but to be honest the whole story is just an excuse for a marathon of gags. ""Police academy"" pretty much feels like a series of sketches with likable goofy characters. Ah yes , the characters . There are the main strength and the heart of the movie. They are pretty much one dimensional and lack depth , but how entertaining they are ! They memorable , colorful , likable and unforgettable. Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg in role which made him famous) the wise cracking, prank pulling underdog with heart of gold. Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow) the human sound effect machine. Tackleberry (David Graff) the gun-happy macho. Comendant Lassard (George Gaynes) the completely clueless old man. Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith) black giant . Lieutenant Harris (G.W.Bailey) the lovely asshole. Hooks (Marion Ramsey) shy black woman with voice projection problems. Feckler (Bruce Mahler) the ultimate unlucky nerd. Who could forget about them !The movie was written by Hugh Wilson (director) , Pat Proft and Neal Israel (""Bachelor party"" and the ""Naked gun"" trilogy). Memorable one liners and scenes , especially : The scene with the hooker in the speaker's podium , the horse scene , the unforgettable Blue Oyster bar , the sexy Amazon drill instructor , ""Princess ?! More like a Prince to me !"" , Larvell Jones intimidating guns and many more The movie doesn't care about political correctness and that's one of the reasons why I like it. Solid acting from all people in the cast. Watch out for young and uncredited Ed O'Neill (""Married with children"" TV series) handing out uniforms on the first day at the Academy. Robert Smith created one of the most memorable and likable music themes ever. He also provides a good score for the whole movie. The tango is called ""El Bimbo"" performed by Jean-Marc Dompierre and his orchestra.The sequels didn't live to the original and sadly many people seem to think that the original was bad too. I don't really think they should make them in the first place. There simply wasn't any potential to create good franchise. The sequel number 2 is watchable , but the series got repetitive and boring very quickly. The TV series were also bad.""Police academy"" is a good comedy. It's FAR from ""Worst movies ever "" list . It's innocent, silly , sometimes stupid fun . It's better than so-called raunchy comedies like ""Stepbrothers"" that Hollywood is making now. I give it 7/10.",Police Academy

The movie is generally funny, the characters are likable, and it's filmed in Toronto! I was surprised to realize that with the first scene showing the Toronto skyline.

On the other hand, the women held it together with excellent acting. It's worth seeing for some inventive uses of sound and the actors.

There's that action all those comedies have in the middle...But: it is funny. 
The characters are still enjoyable, despite being naive; the actors are likeable, friendly faces from the 80's. It's got some nice 80's prime-time action score.

One day while I was up there I went to see ""Police Academy"" with my mom, my grandma, and a cousin. Before we saw this, I remembered Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert gave this movie no stars. I also remembered Ebert reviewing this movie on his show ""At The Movies"" with his late partner Gene Siskel (this was before their show went nationwide and was retitled ""Siskel & Ebert""). Ebert summed up ""Police Academy"" in one short sentence: ""IT IS BAD!!!"" And Siskel agreed with him. But I went to see this movie anyway and to this day I'm glad that I did. ""Police Academy"" made me laugh my head off. After the movie was over I said it was the funniest movie since ""Airplane!"" This movie was so funny I went to see it a second time over Memorial Day weekend 1984 with a friend of mine here in Chicago. ""Police Academy"" still makes me laugh to this day. It's too bad the sequels didn't live up to this, the original. The second, third, and fourth movies in the series were marginally funny. The fifth and sixth movies were less funny and the series started to wear out its welcome. I've never seen the seventh movie ""Mission to Moscow"" but I heard it's a stinker. So I'm sticking with the first movie because it's the funniest.

80,blackmamba99971,The best of the best,10,16 July 2017,"If you've ever wanted to know how the real police academy operates then look no further. Police academy, home to the newest recruits, and also a new way of allowing normal civilians to make a dream come true. Heritage has shown that most academies look for those who have stamina, strength, the right height, right weight, and Johnsons. Yet as the times change so do the police forces. Much like this film who shows that no more discrimination is allowed among the young cadets. Which brings us to the protagonist Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg). A brash trouble maker who pulls pranks long enough to finally get himself thrown into the academy to become a better citizen. How will the city survive? Along with Mahoney comes a motley crew of misfits misunderstood by society such as Marvell Jones (Michael Winslow) who usually passes the time by making sound effects that sound so real you would think the sounds were authentic. Such as gun fire, harmonicas, or even an arcade game. In between these two are other characters such as Tackleberry (David Graf) Hightower (Bubba Smith) or Hooks (Marion Ramsey). Put these people together you get the next generation of cop that most would sacrifice their life for to keep them in their neighbourhood.Although learning is part of the ritual, for which you will need a rough, tough, and hardened Lieutenant Harris (G. W. Bailey) and his sidekick who is not only beautiful but cruel as Harris is Sergeant Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook) Together they make the best drill instructors this side of Siberia with their relentless training regimes of push ups, sit ups, running, push ups, obstacle training, push ups, and more. But also there are the butt kissers such as the two squad leaders such a Copeland, and Blanks who during this feature gets dancing lessons by some very mean looking S+M Blue Oyster club members.Put it all in one can you have one hell of a thrill ride from frame one to six thousand. Full of laughs, action, and great actors such as the most beloved academy leader Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) who only wants to see his cadets graduate with Honourable pride. Police academy was one of the top grossing films during the eighties, which inspired many people from all walks of life to enlist hoping to become the next Carey Mahoney. Yet to do that one only has to park a car sideways, and listen to Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Since the first film it spawned five more instalments making it one of the successful franchises in recent years including their own animated series. To remake this kind of humour would need some very intelligent writers that do not need CGI or special effects, only cut throat humour that can make an audience laugh from start to finish.However to make it work for the Commandant position since the passing of George Gaynes it will be some time before it can actually get off the ground. In the mean time sit back, and enjoy a real gem from the eighties as Police Academy breaks all the rules, with gut busting laughs, and fun. Highly recommended for ages fourteen and above.",Police Academy
81,willcundallreview,Seriously....Seven!,5,6 November 2015,"With seven films in the 80's and into the 90's, the Police Academy series of comedy films are known for their stupid humour and crazy bunch of characters. Here is where the insanity all kicked off and in mediocre fashion, how this spawned so many sequels I'll never know although financially this was a massive success though. The film is about a new law where basically anyone can apply to be a Police Officer and go through training in the academy. Of course the law brings in many wacky people and those who don't even want to be there because they have to go, the film thrives on creating oddballs but really fails to get a lot of decent jokes out, squandering any chances this had at being at least satisfactory.The film stars people such as Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall, Bubba Smith and for me and I think for many others the best person in this, Michael Winslow. Although the character of Cadet Eugene Tackleberry is close to being the best comedy performance in this, Winslow's character Larvell Jones another cadet is actually funny in this, the noises this guy makes are very memorable even from this film. The movie isn't bad in my opinion far from it, many critics in the day really hated this but it isn't really a movie so dumb you'll want to turn it off, it has it's moments and some are pretty good but I just felt it is a little too dumb to be anything but average.Hugh Wilson is the guy behind this directing and co-writing and he doesn't do so well, the moments in which the film could have been funny are squandered by bad choices direction wise and making some jokes just too crude. The movie could also be said to be misogynistic and homophobic which could be true, I heard many homophobic slurs and characters saying another is gay as an offensive term. The treatment of women in the film is questionable and although Cattrall's character Karen Thompson is a strong minded woman, many women in this are seen only in a sexual way.I think although the film can be backwards, some moments of this movie do have good humour and can be funny(it doesn't excuse the backward attitudes though). It mostly gets by in the laughing areas with physical humour and at times Commandant Lassard the man in charge of the academy has some great one liners. Lt. Harris played by G.W. Bailey is also pretty good in his role, he is easily dislikeable and so many things that happen to harm him or offend him are easily likable moments of this movie. Overall I can't really recommend Police Academy mostly because it's just not that good, I mean some people may really like it and it could right up you street but it's too silly for me and I feel for others too. So there you have it, the start to a long running series of films that just seemed to never stop, it did finally of course but even today they are talking about doing a reboot, I hope if they do then it can actually be a good film for once.",Police Academy
82,Cinemaniac1984,"The first, the original, and the best Police Academy.",7,13 April 2017,"Police Academy is easily the best movie of the entire series which seemed to decline steadily in quality. Made up of a cast of mostly unknowns who would later become well known for this 1984 classic, Police Academy is still a delightful comedy 33 years on.In an unnamed city (actually filmed in Toronto), the city mayor decides to solve the problem of the shortage of police officers by removing all restrictions for the police academy and no longer will cadets be discriminated against sex, weight, height, orientation, intelligence and fitness. As the gates have been thrown open, men and women of all shapes and sizes apply for the police academy. The cadets include Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Thompson (Kim Cattrall), Fackler (Bruce Mahler), Barbara (Donovan Scott), Martin (Andrew Rubin), Blankes (Brant Von Hoffman), and Copeland Scott Thomson). While the good hearted Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) is more than willing to give all the cadets a chance, Lieutenant Harris (G.W. Bailey) is strongly opposed to the standards being lowered and is more than willing to wash a majority of the cadets out of the academy by making their lives hell. Sergeant Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook) is also one of the instructors of the academy however more than one of the male cadets have a sexual interest in her.Although Steve Guttenberg had small roles beforehand including Diner (1982), he became a household name throughout the 1980's with the first four Police Academy movies as well as movies such as Cocoon (1985), Short Circuit (1986), and Three Men and a Baby (1987). Unfortunately he was barely sighted in the 1990's and his star power that he one had was lost. Kim Cattrall also earned a number of leading lady roles in movies such as Big Trouble in Little China (1986) and Mannequin (1987), and also hit the big time with TV series Sex and the City. The rest of the cast such as Michael Winslow, David Graf, Bubba Smith and G.W. Bailey continued to appear in the Police Academy series and had a variety of small roles in other movies, however most of the cast have since developed a cult following. Sadly David Graf died in 2001 after a heart attack, former NFL star turned actor Bubba Smith died in 2011, and George Gaynes passed away in 2016.Despite its adult humour, Police Academy was a movie I enjoyed watching as a young child (though I had hired the movie out on video and had watched it numerous times, my mother forbid me to watch the first movie upon discovering a number of infamous scenes) as well as the rest of the movies and the animated series (which got me hooked originally).Police Academy is still a time pleasing classic comedy that is still enjoyable as time goes on. The same can't be said for the rest of the series with its over reliance of unsophisticated humour, sex-related jokes and physical comedy which did become repetitive. That aside, the first movie still remains as the most memorable of the series.7/10.",Police Academy

Legendary (!) characters and timeless sketches ensure that, whether you love it or hate it, it has a major place in comedy movie history.The Poilce force under Commendant Lassard decides to bring in a whole new batch of recruits, throwing all past criteria out of the window. Now ex-cons, scumbags, stupid people, men and women of all shapes, sizes and races can apply for a position in the police force by going through a rigorous training scheme. One man, Carey Mahoney is constantly getting into trouble with the law, but his misdemeanours are small, more of an annoyance than a threat. He is ordered either to join the Police Academy, or be sent to prison. He reluctantly agrees to join with the plan to get thrown out immediately. He meets Jones on the way who agrees to join too, a man with the ability to recreate any noise imaginable. So we meet the other recruits-Tackleberry, the NRA gone wrong. Hightower- ex-flower shop owner, almost 7 ft of pure muscle. Hooks, a timid young woman. Barbara, an overweight mummy's boy. George Martin, who pretends he is Italian to get the ladies. Karen Thompson, Mahoney's love interest, and Fackler, a clumsy nerd. Along with these come Copeland and Blankes who soon suck up to the man who will be training them- Capt. Harris.Harris wants the top spot, and believes that if he can show that Lassard's plan is a failure, he will be promoted. To do this he goes about destroying the Cadets' spirits, trying to expose their weaknesses. However, when a riot breaks out the cadets show their training and true worth, and prove that they are good enough to become real cops. We also meet Sarg Callahan, a female officer who likes the men... and Commissioner Reed the man Harris is trying to impress. During the film each character has very funny moments, Jones with his noises, Mahoney with his tricks, Hooks with her voice, Tackleberry with his guns etc. The funny parts are extremely funny, highlights including The Blue Oyster Bar, the attempt to throw Barbara's books out a window, and the podium- 'SLIIIIIIDE!' scene. Every actor puts in a good performance, the score is a classic, and everything works out well. it may be a no-brainer, but it is therefore perfect to watch with your mates. All the Cadets redeem themselves, overcoming their personal flaws. Yes it is understandable why people would hate this film, as people are unfortunately predictable. Some will not find this funny at all, some will, as with anything, but don't judge it for its foolishness, just watch and laugh.10 out of 10",Police Academy

But the first one released in 1984 is a gem. A charming, laugh-a-minute and totally stupid madcap depicting the exploits of a group of misfits who join the Police Academy of an unnamed city, following the announcement from the new Mayor that essential requirements have now been lifted in order to recruit more members. What presents itself at the Police Academy to Lt. Harris is nothing short of a circus line-up. We have one individual whose litany of minor offending has led to him being sent to the Academy as an alternative to jail, a man who can made realistic audio sounds of anything, an overweight and timid woman who can't find her voice, and a gun-nut who can't seem to wait to get a badge and gun and kill someone. And these are just the tip of the iceberg. Hurst and Commandant Lassard come up with an idea. They have to accept these people in to the academy, but they don't have to make full-fledged officers of the law out of them. They will weed them out, or so help the city and those they will be sworn to protect.",Police Academy
89,the amorphousmachine,"Bit dated now, but the original film is definitely the best of the bunch!",7,19 October 2008,"The first in the series that spawned six sequels is definitely the best! Better remembered as part of my childhood viewing, and I always had an affinity for the wisecracking misfit in Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg)- who is the glue that unites the rabble together to fight crime! Memorable is also the first main antagonist as Captain Harris (played superbly by G,W.Bailey), who becomes the butt of many many jokes by the would-be recruits. George Gaynes as Commandant Eric Lassard is also brilliant in playing the naive and somewhat stupid superior to them all, but his likable charm wins you over.The first film introduces us to an array of misfits and recruits, who become characters throughout the series. Besides Mahoney, there is the gigantic but sometimes gentle Hightower (Bubba Smith), the gun-enthusiast in Tackleberry (David Graf), the quietly-spoken and meek Hooks (Marion Ramsey), the voice-worker in Jones (Michael Winslow)the maladroit who indirectly causes accidents in Fackler (Bruce Mahler), and the buxom and fiercely sexy Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook). These characters return throughout the sequels! However, some characters are unique to the first film, such as the womaniser in Martin (Andrew Rubin) and the overweight and bullied Leslie Barbara (Donovan Scott) are significant in this movie as Mahoney's pals and sidekicks.As a kid, my favourite character was Jones due to his unique ability to create sounds with his voice, but that seemed to have worn thin as an adult, and I much preferred some of the other gags such as the Blue Oyster one that keeps coming back, and the podium scene particularly because George Gaynes sells it so well. Also, Mahoney's antics and interactions with Harris is rather funny, and the social misfit proves his worth to society in the end. 'Police Academy' made me a big fan of Steve Guttenberg back in the day, and I always managed to see his other films, but it was here where he made his mark. In the tradition of the 80s, 'Police Academy' spawns many a sequel, but in this case, the original is the best!A solid ***½ out of *****!",Police Academy

The movie is about a police academy and its many mishaps that happen involving its many cadets (starring Steve Guttenburg). Overall this movie is hilarious and deserves a high rating and is not to be judged by the sequels which have given the first movie a bad reputation (suppodsedly as I like the first 4 at least and have not seen the others.

94,garyldibert,Leslie Easterbrook makes this Movie,7,6 July 2008,"TITLE: POLICE ACADEMY was release in theaters in the United States on March 23 1984 and it takes you 96 minutes to watch this movie. Kim Cattrall, and Steve Guttenberg Police Academy is a 1984 comedy film directed by Hugh Wilson, and starring Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall and Leslie Easterbrook. It grossed approximately $146 million worldwide and spawned six sequels.SUMMARY: A new mayor has announced a policy requiring the police department to accept all willing recruits. Not everyone in the police force is happy about the new changes. The main character, Carey Mahoney, is a repeat offender who is forced to join the police academy as an alternative to jail, a proposal by the officer who has been lenient on Mahoney due to knowing his father. Mahoney reluctantly agrees to this and decides that he will get himself thrown out. However, the chief of police, outraged by the mayor's lowered requirements, decides that the new cadets should be forced to quit rather than being thrown out. Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris, who trains the cadets, agrees with the plan and employs tactics to make their lives as miserable as possible so that they do in fact quit. Mahoney tries many schemes to get thrown out as he cannot quit, as part of the deal made with the officer said if he quit, he was going to be sent to jail. However, toward the middle of the film he decides to stay for good having fallen in love with Karen Thompson, a fellow police cadet played by Kim Cattrall. While in the academy, Mahoney becomes friends with fellow cadets Larvell Jones, Eugene Tackleberry, and especially, Moses Hightower (played by former pro football great Bubba Smith), a quiet giant of a man, after helping him prepare for the critical driving test. After passing, Hightower is very thankful to Mahoney. Unfortunately, Hightower gets himself thrown out of the academy because of an incident when, after fellow cadet Laverne Hooks has been racially insulted, in which he lifts and turns over a police car with the hated cadet Copeland inside. Soon later, Mahoney gets involved in a lunchroom brawl caused by Copeland and Blankes, and takes the blame for throwing the first punch, which finally gives Lt. Harris the green light to expel his most despised cadet. Before Mahoney actually leaves the premises, however, a major riot breaks out downtown. The resulting police emergency forces the cadets into real action for the first time. During the riot, a tough outlaw manages to steal two cadet revolvers (one from Copeland and the other from Cadet Blankes). The outlaw grabs and disarms Lt. Harris by surprise, taking the officer to the roof of a nearby building as a hostage.QUESTIONS: Why did Despite his troubles with Harris did Mahoney try to help him? Why was Mahoney taken Hostage? Who suddenly appear on the rooftop in street clothes? Did Mahoney and Hightower graduate from the Academy? Why did Mahoney and Hightower receive commendation? What was inside the podium hiding? MY THOUGHTS: Now thoughts about this movie! It wasn't a bad comedy, but it did lack the things that can keep your attention. However there was one actress that caught my attention and that was Leslie Easterbrook. She was the only reason to keep watching this movie. She a very lovely actress and I hope to see her in the future movies. Based on the fact that Leslie was in this I give this 7 weasel stars.",Police Academy

97,Idiot-Deluxe,Classic 80's comedy! Has aged well - quite unlike it's G-Rated sequels.,8,29 November 2016,"1984's Police Academy was great in it's day and 32 years later the movie still feels fresh and full of vitality. Sadly it's ONLY the first entry in the series that has held up over the years and that's largely due to the films risqué sense of humour, being more adult or ""mature"" in nature. I've seen this film dozens of times over the years and always get a kick out it.It's funny to think that this movies success (or the entire series for that matter) largely hinges upon the presence of a perennial B-Lister like Steve Guttenberg, but it's true - it just doesn't seem like a Police Academy movie without Officer Mahoney. For the uninitiated Police Academy is a rousing comedy, that comes loaded with many funny and memorable characters and it was the starting point for a long-running and prolific series of movies throughout the 80's and into the early 90's. But it's this one, the first one, if memory serves me correctly, is the only one that's actually true to it's title - it being the only one that takes place largely at a ""police academy"". And it's here, at the beginning, where the comedy is most focused and is at it's most effective.Centering largely around Cadet/Officer Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg) who plays a good-for-nothing punk that's constantly in trouble with the law, as he drifts from one low-paying job to another. Eventually he's pressured into going to the police academy or prison, unenthused by either choice, he chooses the academy, once there he's intent on getting thrown out later that very same day ""Be out of here by three"". He proceeds to cause mischief where ever he goes and with every chance he gets - and there are many. Because after all, that's really half the show - Mahnoney's shenanigans on campus. In fact his handiwork becomes so well known to others, that you hear lines like ""Mahoney... it's gotta be Mahoney"". He's constantly at odds with his superiors's and one in particular: Lituentant Harris, who is by far the most combustible and vocal of the academy's training core and it's between them that many of the movies funniest exchanges happen. I'd say the best of which would have to be the accident involving the dirt-bike and horse's ass - Riotous! Truly a classic film moment - or better yet the scene that immediately follows, which is a hilarious continuation of that scene.Having recently seen it yet again, I can attest to the films seemingly timeless quality and it's irrepressible comedic charm. Director Hugh Wilson did a great job with getting the most out of his cast and the films comic sensibilities still manage to shine brightly after all these years. Police Academy, the first in the series, the one that literally ""started it all"" remains a top-tier comedy and one of the very best of the 80's - a decade that easily had more notable comedies than any other (I could make a list but don't feel that it's necessary).Sadly it's -only- with the first Police Academy movie that the magic is alive and vital - the rest were obviously tamed-down for younger audiences - and it's a real shame they went with that direction.I can't help but think how awesome it would have been for Eddie Deezen to have been one of the new cadet's, definitely a missed opportunity..... but anyway's - Long Live The Great Mahoney!",Police Academy

With a myriad of comedy styles, from raunchy to slapstick, it really makes for a fun lighthearted film to forget the unpleasantries in life and just soak in the moment.However, there were many racial and homophobic jokes made that frankly, especially in this day and age, were more disturbing than funny.

101,jbartelone,Watch ONLY if you Like Slapstick Movies!,4,12 September 2007,"Police Academy is what it is, one of the many teen slapstick farce comedies of the 80's that spawned much of the screwball shenanigans that still exists today in these types of movies. It doesn't offer much in the way of story lines, plot, or premise. However, it can still be fun IF (and this is an important if,) you like slapstick comedy.It's nothing more than a bunch of immature cadets going through basic training at a Police Academy mixed in with the typical college sophomore humor of sex jokes and situations while trying to say to the audience, ""Let's see how many moronic elements we can get out of a low-budget comedy to make high school or young college kids say, ""hahahaha, this is funny."" However, Police Academy's biggest problem is that it's not quality comedy in any way, shape or form. There ARE a few funny situations, but nothing that is memorable or hasn't been done 100 times before in these types of movies. The film also suffers from the lack of any big stars to make it appealing even to the audience that it is trying to reach.If you are under 20, and like screwball comedy, Police Academy is a one or two shot viewing when there is nothing else on or when the video store is out of the movies you want to see and you find this in a bargain bin somewhere.

Number 3, better than 2 but not nearly as good as 1. The rest. I cry if I watch them. A chuckle here and there isn't enough for me. Just my humble opinion.This first, however IS a classic movie. Not an intellectual art film, just a very funny movie that has managed to entertain millions for quite some time. Anyone who walks into this film with the idea that it's anything but a silly, off the wall comedy, and who feels films must have a message or some deep meaning, is in for a disappointment. Honestly, why would some pretentious snob watch this in the first place? The advertising is fairly clear as to what type of movie this is. But I digress.The basic story line is that a bunch of folks who would never, EVER, have a chance at being police officers under the strict guidelines have their shot when a 'forward thinking' mayor takes over and opens opportunities to EVERYONE. Disaster is being invited here. However, as it turns out, whether or not the recruits really wanted to be cops, they become some damn fine cops. In real life, it's amusing to see that this can actually happen. The best candidates on paper can be the biggest flops and those who, on paper, should be avoided, sometimes excel. Steve Guttenburg should make a comeback.

When i compare Police Academy to most of the comedies of today then i appreciate it even more.One thing that bugs me is that Michael Winslow is under used in this. It seems that he is involved in very little and is only there to make cool sound effects. I would have liked him to have been involved in the story more.Regardless of that little annoyance this is still a brilliant movie which is far superior to the sequels.

Thing is the original was the best of the bunch and actually pretty good. While it does get occasionally offensive and sometimes not for the best.Changes have been made by the local mayor to stop certain criteria from being met in order to train to become a cop. Now a new wave of recruits are joining the force. From disgruntled parking lot attendants (Steve Guttenberg) to itchy trigger-finger security guards (David Graf) to wimpy photo shop workers (Donovan Scott). Others join them as well like former NFLer Bubba Smith, soft-voiced Marion Ramsey and mouth-box Michael Winslow who could make any sound effect. Winslow was in fact so instrumental in my up-bringing to this day I still walk around making sound effects. Problem is it's not so easy. Lt. Harris (G.W. Bailey) would love to see every single one of them fail and quit to prove his belief that this new idea of recruiting is ridiculous.The original was in the vein of NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE or PORKY's. Where the sequels were not so much aimed at adults. This is rated R due to coarse language, nudity, sexual themes and violence. So, the original may not be for the kiddies where the sequels could be.

109,m-ozfirat,A comedy classic on its merit,10,13 January 2015,I grew up with this movie as a child when my father bought it at the Video shop when it was first released and became part of my childhood. I found comfort in the film. The lead character is played by Steve Guttenburg who is well cast and plays a rebel turned opportunist when he is recruited in to the Academy for his juvenile antiques. Kim Cattrall is beautiful and well cast as the demure Cadet with whom the chemistry is good with Guttenburg. The story line is inspirational and entertaining with other well written characters that in paradigm make the acting and storyline entertaining with rich humour and some action at the end to provide excitement when they overcome doubt by proving the cynics wrong such as Captain Harris. The sequels were frivolous and lacked the funny maturity of this one and eclipsing it. A couple of the sequels such as 4 and 6 would of been good independent comedy films not exhausting the brand. Guttenburg was at the height of his career then and this certainly is a classic from his era in the 1980s and in my view film History.

I think the key reason the PA movies are the most dissed film franchise ever comes from the makers' ultimately well-intended mutiny on their original audience. This film, the very first, is actually an R-rated ""Animal House takes over the law"" flick, before the makers decided to market toward families. There's scary fuzzy homo-biker club humor! Stuck up Captain Harris flies head-first into a horse's patoot! There's a ""mysterious hands (or is it... never mind) under the podium"" gag... before the Clinton era!

114,Jim Griffin,"Offensively bad, unfunny comedy (spoilers)",4,2 January 2001,"So many things to complain about, and with only a thousand words...When Police Academy was first released, the audience was issued with 2D glasses so they could see the characters in all their glory.  This group of cardboard cut-out non-entities are perhaps the main flaw in a deeply flawed movie.  Imagine how this puerile rubbish was pitched:  People what shouldn't be in the police actually do be in the police.  There's one man who does be cocky, another man what does make noises, a fat man whose belly is big, a woman what does speak quietly, a big man what is tall, a man who is clumsy and does wear glasses, a man who sleeps with lots of female women, a woman what is manly, and a man what is nasty.  It would be generous to call these people one-note characters; they could barely make up a note between them. This bunch of stereotypes provide jokes and plot twists that can be guessed from the moment they first appear on screen; the only surprise in the movie comes in learning that it wasn't written by a twelve-year-old.Steve Guttenberg's Mahoney is supposed to be cocky and charming, but is instead just a charmless, smarmy nothing.  His character arc is sophisticated; he moves from being a cocky, anti-authority figure, to being a cocky, anti-authority figure in a police uniform.  And he's not the only one to undergo such development.  The woman who speaks quietly learns to shout; the fat guy who can't do self-defence beats up some innocent people; the slut settles down; the butch woman learns to love; the clumsy weed does something slightly unclumsy; the guy who makes noises learns to carry on making noises; the guy who loves guns continues to love guns; and the big tall guy stays at about the same height.  Okay, so those last few weren't allowed to explore the depths of their characters quite so completely.  A true loss to the world of cinema.With characters as feeble as these, the movie can at least be saved by some great jokes.  Which makes it more of a shame that there aren't any.The most off-putting thing about this feeble, laugh-free movie is its attitude towards homosexuality.  Whenever this subject comes up, the innocent tone is lost completely.  When a dog tries to mate with a man's leg he is called a `queer'; when some cadets are sent to a gay bar they find themselves forced to dance and smooch with a threatening bunch of men cloned from half of Village People; the Commandant, who had thought Mahoney was gay because of a particularly puerile gag earlier in the movie, sees him kissing a woman and says `now that's more like it.'  Remember, viewers: these people are to be feared, a moral that suggests this script was written in 1954 and took thirty years to get the green light.  Another darker moment, as out of place as a decent joke, is when one cadet calls the quiet-speaking black woman `a chicaboo'.  Hightower, the big black guy (he's big, geddit?) walks up to the racist cadet and the car he's sitting in, and turns the car onto its roof.  He gets thrown out of the academy.  That's Hightower, not the racist guy.  These scenes reveal a darker and inappropriate side to the movie, which take it from unfunny pap to offensive plop.Inexplicably making tons and tons of money, Police Academy was followed by six sequels, a TV adaptation, and a short-lived animated series.

If John Candy or Bill Murray did Police Academy, they could make it work. Instead Police Academy hired all these crappy no-name actors from nowhere that take the movie nowhere. I was surprised that there was so much hooting and hollering and laughing going on in the theater. I thought that perhaps everyone else was watching something else. I know it is a little too late, but if you haven't seen this dud, avoid at all costs!!",Police Academy
117,ShadySovereign,The wackiest cops you'll ever see!,8,22 January 2006,"I had the opportunity to first see ""Police Academy"" on a movie channel, and I really liked the movie. It had really funny jokes and gags, mostly slapstick and verbal jokes. It also proved that a team of misfit cops-to-be can actually help fight crimes! The great thing about this movie is the humor. The funniness of the film can keep you laughing, and the comedy is very original. It's especially funny to know that each of the police cadets have their own unique crazy ability that gives them advantages over their foes. The characters are very memorable too.The downside of this film is that the climactic scenes at the end seemed to end the movie too fast, since I expected more crime-fighting. But since this was the first movie, I guess the film-makers didn't think too much about villainous characters. They probably just wanted to keep the movie as it was, with good clean comedy. The other downside is that there are extremely terrible sequels that follow. A word of warning: NEVER WATCH THE SEQUELS OF THIS MOVIE.Overall, the movie was hilarious and fun. Watch it when you need to be cheered up on a bad day. I guarantee that you'll be happy after viewing it.I give this movie an 8/10.",Police Academy

Okay it's not Oscar winning quality, no but it's one of those films with a certain 'appeal'. Yes it did brandish six more sequels which went downhill in quality! But the original is the best. It's genuinely funny and unlike the many to follow it has adult humour. It's probably best viewed after midnight for maximum pleasure. This brings a real mix of the 'finest' raw recruits desperate to be police officers, pick of the bunch would be Mahoney signing up with the intention to get booted out! or there's ex-florist and huge mantle Hightower, who could end all crime himself! There's the womanising George Martin. The excellent Lesley Barbara, gun mad Tackleberry etc led by the madcap Lt. Harris and his dominating matrix Lt. Calahan, who are ably watched by the bumbling Commandant Lassard. A hooker running loose on the campus, a huge riot, not to forget Blanks and Copeland and of course the BLUE OYSTER bar!

119,Quinn-5,A Good Movie...,7,16 February 1999,"""Police Academy"" has some good lines and great bits, no doubt about it. In fact, G.W. Bailey's Lt. Harris is one of my all-time favorite comedic villains, and his clashes with Steve Guttenberg's Carey Mahoney are just pure fun. The completely unbelievable rioters towards the end (the hundreds of low income urban white guys on a rioting rampage) exhibit some bad casting, but what film is without fault? Besides, this is a slapstick comedy of the 80's era. And c'mon, Robert Folk's marches for this film (heard most prominently at the beginning) should be considered one of Hollywood's most enjoyable themes in the world of movie scoring.However, what should've been a ruby in director Hugh Wilson's crown as one of his earliest movie-making achievements, the film losses a lot of its charm with the knowledge of the bastard children it would go on to spawn. The ""Police Academy"" sequels have become somewhat notorious as being the very essense of what makes a bad sequel really bad. Each one became gradually poorer in writing and casting, especially in writing. Each one demonstrates the true desperateness of the cast as the more employable actors left (well, more employable ACTOR, if he can even be called that: Steve Guttenberg). In each sequel, the supporting cast for the most part return, like glutoness, yet starving, stray dogs. Like a drunk vagrant dancing and singing for quarters, Tackleberry is still the big crazy guy who likes guns, Jones the whacky black guy who makes sounds, and Callhan, the chick with the big breasts. And by the way, Groundhog Dave is one of those cast members, I think....hs words read like the back cover of Police Academy 6....",Police Academy

121,LostInFilmUK,Perfect old school comedy,10,17 February 2013,"Story/Plot - The year is 1984 and the mayoress has removed set personal criteria form the requirements to join the police force. No longer is sex, weight, height and orientation a factor. This now allows for an insurgence of people applying. The Police Academy series follows a select group of misfits in their quest to become police men and women.The first film of which this review covers follows these misfits in their time at the Police Academy. The main focus is on a petty criminal called Mahoney. Mahoney is busted for criminal damage and as punishment is forced to go to Police Academy. Mahoney initially feels that this isn't the right place for him and he makes it his mission to be thrown out as he is not allowed to quit.As the classes go by and the training exercises are played out, Mahoney soon realises that he is actually enjoying the academy and does want to become a police officer.We are also introduced to the gun maniac Tackelberry, the very tall Hightower, voluptuos Callahan, squeaky Hooks, human beat box and sound effects master Jones and the ever confuzzled Commandant Lassard.This group become good friends and become the base for the rest of the series of films.My verdict - This is one of my favorite film series ever. I have watched these films a few too many times but I love them. I will always recommend Police Academy to anyone who wants a good laugh but to see a good film as well. Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall, GW Bailey, Bubba Smith, Donovan Scott, George Gaines, David Graf, Lesley Easterbrook and Michael Winslow create the main cast and are all prefect in their characters.

I'm glad Michael Winslow is staying with the movie contract! (As quite a few others have left). Favorite scenes. A: I like the scene of Carey Mahoney teaching Moses Hightower, to drive approximately 2:45 A.M. to 3:00 A.M. B: Larvell Jones' two gun imitating, first, in handcuffs next to Mahoney, he exasperated the patrol, it is so hilarious, almost causing the telephone call, to be disconnected! And in Commandant Lassard's police car, during the riot! I also like the scene of Jones' trick of imitating a electric megaphone to get Mahoney out of class & also ""calls Lieutenant Harris, to the Firing Squad""! C: Leslie Barbera got his 'revenge' on those that threw him & the Kodak camera street-room over the bridge, at the early opening & during the riot, he sees them again, but jumped to a wrong conclusion, seeing them take items out of a house. Leslie Barbera used jui-jitsu & overcomes all of them, just to learn what they had was theirs, all the time. 63x927is58401.",Police Academy
123,jon_carlson-28953,Mildly Amusing At Best,4,11 March 2020,"The ""Police Academy"" franchise is considered perhaps the most dismal of any series of films with 3+ sequels. Upon viewing the original, which is considered the best, one need not wonder why.This piece of mediocrity from 1984 tries and fails miserably to have something for everyone by cramming as many jokes and quirky characters into 1 hr and 40 mins as possible. At best they achieve a chuckle, at worst aggravating confusion.The plot is a familiar one. Some good natured oddballs attempt to achieve a goal while fighting an antagonistic bunch of authoritarian squares. The goal here is to make it through police academy. And it's all one note characters and jokes the whole way. Steve Guttenberg tries to be too cool for school funny. Michael Winslow makes noises = funny (and actually is on occasion). Bubba Smith is tall, therefore funny. This one's fat, that one's clumsy, this one has large breasts. Hardy har har!This is maybe one of the most mediocre comedies I've ever seen. And what makes it worse is that it has a decent premise. And is poorly executed. How this movie is so loved is beyond my understanding... I won't deny I laughed a few times, but once roughly every ten minutes isn't enough for something that's supposed to be a comedy.Skip it. 4/10.",Police Academy

If you are analysing Police Academy (not Ghandi, Schindler's List or even Goodfellas) in those terms then you should lighten up, fool. It's a film that doesn't deal with serious issues. It's a comedy. Do you go to pantomimes and analyse the mise-en-scene?Anyway, personal beefs aside, Police Academy 1 is highly amusing. Head up horse's backside...the whole megaphone / shoe polish thing... amusing stereotypes but not offensive enough for the same actors to play the same roles four times in a row (at least). If you liked American Pie 2 then you'll like this, unless you thought American Pie 2 was homophobic or tasteless, in which case avoid it like the plague. For one, I found both films funny and didn't watch them in the style of a Daily Mail reader.

But it made me realize just how much of an original film the first installment was. I still like watching this, the one movie, that set off a whole series not just of sequels but also of very bad comedies with the word ""Academy"" in their titles. And the reason this could happen was that this film actually had a bucket full of very funny moments. Yes, I fondly remember the training session during which Cadet Hooks turned an arrest into a hold-up, because of her nervousness. Or when it turned out, what kind of bar the ""Blue Oyster"" actually is (a joke that was already dead, when the first sequel picked it up). Or when Michael Winslow started showing his sound imitation talents at a police station. A lot of this is really bad, but there's enough good stuff here to make it just the movie you want to see on a nice evening at home with the guys.

Judge each film in it's own right. Then you will be able to appreciate these examples of fine comedy. This, the first, is by far and away the best.

No way this movie could be made in today's time. It had more natural diversity, not the stuff Disney Star Wars tries cramming down your throat.A little good harmless 80's nudity. Nothing crazy or overboard. Which still confuses me, John Wick can have graphic shootouts, peeling peoples caps left and right, stabbings, you get it, but regular tv still can't show nudity. Not sex, just nudity.Steve Gutenberg should have kept with the series. All the characters are hilarious in their own ways. The Blue Oyster bar scenes always confused me as a little kid when this movie came out. Watching it now is freaking hilarious! And the 2 goons that were victim to accidentally stumble into the smbd establishment, both played their roles great.Ahead of its time, it's just been amazing watching comedy evolve (for better and worse) over the years. Police Academy is hard to beat when it comes to the low-brow humor game. Movies like Stripes and Super Troopers are up there in this genre of comedy. BUT, just in my opinion the comedy writing before the turn of the century was more polished and well rounded. Felt more organic. Better acting!

Of course Blanks and Copeland walking into the Blue Oyster bar deserves immortality. The joke was so good they put it in the 2nd or 3rd movie again. It was worth it just for the great tango music.

160,reviewsbyaledh,My favourite film series ever,10,7 April 2011,"The year is 1984 and the mayoress has removed set personal criteria form the requirements to join the police force. No longer is sex, weight, height and orientation a factor. This now allows for an insurgence of people applying. The Police Academy series follows a select group of misfits in their quest to become police men and women.The first film of which this review covers follows these misfits in their time at the Police Academy. The main focus is on a petty criminal called Mahoney. Mahoney is busted for criminal damage and as punishment is forced to go to Police Academy. Mahoney initially feels that this isn't the right place for him and he makes it his mission to be thrown out as he is not allowed to quit.As the classes go by and the training exercises are played out, Mahoney soon realises that he is actually enjoying the academy and does want to become a police officer.We are also introduced to the gun maniac Tackelberry, the very tall Hightower, voluptuous Callahan, squeaky Hooks, human beat box and sound effects master Jones and the ever confuzzled Commandant Lassard.This group become good friends and become the base for the rest of the series of films.Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall, GW Bailey, Bubba Smith, Donovan Scott, George Gaines, David Graf, Lesley Easterbrook and Michael Winslow create the main cast and are all prefect in their characters. I can not fault them at all.I will always recommend Police Academy to anyone who wants a good laugh but to see a good film as well.Written by Aled from aledh.co.uk - Reviews by Aled, Ash and Darren",Police Academy
161,markadopieralski,Good 80s comedy,9,20 October 2021,"Many reviews on here do not seem to get 80s humor, that's fine you can go watch your awful late night ""comedians"" and the rest of us will enjoy actual comedy.",Police Academy
162,maguidominguez-26564,Why.,2,31 July 2020,"I refuse to believe audiences enjoyed this movie for a reason other than the constant flashing of breasts.The movie sacrificies proper rhythm, characters and tone for the sake of packing in as many jokes as possble, which is a perfectly vslid route to take. The problem is that most of the jokes miss, sometimes in such a way that it's like a succession of tidal waves of pure cringe, washing over you one after another. The characters act illogically and change motivations and aspects of their personality from one scene to the other with zero rhyme or reason to the point where it's frustrating to watch.As a side note, and I say it without an ounce of exaggeration, the latin-american Spanish dub it's absolutely dreadful. It makes any funny scene this movie has in its original language get the funny completely sucked out of it.",Police Academy
163,j03hornetsjc24,Anyone know the song that is played in the Blue Oyster bar ???,10,7 September 2005,"I'm looking for the song when the 2 guys get taken into the bar and dances with these gay guys. It plays right when the Captain gets jerked by the gay guy and is made to dance. Please any help would be grateful! I got information on this a long time ago but lost it somehow. If anyone knows the music I'm talking about please either respond on here or e-mail me.Jason Thanks!ps: If it is available on CD, please include the album information as well as the song titleOnce again thanks!",Police Academy
164,amb6287,Classic comedy that's still funny,7,12 September 2005,"This movie is one of the best comedies of the 80s. It's a great ensemble comedy in the tradition of Caddyshack. Steve Guttenberg is hilarious and Michael Winslow's ""human sound machine"" abilities are amazing. The movie features a sexy Kim Cattrall long before ""Sex and the City"" and a fantastic cast of supporting characters.Yes, it's a bit silly, but everyone needs to be silly sometimes. Some material may be inappropriate for small children, but Policy Academy is a must-see for older kids and adults who like to laugh.The sequels go downhill and are more of the same, but #2 and #3 are still worth renting.",Police Academy
