0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not John Hughes' best, but not bad, in fact it is quite entertaining",7,24 November 2010,"I do not think Weird Science is John Hughes' best film, but it is a decent enough film that did entertain me. It is too short however, and the humour occasionally is rather crass. However, I loved the concept, it was original and I think it worked rather well. The film looks good too, the scenery and cinematography are typical Hughes which is a good thing in itself, while the soundtrack is cool. While the humour is crass, there are some funny moments and some inspired wit in the script, while the pacing and direction are fine. The acting is good enough as well. Anthony Michael Hall Ilan Mitchell-Smith are likable leads, while Bill Paxton gives the best performance and Kelly LeBrock is smouldering. Also look out for Robert Downey Jnr in this. Overall, not bad, not amazing but it entertains. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Weird Science
1,bkoganbing,Amusement and Pleasure,7,1 May 2017,"The wish dream of every nerdy kid in America came true when John Hughes brought out Weird Science for the movie going public. Just imagine being able to create via a computer a Kelly LeBrock for your own amusement and pleasure. That's what Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell Smith do on his PC. Remember personal computers at the time were still fairly new and it wasn't everyone who had one. So at Smith's home the guys create a perfect woman in a virtual world. But some crossed wires bring Kelly LeBrock to life in their world. Those same crossed wires also bring about some other things in Weird Science.In the supporting cast some credit has to go to Bill Paxton playing the older brother to Smith, a jock/ROTC type straight from some military school who torments the younger.Smith and takes his own pleasure in it. What LeBrock and her magic circuits do to him is screamingly funny. Let's say his inner self finally bursts forth.After 30 years this brat pack comedy is still very funny.",Weird Science
2,Leofwine_draca,Weird is the word,5,12 September 2015,"WEIRD SCIENCE is an odd and unique little comic fantasy movie from the ubiquitous John Hughes, although his scripting isn't as assured here as in his more well remembered classics from the decade. In fact, WEIRD SCIENCE has something of a scattershot approach to the material; it feels a little like WAR GAMES at the outset, before turning into the usual teen 'ideal woman' fantasy scenario and then into a bizarre action comedy in the second half.I wasn't too fussed about this film if I'm honest. One of the biggest problems I have with the film is that the two central characters act like a couple of jerks and were completely unsympathetic to me. Half the film seems to consist of them sitting around and arguing in the toilet and it all feels rather stale and uninteresting. The goofy fantasy stuff is better; Kelly LeBrock is having a ball as the 'ideal woman' and has probably never been better in her career. Still, Bill Paxton should have been asked to tone it down a bit, because he's WAY over the top here.After a rather dull first half, things pick up with the introduction of a house party that pretty much takes up the whole second half of the movie. There are some wonderful cameos from Vernon Wells (playing his character from MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR) and Michael Berryman that prove to be the highlight of the whole thing. There are plenty of jokes here too, many of them feeling forced but some hitting the spot. I'd class WEIRD SCIENCE as an interesting failure rather than an all-out cult classic, though.",Weird Science
3,SnoopyStyle,Loving this 80s comedy,8,15 August 2014,"Gary Wallace (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are hopeless dorks dreaming of classmates Deb (Suzanne Snyder) and Hilly (Judie Aronson). Their douchy boyfriends Ian (Robert Downey Jr.) and Max (Robert Rusler) keep bullying them. Wyatt's parents are going off leaving his older bully brother Chet (Bill Paxton) in charge. After watching Frankenstein, Gary gets Wyatt to use his computer to simulate a girl. They break into a restricted system and create Lisa (Kelly LeBrock). She's got the brains, the body, and the guts to push the guys to be cooler than they could ever hope to be.It's hard to justify loving this movie so much. It's a nerd fantasy that John Hughes is tapping into. It has everything that a film critic hates. It's stupid, crude, and really stupid. It's just funny and the guys are adorably geeky. The fact is that the guys are lovable and Kelly LeBrock is perfect for this role. She's smart, ballsy, and sexy.",Weird Science
4,Prismark10,Weird Science,6,15 August 2021,"Weird Science is an odd surreal teenage fantasy from John Hughes.Gary Wallace (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are high school nerds. They lust after the school beauties Deb and Hilly but realise they have no chance trying to chat them up.The girls prefer the company of school jocks Ian (Robert Downey Jr) and Max (Robert Rusler) who bully Gary and Wyatt.The sexually frustrated teens manage to conjure up their perfect woman by punching in some data into their home computer and a freak electrical storm creates sexy Lisa (Kelly LeBrock.)Lisa is a knockout, she changes the boys outlook.

However things go awry when the boys show of their power to Iand and Max.Hughes has mixed the Bride of Frankenstein with movies like Porkys and Risky Business. He also adds a lot of 80s British pop music.It's zany fun but also inconsequential. It was made at a period when John Hughes was a one man film industry for American teenagers and it needed several redrafts of the script.",Weird Science
5,kosmasp,Back in the day ...,8,16 October 2020,"The 80s ... you gotta love the different Science Fiction elements movies had back then. Either gloomy and dark outlook, or like this a more funny approach to it all. Although you should probably not compare this to other movies. This is so over the top and makes almost no sense by normal standards ... you shouldn't even think about them! Maybe one of the few things that are relatable to some, is that teenage boys get anxious, when near girls/women! Especially in compromising situations - like in the shower.So if you don't mind that and can suspend your disbelief or even if you've seen this either in the 80s or when you were the right age ... you'll love it. If you take it too seriously, there will be no fun for you though! So decide what you want and act accordingly.",Weird Science
6,lee_eisenberg,"it was undeniably weird at the time; nowadays, a lot of it looks questionable",5,7 October 2021,"A few years ago, Molly Ringwald wrote an article (I don't remember which publication) in which she described watching one of her '80s movies and nowadays finding the gender relations unpleasant. It makes perfect sense that something from decades ago looks regressive to us in the 21st century. I guess that's the point of media literacy.Which brings us to ""Weird Science"". I have no doubt that this is every teenage boy's fantasy. What's questionable is not just the depiction of hopeless romantics who want a hot babe - I will admit that Lisa is a real looker - but also the casual use of homophobic language.Whether it's ""M*A*S*H"", ""Animal House"" or ""Revenge of the Nerds"", pretty much any old movie where people make their own rules ends up looking unpleasant in later years. I bet that some current productions will look questionable in years to come.Other than that, ""Weird Science"" does have some funny scenes. I particularly liked the interaction between Lisa and Gary's parents.",Weird Science
7,jboothmillard,Weird Science,4,15 February 2009,"From writer/director John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off) I had a vague idea of what this film consisted of, and I was pretty close. Basically two nerdy teenage boys, Gary Wallace (The Breakfast Club's Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are desperate to be liked, and of course sex-obsessed, and in their desperation (inspired by watching - a coloured version of - Frankenstein, 1931) they decide to create the perfect woman. They weren't counting on the computer gaining so much power it would actually make their woman a reality, but it happens, and Lisa (Kelly LeBrock) is determined to help them have a good time. Lisa, who can get absolutely anything she wants (e.g. expensive cars, mutant bikers to appear) has a purpose to turn them into men by putting them in a couple of situations to boost their confidence, and they are on the road to becoming accepted by others. Of course it is at the big party (they always wanted) they meet the girls they would have always wanted, and Lisa's job is done. Also starring Bill Paxton as Chet Donnelly, Suzanne Snyder as Deb, Judie Aronson as Hilly, young Robert Downey Jr. as Ian, Robert Rusler as Max, Commando's Vernon Wells as Lord General, Britt Leach as Al Wallace, Barbara Lang as Lucy Wallace, Ivor Barry as Henry Donnelly, Ann Coyle as Carmen Donnelly and the original Hills Have Eyes' Michael Berryman as Mutant Biker. LeBrock is obviously very attractive, and there are one or two amusing moments, but the comedy is pretty crass, but it was interesting to see younger Paxton and especially future star Downey, Jr. in a film of this sort. It was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Okay!",Weird Science
8,Woodyanders,Probably the craziest movie made by John Hughes in the 1980's,8,1 March 2018,"Meek and socially inept computer geeks Gary Wallace (an excellent and engaging portrayal by Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (a likable performance by Ilan-Michael Smith) get more than they bargained for when they create the perfect woman in the form of Lisa (delightfully played with winning saucy charm and aplomb by the drop-dead gorgeous Kelly LeBrock), who turns their heretofore staid existences upside down. Writer/director John Hughes really lets it all hang out: The enjoyably off-the-wall story zips along at a breathless frantic pace, the zany humor occasionally reaches surreal heights of inspired lunacy, and the major big bash set piece is positively hysterical. Although Hughes eschews his trademark adolescent angst in favor of infectiously go-for-broke wackiness, he nonetheless brings a sweet surplus of pure heart to the proceedings by having Lisa give Gary and Wyatt valuable life lessons in self-worth and self-confidence. Moreover, it's acted with zest by an enthusiastic cast: Bill Paxton almost steals the entire picture with his gloriously obnoxious turn as Wyatt's overbearing older brother Chet, Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Rusler smarm it up well as a couple of jerky bullies, and Suzanne Snyder and Jodi Aronson make for fetching and appealing love interests. Vernon Wells and Michael Berryman have funny minor roles as a pair of punk thug party crashers. An absolute hoot.",Weird Science
9,Tweekums,"'So, what would you little maniacs like to do first?'",8,28 November 2016,"Gary and Wyatt are a couple of geeky fifteen year old high school students and they have no chance of getting girlfriends; especially the two they really fancy who are currently dating a couple of more popular boys. Then, while watching Frankenstein on television, Gary gets an idea if they can't get girls the normal way why don't they just make one! After loading the computer with details of their perfect woman they find themselves looking at a beautiful woman, which they later name Lisa; and she is all theirs. They may now have this beauty but they still don't really know what to do. She however is determined to give them a good time whether they like it or not. She takes them out for a night on the town. Later she throws a party at Wyatt's house, inviting just about everybody inevitably things get out of hand and Gary and Wyatt are forced to make a stand.This is something different to John Hughes usual films; we have the usual teen protagonists trying to fit in in '80s America but we also have some rather wacky elements. The way they create Lisa was funny in a ridiculous way a way that some viewers may find embarrassingly silly. The characters lacked the depth of those in most of Hughes's films making them less sympathetic. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith are good enough as Gary and Wyatt but it is Kelly LeBrock's performance as Lisa that hold the film together; she manages to be seductive, with just a hint of danger and a wicked sense of humour. She also has one of the best introductions of any film character with her line 'So, what would you little maniacs like to do first?'. The special effects are a bit ropey by today's standards and things do get a little over the top towards then end but that doesn't matter as it is still funny. The ending is a bit cliché but again it manages to be fun and even manages to include a nice little car chase. Overall I found this film to be quite a lot better than I expected and recommend it to fans of the '80s.",Weird Science
10,BA_Harrison,"Something in leather, or rubber, or barbed wire?",9,27 June 2017,"Teenagers Gary and Wyatt (Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are high school losers, never made it with a lady, so they stick bras on their heads, hook up their computer to a Barbie doll, hack into a mainframe for more processing power and create their perfect woman, Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), who tells them how to walk this way and talk this way. Before you can say 'teenage nerd wish-fulfilment', the lads are wearing snappy suits, boozing and schmoozing at a blues bar, driving luxury sports cars, and hosting the ultimate house party, before finally finding true love with school babes Hilly and Deb (Judie Aronson More and Suzanne Snyder).Written and directed by John Hughes at the height of his game, Weird Science is pure teenage fantasy, targeted at adolescent boys with raging hormones. As such, the comedy is far from sophisticated, with gags about farts, poop, sex, puking, and underwear. Crass, to be sure, but also very funny if you're a pimply teenager or, like me, an adult whose sense of humour hasn't really matured that much since puberty.Hall and Mitchell-Smith are perfectly cast as luckless dweebs Gary and Wyatt, with Hall, in particular, on fine form, providing the film with some of its funniest moments (his bar room tale about unrequited love is hilarious). LeBrock is great to look at but her performance is wooden (then again, who's to say that a Real-life Barbie doll wouldn't act that way?). Able support is given from the always great Bill Paxton as Wyatt's obnoxious brother Chet, and Robert Rusler and Robert Downey Jr. as bullies Max and Ian, while cult favourites Vernon Wells and Michael Berryman contribute memorable cameos as mutant bikers, who invade Wyatt's home during the film's surreal and very silly soiree (I think that means 'party').8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for Oingo Boingo's incredibly catchy theme song.",Weird Science
11,moonspinner55,Great comic premise gone unrealized...,1,20 May 2006,"John Hughes scraping bottom: two teen boys invent a busty, sexy brunette with their home-computer, resulting in hormone-crazed comic chaos. What might've been a likably goofy slapstick ride has become a tasteless, witless affair aimed at sniggering juveniles. It is far worse than the usual sex-related teen shenanigans, which not even Anthony Michael Hall's affable charm can rescue. Kelly LeBrock, with her pouty lips and deep, guttural laugh, is definitely game, but she's used as a sight-gag, a prop, and Hughes can't even work up a genuine character for her to play. Even for low-rent tastes, the final joke is jaw-dropping. NO STARS from ****",Weird Science
12,paul_haakonsen,"I mean, the next thing you know, you'll be wearing a bra on your head!...",6,11 July 2017,"""Weird Science"" is definitely one of the memorable movies from the 1980's, and it is without a doubt also one of the movies that instantly comes to mind when you think movies from the 1980's. Furthermore, it is a classic in its own right, and it is a movie that you can watch over and over again.The story is about Gary (played by Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (played by Ilan Mitchell-Smith), two high school students without any luck with the women and often at the end of the bullies shenanigans. After seeing a ""Frankenstein"" movie on late night TV, they decide to create their own ideal woman (played by Kelly LeBrock) on the computer. But when their creation takes physical form and becomes a real woman, the two teenagers find that their luck has changed and popularity is just around the bend.When you watch ""Weird Science"" these days you are just amused with the graphics that were used in the movie back in the day. Sure, it was grand and impressive back then. And seeing that is a nostalgic trip back to the glorious 1980's.It is a combination of the storyline, the characters and the cast ensemble that makes the movie stand out so nicely and work so well.The cast list includes Kelly LeBrock which is very much the epitome of the 1980's for many men whom were young adults or adults during the 1980's. But it also has some other impressive appearances, for example Bill Paxton in the hilarious role of Chet, but also Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Rusler as the two high school bullies. Furthermore, there is also some nice appearances by Vernon Wells and Michael Berryman as two bad guys.If you were watching movies during the 1980's, then chances are slim to none that you are not already familiar with this lovable movie. And on the off-chance that you aren't already familiar with ""Weird Science"", then do take the opportunity to sit down and watch it should you get the chance. This is a very enjoyable movie in every way.",Weird Science
13,BandSAboutMovies,Rewatched this,6,17 July 2019,"As John Hughes ruled the 1980's with six films about teens, this was the first time that he moved from some level of realism to complete fantasy. Named after the 1950's EC Comics title - producer Joel Silver even paid for the rights to the name - Weird Science seems on the surface that it's going to be teenage softcore fantasy fulfillment. That's the bright spot of the film. Lisa may have been created on the computer to be the perfect woman, but the perfect woman would have a mind of her own.Gary Wallace (Hughes' avatar in three films, Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (who grew up to be a nerd in the best of ways as a professor and published Dungeons and Dragons author) are the geekiest of the geeks at Shermer High - the fictional school that all Hughes' films emanate from. Their latest humiliation was being pantsed in front of their dream girls Deb (Suzanne Snyder, Killer Klowns from Outer Space) and Hilly (Judie Aronson, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter) by their boyfriends Ian (an incredibly young Robert Downey Jr.) and Max (Robert Rusler, Sometimes They Come Back).Inspired by Universal's Frankenstein, the boys decide to use magic, electricity and a computer to create the perfect woman. A power surge ensures and creates Lisa (Kelly LeBrock, who really was the it girl of my teen years), who has limitless powers and the desire to take our boys and turn them into men. The thing is, she isn't some bimbotastic plastic love doll created simply for their pleasure. That would render this whole movie incredibly stupid. No, she's here to make their lives better.There are so many obstacles in her way: Chet (an incredible Bill Paxton) who makes his brother's life a living hell; the boy's parents and yep, Max and Ian. It all comes to head at a party where a nuclear missile and mutant bikers - yes, that's really Michael Berryman and Vernon Wells - are part of the chaos. It all ends well - Chet ends up getting turned into some form of feces monster while Gary and Wyatt get the girls. And Lisa? She ends up becoming a gym teacher.My only issue with the film is the scene where the boys go to downtown Chicago and hang with a crowd of older black men, talking about the ""eighth-grade that broke his heart."" I realize that this movie was made in 1985, but even then, it completely took me out of the movie. I still have no idea why it remains.Weird Science was memorable enough to lead to a 1994 to 1998 TV series version. A remake was announced, but that thankfully never made it to the screen.",Weird Science
14,studioAT,Weak John Hughes film,2,25 October 2017,"This is another of those daft comedies that John Hughes was able to churn out with alarming ease.Borrowing heavily from the 'Frankenstein' story, this is about two teen boys creating the perfect woman via a computer, and of course she then comes to life and teaches them a lot about life etc.Apart from a good central performance from Anthony Michael Hall this film in my opinion is not worth recommending.",Weird Science

16,Scarecrow-88,Weird Science,7,9 August 2009,"WEIRD SCIENCE is a celebration of the incredible sexiness of Kelly LeBrock and the fact that director-writer John Hughes FINALLY gave Anthony Michael Hall the starring role he had sure deserved. The usual high school hi-jinx are on display with plenty of teen sex jokes, except unlike past John Hughes comedies, this has elements of science-fiction and the supernatural. I think the movie works so well because of the marvelous chemistry between Michael Hall, Ilan Mitchell-Smith(..as Hall's nerdy pal, Wyatt)and LeBrock. The Frankenstein idea of how Michael Hall and Mitchell-Smith is merely playing on our teenage fantasies..I know when I was a youth that LeBrock was certainly a fixture in my pleasant dreams during puberty! LeBrock was in her element, positively a knock-out, with a confidence(..and figure)and swagger that I'm sure had many a gal jealous. She's ideally cast as the fantasy babe, but Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith compliment her very well as our dorky heroes. Bill Paxton steals his scenes as Mitchell-Smith's goofy, crude, bullying brother, Chet.This film stretches the PG-13 rating to the limit and features pretty coarse dialogue and situations for a movie aimed at teens. After all is said and done, the movie's message is similar to other stories penned by the late John Hughes..thanks in part to (im)proper guidance, the nerdy boys find guts to stand up for themselves while wooing lovely girls(Suzanne Snyder and Judie Aronson) in the process. Robert Rusler and Robert Downey Jr(..two years before hitting paydirt with LESS THAN ZERO)are the two popular high schoolers who pick on Michael Hall and Mitchell-Smith and desire to get a shot at LeBrock. Vernon Wells and Michael Berryman are among these fictional Mad Max type bikers who interrupt our heroes' big party(..created by LeBrock as a means for Mitchell-Smith and Michael Hall to prove themselves in front of their peers).Memorable scenes include Michael Hall and Mitchell-Smith's shower with a naked LeBrock, the trio's trip to a juke joint, LeBrock's ""freezing"" Mitchell-Smith's grandparents, LeBrock's confrontation with Michael Hall's parents, and LeBrock's smooch with Mitchell-Smith(..this left an indelible mark on me as I, like other males in our teens, put myself in his shoes). LeBrock wears some wild costumes and has big hair at times, but is she a stunner.",Weird Science
17,grantss,Quite silly - not up to John Hughes' usual standards,3,31 May 2016,"Two teenage boys, Gary Wallace (played by Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith), are struggling socially. Girls aren't attracted to them and boys bully and embarrass them. Lack of girlfriends leads them to try to create their own woman, Frankenstein-style but with a computer rather than body parts. Their experiment proves successful and their perfect woman is created, Lisa (Kelly LeBrock). She helps them gain popularity and confidence, but also gets them into some dangerous situations.Written and directed by John Hughes, the man who cornered the market on teen comedy-dramas in the 1980s. He directed and wrote classics such as The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Sixteen Candles and wrote Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful. This is not in the same league as any of those, not even close. Silly, largely unfunny and quite juvenile. While his best movies were teen-orientated they still had great sensitivity, drama and gravitas, and a reasonably clever sense of humour. This does not. It's pretty much the worst kind of teen movie - random plot, bizarre, pointless high jinks, cheesy comedy.",Weird Science
18,Boba_Fett1138,One of the best teenage '80's comedies.,8,20 February 2010,"Looking back, it might very well be true that the '80's was the best decade for comedy. It had some of the biggest comedy stars at their prime at the time and some capable directors, with experience in- and love for the genre, such as in this case John Hughes.Not only was John Hughes just a great comedy director, he specifically was also one who made some great movies for teenagers and he really seemed to connect with his audience. He knew what teenagers wanted for a movie and what issues were on their minds and needed to be handled within a movie. Lots of film-makers just don't connect that well with its teenage-audience, simply thinking that what they put in their movies is what they want to see. It's the reason why there simply aren't any good teenage comedies these days anymore it seems, with the exception of the American Pie-series and a couple of other recent movies like that out there.John Hughes always claimed he wrote this script only in 2 days. And yes, I do believe this. I'm glad it got only written in 2 days, fore if the movie had gotten written in a couple of months or so, Hughes would had probably attempted to let the movie and its story make more sense and would had probably put a more clear main plot line in the movie, giving the overall movie also some more purpose. But I just simply love the movie for not doing this. The movie often just simply doesn't attempt to make any sense and it's all some big fun non-sense. The movie now is basically just the one fun and crazy event after the other.Yes, in all truth this really was one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. The characters, the events, the premise, it's all so much fun to watch and the movie basically has no slow or dull moment in it.It's also a movie in which the main characters are actually being played by some real teenagers. A movie always deserves some extra points for that. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith play some teenage characters everybody should be able to relate with. What's on their minds is girls, popularity and sex. Basically all the things real teenage boys used to think about. It was also fun to watch some now famous actors in this movie, in some of their more early roles. Bill Paxton is greatly fun as the prick, military, brother and Robert Downey Jr. also shows up in a quite big early role as one of the school bullies.It's a movie with some great comedy pace and timing in it. Added to this are some good and fun characters and situations and you basically have a great, fun comedy already. John Hughes' qualities as a director probably made this movie work out better than it had the right to and he also makes this one a great one that still connects to a lot of teenagers out there.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Weird Science
19,view_and_review,A Fantastic Creation,6,26 July 2019,"I have a nostalgic fondness of this movie. It is a pure fantasy. What better fantasy can a teenage boy have other than having a beautiful woman at his beck and call? And she can materialize things such as clothes and cars! That is a dream come true. She was the technological version of I Dream of Jeanie.As a premise this movie was stellar but the execution was lousy. It's like the writers used all of their creative juices to come up with the idea and had nothing left for a good movie. Of all the things that could have been done with and by Lisa (Kelly LeBrock) I felt they underutilized her.Lisa's sole goal was to get Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) to realize their own self-worth and for others to see it as well. Now get this: she does this by giving them stylish clothes, stylish cars, herself as a tool, and a huge party with booze and babes. In other words, she used all of the materialistic things that shallow people would be attracted to in order for these shallow people to see Gary and Wyatt's true value. Wouldn't a better point be that those attracted to people because of these things aren't worth having as friends??? That would have made more sense to me.So, my rating is based solely on the dream scenario. Kelly LeBrock is an 80's version of Angelina Jolie. Even as an adult I can completely see the value in Gary and Wyatt's creation. Lisa was a creation that men of all ages would fawn over and/or pay mightily for.",Weird Science

Hot damn!! Their perfect woman is Kelly Le Brock, who wouldn't necessarily be my choice, but she'll do.John Hughes was on a roll with his teen comedy genre, and this film preserves the memorable performances of Anthony Michael Hall and a young Bill Paxton as the world's most obnoxious older brother.Grade: B",Weird Science
21,Uriah43,Science in the 80's,7,22 March 2019,"This film involves two high school nerds by the names of ""Gary Wallace"" (Anthony Michael Hall) and ""Wyatt Donnelly"" (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) who desperately want to date some of the local females. Unfortunately, none of the local high school girls want anything to do with them. So one night the idea occurs to them to create a woman using Wyatt's sophisticate computer to hack into a top-secret Air Force database. Much to their surprise-and due in large part to certain weather related atmospherics-a beautiful woman they name ""Lisa"" (Kelly LeBrock) appears out of the smoke and tells them she will do whatever they want. Needless to say, their lives change dramatically from that point on. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that this was one of the better comedies to come out of the 80's with both Anthony Michael Hall and Kelly LeBrock turning in pretty good performances in the process. I especially liked the scene at the seedy nightclub called ""The Kandy Bar"" which, although a little vulgar, was absolutely hilarious. In any case, those viewers interested in a comedy of this sort might find this enjoyable and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Weird Science

Pity it forgot to be funny, since this over produced and under written comedy/fantasy settles for being heavy handed and sanctimonious, with far too much humiliation and destruction, to the point you just want someone involved(director John Hughes?) to get control over this train wreck.Good comedy premise thrown away, despite a few amusing bits.",Weird Science

They are indeed successful, but their creation 'Lisa' has a bit more spunk than they could have hoped for and this provides some very funny moments and scenes.  This movie is a great 80's comedy and features cool music and a rather good cast.  Kelly LeBrock is great as Lisa, but my favorite character has to be Chet, played brilliantly by Bill Paxton. Every scene he is in is very funny and worth the watch.  The movie though is packed with funny scene after funny scene.  Of particular interest to anyone who likes the movie ""The Road Warrior"" is the scene where the bikers crash the party.  I do believe the lead biker is in fact the same one from that movie.

24,Sylviastel,Not that bad!,6,13 May 2006,"This was not one of John Hughes' greatest successes. Supposedly, the film critics trashed this film. But you know what, it's worth watching. Kelly LeBrock plays the model that Anthony Michael Hall's character and his friend create from a computer. They live in suburban Chicago of course which is one of John Hughes' trademarks is to set most of his films in his beloved city. Anyway, his friends' parents go away for the weekend. Once Kelly's role is created, they want to get girls and be popular rather than be humiliated by the lights of Robert Downey Jr. who is also in this film as one of the popular dudes from their high school. The film could have been better but it could have been a lot worse by today's standards too. The film works because you can watch the silliness and chuckle at some of the scenes in it. It's not award-winning stuff, it's kids' stuff. LEt the kids today watch and judge for themselves. I'm not saying that adults can't enjoy it. I do to this day. So if you want to escape from depressing reality, watch this John Hughes' film. It will at least make you smile.",Weird Science
25,trashgang,boring,4,7 January 2014,"Mmmmmmm, high ratings for a comedy, must be good but up to today's standards it looks ridiculous. I had never seen it before because when it came out I was at the end of my teens and was already into horror but the story always attracted me due being based on Frankenstein, and by doing they added a lot of screenshots from the Universal classic (1931).But I must say that I never laughed it out loud . I was more watching it for other reasons and no you are wrong, not for Kelly Lebrock (Lisa) in her sexy outfit. This is one of the earlier flicks with Robert Downey Jr. with his other teeth. You know what I mean when you are going to watch it. Michael Berryman is also to spot as a biker, you know him from The Hills Have Eyes (1977). The jokes are really stupid and so predictable that for me it was all a bad joke. Didn't like it at all but it must be me because it even spawned a series (1994). A classic, not for me.

It happily marries the Frankenstein legend with the ubiquitous teen sex comedy and some of the dialogue is pure joy. It's odd that I almost always think of this movie as Anthony Michael Hall's spotlight (he's usually the scene stealer), but Kelly LeBrock manages to hold her own; far more than just eye candy, she flexes her own comedic chops.Part of what makes this enjoyable for me is that my spouse can recite the drunk scene from heart, which means that I'm still laughing even when the movie's not on. To me, it's the best scene of the movie because everyone involved is hilarious. This could've been your average horny distraction, but there's decency and lessons of self-confidence contained herein, and Ms. LeBrock is just the right teacher.",Weird Science
28,JamesHitchcock,So wet you could shoot ducks off him,4,17 January 2015,"What do you get if you use a computer to design a perfect woman, taking your inspiration from old Playboy magazines, and then connect your computer up to a Barbie doll during an electric storm? The answer, according to this film, is that you get a girl who looks like Kelly LeBrock! And that was in 1985. Just think what you might get today when computers are so much more powerful.Gary Wallace and Wyatt Donnelly are two nerdish Chicago high school students. They are also unpopular with their male classmates and are picked on by the school bullies. Wyatt is also picked on by his unpleasant older brother Chet. Although they are only fifteen, however, their main obsession is their inability to find girlfriends. Inspired by an old Frankenstein movie, they try to remedy this problem by performing the aforementioned experiment and are greeted by the emergence from the bathroom of a beautiful young woman clad only in a T-shirt and pair of panties. Despite being only a few seconds old, the young lady, whom they name Lisa, is much more worldly-wise than Gary and Wyatt, and also has magical powers.Now the film doesn't simply end at this point with Lisa becoming Gary and Wyatt's girlfriend. Quite apart from the jealousy that such a ménage-a-trois would be likely to give rise to, there is also the problem that, despite her extreme youth, Lisa has the appearance of a woman in her mid-twenties, and even in the eighties a plot in which Kelly LeBrock becomes the lover of a pair of underage teenagers would not have found favour with the moral majority. (Today it would probably be banned as kiddie porn). So she becomes a fairy godmother who uses her powers to help the boys with their struggling love lives. By the end of the film, they have managed to lure away the former girlfriends of the two class bullies. (Unfortunately, neither girl is as attractive as Lisa, and the film does not really delve into whether their appalling taste in men actually makes them worth having).Actually, there seems to be a perfectly simple explanation for the duo's lack of success with girls. Gary, as played by Anthony Michael Hall, is so wet you could shoot ducks off him. As for Ilan Mitchell-Smith's Wyatt, shall I just say that the girls are probably looking for someone a bit more manly than a boy whose voice still hasn't broken in his mid- teens and who has a penchant for wandering round the house in women's underwear? The film might prefer the alternative explanation that the boys simply lack confidence, but to me they just came across as a pair of dreary wimps.The one really good performance comes from Bill Paxton as the obnoxious Chet, and LeBrock, a model who had previously only appeared in one feature film (""The Woman in Red""), does more than merely rely upon her good looks. (If only I could say the same of all models who have tried their hand at acting!) Overall, however, the film struck me as a failure, for two main reasons apart from the wimpishness of its male leads. The first has to do with the way the character of Lisa was conceived. She came across as far too self-assured and omnipotent, and did far too much to help the boys. If the intention was to help them gain confidence, making them so dependent upon an all-powerful fairy godmother seems like a weird way of doing it. It might have been more interesting if she had been fallible with fewer magical powers, initially confused and bewildered at having suddenly been conjured into existence with the body and mind of an adult, and then growing in confidence into a sort of loving big sister, being helped by the boys as well as helping them. At the same time the boys would also grow in confidence as they came to realise that this beautiful woman needed them as much as they needed her. Such a concept, however, might have been a bit too subtle for a movie, like this, subtlety being a concept largely alien to John Hughes who acted as both writer and director.The film's other drawback is that, like a lot of ""teen comedies"", it relies too heavily on puerile or tasteless adolescent humour, with little if any genuine wit. (This was characteristic of eighties teen comedies, ""Drop Dead Fred"" being another classic example, although plenty have been made in a similar vein since). Some of Lisa's tricks seemed very mean-spirited cause and the plot at time seemed bizarre and inexplicable. (Hughes evidently thought that he needed to stress the ""weird"" element in the title). I understand that a remake of ""Weird Science"" is currently under consideration. If that is so, there is a lot of room for improvement on the original. 4/10",Weird Science
29,MovieAddict2016,"""Weird"" is right",6,3 June 2006,"This is a very strange film. On one hand it's perfectly entertaining, but it's so bizarre and - to be blunt - utterly far-fetched and beyond-ridiculous that it actually kind of distracts from the entertainment value at times. The plot is so dumb - and the way it's handled - that suspension of disbelief is pretty hard.However, if you look at it as a realization of every teenage boy's fantasy, I guess it's all right.It's essentially about two 15-year-old boys (Ilan Michael-Smith and Anthony Michael Hall) who ""create"" a woman using electricity, a computer and a Barbie doll.This was my problem with the movie. John Hughes is usually great at character development and dialogue - but there's so little here. The setup is weak and the boys' decision to create a woman is handled waaaay too fast. And then the science behind their actions is ignored so much that it's almost insulting. The ""hacking"" of the computer mainframe that takes place during the Barbie doll's transformation into a human is classic '80s technology - they had no idea what a computer even was back then and as a result the ""hacking"" segment is basically an animated slideshow of cool images on the computer screen as Smith types noisily away on his keyboard.Their result? The beautiful supermodel Kelly LeBrock, who promptly takes a shower with the boys (their clothes are left on, of course, but hers are not) and then teaches them how to be cool, get girlfriends and so on.I was surprised by the amount of sexual content for a 1980s movie involving under-age teens. I've seen people say here on IMDb before that '80s movies couldn't get away with anything but that's not true. It may have been the Reagan era but this movie features 15-year-olds making out with a woman in her late '20s, sexual innuendo involving the woman (it's implied one of the two boys has some type of sexual contact with her during the first night), underage drinking, underage smoking, and then of course a classic scene that could never be filmed today - Anthony Michael Hall mimicking African-Americans in a seedy downtown bar.I don't mean to sound like a prude, I was just shocked at how much they got away with for a 1980s, PG-13 John Hughes comedy.The acting in the movie is decent. Anthony Michael Hall is a revelation, and his scenes as a drunk pimp in downtown Shermer are hilarious. He comes across as a true comical force, which I was surprised at considering he's not usually the leading man in films.On the other hand, Smith is poor - he smiles throughout the movie, even when he's supposed to be scared or angry. Maybe it was his first acting job and he was nervous or in disbelief, but it's kind of annoying.Bill Paxton is responsible for the movie's most memorable scenes. He is utterly hilarious and his scenes were usually the only ones I laughed out loud at.Overall this is one of Hughes' weakest films and it's probably because it was one of his more early directorial works. In terms of character development, ""The Breakfast Club"" reigns supreme. The dialogue isn't that great and the movie is too short and spends too little time with its setup. It's entertaining if you're not looking for anything of substance, but I think if Hughes had tackled this a few years down the road of his career the result would have been a bit more intelligent and memorable.",Weird Science
30,thesar-2,Weird. No Jr.?,7,17 August 2013,"I used to watch Weird Science, and a lot of John Hughes movies as a kid, but I don't recall a ""Robert Downey"" in the mix.With this 8/9/13 viewing, probably the first in 20 years, the focus from me was twofold: the fact that Robert Downy (no Jr.) was so young and he probably had no idea how incredible his stardom would take him once he donned the IRON MAN outfit and that I had an incredible crush on Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) when I was young. So, basically, with this revisit, I focused on those two.Okay, fine, I also wanted to see the gorgeous Kelly LeBrock before she became, well, what she is today. She is such a wonderwoman. What happened to her that she didn't growmore? No, I don't mean her, well, two attributes.I digress. This totally 80s flair film takes virtually no realism and is a ton of fun when you suspend your disbelief. It's a coming of age story in a period of one weekend. It's wildly random at times, and inconsistent, but a lot of fun due to the music, comedy and namely performances from LeBrock and (yeah, being honestly unbiased here) Mitchell-Smith.When watching the wretched 2012's Project X, I always think back to this party movie. While neither is realistic, I would prefer, any day of the week, to watch these ""party animals"" have a good time, than the kids of 2012 destroy their souls.I digress.again. Best buds and nerds, Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt ""create"" their perfect woman from a 1985 com-pu-ter and their dreams are set to come true. Of course, there's a little learning to commence during this and some more comedy when they come out of their shells and get the girl(s.) Real girls, that is.It is interesting with what they could get away with back then, i.e. PG-13 rating. Honestly, it would surely be an R in today's time.Nevertheless, not the best John Hughes movie, but a whole lot of fun for those who grew up with this movie.

31,Cineanalyst,Frankenstein Meets '80s Teen Comedy,4,25 August 2018,"""Weird Science"" is about as daft as Ted Turner's scheme to colorize classic black-and-white films, one of which, ""Frankenstein"" (1931), plays within this film--providing the basis for two teenage boys to create a woman. The jokes are juvenile throughout, which can be humorous in a so-bad-it's-good way. Only the nauseatingly sweet ending spoils the fun.The creation of the boys' fantasy woman is pure nonsense. There's no attempt to depict computers in a coherent or logical fashion. They wear bras on their heads and hook up a Voodoo doll to electrodes. They scan pictures from magazines to develop her, with a picture of Houdini presumably giving her magical powers. This seems to create storm clouds, gusts of wind and the violation of basic laws of physics more reminiscent of ""Poltergeist"" (1982) than the 1931 ""Frankenstein,"" although there's still the bolt of lightning. And their sexpot creation is more genie than monster.Apparently, there was talk a few years ago of remaking this, but I don't think something like this would be made today. Would they even try to get away with a drunk Anthony Michael Hall trying to mimic the speech of African Americans, or using a homophobic slur as the ultimate put-down, or Kelly LeBrock inquiring whether a pair of panties would turn on a 15-year-old boy? I assume, at least, that Universal won't try an ""Overboard"" (2018) type gender-reversal remake. And I doubt they could top such a stupid joke as when LeBrock asks Bill Paxton, ""Why do you have to be such a (slang word for ""one who masturbates"" censored by IMDb)?,"" and he replies, ""Because I get off on it."" Your response to whether or not you find that joke funny determines if I would or wouldn't recommend this film to you.",Weird Science
32,g-bodyl,Over-the-Top in the Best Way Possible!,8,20 April 2015,"Flashing back through history, the best decade for teen comedies were the 80's. A little before my time, but that doesn't stop me from loving such comedies, especially when John Hughes is in charge. Weird Science is another geeky invention of the 80's and I just love how over-the-top the film is and how the film knows it. Any film that turns militaristic brothers into ugly monsters or a beautiful woman freezing grandparents gets a check plus in my book. The film isn't the best teen film from the decades, but it's sure one of the most cheesiest and entertaining ones. John Hughes's film is about two unpopular, bullied kids named Wyatt and Gary who are trying to find true love. They decide to generate a woman through the use of Wyatt's computer. But after Lisa is created, the situation they created vastly spirals out of control. The film has a plethora of enjoyable performances. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith certainly made there characters relatable, awkward, and funny. I liked Kelly LeBrock's sexy performance as Lisa. Robert Downey Jr was pretty good as one of the bullies, almost Tony Stark-like. Bill Paxton was highly enjoyable as the older brother super involved with the military lifestyle. Overall, Weird Science is an over-the-top movie but in a fascinating, enduring way. It's essentially a product of the 80's, a great decade for movies. The film may be weird and quite funny, but it does have relevant thematic issues that every kid should take a note of. I really like how the quirkiness of the film did not take away any of the themes. Not the best of 80's teen comedies, but certainly an enjoyable romp. My Grade: B+",Weird Science

It is a very flamboyant and funny movie, coming right out of the genius mind of John Hughes, following two insecure teenage boys who manage to create a woman, hilarity ensues as we watch them struggle with this new invention. One thing it is lacking which is very evident in other Hughes films, such as the Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, is heart, there are not really moments that show compassion or a real, believable relationship between these characters, it could have been a great extra layer that simply was not there. The cast is terrific, Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Michael-Smith work off one another spectacularly, Kelly Le Brock is very convincing as the perfect woman for the two boys, Bill Paxton shines as the mean older brother and a bunch of smaller roles, including Robert Downey Jr., manage to steal some scenes. Funny and very enjoyable, Weird Science may be lacking heart but it makes up for it with big laughs, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.

I wouldn't consider Weird Science to be one of John Hughes best films, far from it actually, but it is enjoyable and that's all I care about. The premise doesn't make much sense and lacks the believability factor, but that's OK with me. I kicked my brain to the curb and was able to go with it. John Hughes knows how to entertain his audience and go with the times. This may not be the strongest of scripts, but he injects some great humor into this movie. I laughed my ass off on quite a few occasions. Anthony Michael-Hall is a member of the infamous brat-pack. He has charm in spades in this movie. Ilan Mitchell-Smith is solid as Hall's geeky friend. Bill Paxton is a scene stealer as Mitchell-Smith's mean brother. And, of course, Kelly LeBrock is very memorable as the creation. She was downright breathtaking at this juncture, what happened?!

37,The-Sarkologist,Aged Well,7,20 June 2018,"So, we have these two high school nerds standing at the entrance to a gym fantasising over a bunch of girls (and nobody notices this, why?) when the jocks, or at least the cool kids (played by a very young Ironman) decide to embarrass them, so basically we open with the 'let's embarrass the nerds' cliché. Well, it seems that since they don't have the ability to actually interact with real people they decide that they will resort to the only thing possible to give them pleasure - their computer. Gee, this movie really predicted the future in that regards.
 While we have Frankenstein playing in the background, they come up on this ridiculous idea that they will create their own woman. Then again their computer isn't actually all that powerful, so they decide to hack the airforce's mainframe (probably not that hard, considering the kid in Wargames also managed to do it), and use their computing power to help. So, after a lot of flash bangs, feeding in a bunch of pictures (including a picture of Einstein, though I am still wondering how the computer was able to interpret that as being his brain, as opposed to the face), bang - Kelly le Black appears.
 Seriously, haven't these kids ever actually read Frankenstein. Hey, they had the film playing in the background so surely they know that that whole experiment ends badly. In fact Victor Frankenstein fled the house as soon as he discovered how horrifying his monster was. Then again, it is Kelly le Block, and I'm sure nobody is going to run away from her, and also technology has significantly advanced since the beginning of the 19th century, so I guess all the problems that Victor faced have been ironed out by now.
 Well, they now have this beautiful woman who will follow their every commands, and surprisingly they don't actually know what to do with her. I guess I'll give this movie a couple of points for realism in this regards. Also, we have Bill Paxton running around, and a very young one at that, pre-figuring all of the action movies he will be starring in in the future by having him play a guy at a military academy, and being very adept as extorting money out of his little brother (though where he actually gets all of this money from when he doesn't have a job, and the reason that he is paying Ched all this is so he doesn't tell his parents, so getting the money off his parents is going to be an issue as well).
 I'm sure we can pretty much work out what happens. These kids are seen with a very attractive, and incredibly intelligent, women and all of the sudden they are liked. In fact, in a space of one weekend they go from being complete outcasts to the life of the party - a party that is being thrown at their house. Well, I guess some more points for realism here - I'm not surprised that a bunch of teenagers all rocked up at an unknown house for a party simply because somebody told them that there was going to be a party there. Also, more points for the fact that the hosts end up hiding in the bathroom because, well, they've never actually been to a party before - ever.
 Look, lets not be too serious here though because this is a pretty fun movie, though I wouldn't go as far as say it's a cult classic. Sure, there is the 'two nerds get girlfriends at the end of the film' cliché and also the 'it happens to be the two girls they were dreaming over at the beginning of the film' cliché, and I also can't help but wonder whether these girls are actually going to be speaking to them again on Monday when everybody goes back to school, because, well, it's Monday, and if we know anything about Mondays and that it is back to the same old stuff and all the exciting times that happened on the weekend are now in the past.",Weird Science

39,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The illogical and wild side of the John Hughes coming-of-age films,6,28 August 2011,"Even when John Hughes makes a mediocre film such as ""Weird Science,"" the nature of his intent still shines through, to the point where you can't necessarily fault him for anything except not making a better one. ""Weird Science"" serves as the ultimate 1980s high school nerd fantasy, one in which babes see social awkwardness as a turn-on and bullies and extortionist older brothers help themselves to large servings of humble pie. The movie truly doesn't need to be anything more, even in spite of the shallowness of its characters and general disregard for logic.Anthony Michael Hall (in his fourth Hughes film in three years) and Ilan Mitchell-Smith star as two losers who determine that if they can't get girls the ""old-fashioned"" way that they can use their computer smarts to play Frankenstein and create the ideal woman. After some illegal hacking they pack her with a high IQ (and an appropriate breast size) then hook a doll up to a machine. One crazy storm inside their house later and suddenly there's Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), who's every bit as stunning with a type A personality as a nerd could possibly imagine or desire.The story then goes the unexpected route. Lisa, equipped with mad street smarts and magic powers, literally takes over the driver's seat and the young Gary and Wyatt for a wild ride. After helping them loosen up a bit, she determines they need a few tests to find the courage they need to stand up to bullies and go after the girl.Hughes determines that Lisa needs no rhyme or reason other than causing an appropriate amount of mischief so the boys can learn a valuable thing or two. She's the fairy godmother of this fantasy; it's one thing to stand up to your parents, for example, and tell them you're going to a party, and it's another to have a hot model do it for you (and cause your father to forget who you are). Hughes basically sticks it to everyone who made his life crappy during his teens, though to be fair, he recognizes the nerd's shortcomings and doesn't paint them as heroes. Hughes has always played things close to the chest, filming most of his movies in the Chicago suburbs where he grew up, even naming the high school in ""Weird Science"" after the main road where his actual high school was. In this film he has absolute loony fun with his usual tropes, going as far as turning Bill Paxton, who plays Wyatt's militaristic older brother Chet, into a steaming pile of crap that looks like Jabba the Hut.Fans of the more romantic side of Hughes, who love his candid nature toward portraying high schoolers, might find ""Weird Science"" to be the wild mutt of the family with its irreverence, and high level of silliness. It could be considered the ""cult favorite"" of the Hughes collection and that's fine. It definitely caters to those who can relate to being a socially outcast teenage boy and not too many others, but by no means is it a slip-up for the coming-of-age master. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Weird Science

Not a high point for John Hughes, who directed this paper-thin fever dream of a slapstick comedy after writing the screenplay in just two days. Hughes would become known for quick penmanship later in his career - he'd write Ferris Bueller in roughly the same amount of time - but in this case that efficiency leads to an imaginative premise that never really grows to maturity. Anthony Michael Hall, in something of a leading role after breakout performances in National Lampoon's Vacation and Sixteen Candles, is responsible for a lot of what works about the finished product. His comic timing is excellent, even in the most absurd situations (of which there are many). Hall particularly soars in one drunken scene, spilling his guts and making unlikely friends with the regulars in a seedy ghetto jazz bar, but that's an early climax and the film struggles to outdo it on the home stretch. Props and gimmicks pad out the rest of the ride, along with a generous dose of fresh, Hughsian, era-defining new wave cuts. Cheap and easy, but invariably charming and authentically funny; I've burnt weeknights with worse films.",Weird Science
44,jimbo-53-186511,Excellent in so many ways,8,16 April 2015,"Gary Wallace (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are two high school losers that want nothing more than to be able to score with hot girls and to be respected by their peers. Whilst bored one Friday evening they decide to try and see if they can create a perfect woman on their computer. However the boys find that they get more than they bargained for when their creation called Lisa (Kelly LeBrock) enters into their lives and immediately makes a big impact on them.This film worked for me in so many ways and the first thing I liked about this film is that it's a fun piece of escapism. When growing up, how many young men wouldn't have wanted to create a beautiful woman and then find out that said beautiful woman was there to guide them through their adolescence. How much simpler would life be if we all had a Kelly LeBrock by our side.The second more obvious thing that was good about this film is that it quite simply was funny; I wouldn't go as far as saying that it was consistently funny, but when the gags came they hit the right note and I was pleasantly surprised that the film was much less vulgar than I was expecting. I thought that Chet's comeuppance at the end was particularly surprising and amusing. Gary's early scene when he's in the bar trying to emulate the style of the 'black' guys was also funny, but again that scene was funny in a way that was neither crude or offensive. The best character in this film was undoubtedly Chet who kind of reminded me of an 80's version of Stifler from American Pie. Paxton's character was funny, but not in an obnoxious way and he clearly had a lot of fun in this film.The final element that made this work is that it isn't just a dumb teen sex comedy; this actually has a lot more depth to it than one would assume from the beginning and it's actually pretty smart and very well-written. Essentially it's a coming of age film with a few life lessons thrown in for good measure. What also makes this work is that for me it never felt preachy or ever felt like the point was being forced home. Whether you were a nerdish character growing up like Gary or Wyatt or a jock like Ian or Max it's a film that many people can relate to and I think that's ultimately what makes it work so well.If you can look past the embarrassingly dated special effects then there's really very little wrong with this film. It's definitely one of the better teen comedies.",Weird Science
45,r96sk,This film leaves little to remember,6,23 January 2020,"'Weird Science' features an interesting premise, but ends up being a bit of a let down.The acting isn't the best, not even from the now well-known duo of Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Paxton. It didn't bring laughs, while none of the scenes really felt connected. This film leaves little to remember.",Weird Science
46,kirbylee70-599-526179,ADOLESCENT FANTASY,8,4 August 2019,"I can remember when WEIRD SCIENCE was first released seeing the film and thinking it was one of the funniest films I'd seen in some time. Watching it now some 30 odd years later I still thought moments were funny but was surprised at how juvenile it really was. Not in a bad way but it's that difference in seeing things through the eyes of someone in their 20s versus someone in their 60s.If for some reason you never saw the film (welcome to the world after your release from the cave) it revolves around two geek teens named Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) and Gary (Anthony Michael Hall). Wyatt's parents are out of town and while watching the classic FRANKENSTEIN Gary comes up with the idea of using Wyatt's computer to create a woman of their own. Keep in mind this is the early days of home computers when a 6 inch floppy disc was the norm.With bras strapped to their heads, feeding information to the computer and after easily tapping into the government missile based mainframe (notice how often that happened in 80s movies?) the pair soon find themselves confronted by a gorgeous woman (Kelly LeBrock) whose first words are ""So...what would you little maniacs like to do first?"" There first wish is to take a shower with her which they do while still dressed.Decking them out in spiffy new duds she cooks up for them and hopping into her pink Cadillac the trio head out for some fun. Along the way they give their creation the name Lisa, the girl who shamed Gary the previous summer he still has a crush on. The location Lisa chooses for them is a black blues club where they end up drunk with Gary telling the group of friends they make there about the girl who crushed his heart and his testicles.Getting home early the duo are confronted by Wyatt's older brother and main antagonist Chet (Bill Paxton). Visiting from military school and responsible for watching over Wyatt he constantly threatens him, bullies him and extorts money from him to remain silent. Face it, Chet is a supreme jerk.Lisa next takes the boys to the mall where Max (Robert Russler) and Ian (Robert Downey Jr.), the school bullies who pick them, dump a slushie on their heads. Feigning regret to their girlfriends Deb (Suzanne Snyder) and Hilly (Judie Aronson) the pair get away with their misdeed but soon dump the girls when they see Lisa. Following her outside they attempt to hit on her when she tells them her ride is there as Gary pulls up in a Porsche. She then invites the pair to a party at Wyatt's house and tells them to let everyone know.The party does take place and things immediately get out of control. Hundreds of kids show, food is eaten, alcohol is flowing freely and Gary and Wyatt are spending the party in the bathroom, afraid to come out. Lisa has to come up with a way to get them out of their shells, to put them in the eye sights of Deb and Hilly and to show the rest of the kids that they're much cooler than even they realize.While watching the film I had a combination pop into my head. If you took a blender, tossed in Mary Poppins, a few Playboy magazines, the mind of a pre-teen boy and added a dash of science fiction then turned it on you basically have the script for the movie. Again, that's not necessarily a bad thing. But watching it now it feels to thin and ready to jump into the fun filled frivolity without much depth to it. As some in the extras point out perhaps this was director/writer John Hughes decision just to have some fun after the back to back hits SIXTEEN CANDLES and THE BREAKFAST CLUB. At least it seems that way.The two leads here show tremendous differences in their abilities. Hall is adept at playing the buffoon teen having done it before and shows his abilities as an actor. Smith on the other hand is particularly lame in his performance. It's no surprise that his career was extremely limited. LeBrock does a fine job in only her second film. Her job is to look great which she does but she handles the comedic actress part required here quite well too. Standout among all though is Paxton as Chet. Once seen you cannot forget him in this role.I doubt that a movie like this could be made today. The PC Police would have a field day with it, demanding that this, that or the other was offensive and would have to be eliminated leaving behind barely anything at all resembling a movie. Like BLAZING SADDLES you can either go along for the ride and have some fun realizing that it's just a movie and made for laughs or you can be a miserable human being and take all the fun out of everything. Keep in mind this movie was made for teens and it shows. It's still a fun movie.Arrow Video outdoes themselves once more with a great presentation here. The film is being offered on blu-ray with a 4k scan from the original negative. Included are both the original and an extended version of the film. The extras are fun as well. They include a new interview with special effects makeup creator Craig Reardon, a new interview with composer Ira Newborn, a new interview with supporting actor John Kapelos, a new interview with casting director Jackie Burch, ""It's Alive: Resurrecting Weird Science"" an archive documentary on the film with interviews of the cast and crew, theatrical trailers, TV spots, an image gallery, a reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork by Tracie Ching and with the first pressing only an illustrated collector's booklet featuring new writing on the film by Alexandra Heller-Nicholas and Amada Reyes.Fans of the film who think they've had the best version on disc before will find that this one is far superior. If you are one of those fans make a point of replacing that old copy with this new one from Arrow. You won't regret it.",Weird Science
47,davispittman,Just average really,5,31 January 2016,"Weird Science is really just an average film. There really isn't all that much new or entertaining material in this 1980's teenage romp. The acting is really just alright, not all that impressive or poor, just so so. I mean I guess there were a few funny moments, but in my opinion, it wasn't anything that special or amusing. This movie doesn't have much of a purpose in my mind. This movie is really not John Hughes's best, I would consider weird science to actually be one of his worst films. It's simply not original, well written or well made. The jokes are not funny and the many physical gags are over the top and been there done that. My advice to you if you see this on the television grid is to just pass it by, there are so many more entertaining and better quality 1980's classic films that are better and much more worth your time. 5/10.",Weird Science
48,slokes,Make A Circuit With Me,4,13 April 2014,"John Hughes was on a tear in mid-1985, but the writer-director of celebrated teen-angst comedies like ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" was either slumming for a paycheck or suffering a brain cramp when he made this cockeyed paen to young libidos unleashed by technology.Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are a pair of luckless high-school nerds who crave females but have no idea about getting them. But Wyatt does have a computer, and Gary convinces him to simulate a woman with the hotness of a Playboy model and the personality of David Lee Roth. One lightning bolt later, and presto, there's Kelly LeBrock in panties and a halter top, ready to make their dreams come true.""Honeybuns, you wanna party so badly, you can bottle it,"" she tells Wyatt. ""If you wanna be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle.""""Weird Science"" is an outlier among Hughes' teen movies of the period, which tended to present more authentic emotions in pursuit of comedy. Still, Lisa, as LeBrock's character is known, is of a piece with Bender in ""The Breakfast Club"" and Ferris Bueller in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" the rule-bender who has to teach some young charges about escaping adult preconceptions.Employing the outright fantasy of a dream girl with magic powers for such a function could be useful, if the characters were better developed or the comedy funnier. Sadly, ""Weird Science"" is a kind of rush job, most of the humor being in the form of crude embarrassment gags on Gary and Wyatt, and their reactions to same. An opening sequence shows them staring at a gym full of teenaged girls, until their reverie is interrupted by a pair of toughs who pull their pants down. That's all the scene has, and it's par for the course.One of the toughs is played by Robert Downey, Jr., making a minor impression except for his hair, which is tousled like a firework. Hall wins the prize for Biggest Big '80s do, though, a layered flip of such intricacy it had to take the boy all morning to set it. Hall is the star of the show, something he earned with his great supporting turns in ""Breakfast Club"" and ""Sixteen Candles,"" but Hughes doesn't do him any favors here, letting him overplay too many scenes while Mitchell-Smith winces and grins in fey support.LeBrock does better, in part because she knows she's playing a special effect and has fun with it. People talk about her amazing body, but her kissable mouth is equally lust-inducing. She shows a bit of range, too, but Hughes gives her little more to say than ""I do whatever they say"" when asked about Gary and Wyatt. There's a lesson somewhere, too, about finding self-confidence or whatever, but it's a lame tack-on.The film does fly. Hughes' willingness to play for cheap laughs makes this vehicle subtlety-free. The scenes featuring Bill Paxton as Wyatt's unhinged bully of an older brother provide real sparkle, especially when Lisa lays down the law. Every now and again, Hall delivers a decent Hughes line in the old style. Mostly, though, it's enjoyable when giving you a chance to oogle LeBrock.This happens a lot. Hughes is pandering, but sometimes it works. Other times, it is more of an amiable if unimaginative time-waster that reminds you how the director needed to keep things real in order for his films to work.",Weird Science
49,gcd70,Weakest John Hughes,2,3 July 2008,"John Hughes' weakest effort to date was this 1985 pic about two sexually frustrated young boys who come up with the bright idea of creating the perfect girl with the help of modern technology.The script from Hughes is basically a pathetic teen ""wet dream"" that perhaps stems back to the writer's own childhood. Certaninly this premise was not strong enough to carry the film, which consequently has no depth and will entertain at surface level only. ""Weird Science"" is blessed with some funny scenes but is ruined by too many clichéd situations and two dimensional characters. Hughes fails to say anything profound to or about his young teenage audience.The cast are all below par, with Anthony Michael Hall not at his usual perceptive best, Ilan Mitchell-Smith merely filling in as the wussy sidekick and Kelly LeBrock having little to do but look hot.

Two lonely, but likeable nerds Gary and Wyatt create ""the perfect woman"" on their computer, which brings to life the stunning Kelly LeBrock and the film is a non stop party until the movie ends. Anthony Michael Hall returns again as nerd icon and has great support roles from Bill Paxton and Robert Downey Jr. As silly as the film is, it has some heart and Gary and Wyatt are very sympathetic characters.

I'm not complaining, since his commitment to character usually overrides all else, making even the most contrived leaps of faith engaging. Unfortunately, his commitment to character takes a turn for the disastrous in ""Weird Science,"" easily his worst film. Two shrill, unlikeable high-school losers, frustrated over their inability to score with chicks, decide to create one of their own (through some laughably awful 1985 computer technology), in the form of vacant Playboy centerfold Kelly LeBrock. But hey: these shrill, unlikeable losers (who would be justifiably subjected to beatings by their own nerdy peers) really just need to face the fact that a little confidence is all it takes to impress the ladies (and stand up to your sadistic, Army-brat brother)! I have come to expect the contrived, 20-minute opening setup that frames the remainder of a Hughes film, but the setup for ""Weird Science"" is non-existent; in its place is a gimmick: a glut of special effects and out-of-place action (in the third act, a bunch of bikers out of ""Mad Max"" terrorize our hapless losers) that tears any possible humanity to shreds. It's not spoiling anything to say that the losers get with their respective hotties in the end (and are much more worldly, sensitive guys than the horndogs we first met), but the manner by which Hughes arrives at this conclusion rings so patently false it's infuriating.",Weird Science

They certainly throw the word f@gg@t around far too much to get away with now.The performances are all a bit extreme and OTT, but that is the nature of the film and probably what makes it fun.There is no denying that Kelly LeBrock was a very beautiful lady, but the sight of Bill Paxton's bottom always appealed to me more, despite his obnoxious character.

Hughes mines teen fantasy wish fulfillment when nerdy Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith make a woman, Kelly LeBrock, who helps them become cool and meet cute girls. Since the film is a fantasy, it does allow it to have over-the-top characters, like Bill Paxton's Chet, or have Road Warriors crash a party on their motorcycles (who include Michael Berryman and actual Road Warrior alumni, Vernon Wells), though I never really cared for most of Hughes pictures that were broad comedies along these line (i.e. ""The Great Outdoors"" or ""Beethoven""). I prefer his more sincere of comedies, including everything from classics like those mentioned above to even lesser ones like ""Career Opportunities"" or ""Dutch.""

55,vertigo_14,Funky Teen Sci-Fi (spoilers),7,8 August 2004,"80s! I'm living in the 80s! If you love 80s teen movies, then Weird Science ought to be in your catalogue. It is one of director John Hughes most memorable, and one of the 80s most original.Written in two days, this is a teen science fiction film, the story of two teenage loners, Wyatt (the always grimacing Ilan-Mitchell Smith) and Gary (Anthony Michael Hall before he went deadpan) and their weird way of discovering girls. A variation on Frankenstein, the teenagers create a beautiful woman (the super cool Kelly LeBrock) using their computer and some clever hacking skills (of course, it's exaggerated). Their creation is Lisa, the chic English accent woman who brings a little life to the subtle Illinois suburb. As the antithesis of both Wyatt and Gary's personalities, she's going to show these boys a little adventure, get them to loosen up, and for crying out loud, gain some self-esteem.Because Lisa is a lady with some supernatural power like freezing grandparents in time, erasing the memory of a bad first impression with Gary's parents, turning Wyatt's obnoxious military school brother Chet (Bill Paxton in his funniest, most arrogant role yet) into a giant pus maggot, or even having a gang of mutant bikers storming a house party. And Lisa's greatest gift to the boys: showing them true love by helping them along to meet the two girls they've been after all along, their high school classmates, Deb and Hilly, who are unfortunately hung up on the dweeb bullies, Max (Robert Russler) and Ian (Robert Downey, Jr.). So essentially, it deals with many aspects of teen angst (but more like just teen self-esteem or self-consciousness issues) within one story. Parents, class status (done subtly here as opposed to Some Kind of Wonderful or Pretty in Pink), relationships, etc. It works well, and is done quite humorously.One of my favorite scenes is when the trio (Lisa, Gary, and Wyatt) go to the night club looking pretty out of place (they're not only the only white people there, but probably the only ones under thirty). Once Anthony Michael Hall's character, Gary, gets drunk and starts with his slang, it's hilarious. Reminds me a little of Adventures in Babysitting when the gang drops in on the club and they're not allowed to leave until they sing. So eventually, they loosen up and have a little fun.It's a wonderful movie with a classic John Hughes comic touch (says the mutant biker to Gary and Wyatt after they threaten to kill them if they don't leave, ""Please don't tell anyone about this. I'd hate to lose my teaching job.). Plus, it's got a great soundtrack, featuring Killing Joke, Lords of the New Church, and Oingo Boingo doing the title song. The music video for it was fantastic, and not only features clips from the movie, but Kelly LeBrock herself in Oingo Boingo's own rendition of creating the woman via technology. Although not one of John Hughes' best (I think Sixteen Candles is still his greatest), it is certainly one of his most memorable and one that I will love no matter how old I get.

56,PredragReviews,"""Nothing's more important to a teenage boy than his grandparents""",8,9 May 2016,"Weird Science captures exactly what made 80's films so quirky and legendary. It's not just weird scientific experimenting that results in the creation of a beautiful knockout supermodel played by Kelly LeBrock walking around all hot and impressing/exciting young teenage boys. Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are two nerdy high school guys with fantasies of popularity and dreams of acceptance. While the reality factor goes right out the window as the movie progresses, I think the core theme of the movie is something a lot of people could relate to, the feelings of alienation at that awkward age, where even minor differences seem so large and significant, and the wanting to fit in, to be accepted. Kelly LeBrock is smoking hot as Lisa, the girl created from a Barbie doll and some microchips. Robert Downey, Jr. and Bill Paxton also appear, but it's the John Hughes directing touch that really propels this film.While more based in fantasy than Sixteen Candles or The Breakfast Club, the John Hughes' touch is evident in his choice of non-mainstream music, direction, dialogue, and the underlying themes of teenage angst and rebellion. There have been some reviewers commenting on how the movie may have been cropped, but I honestly didn't notice.

Too bad that no one decided to do anything remotely interesting with this premise, as she just becomes something of a mentor to the nerdy teens and teaches them a little bit about courage and self-confidence (very, very little) as they throw a big party, catch the attention of a couple of one-dimensional lookers (Snyder, Aronson), and everything gets wrapped up nice and tidy--yawn. Vulgar and smarmy, yet neutered for a PG-13 rating, the only thing ""weird"" about the ""science"" is how it makes no sense and no one tries to explain it (why does LeBrock apparently have magical powers??). Hall is often obnoxious, Mitchell-Smith is as much a wimp at the beginning as he is at the end, but LeBrock at least plays her role with intelligence as sharp as her attitude.

59,mike48128,"Like Jumanji, I Dream of Jeanie and Ghostbusters-Total Fantasy Fun",8,18 June 2012,"I just read several pages of random interviews. A lot of people just don't understand this movie. It is supposed to be totally impossible and unrealistic. I believe that John Hughes was trying to ""push-the envelope"" to see what he could get away with and still keep a ""family"" rating. Today, if a film like this was made at all, it would have to be by ""Pixar"" animation. Let's examine the basic premise: Two nerdy naive teen age boys set out to create the fantasy girl of their dreams, for their personal sexual purposes. It doesn't quite turn out that way.Lisa: what is she? She sure isn't human. She acts like Barbara Eden's ""Jeannie"" but may be a 3D hologram made of energy. Her creation makes no sense: how can voodoo and computer simulation create anything alive?Like Jumanji and Zathura (The Brass Bottle, I Dream of Jeannie, Mary Poppins, Nannie McPhee) and similar stories, all is returned to its original state and no one is harmed; only wiser for the experience. What I like about this film is that nobody dies, it's just an adventure.It is a teen-age fantasy nonsense film, meant to be enjoyed as just that. Do not try to attach any greater significance to it. It is fun to watch and has great CGI and EFX: 1. The big brother as a ""flatulent- toad"" is completely outrageous. 2.Kelly Le Brock, sadly, made too few films. (Even she admits that her body was impossible to maintain and she struggles with her weight in later life.) What I don't like about this film: 1. The ""White Superfly"" bar scene. Too racist and uncomfortable. 2. Nobody makes friends with their high-school bullies. Ever. 3. The ""Mad Max"" characters are a little too much over the top. You have probably watched this already and either hate it or love it. It's in the same class as ""Men in Black."" Totally unbelievable and too much fun.",Weird Science
60,Screen_Blitz,"80s high school science-fiction comedy is strange, but genuinely enjoyable",7,5 April 2016,"From director John Hughes came some of graceful high school comedies filled with laughs, heart, and splendid nostalgia; such tropes that many teen comedies lack today. Whether his movies follow a group of teenagers coming together on a Saturday detention, cutting school for a day of enjoyment, or getting involved in an unexpected love triangle; his movies are always entertaining, unless of you are someone who doesn't enjoy teen rom-coms. This movie however, takes a slightly different route in the comedy genre by adding elements of science-fiction and fantasy to form up a geeky, but funny teen comedy for teens and adults alike. This film follows Anthony Michael and Ilan Mitchell Smith as Gary and Wyatt, two unpopular teen boys who struggle to climb up the social ladder at school and are constantly pitted targets by the bullies Ian (played by Robert Downey Jr.) and Max (played by Robert Rusler) who manage to maintain high social standing with their girlfriends Deb (played by Suzanna Snyder) and Hilly (played by Judie Aronson). In an efforts to make their social (and sexual) fantasties come true, these two use Wyatt's computer to create themselves a live girlfriend who they name Lisa (played by Kelly LeBrock). Upon her creation, Wyatt and Gary began getting accepted as they began bringing her on dates while she teaches them confidence of getting out in the social crowd. The greatest gem of the film comes from how John Hughes takes such a silly idea and manages to make it work. Now for a science-fiction comedy in the 80s, viewers should not go in expecting groundbreaking special effects or anything blow you out of the water. But this film brings just about everything it needs including a solid cast, good laughs, a heart, and an inspiring message. The main characters are quite funny in some scenes, especially when they get involved in some surprising shenanigans, and come to be easily likable. Of course, these are the typical teen boy stereotypes with fantasies of losing their virginity. It can be fun to watch teenagers take their girlfriend to a bar with fake IDs and throwing parties with booze and loud music. The opposite comes from Bill Paxton who plays Wyatt's abusive brother Chet who torments him whenever he gets the chance, but with unexpected comic relief; and of course Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Rusler who's characters find fun in pantsing the main characters in front a group of girls, or dumping sly smoothies on them. Aside from the silly and occasionally vulgar humor typical for teen comedies, viewers may find enjoyment by the classic 80s soundtrack including songs by Van Halen, and most importantly the message about being socially accepted by people for who are you, not for what you have. Weird Science doesn't meet the heights of John Hughes' other works, but it is still enjoyable and fun for teens and up to watch. This is a funny movie with a great cast and an inspiring message. It is definitely a film teens should watch. Yes, the idea of teenagers making a girlfriend out of a computer is silly, if only Steve Jobs actually made a computer with that kind of power. But what matters in the end is that John Hughes makes it work.",Weird Science
61,bobsgrock,Only John Hughes could make this work.,7,16 April 2009,"It truly is one of the most bizarre and insane movies I have ever seen, yet in its own unique way it has a heart and soul and an actual lesson to teach us. Combining elements from his previous movie, Sixteen Candles, and the science-fiction genre, Hughes creates a world that isn't fully rooted in reality but has realistic characters you are able to interact with. As the story goes, two nerds are tired of being made fun of and perceived as uncool. They decide to use their computer and create the perfect woman which will then elevate their status at school and in society, they think. What they don't count on is that it turns out to be an intelligent, English woman who has more in store for them than they wanted.To get right down to it, this is the most unusual of the John Hughes movies but it also maintains that message that is so prominent in other movies like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. I didn't grow up in the 80's, but I am sure that teens felt ostracized and left out in many aspects of their life, least not including high school. What Hughes has done with the three aforementioned movies as well as others later in his career is that he has created characters that are memorable, flawed and willing to listen to change that could benefit them. To enjoy this you have to look past the bizarre climax and the other subplots and appreciate that someone made a movie for you as a teenager, a person and not just a dollar sign.",Weird Science

The movie stars famed 80s 'Brat-packer' Anthony Michael Hall (as Gary) and the not-so-famous Ilan-Mitchell Smith (Wyatt) as two uber-nerds who are mocked, socked, rocked, and jocked continuously throughout the film by their 'more cool' high school counterparts. To get even and become more cool themselves, Gary and Wyatt create the perfect woman 'Lisa' (played beautifully by super duper hot and exotic 80s British model-icon Kelly LeBrock; more on her later). Late one Friday night at Wyatt's house while his parents are away, inspired by watching the classic film FRANKENSTEIN, they create her with various 80s gadgets and objects (an Apple computer, pictures from model magazines, and a Barbie doll that is connected to the parts from the popular old-style game Operation)They even give her a brain and make her super-smart! I know it sounds ludicrous, but its a fantasy-comedy, with the emphasis on comedy.Anthony Michael Hall (as Gary) is nothing short of comic genius in this movie. He just lets it all go and gives one of the most memorable laugh-out-loud comic performances. He has a great, hilarious scene early in the movie in a blues club where Lisa takes Gary and Wyatt to. In this scene, Hall mimics and sounds just like an old, world-weary, club-hanging soul brother and carries it off to perfection. He also sports 'big eyes' throughout the movie at various times to great effect and it totally works. Ilan-Mitchell Smith, even though the movie sports them as a duo, is less funny, but still he works well as Gary's sidekick and on repeated viewing is very watchable himself.Now to 'Lisa'. Kelly LeBrock! What a forgotten bombshell from the 80s! She did this movie, ""The Woman in Red"", ""Hard to Kill"" and was never heard from again. But she ought to be remembered for ""Weird Science"". She is 100% total hotness! Gorgeous to look at from beginning to end, she is no supporting character either. She's essentially the female lead and is totally sexy and funny. She looks and acts like she's having fun throughout. And she has some great throwaway lines ('Rex Harrison hat'; trust me, you'll laugh when you see and hear her delivery of it). Even though she is the boys' creation, Lisa is pure fun and has more personality than most humans! She's the ANTI-FRANKENSTEIN, or the ANTI-BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, if you prefer! Lisa gives Gary and Wyatt the confidence they need to become cool like the rest of their high school compadres.Also along for the fun in great supporting roles are Bill Paxton (before he became Mr. Big Shot in the 90s) as Wyatt's older, Neanderthal, jerk of a brother Chet and Robert Downey,Jr. (as one of the guys taunting and bullying Gary and Wyatt throughout). Of course, the movie has its obligatory, happy ending where Gary and Wyatt (thanks to Lisa) get the girls (a couple of standard, high school Madonnas) and well, as for the 'make-believe' Lisa, you'll be happy how it all ends up with her too. Being an 80s movie, obviously the technology looks and is very dated, but that's part of the fun. Also, there's a few moments, especially at the climactic party at Wyatt's house, that don't come off as funny as they should be, but they are few and far in between. The movie, in addition to being funny, also works as a piece of 80s nostalgia that makes you want to be in high school again w/o any cares and makes you just want to party.A fun, funny, 80s teen flick that takes me back to the good ole days!",Weird Science
63,Beta_Gallinger,"It sure is weird, as the title may suggest, but that helps make it fun!",8,8 November 2010,"This was the third movie which was both written AND directed by the late John Hughes. Like all the other films he wrote and directed before 1987's ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"", this is one of his teen films, but it is certainly not quite the same as its two predecessors, ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"", even though it was released the same year as the latter! Having seen ""Sixteen Candles"" for the first time very recently, after being familiar with ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" for several years, I decided to watch ""Weird Science"". It seems to be less popular than any of the other teen films I've seen from Hughes, so I wasn't expecting it to be any more than pretty good, but my expectations were surpassed!Gary Wallace and Wyatt Donnelly are two nerdy 15-year-old friends who are very unpopular at their high school and have a very poor chance of getting dates anytime soon. One weekend, the two of them are at Wyatt's house while his parents are away. As the two friends watch ""Frankenstein"", they are inspired to conduct a science experiment, one similar to that of Dr. Frankenstein, but instead of reanimating corpses, they will use Wyatt's computer to create a new woman! They feed information into the computer to make sure this woman is both good looking and highly intelligent, and hack into a government computer to get more power! The experiment causes a violent lightning bolt to strike and make a huge mess around the boys, but after this chaos is over, Gary and Wyatt's bold experiment proves to be a success! They find their new woman in the room with them, and it turns out she is gorgeous, intelligent, devoted to the boys, and even has superpowers! The teenage friends decide to name her Lisa, and they are in for some bizarre experiences as she tries to help them gain popularity! The beginning of this movie shows Gary and Wyatt watching gymnasts at school, fantasizing about them, and then getting pantsed by bullies. It looks like the film could be reasonably funny (though I'm not sure how funny the pantsing part is), but not necessarily anything great. However, it soon gets funnier, probably around the time the experiment causes destruction, and I certainly found laughs while seeing Gary and Wyatt in the shower with their new computer-generated woman and then going out with her. The film soon goes downhill again, and I didn't think the part with Gary and Wyatt getting drinks poured on them was very funny, though there certainly are still funny parts around this point. ""Weird Science"" soon improves again, I think starting with the scene showing Lisa meeting Gary's parents for the first time and telling them things he doesn't want them to know, which is definitely a comic highlight of the film. From this point on, I thought this 1985 fantasy comedy was consistently entertaining, not just with the humour (though there is lots of that), but also with the bizarre story, which made me constantly wonder what was going to happen next! Kelly LeBrock, who plays Lisa, sure is hot in this movie, and I like the powerful character she plays.""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"", and ""Weird Science"" are all John Hughes films featuring Anthony Michael Hall in the cast, and the main characters in all of these movies are high school students. However, the first two are both realistic films, with no fantasy in them, and that's far from the case with this one! Yes, this is one bizarre film, combining not just comedy and romance, but also sci-fi, a genre which Hughes was not usually associated with. If you've seen this film's two predecessors and haven't seen this third one of the bunch but are intending to, I strongly advise you to keep all that in mind! I can imagine many people who usually like Hughes' teen movies really being put off by how over-the-top this particular one is! Still, watching it shortly after ""Sixteen Candles"", I think this bizarre 1985 comedy is the stronger of the two, even if most viewers would disagree. If you have some idea of what you're in for and still want to watch ""Weird Science"", I won't advise you not to.",Weird Science
64,Stampsfightclub,Disappointing outing from Hughes,2,30 March 2010,"Lonely teenagers Wyatt (Mitchell-Smith) and Gary (Hall) decide to make a woman that fits all their requirements from a computer, only to find not everything fits perfectly.There were two words that attracted me to this high school comedy, John and Hughes. The mastermind behind the conceptual excellence of skiving school to live in Ferris Bueller's day off to the film that showcased how teenagers really felt about their suffocating parents in the Breakfast club, the man seemed to have his knowledge spot on regarding teenage life.What emerges is a pretty standard and very degrading depiction of lonely lust, containing two teenagers who are the good guys, but are hard pushed to maintain that.Anthony Michael Hall, a hero from the Breakfast Club, feels repetitive and loud in another role for Hughes. Mitchell-Smith likewise feels weak and a stereotype of high school repression and against Hall, we have the most conventional and boring comedy duo ever mastered, which is a great shame for a director and writer who also created some of the best teenage comedy ever.The premise for the story sounds promising, two lads attempt to break science through some technological mastery in an attempt to fulfil their lust on a weekend away from their parents.So after some degrading and embarrassing perversion by the lead duo on cheerleaders and a head turner away from dropped pants do the duo retreat to their sanctuary and form an hyperbole of illogical science to fulfil their uses and gratifications. Through some fast flowing wires and a bemused science guard to the pair get their just deserts.One thing John Hughes usually does perfectly is introductions and Kelly LeBrock's opening shot is the equivalent of Megan Fox in Transformers, a slow panning from her legs upwards in a small Barbie styled costume, a beautiful introduction which is maintained through the nest few scenes as she jumps into the shower with the two lads, uses provocative gestures such as late drinking and kissing practice to keep any horny male teenager hooked.Certainly LeBrock hits the nail on the head, acting flirtatious and forward to justify her character as perfect female, until the inevitable outcome the plot always has in mind, there is more to a person than looks tag.Through some careful shots and repetitive music we see the story pan out as any other romantic comedy would and there are minimal surprises to generate a good watch, particularly when the humour is gross out and shamefully degrading to the actors.The final nail in the coffin is the change in personalities of the final act and as predictable as the coming of next year will have you shaking your head.Certainly not too much consequence came from this film as there were Ferris Bueller's amongst others to follow and create a reputation of teenage comedy mastery.",Weird Science
65,tbills2,"Weird Science, Science",6,22 July 2013,"One of the better comedies of the '80s, and a cultural classic, Weird Science succeeds at being good and funny in a weird way. The plot strings along nicely allowing the kids to do nothing more than create 'weird science' on their computers, and party all the time and chase after women, all while trying to keep their parents and friends, and Wyatt's older brother, Chet, out of their hair. Chet's so funny being played by Bill Paxton. Writer/director John Hughes knows a thing or two on how to cash in a film. John Hughes has such an expansive versatility with writing. Hughes goes against the grain a bit in Weird Science by deciding Gary, played by Anthony Michael Hall, as the main character. That's okay, the problem is that Hall is losing his cuteness, seriously, more like he's loosing his cool. Hall's generous tendencies are fleeting him, and therefore, the character isn't very relatable, but more so sympathetic, which makes it good in a different way, a less conventional way, but Gary should have been the side star, and Wyatt should have been the main character. It's purely sexual. There's nothing wrong with Kelly LeBrock, Lisa, not a thing! What an '80s babe! In the beginning, Kelly LeBrock introduces all the sex appeal needed appearing in her '80s undies, and then she proceeds to manage the movie with sophisticated sexiness the remainder of the viewing. How sexy! Weird Science = Kelly LeBrock. The boys are very good too and make the movie really worth watching. Weird Science scores all the way up to 6 for its creative ingenious fun.",Weird Science
66,eminkl,"Cheap and easy, but invariably charming and authentically funny",6,18 April 2020,"A pair of hapless teenage geeks create their dream woman with the aid of a home computer and proceed to turn their social standing upside down. Not a high point for John Hughes, who directed this paper-thin fever dream of a slapstick comedy after writing the screenplay in just two days. Hughes would become known for quick penmanship later in his career - he'd write Ferris Bueller in roughly the same amount of time - but in this case that efficiency leads to an imaginative premise that never really grows to maturity. Anthony Michael Hall, in something of a leading role after breakout performances in National Lampoon's Vacation and Sixteen Candles, is responsible for a lot of what works about the finished product. His comic timing is excellent, even in the most absurd situations (of which there are many). Hall particularly soars in one drunken scene, spilling his guts and making unlikely friends with the regulars in a seedy ghetto jazz bar, but that's an early climax and the film struggles to outdo it on the home stretch. Props and gimmicks pad out the rest of the ride, along with a generous dose of fresh, Hughsian, era-defining new wave cuts. Cheap and easy, but invariably charming and authentically funny; I've burnt weeknights with worse films.",Weird Science
67,gab-14712,John Hughes At His Weirdest!,8,22 June 2020,"Coming off huge commercial hits such as Sixteen Candles and his most popular work, The Breakfast Club, John Hughes returns with his second film of 1985; Weird Science. His new movie turned out to be a solid hit, especially with the teenage audience group. Written in two days, Hughes created another movie about dweeby students trying to find their way in high school. Unfortunately, I felt this is Hughes's weakest film. He uses more special effects than his previous films and I felt his work on the film's characters could have been more fleshed out. As I said, the teenage people will adore the film. The adults may find it a little pandering and annoying. That said, the film turned out to be a cult classic. It is not the Hughes movie I would recommend, but there is still some fun to be had mainly thanks to Kelly LeBrock's magnetic performance.This film is the combination of your basic teen film formula and Frankenstein. ""It's Alive!"" is one of the most recognized movie quotes of all time. That is initiated here when the two teens used their knowledge to create the woman of their dreams. It was an interesting formula combination, and Hughes did his very best to allow the story to flow. Sadly, some sequences are rushed, and others are juvenile. Definitely a good concept that I would love to see more exploration with in the future.Gary Wallace (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Michael-Smith) are two very unpopular teenagers. They want to be accepted by their classmates but fail miserably. Using their smarts and technology, they decide to create the woman of their dreams-much in the way Frankenstein's monster was born. It worked! They have created the woman of their dreams, Lisa (Kelly LeBrock). That said, Lisa is more than these two kids can handle. Their goal is to become more confident, but Lisa and her supernatural ways are going to give these kids some interesting encounters.John Hughes and Anthony Michael Hall must have really gotten along because they are 3 for 3 in working together up to this point. In Sixteen Candles, he was ""the geek."" In The Breakfast Club, he was ""the brainiac."" Here, he portrays a nerd. It really is fun to see Hall use these roles to develop as an actor. That said, Kelly LeBrock and her wildly sexy English accent steals the show. She was the one character that was truly developed. She just could have been a ""no-brains"" playmate, but instead she sees right through the boys as she toughens them up. Also, if you mess with her, you might be turned into a hideous slug. Another standout is Bill Paxton. His best performances may have been under James Cameron's wings, but John Hughes made him a hit with the public as Wyatt's elder brother, Chet. He is probably the most evil big brother in any film that was ever made. He tortured his poor Wyatt often, but Lisa may prove very useful on that front. Also, if you want to see an early Robert Downey Jr performance, here you go!Weird Science is a movie that is...well...weird. Hughes took advantage of making his film very, very weird, which of course pleased all teenagers known to exist. Hughes added more special effects to his budget. Perhaps he should stick with character-driven projects. That slug, though. The music is merely fine, just more typical 80's music. The story itself is cool, although it's a little immature at times. At least here, Hughes embraced it and combined it with his growing-of-age story tendencies. This is one of his lesser known films, but it has gained a cult following in recent years. I had fun from time to time. Thank you, Kelly LeBrock!My Grade: B-",Weird Science

As a child in the 80's I grew up with this film and it was awesome, but I watch it now and it's fun to watch, but I can't imagine anyone that didn't grow up with it really liking it. There really isn't much logic or reality to this film, but it's fun to watch anyway.Although, if you want to see Kelly LeBrock looking unbelievably sexy, then you might want to check this film out.  Also, the two love interests aren't bad either (Suzanne Snyder and Judie Aronson).  The rest of cast is quite good as well. I especially like Ilan Mitchell-Smith's character, Wyatt, he seems like a genuinely likeable guy.  Anthony Michael Hall is pretty good in his role, but he truly is a nerd in the role.  Bill Paxton plays an excellent older brother to Wyatt, he really seems to steal the show when he's on the screen.  Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Rusler play the perfect cool-guy morons in the film.The acting is ok for the most part, but nothing terribly spectacular. Pretty much what you would expect from an 1980's teen comedy film.  All in all, the film is ok, but far from great.

Along with her, there's a sense of metaphor, wildness and truth that transpire from the movie experience. And it should be said the kid who plays the blond-haired Gary was one heck of a find !

76,avik-basu1889,One of those 'Hasn't Aged Well' films !!!,2,7 November 2017,"All the other John Hughes films I have seen are really touching coming-of-age tales that humanise characters who might initially seem like stereotypical caricatures. This is the reason why 'Weird Science' feels like such an aberration. This film has the 80s written all over it, but unlike other Hughes' films, in a bad way. If one tries to count the number of times there is a scene or a line of dialogue that looks/sounds offensive, he/she will lose count by the 30 minute mark. It's one thing for a movie to be about a character who is offensive, but its quite another when the movie itself starts reveling in the offensive content. One of many examples of the film reveling in its vulgar content is the scene where a random pianist girl gets unnecessarily stripped naked by the blowing wind and the scene gets played out for comedic effect and it reeks of puerile crassness. The interesting thing is that offensive jokes can still be funny, but unfortunately other than a few scenes featuring Bill Paxton, the film completely failed at making me laugh.I think the ultimate message that this film gives and the realisation that the two protagonists arrive at is not that bad. But the route it takes to drive home that message is highly offensive, misogynistic and questionable. Bill Paxton's performance as Chet is the one saving grace that the film offers. He makes every second of his guest appearance worth it. But unfortunately apart from him, there isn't much here to look forward to.",Weird Science
77,flicklover,A fun romp from the 80s!,8,28 December 2018,"I was a teenager during the 80s. John Hughes teen comedies are some of the best memories I have from that decade. Compared to some of his other films, WEIRD SCIENCE is probably the least regarded. It is very funny, and some would say crude but it as a film of that time it is good.Very simple story. A pair of geeks decide to create a girl on a computer and get more than they bargained for. The unpopular geeks only wish to find girls to like them and be popular. Gary is played by Anthony Michael-Hall, Wyatt us played by Ilan Mitchell Smith. They are very funny together but the film belongs more to Anthony Michael Hall. He has the best lines and reactions in the film. The girl they create named Lisa is played by Kelly LeBrock in a very funny but sexy performance. I remember having a huge crush on her from this film and THE WOMAN IN RED. She is gorgeous. The story could have been about the boys learning all they need to know about sex and there is some of that but it is mostly about Lisa helping them become more confident. The humor is pretty tame from today's standards but it still works, and there is a sweetness that is enjoyable. Wyatt has an abusive brother named Chet that is played hilariously by Bill Paxton. He steals every scene he's in.All in all it us a funny coming of age story that seems to be a time capsule of a great decade.",Weird Science
78,renegadeviking-271-528568,Weird Science review,7,5 January 2021,"""We need more input. We gotta fill this thing up with data. We gotta make her as real as possible, Wyatt. I want her to live. I want her to breathe. I want her to aerobicise.""As I must confess that I only saw the movie for the first time about 6 years on a VoD service when I needed something to cheer me up. The movie was released in 1985, which meant I was only a 1 year old at the time of its release, but unlike some of John Hughes' other efforts such as Home Alone, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Breakfast Club, which I did watch growing up, Weird Science took its time in gaining my attention.I'm not entirely sure how or why I missed out on Weird Science growing up, because looking at it now it had everything I could have wanted in a movie when I was younger. Two nerdish boys, who somewhat reflected my own time at school, goofy special effects, some brilliantly funny jokes and a smoking hot woman in the form of Kelly LeBrock all make up a delightfully silly movie about two nerds who create their perfect woman.The premise is the best kind of nonsense, as two highschool nerds, Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith), decide one Friday night, after watching Frankenstein on the TV nonetheless, that they are going to create something of their own. After hacking into a government computer network, for more power, and then connecting a barbie doll to Wyatt's computer a lightning bolt strikes which causes all sorts of mayhem only for Lisa (Kelly LeBrock) to emerge from the carnage.The science behind Weird Science is pure 80's nonsense. I doubt anyone seriously believed any of this was at all possible, especially at a time when technology was really only just finding its feet. Still, it's this kind of loopy science fiction that gave many an 80's movie its charm, and charm is something that Weird Science has by the bucket load.Once the initial three leads are set up, the story moves quickly, as our protagonists move from staying in watching movies on a Friday night to bar crawling their way through the city as Lisa encourages them to let loose and have some fun for a change. Lisa is the kind of creation that can somehow manipulate environments and seemingly create things at will, as she has to make fake ID's for our two heroes in order for them to be able to drink, drive and drink and drive legally.Hughes makes the clever decision to focus on the characters and not so much on the plot here. The plot is established quickly, leaving the endearing charm of the three main characters to hold things together. Anthony Michael Hall, starring in his third Hughes directed movie by this point, gets some of the best lines in the movie and really excels in a bar scene explaining to his new friends how the girl ""with the big titties"" broke his heart. While Mitchell-Smith plays the straight guy who has to be the foil to Gary and his own older brother Chet, played by Bill Paxton.Both Michael Hall and Mitchell-Smith are charming in their roles despite being the school nerds. They are ably supported by a superb cast who, despite limited screentime for some, manage to leave their mark on a movie that could easily have forgotten about them (see what I did there?). Robert Downey Jr. makes an early career appearance as one of the bullies who continually picks on Wyatt and Gary and then stupidly believes he has a chance with Lisa. Vernon Wells essentially makes an appearance as the same character he played in Mad Max 2, which further adds to the bizarre elements of the movie. While the previously mentioned Paxton plays Wyatt's hardass military brother, who likes to give Wyatt a hard time throughout the movie, but pays for it when he encounters Lisa late on and who gives him more than he bargained for. When asking him to keep quiet about the movies events, she exclaims: ""I can be a real serious bitch, if I don't get what I want!""Kelly LeBrock threatens to steal the show several times throughout the movie, getting some great lines and delivering them with a poise that makes her character even more likeable. On the John Hughes documentary, Don't You Forget About Me, LeBrock admits to her character being ""Mary Poppins with breasts"" and in all honesty she is correct. Despite being sexy, she is never there for sex or to really pleasure the boys in any way, but more to give them a guiding hand and teach them a thing or two about self confidence. She is the emotional core of the movie, loving the boys, nurturing them and sticking up for them when they either can't or won't.That is Hughes' greatest strength here, as he directs a movie that is so daft in principal, that he manages to make a character piece about two teenage boys growing up being bullied and laughed at throughout their entire school life, or being told they will amount to no good from their overbearing parents. To then find the self confidence to break out of their shells and and become more than they thought they could. The struggles of teenage life are apparent in many of his efforts, particularly his earlier movies, and they remain here too. Despite the special effects and nonsense science, Weird Science is simply a, very funny story of two teenage boys encountering things for the first time in their lives. From drink, to women, cars to fights a simple tale exists of two boys growing up.In summary: A fine effort from Hughes, with a young cast on top form, Weird Science is a superior piece of 80's nostalgia that still stands up today.",Weird Science

The 2 guys get into some antics and in typical John Hughes fashion find themselves along the way.There is a scene showing a clearly adult Kelly Labrock making out with a very underage Illan Mitchell-Smith - cringe #1Cringe #2 is when Anthony Michael Hall does what I can only describe as an Eddy Murphy impression... and it goes on forever it feels like.Outside of that it's entertaining but just not as much fun as I remember.

80,patriciogl10,My favourite John Hughes film.,8,21 December 2019,"The most daring and out-there film of the master of '80s high school films, John Hughes. The plot revolves around two high school underappreciated boys and their desires to be popular with girls. That sounds about right when it comes to Hughes, but then something else is thrown in the mix, something really unconventional that really lifts this film above the others. Through a computer program they decide to create their own woman and much to their surprise, they succeed. Logically, things start looking much better for the both of them, since they are seen through different eyes now that they have a beautiful woman by their side. After that things get a little out of control, which is incredibly exciting. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith built an incredible chemistry between them, so perfectly believable they seem to have been friends for ages. Then there's Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), the woman they created, who is played with an enchanting sensuality that you cannot help but to gaze everytime she is on screen. Bill Paxton plays an annoying, arrogant and despicable older brother who is always watching what his little brother is doing.Great performances, a whacky but fun plot, the comical touch provided by Hughes in many moments of the film, big and small, keeping an appreciable balance in between.

This movie, however, comes in at completely the opposite end of the spectrum. To say that this is dumb does not even begin to describe it. It is embarrassingly bad. Cringeworthy. This is just lazy film making, writing and directing. The special effects, such as there are of them, are dreadful. The comedy is heavy handed, unsubtle and, worst of all, just not funny. So much of it is just illogical. (Yes, I know it's a fantasy, but even fantasies have to make sense within the world they inhabit. This does not.) Good actors are wasted. Anthony Michael Hall appeared in a number of Hughes' movies and, I thought, had shown himself to be a young actor with a real flair for comedy. You'd never think that after watching this. His comedic contributions consist of silly voices and wide-eyed staring. I have never heard of Ilan Mitchell-Smith before, but he seems to be a personable and likeable actor. He is wasted here. My goodness - even Bill Paxton and Robert Downey Jr have roles in this! It's a wonder their careers went anywhere after this crud. Kelly LeBrock doesn't appear to have any acting talent at all, although she does seem to be enjoying herself. Everyone else involved just seems to be phoning it in.If you want to see a good teen comedy, or even just a good comedy; if you want to see a movie that captures something of what it was to be a teen in the 1980's then it's hard to go past the movies of John Hughes. Just not this particular one.",Weird Science
82,gritfrombray-1,A scream from start to finish!!!,10,30 April 2007,"Love this film as it is genuinely funny and all cast are excellent in their respective roles. When the boys decide to create a 'perfect' woman using their computer they do the right thing and create Kelly LeBrock in the form of Lisa! The dialog, acting and sets and sequences are hugely over the top and this is a joy from minute one. As with comedies from the 80s it contains a lot of stars that went on to do a lot more but these guys are brilliant already!! The shower scene is a scream and where Lisa takes Wyatt home and tells his parents she's taking him to a party, much to their angst and disbelief is genuinely hilarious. One of the funniest films of the '80s and a must see if you like smutty comedy!",Weird Science
83,Jared_Andrews,Has Not Aged Well in the Slightest,3,25 May 2020,"Sometimes I'll watch a movie from the '80s and wonder what the heck people were thinking. Then I remember the rampant cocaine use throughout the United States during the decade, and then things begin to make more sense.This is one of the zaniest goofball comedies you'll ever see. It has absolutely zero interest in making any sense, so you might as well check your logic and your entire brain at the door. If you're willing to accept it for the fantastical farce that it strives to be, you'll enjoy yourself. For the most part.The issue is that even without your brain you're going to have a hard time looking past the fact that these two 15-year-old boys have created a 23-year-old-woman to be their girlfriend. And she's totally down with it. She makes out with one of the boys for an uncomfortably long time (as if any amount of time would be comfortable). The scene is so creepy and cringeworthy that it's miracle that anyone thought it was acceptable to keep in the movie.Perhaps no one batted an eye at the scene during the time of the film's release, though I find that hard to believe. Today, the scene has aged so poorly that it overwhelms the entirety of the movie and invalidates the whole thing. Though, to be fair, the rest of movie does little to deserve validation. We're talking about a movie that includes a toy Barbie turning into a real-life woman with superpowers, a motorcycle mutant whose day job is teaching, and a man being turned into a literal pile of talking feces.I had heard people revere this movie as a classic, which is now unfathomable to me. The adult on child make out scene is going to haunt me for quite a while. I implore you to spare yourself that unfortunate fate and watch something else.",Weird Science
84,kingofdanerds,Having weird in the title is a major understatement,8,15 April 2021,"One cannot simply say Weird Science without singing the title. Simple as that. Weird Science is a 1985 John Hughes film. Does 1985 and John Hughes have anything else in common? The Breakfast Club. Interestingly enough, this film was actually filmed somewhat during The Breakfast Club. Obviously upon release, Weird Science was not as well recieved as John Hughes' previous films but has since gained a cult following and even got a television show in the 90's that ran for four years. Weird Science stars Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club), Kelly LeBrock, and Ilan Mitchell Smith.Gary and Wyatt are outcasts at their high school. Nobody likes them and nobody wants nothing to do with them. Then one night, they get the idea about creating the perfect women using their computer. They do so and name the beautiful woman Lisa and from here on, chaos and hilarity ensues.Weird Science is just plain fun to watch. When something weird happens, it is fairly fun to watch. Having weird in the title is a major understatement. It is something that I cannot describe in words. All I can say is that if you are into weird and beyond wacky science fiction, this film is for you. Can it be a little too much at times? Yes but in an entertaining sort of way. The film's absolutely absurd yet interesting at the same time plot has potential for a lot of laughs and laughs it gets from me. I will agree that this film is not as good as The Breakfast Club or at least it does not hit real deep like in said film. The message of the film I would guess is about confidence or something along the same lines as that but it is not as apparent due in large part to the absolute craziness that occurs. I am mildly dissappointed because it is a John Hughes film and I would expect something to hit deep. Which leads me to the characters or at least to the two male leads of this film played by Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell Smith. They are supposed to be these ""nerdy"" outcasts. First off, nerdy they don't appear to be. Outcasts? Yes. Nerds? No. Yes, I know that Anthony Michael Hall is pretty much known up to this point in his career as playing the nerd. But, in this film it is not the case. Perhaps the fans have somewhat miscategorized his character. Ilan Mitchell Smith by himself is pretty believeable as a nerd but when with Anthony Michael Hall, nah. Even the outcasts thing is not wholly believeable. We have no scenes showing them being the outcasts at school or showing why they are outcasts. Perhaps I am a nitpicking snobby amateur film pundit but I say that one scene would have made the whole outcast story more believeable. The acting is fairly good from the two. Now with every teen comedy or at least a vast majority of them, there has got to be bullies. The bullies portrayed in this film are the type of bullies that are more annoying than anything if you know what I mean. Would I have prefered if they were the more bullyish type instead of annoying? Sure, but what we get is alright I suppose. Robert Downey Jr. (of Iron Man fame) portrays one of the bullies. Sure, there is a huge RDJ bandwagon that I will stay off of. I know this was an early role but it is nothing spectacular. Definitely not a stand out role for him. As for the other bully, who cares? Now the real bully is Bill Paxton's Chet character. I absolutely love Bill Paxton in this film and he is rather effective in the role of Chet. Now the one person that I decided to save for last is Kelly LeBrock's Lisa. First off, Kelly LeBrock is absolutely stunning and is perfect in this film....that is her appearance.....acting wise...... well......does not matter. The special effects are nothing groundbreaking but are not bad to look at. The soundtrack is fairly good and the song Weird Science (by Oingo Boingo shall forever be in my head and I will forever be singing the title when talking about this film.Weird Science is a fun film to watch and I do see where a lot of criticism may come from here. But whatever it is, this is surely one weird film.",Weird Science

Enough of that. The bottom line is that this film was good for its time, and it's not bad now, but it has faded over the years and the only time I pull out the DVD is when I'm in the mood for some comedy from the 80's (but ""The Breakfast Club"" is a lot better).

87,mgruebel,John Hughes up-and-coming,5,8 October 2015,"Weird Science is one of those fluffy 80s comedies that does not age particularly well, but will bring a smile to the face of that generation, and perhaps an embarrassed smirk to a modern teenage face: What, my parents were that dorky? What, I thought Robert Downey Jr. was cool?It's really not a great film, with its deus-ex-machina plot of two sex-starved teen boys having their home computer synthesize the perfect woman, who can conjure anything needed to keep the plot moving or -yawn- redeem the boys when she conjures a motorcycle gang that rides around the parent's living room. A set of artificially linked set pieces, culminating in the party to end all parties, ensues.The special effects are kind of interesting historically, combining what computer graphics were accessible cheaply in those days with physical special effects that are a cut above a cheap teen flick comedy.Still, even in this very imperfect work, one can see director John Hughes' ability developing: to write teen fare with that unbearable lightness of being. Ferris Bueller, which launched Matt Broderick's career, was not too far in the future, as was Home Alone, which launched Macaulay Culkin on a much shorter career. Both are funnier and generally better films than Weird Science. But if it shows at your local drive-in, and you have plenty of cotton candy or twizzlers in hand, it's a good crowd movie.",Weird Science

89,chvylvr80,THE 80's comedy,9,15 October 2003,"Weird Science is the best 80's comedy that was ever made. I'm saying it. Ghostbusters, Summer Rental, The Great Outdoors, Strange Brew, Gung Ho, Mr. Mom, all of these movies have their place, but none of them can match Weird Science for laughs or pure....eightiesness. Yes eightiesness is a quality. It's a corny, dated quality but one that is tangible and valued by my fellow eighties loving brethren to this day. Come back with me if you will to a time when Anthony Michael Hall was still fielding calls and Kelly LeBrock was French for sexy.Weird Science has everything that an eighties comedy needs: A least one hot girl, a few actors who are no longer working or who do anything that will come along, plenty of dashing eighties threads, a corny as hell eighties soundtrack,(and Oingo Boingo is as corny and eighties as they get), and plenty of cheap funny jokes. Undoubtedly the best thing about Weird Science is Bill Paxton, who plays Wyatt's older brother Chet. Chet is the worst big brother ever to grace a movie screen and is a role model for all big brothers everywhere, me included. Chet delights in extorting money and valuables from Wyatt in exchange for his silence about Wyatt's activities. The best part in the movie is when Chet gets turned into the toad thing or whatever it is. Man I love that part. The rest of the cast does a good job of being their stock characters. Kelly LeBrock does a good job of being hot. Robert Downey Jr. shows none of the signs of future drug addiction. The film is unremarkable in the fact that it isn't anything groundbreaking or special. It's just a funny movie. And an eighties classic. Bottom Line: If you grew up in the eighties and you never saw Weird Science then you must atone for your crimes by going out and buying it right now. Then send me an email telling me how grateful you are that I put you on the path to rightousness and eighties correctness.",Weird Science

There are good special effects and Kelly LeBrock proves to be a modern Frankenstein who lives up to her role. She is sexy but also terrifying in how she fulfills the wishes of her creators by twisting them like a mischievous djinn.A series was also drawn from the film which was quite successful too.,Weird Science
92,IamROCKAS,"This movie is what I imagine going on in the heads of the people who keep telling me Just relax, man and expect me to be better.",3,25 February 2021,"Before talking about the movie, let's address that I'm a really tense person and my blood pressure has been compared to a 60-year-old man's, so I get lost when someone just asks me to relax, like how does one usually do that? Start breathing slower? Take a walk? Both are good options to make me feel better and take my mind of things that are bothering me but they won't help me relax. To me, being relaxed in a tense situation is more of a skill than a common reaction and I see more people being relaxed rather than hustling to do their tasks when they should. So why am I starting this review with such a personal statement? Well, because this movie is portraying that relaxing is easy and everything will be better if everyone would just relax, at least that's the idea I got from watching it.Weird Science came out during the era where a lot of coming-of-age classics were being released left and right and slasher movies were on the rise. That also reflects in the filmographies of the actors that appeared in this movie but I just don't know where this romantic comedy with a sci-fi twist lands among movies. The only thing that makes it special is the presence of a computer-generated woman that gets a weird part in helping our two protagonists find themselves out of the hole that is known as not being popular in high school. From the idea perspective, I really like this concept but the way it was adapted just didn't click with me and I can't tell whether it was the comedy, that was a big turn off for me in this movie, the romance, that just didn't feel real or the kind I wanted to cheer for, the story, that's too sci-fi for my taste, or the combination of all of the above.I get what message the movie tried to communicate and even though it didn't work in the way that I would find to appreciate it, I can't say that there was nothing to cheer for when watching Weird Science. For instance, seeing the juxtaposition of the awkwardness of our leads at the beginning and the confidence of them at the end of the movie makes me glad that at least they got over the hump. Seeing a teenage boy fantasy come to life also felt iconic too. I didn't recognize the young Robert Downey Jr. here but he did blend it well with a young and good-looking cast. Finally, even though not every joke landed with me, the scene where Gary points his gun at everyone with little to no care and shoots the chandelier later, thinking that was the squirt gun, was one of the better examples of good writing with unexpected twists that I noticed.Overall, I wouldn't say I enjoyed the movie. But the experience wasn't in vain, I need movies like these to remind me what I actually like and tend to appreciate in cinema. Perhaps this movie just didn't age well and I would have a completely different opinion if I saw it live in cinema 36 years ago or even if I was just a little bit younger, finding a random VHS tape in a random pile and not caring what was on it.",Weird Science

94,joshuafagan-64214,Not Hughes' Best,3,12 June 2016,"This isn't the worst movie I've seen. But it exemplifies everything that's wrong with 80's movies.The plot concerns two awkward teenage boys who somehow manage to create a beautiful woman, who, like some sort of uber-hot fairy godmother, helps them come out of their shell and become confident members of society- terrible, terrible 80's society.My biggest problem with the film plotwise is that there's no evidence that they're actually better people. If anything, they're more annoying than they were at the start of the film. And all throughout, they are just horrible and horribly unlikable people. If this were my film, they would be the antagonists instead of the protagonists. If nothing else, there should have been some time for the characters to reflect and think on what they've done. But why have reflection and intelligence when you can have low-grade humor and pathetic wish fulfillment disguised as empowerment for the last sorts of people on earth who actually need empowerment? I really hate the 80's. I am so glad I didn't have to live through them.It gets to the point that the purposely, hideously one-dimensional evil big brother character is the most sympathetic one in the film. 80's films love wish fulfillment, and this isn't inherently a bad thing. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is pure wish fulfillment, and it's also one of the best movies of the decade. The main difference is that Ferris is cool and smart and free while the main characters here are pathetic, smarmy, and squirmy. I'd go anywhere with Ferris. I'd do anything to avoid going with these people. Ferris earned his crazy getaways. These people stumble around. They're more like Camerons, except Cameron is genuinely likable- a normal guy- whereas these people are unrelatable freaks.But of course this movie doesn't need to be as good as Ferris to be watchable, just like not every fantasy film needs to be The Lord of the Rings. This film isn't bad because not even a homeless man would take it as a replacement for one of the great 80's teen comedies. This film is bad because it's an insensitive, brainless, unfunny, dull, absurd piece of cinematic garbage that is inferior to every other movie that has endured from its time and genre.The effects are bad, even for a cheap 80's movie, and the characters are boringly one-dimensional. I'm for more angry at the latter flaw, particularly considering this is a Hughes film. Sure, Hughes helped enforce those stereotypes, but he usually built beyond them and did something with them. That's what makes the Breakfast Club so great. But the characters here are so by-the-numbers, it's laughable.My theory is this: Hughes used up all his wit and creativity on TBC and Sixteen Candles and had none left for this film. I'm backed up by the fact that he made all three of those movies one after another over the span of 19 months. Maybe he just didn't have anything left in him. Maybe he had to go back and recharge before getting back to it.There are few positives to this movie, but these are they: Kelly Lebrock does a great job as the created woman. She's not a great actress, but no one in this movie acts well, so her lack of ability doesn't stand out. What does stand out is her charisma and poise. She's the only redeemable part of the movie.And then they're the fact the film often veers into so bad it's good territory. When the film's being absurd instead of absurdly boring, it's actually quite funny. It's not intentional humor, but it's something.The film isn't as sexist as one would think. It's bad in that regard, yes, but it's so bad and ridiculous that you're only going to be offended if you're looking to be offended.Eighties movies are like the first act of 90's movies, where it looks like the main characters have gotten away with committed morally questionable needs, but their actions soon catch up to them. In 80's movies, there's no karma. But in the case of films like this, I desperately wish there were.",Weird Science

Basically two teenage boys, the geeks of their high school are sick of having no friends, no luck and being repeatedly ignored, so one day they set out to create their own living, breathing woman (yeah you heard me right), this woman is a pure stereotype, every man's dream, a sexual fantasy for every young boy. The whole premise of ""Weird Science"" is bizarre, like whoever wrote it was seriously stoned at the time, and thank goodness they were; it has many loopholes that are left unexplained, but who cares about loopholes, right?
It pretty much sums the 80's up in a just over an hour and a half..., one of those films that stays with you lingering in your mind for days, just how cool and camp it is, you never get films this bizarre and successful and long lasting these days, like Hollywood, or time itself, has lost its touch. It has a young Robert Downey Jr in a smaller role and Kelly LeBrock in the leading role, an iconic sex symbol of ever there was one.

That message – horny boys and science is a wicked combination. Once you see John Hughes' masterpiece about Frankensex, you will be asking yourself why you ever quoted The Breakfast Club. I sense you doubting that Weird Science effectively taps into the troubled teen psyche with sincerity and insight. Well consider the following. A bodacious babe is front and center with Einstein's intellect and essence of David Lee Roth. A teenage girl is stripped naked by a vacuum cleaner chimney – which is okay cuz it's in the name of science. Bill Paxton is reduced to a Jim Hensonesque troll! A giant phallic missile penetrates a suburban house. Still not convinced? Well, just watch the last half hour. A gang of road ragers crashes the obligatory 80s teen party, do donuts all over the floors and smack random guys in the crotch.

There are so many good one liners and visual gags that it just puts this film into awesome territory.This film knows exactly what it is and just embraces it. Yes it can be silly,outrageous and funny but the film has heart as well. The coming of age journey that these boys go through with the help of Lisa is just really heartwarming and shows that you don't have to be popular and being yourself is all that really matters. This theme has been done many times before but the low fantasy concept breaths new life into it. Can it be dated at times? Yes a little. Can it be overly silly at times? Yes but I think that works more in the films favor rather than against it. The positives outshine the negatives.Check this film out it might surprise you.

Its even entirely chaste, making it a feminist nerd fantasy, which explains the writers and thus the characters inability to understand women and the social dynamics involved.I don't even really understand the appeal of Kelly lebrock, she's a generic model brunette, only distinguished by her british accent.In the end nothing is learned, nothing real is explored, just random hijinks of the very lame. Was only interesting to see an early Robert Downy Jr role, especially since he looks rather goofy in this film, very far from handsome.You are better off watching Mannequin from 1987, it pulls off the absurd premise correctly, Cantrell has warmth and charm where Lebrock has only an assertive accent, and the film has fun with its premise in a way where by the end you forgive the flaws.",Weird Science

Instead of giving them what they want, the all-knowing Lisa gives them what she knows they really want. They want to be popular, well liked, cool, and most of all, popular with the ladies.

I think 'Sixteen Candles,' 'Ferris Bueller,' and 'The Breakfast Club' are all overrated. They're not bad movies, I've just never personally found them very interesting.

It may bore teens who grew up in the 90's, who have become desensitized with the ""extreme/in your face"" crap that is being fed down their throat, but if they want to enjoy a decade that was truly enjoyable, here's the movie. I gave it a solid 7 of 10 rating.",Weird Science
106,Defected74,Great 80's campy John Hughes movie,9,27 January 2021,"""Hey, Gary? BTW, why are we wearing bras on our heads?"" ""Ceremonial."" She's alive, ALIVE!!
This movie is not going to impress any teen boy born after 1990, but it is definitely fun nostalgia for teen boys of the 80's, and it stars the hot Kelly Lebrock!! I saw at the theater with my friends and had a blast. It's silly, over-the-top humor that is meant to entertain without any effort. For those who discredit this movie, they obviously didn't grow up in a suburban square state town hanging out at the mall eating candy, drinking too much soda, and playing at an arcade wishing the girls would just talk to them. This movie is full of one-liners, and I wish these types of movies would get a 4K remaster. I watch it about twice a year just for sh-ts and giggles.",Weird Science
107,idontneedyourjunk,No science. Paxton is a blob.,1,1 October 2017,"From John Hughes, the director/producer/writer of 16 Candles, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Pretty In Pink, comes this steaming mound of elephant excrement.Two nerds plug electric wires into a Barbie doll, hack into a Pentagon supercomputer using a Memotech MTX512 (64KB of RAM) and use this extra computing power OVER DIALUP to create a 3D digital hardlight woman who also happens to have magic powers. If they had used NASA's computer, it would be a remake of 'I Dream Of Jeannie'.The 25 year old computer genie then gets the two 15 year old guys drunk, offers to have sex with them and then throws a party for them to get laid. Typical hijinks for an 80s teen movie, sure. But the director wanted to film his sequel, which would see the sex roles reversed. A 25 year old guy gets two 15 year old girls drunk, offers to have sex with them... yeah, I don't think that's in the same genre.Meanwhile, the nerds are too nerdy for sex, so she throws them a party instead, where the house gets trashed, she magically conjures up other people, and they stage a home invasion in order to trick two girls to fall for them.Bill Paxton does his best as an army gungho brother who is a typical movie bully, but his part falls flat, as does the rest of this movie.The movie ends with a Genius Ex Machina, where the house is completely restored, there are no repercussions, and the two girls are supposedly in love now after having dumped their previous boyfriends a few hours ago.It somehow spawned a TV series that ran for 5 years.Demi Moore (Ghost, A Few Good Men, GI Jane) and Robin Wright (Princess Bride, Forrest Gump, House of Cards, Blade Runner 2049) auditioned for the part of Lisa The Genie.Starring: Robert Minkoff, 71 bit parts over 17 years. Wow. (A bit part is where you have some small dialogue with a supporting or lead character). He was never a lead or support, but averaged over 4 movies a year.Kevin Thompson, one of the dwarfs who operates the suit (when Paxton gets turned into a blob), also played the bear toy in Bladerunner, and an ewok in Star Wars (including the god-awful TV movies).Mikul Robins, random dancer at the party, will appear in another movie with Paxton, Commando.Wallace Langham, from nobody in this movie, to David Hodges on CSI (only took 8 years to get on the opening credits).Chino 'Fats' Willams, drove the front loader in Terminator, now a bar patron getting drunk with some very white 15 year olds trying to talk black. Cringeworthy.Vernon Wells, bikie in Mad Max 2, then bikie leader here. Lead antagonist in Commando (Bennett).Robert Downey Jr, as a pretentious jerk who is only concerned with his looks and getting the girl. So, he hasn't changed much.Ilan Mitchell-Smith, lead nerd, now a professor of medieval literature, getting a cameo on The Goldbergs (Weird Science homage episode).Kelly LeBrock, fashion model, starred in Woman In Red, her then-husband was the producer, divorced 2 years later. Starred in Hard To Kill, her then-husband was the other co-star, Steven Seagal. Divorced six years later.Anthony Michael Hall (The Dead Zone, Warehouse 13, The Breakfast Club, 16 Candles), one of the most annoying movie nerds, definitely the worst hairstyle (which he kept for like, a decade. Even through his 2 years where he became a unemployed drunk).",Weird Science
108,Idolprincess,That was made by John Hughes?,6,14 July 2004,"I've always been a fan of John Hughes movies, even the goofy comedies like Vacation. My boyfriend is a fan of that movie so I decided to watch it, even though I was septic. I didn't know it was made by John Hughes when I rented it, and I thought I was going to see just another 80's goofy comedy, which is pretty much what it is in general.I'm not sure if I liked that movie. I liked the silly story, two geeky teenagers making the perfect woman with their computer who becomes like a big sister to them who gives them advice. It's also so badly made and silly that it can be hilarious for that reason. [ Just watch the scene where they create the girl ]But sometimes it just seemed like an excuse to give real geeky guys something to dream about. The two main characters aren't even that interesting or funny. One of them is a fun character because he's very shy and scared of people around him, but in my opinion, the other character is extremely annoying. I usually like pointless and goofy movies but I was completely discouraged at the end of this movie when there was an attempt at a love story. I know this movie doesn't take itself seriously, but come on...I didn't find this movie very funny overall. It just seemed like another sex comedy for teens. It's sort of like a really bad cross between ""American Pie"" and ""Mannequin"". I laughed sometimes, by example, when the two protagonists have bras over their heads, but I don't think anything made me laugh aside from this scene and the general goofy-ness of the movie.
I'm not going to talk about the acting either. The appeal in a movie like this one is that it's so stupid and badly made that it can be fun to watch. It can be a good addition to your 80's classic comedies collection as well.",Weird Science

It has everything that the 80s a great era to grow up in.The best feature was the computer nurds trying to create the perfect woman, who completely turned there world upside down.It's has everything. Two very cute girls Deb and Hilly, the nurds Gary and Wyatt. Two grandparents in the cupboard, three killer mutants who create their own party, a toad-like creature with a cru-cut hairstyle which turns out to be Wyatt's brother and not forgetting the beautiful woman herself Lisa. Another great aspect about this movie and others in the 80s generation is the heavy rock soundtrack which accompanies this film. All in All great fun. I recommend it.I do have one question though. Why make a series out of this movie, it was great as a film, but not as a series.",Weird Science

I do not remember the first time I saw this movie, but I can tell you it has been one of my absolute favorites since I can remember. Generally, some of my favorite films are the brain-children of John Hughes (The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles are classics). That being said, everyone should see this movie at least one if not 100 times. I always seem to watch it in its entirety whenever it is on TV. It is one of those classic 80s teen movies that just delivers everything it should. Granted, it is not Oscar worthy or anything like that. But it is one of those movies that you just love to watch. I won't comment on the plot for those of you who may not have seen this, but I strongly urge you to see whenever you can. Nearly 20 years after its release it is still worth watching (plus it is fun to mock the typical 80s fashion choices). In short, I love it and I think you will too.",Weird Science

We are probably the only age group to have witnessed the change the technology first hand. Floppies, monitors, those 2d line graphics to the cutting edge technology we see today. I came across this movie while reading Robert Downey Jr's biography. Weird Science is over the top, yes, but in a quirky way. The film captures the 80's geeks, fashion, class rivalry & classic fun. The plot is simple. 2 geeks wish they could fit in and rise one up above their rivals. They use technology to create a woman of their dreams. Things are going their way and in the process they are transformed by her . The jokes are crude however some parts of the movie are genuinely funny. Bottom-line, don't think too much while watching this movie. Just go with the flow. travel back in time and revel in memories that flood you!",Weird Science
113,Tim-177,What was John Hughes thinking?,1,24 June 1999,"When this movie first came out, the reviewer in my local newspaper began his review with ""This offensive mess..."" and finished by giving it an F minus. He was being way too generous.  So was Leonard Maltin when he gave it 1 and 1/2 stars, although his use of the word ""appalling"" is pretty much on target.  The boys wear jock straps on their heads; the sadistic older brother/military school cadet refers to the 2 main characters as donkey genitalia (not a direct quote; I'm too much of a gentleman to use the correct word here and if I did use it, it would probably be expurgated); and one character gets turned into a three-foot-tall clod of steaming manure (how symbolic).  The TV series on which this movie was based was marginally better; possibly because the censors were on duty.  John Hughes wrote this thing in two days?  I'm not surprised.  This is the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen.  Take my advice and pass this by; THERE IS NOTHING WORTH SEEING IN THIS WRETCHED EXCUSE FOR A MOVIE!",Weird Science

Maybe I would have liked it if I watched it then. I really enjoy some of John Hughes other films. I finally watched this for the first time.The acting is wooden, the jokes are lame, and the premise is incredibly stupid. The movie is also very dated as my two teenage children could not make it through 20 minutes of this movie.The special effects are decent for the time, but movies do not hold up solely on the strength of their special effects.

It still gets some good gags in and Bill Paxton has the role of a lifetime as Chet, the abusive older brother of one of the protagonists of the film. All the scenes with Paxton are hilarious and I dare you not to laugh out loud when he delivers the wedgie.Kelly Lebrock is so hot in this and that voice is so sexy. When I was a kid, this was as cool as female roles got.Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith flounder as the two leads. They are not very likable and while AMH at least has something going for him, Ilan is terribly miscast and that voice will haunt you. It is not surprising Ilan never made much of himself as an actor.They play this on TV a lot and I'm giving you the OK to check it out the next time they do.

Pluses: As a person in 2014 looking back on a film from the 80's I'm willing to give the film a lot of latitude. The fx, the clothing, the hairstyles, even the plot. This film will eventually be forgotten or used to showcase eighties film clichés. It's not well made for our time. It's retro, and those kinds of films are fun sometimes. Minuses: The girl is created in the first few minutes of the film and there's no real surprise from anyone. It's just given that she's there. Lisa sets up situations to make the boys accept themselves and there is nothing that she does that would lead to that end, so the ending is frustrating to sit through.

Somehow they create a sexy computer genie lady and much craziness and laughter ensues. It's so good you can't even count the laughs on a centipede.This film riffs on Frankenstein and various eighties film clichés but uses really great dialogue and original comedic situations, whilst dealing with all the issues an unpopular teenager has.Anthony Michael Hall is a genius who sadly faded, and John Hughes has also fallen by the wayside but this will forever be their finest achievement and I urge you to catch it on region 1 DVD, because it's difficult to get anywhere else.Bill Paxton is also great and you will also notice a early appearance from Robert Downey Jr.",Weird Science

The story of two young fellows searching for women. They can't get any because they are geeks. They create a woman by the computer, and that's what's really interesting about this movie. It has a story witch is great. The boys acts good and it's good music too. The thing i like about this movie is that it's so funny and it's interesting too. Once you've put your eyes on the movie, you can't stop looking. That irritates me sometimes when i am in a hurry and you can't stop watching.
80's movies have something special. They're both funny and very good at the same time. That surprises me sometimes. I just love when movies has both good music and is funny too. I think 80's movies are very good sometimes because i love music from the 80's. I really think the music affects the other things. And music is a big part of my head, i think.

121,Schmuck-4,"Well, I'm confused.",10,1 August 1999,"I watched and thoroughly enjoyed this classic film and was appalled to see the scathing remarks my fellow Internet users wrote about WEIRD SCIENCE. Their main criticisms of this film seemed to be based on the fact that it is a 1980s movie and therefore must be completely irrelevant and trashy, fourteen years later.What?!?Just because something is old, is it automatically defunct? Is anything from the 80s defined as crap, solely because it is from the 80s?Well, I'd better go and throw myself off a bridge or something, because I was born in 1980 and therefore I must be Past My Use-By Date, and perhaps No Longer Of Any Relevance To This Glorious Decade.But seriously folks. I realise that the 90s is a very anger-oriented decade, and people like to hate anything that isn't from the 90s just because it's fashionable to do so. But that just isn't what the art of film-making is about. Film-making is about being on the cutting edge, indeed, but it is also about respecting fine traditions laid down (gasp) in the past, even (shock, horror) in the 80s. Many 90s films, in their attempts to be avant-garde and completely different to everything from the past, just end up going overboard and get tripped up by their own self-conscious sensationalism.But I digress. This film may indeed contain music and fashions that are different to the somewhat ridiculous contemporary 90s equivalents. But don't judge a book by its cover. Beneath the very 80s exterior lies a brilliantly funny movie, with themes and ideas that are just as relevant today as they were in the 1980s. And the special effects still look good today; they don't have that oh-so-clichéd 90s computer-generated tackiness. And what other film have you ever seen that involves a grand piano being launched from a chimney and landing on a summer-house? I give this film a solid *** and a half out of ****. And remember, what goes around comes around: People in 2013 will be laughing their heads off at the bad fashions, horrid music and corny special effects from the movies of 1999. The 80s have a certain timelessness, however, evident in such great movies as this one.",Weird Science

But, it has sadly fallen on tough times. Any 20 year old movie would show its age; the effects, the clothes and the slang are all terribly dated now, but that happens to all movies.Where this movie got killed was in syndication. Since, it was so popular, it got shown on many of the big cable networks like TNT, USA and TBS. But, those networks also cut the movie up to fit with ""broadcast"" standards. So, not only does it look like an old movie, some of the dialog is dubbed over (badly) to remove any offensive words and some funny scenes are just cut altogether to make it more family friendly. And in so doing, the film is almost unwatchable. So, any teen watching this movie today will be left wondering what the big deal was. If you can see the uncut version, this is a fun film. But unless it magically appears on DVD, it will probably remain a joke that kids born after 1985 just don't get.",Weird Science

I heard that it was written in just a couple of hours, which looking at it seems to make perfect sense seeings the plot is so loosley put together and the situations so far fetched it's almost as if John Hughes asked us to forget about logic for a couple of hours and just sit back and enjoy the ride, this I did, and I was not disappointed.",Weird Science

Look at the casting. Anthony Michael Hall was tolerable in other John Hughes' movies as a supporting character, filling the nerd quotient. As a lead, however(even a lead nerd)?...I think that question answers itself. Who was Robert Downey, Jr. supposed to be playing? Were the love interests some of the worst drawn roles ever? The only character I liked was Lisa and Vanessa Angel proved to be a much better choice for the role 10 years later.There were a lot of great 80's movies about teens and for them, but Weird Science just doesn't belong.

But this was is quite unbelievable.The acting is utterly abysmal - particularly Kelly LeBrock, who is totally talent-free. The storyline stinks to high heaven and is so politically incorrect it would make even the most severe male chauvinist blush. The dialogue is truly ghastly and made me cringe on many occasions. ""Time Out"" said that it was as though two adolescents had been let loose with a camera.I dare say many will think I am taking it too seriously. Believe me I am not.

The bizarre direct sexual contact between our adult lead and the 14/15 year old boys continues, getting more and more explicit until they're tongue-kissing for a very, VERY long time. I turned the movie off after that. Sorry for being a prude, but these are kids. This is actually happening.

When the two bully characters clamber their way up an escalator in order to check out Lisa, Kelly Lebrock's character, had me in stitches. Another great thing about the movie is the chemistry between the actors. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith play off each other brilliantly and Kelly Lebrock is superb as their love interest. Bill Paxton is also hilariously as the militaristic buffoon ""Chet.""

Sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is good.Although it was fresh upon its release, it hasn't aged well at all.
Relying heavily on sex appeal and cheap laughs, it lacks any depth or real character development.Acting as a time capsule in a sense, displayed with not only through imagery (cheesy visual effects), but the dialogue (political correctness) as well.It holds its place in movie history strictly due to the subject matter at hand and not so much the follow through from Hughes.So if you're looking for to take a wacky trip back to the 80's, this should probably be placed somewhere in the body of your watchlist.",Weird Science

In scenes inspired by classic shows such as ""I dream of Jeanie"" and ""bewitched"", the guys spend the entire weekend doing damage control for the crazy things that she causes to happen. in the midst of it all, there is a coming of age for the boys, who must face bullies and unpopularity in their quest for girlfriends and acceptance among their peers.Lisa does everything to make these guys the epitome of 80's cool. Big hair, skinny ties, suits with shoulder pads, a Ferrari and 911 Porsche, the classic pink Cadillac, etc. The soundtrack is distinctly 80's, with songs by the General Public and Oingo Boingo as some of the stand outs.A pleasant surprise about this movie is how well it has held up over the years. The scene when dorky Wyatt and Gary end up in an all black bar with Lisa still works. Un-pc as it is, the scene where Gary gets drunk and tries to talk like a black man is still hilarious.This movie has several elements I really dig as an adult that were beyond me as a kid. First, Kelly Lebrock's powers and sensuality are both great analogies for the explosive sexuality of a woman and the insecurity of what it is to be a teenage boy. Much like ""Bewitched"" and ""I dream of Jeanie"" an incredibly sensual woman uses her ""powers"" and these dorks spend all their time begging her not to use them. Despite the fact that she is supposed to do whatever Gary and Wyatt ask of her, she is still totally intimidating to them.In one discussion of why the movie ""Elektra"" failed, the critic mentioned that while teenage boys find older women really sexy, they also find them scary. To keep it's appeal to the under 18 set, the movie constantly plays on how intimidated regular guys would be if a real woman were to just pop into their lives.With the old school modem and graphics, the movie also gives a peek into how the world viewed computers not even 20 years ago. There was clearly a belief that someday, computers would be able to do anything, even create life. Author William Gibson envisioned an internet where people would literally plug themselves into their computers. In this movie, the computer has the power of creation. Time has proved that these things are possible, just not quite as sci fi types envisioned them. We do have an internet, but we don't plug our bodies into the computer. And while games like ""Sims"" and ""GTA: San Andreas"" make it possible to have a ""virtual girlfriend"", it's not quite what this movie envisioned.The clutch of this movie is of course the girl herself. Kelly Lebrock sizzles in this movie. She has an understated sexy confidence about her that has not been replicated by anyone other than Angelina Jolie, and her sense of comedic timing is spot on. It's a shame that she more or less disappeared after this movie was made, because she is very memorable in this film. The scene where she picks up Gary at his parents house is the best take on ""meet the parents"" EVER.Finally, this movie served as a great launching pad for a lot of careers. Anthony Michael Hall would have probably become a star if only his next movies had been good (instead of the silly ""Out of Bounds"" and the pathetic ""Johnny Be Good""), but Bill Paxton (who's role as Gary's older brother alone is worth the price of a rental) went on to become a well known a-lister and this early role is classic Paxton (I'd argue that his role as ""Hudson"" in the 1986 movie ""Aliens"" is probably Paxton at his best).So, for the soundtrack, the old school science fiction, the bikini-concept of women's sexuality as something dangerous, and the launch of some great stars, this is a movie well worth revisiting.",Weird Science
138,Pontus-6,Classic,10,30 December 2005,"Along with 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' this is one of John Hughes's best movies. Written over the course of a weekend (also corresponding to the plot time line), Hughes rushes, head first, into 'everything goes'-territory and takes a familiar plot...well, God knows where. I guess this was, sadly actually, only possible in the mid-80s. The lead characters are constantly overexcited, the supporting cast are even more excited in addition to Bill Paxton's key career performance as the 'bully brother' (later on, also as the 'human turd'. Don't ask). It even features a fairly young Robert Downey Jr. with a bra on his head shouting obscenities. After several years in limbo, 'Weird Science' has finally been released on DVD (part of the Hughes triple-feature) but depressingly enough without any extra material. Imagine if Paxton had contributed with a commentary track?",Weird Science
139,Ghetto-4,A visually stunning comedy with much more to it than laughter.,9,29 June 1999,"This is easily the movie I have seen more times than any other film.  A wonderful source of laughter,  nostalgia and warm feeling,  Weird Science sticks out among many of the 1980's teenage angst movies as it tells an amusingly funny story while at the same time retaining a sense of deep seated humanity.  At first glance Weird Science might seem like just another ""coming-of-age"" movie,  but many would agree that between the one-liners and bathroom humor one can find a stunning degree of thought.",Weird Science
140,Mercedes-13,One Of the Best 80's Movies,10,2 July 2000,"Weird Science is such a classic 80's movie you can't help but love it. The plot is about two geeks Gary and Wyatt who create a real life dream girl on their computer, ""I want her to live, I want her to breathe, I want her to aerobicize."" I think the whole movie is hysterical but my favorite part (which isn't in the movie but in some of the TV versions) is when the weenies come to the party on their scooters armed with devo hats. It was too funny. I recommend that if you haven't seen this movie then see it and if you already have then watch it again.",Weird Science
141,sneman,Superb teen movie,10,7 September 2004,"After seeing this film like 10 times when I was younger, I have just seen it again. The film is beginning to show it's age compared to newer movies, but I would surely recommend it anyway. Alone the story line is great. (A little more below the spoiler warning)The first couple of times I saw this when I was younger I would give it a 10/10, so lets keep it that way =)(POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD)2 boys, a computer, amazing hardware to scan all kinds of things from the most beautiful women around, creating the super hot girl of their dreams.Off course she has a little bit of magic, creating everything they boys have dreamt about. Big parties, state of the art cars, and the cool factor having a beautiful girl hanging around.I would recommend this to everyone who liked other teen movies, because this one of the better ones.",Weird Science
142,lynnwatts,whoa!,10,21 October 2007,"I like this movie.""It's purely sexual.""like the computer that Wyatt has.I don't know the name,but i like it. i like the characters Wyatt,Gary and Lisa(who was named after Apple's first GUI computer,the Apple Lisa.I think there is a reference to the TLC music video to Unpretty when Chilli's boyfriend goes on the thing on his laptop that extends the woman's boobs.Have you got one of those at your home,or don't they exist anymore? I think it would be cool to have one of those.I also like the theme song to weird science performed by Oingo Boingo(once called The Mystic Knights Of Oingo Boingo).The movie was made in 1985.",Weird Science
143,billyboybowden,Weird Science - Together they made the perfect movie,10,5 July 2012,"Two guys considered losers in a US high school (Gary & Wyatt) decide to ""make the perfect woman"" (Kelly LeBrock) they soon become the two most popular guys in school grabbing the attention of the two hottest girls in school, classic 80's movie. This film is hilarious for many reasons, the two main characters are likable, the ""perfect woman"" is witty and smart plus an 80's pin up. There are scenes beyond the films years, a giant turd brother, frozen Gran & granddad and a giant blue missile... I just love it from start to finish. The story is basic but well written, imaginative and filled with 80's fashion, mall scenes and everything needed to enjoy a totally retro movie. All the additional characters are funny, Chet, the parents, the bad guys and the motor cycle rockers from another planet. I have seen this movie roughly 30 times and still love it.",Weird Science
144,Gav-9,Bad haircuts and eighties panache,9,4 May 1999,"Weird Science is a film for a generation, not that other generation won't enjoy this.  This film which to be honest is so old even the BBC have shown it more than twice, captured my friends and I.  The film manages to mix belly aching laughter with dodgy eighties soundtrack music.  In fact I'd have to say that if you like the eighties and bad fashions this film can't help but hit the spot.However the lack of a real plot actually makes this film better, so those who don't like it I'm afraid it's a little over your heads people.  With excellent performances from most concerns and all your favourite ""strange looking"" actors for the biker freaks scene.  With one liners a plenty, this is the one you mention down the pub along with ""Do you remember Bagpuss?"" and you can even remember Kelly Le Brock, YES!All in all a cracking film and one worth a sly mention ever now and again, heartily recommended!",Weird Science
145,kim-erp-vp,Most Excellent,8,21 March 2021,"This film is funny (the brother is a riot), has some Mad Max style action and showcases the foremost programmers in the world (anyone who can program a hot hard body like that must be).What else do you want?Show us more women like her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Weird Science
146,hames-jamsa,Good film but also adisappointment,8,26 May 2021,"Of course I am watching this again. John Hughes knew how to create characters and this is fun. You find one or more characters you identify with or want to be (with).The film and even DVD extras are ultimately disappointing. No upskirt or panty shots. I guess you had to be an actor/programmer on the set! Oh well.Women, this is what we men desire, want, crave, covet. That is why they could program anything and programmed her... oh the two chicks (teens) are also thin and not bad at all.",Weird Science
147,mklin-50006,A complete mess,1,21 June 2018,"I grew up watching the movies of the the late John Hughes and I love a few of them dearly. Weird Science isn't one of them....not even close. I found no charm in the movie. The humor is lazy and dim-witted. I never found myself rooting for any of the characters. In many of Hughes other movies, the characters were well drawn and had depth. These characters are a deep as the average puddle. Perhaps if this move had gone the more raunchy route it could have been better. Kind of a Porky's like vibe. The one and I do mean one bright spot is the performance of the late and in my opinion great Bill Paxton. He is like a bolt of electricity when he is on screen. There are several John Hughes movies that are worth seeing. Saying Weird Science is a waste of time us an understatement.",Weird Science
148,el_Vasco,John Hughes made this crap?,3,17 August 2006,"I find it unbelievable that John Hughes, director of comedy classics like Ferris Bueller and The Breakfast Club, actually wrote and directed this piece of junk. There is no justification for this movie; the humor is painfully weak (minus a few scenes namely involving Kelly LeBrock) and the acting terrible, while only at about 1h 20min it felt about half an hour too long. All the crashing, yelling and screaming grew so tedious by the end that I was left wondering why I didn't flick it off half way through. I guess I was expecting something genuinely funny or interesting to happen. I don't think it should matter that I saw this movie 21 years after it came out, because The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off were superb films made within a year of Weird Science. I'm sorry to say this about a Hughes film (obviously set in Chicago, Shermer High School), but avoid this movie at all costs.",Weird Science
149,nick-296,The best of 80's nostalgia in one movie!,10,28 August 1999,"I don't understand how anyone can describe this movie as anything short of a masterpiece.  So, all comedies are not funny anymore after you've seen them for quite a few times, but the difference with Weird Science is that you can still watch it over and over again, without getting bored with it.  It is fun to watch, and it should appeal to anyone, not people who were teenagers in the 80's.  I myself, am now only 19, so, I was no teenager in the 80's, but with an intelligent, objective, opinion, I'd say 80's movies and music are the best.Despite the fact that Wyatt and Gary ""create"" Lisa, who cares if it is unrealistic?  If you can live yourself into this movie, become part of the fun, you'd have a ball.All the main characters are very funny.  Parts I single out is Lisa asking the old lady for advice on underwear for a 15 year-old; Chet turning into that little monster, Gary and Wyatt in the mall, the list goes on!Even the special effects are quite good for that time.Apart from funny moments throughout the movie, in the end you can also learn something, where Gary says to Debbie:  ""Because I want you to like me for me"", and she replies:  ""Whatever you are I like it"".  Whereas today, money, looks, etc. are the thing.It is also so sweet in the end, where Lisa says goodbye, what she says to them, the farewell, it is just so overall endearing!  Which just makes you love this movie even more.The sound track is also quite nice, with Weird Science being played at just the right moment each time.I've come across a few people who always give negative comments about this movie, and surprisingly enough they're all teenagers in the 90's mostly. My advice to anyone watching this movie, remember the 80's was a different era than now, the fashion, the music, everything was different.  Take time out, and just see this movie for what it is, a great fun-filled movie, that anyone can enjoy.  The prejudice that such a lot of people have against the 80's is beyond comprehension to me anyway.  Anyone who watches it, cant help but go crazy about Gary, Wyatt and Lisa, who are all such endearing characters.This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the fashion and the music in it just adds to that 80's nostalgia that this film gives you.To end off this movie could do with a sequel, with Gary and Wyatt, married, life going downhill again, and once again calling upon Lisa to ""straighten"" them out.I gave it 10/10.  Watch and see if you do too.",Weird Science
150,Johnny Knoxville,Pure nostalgic fun,8,5 May 2002,"I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and I thought it was great. Yeah, looking back at it now it's quite trashy but that's sort of the fun of it. It's a no-brainer. Just stupidity and laughs. There's not one person I've met who hasn't seen it. It's like Porky's or Evil Dead 2, everyone remembers it and has fond memories of it. Hell, me and my friends could probably sit down and quote our way through the film. If you haven't seen this I totally recommend it. As long as you're not gonna take it seriously.",Weird Science
151,blackandamber,80s Teen Surrealism,5,2 July 2002,"The teen movie genre of the 1980s had as its central premise 'finding a partner'. So this movie is no exception but where it differs is its bizarre way of hammering home the obvious messages this film contains.
The plot for those who aren't aware concerns two 'nerds' who decide to create a woman using their computer(!).  As a young teen myself watching this for the first time I never really considered how totally out there this John Hughes film is.  Apart from the idea of creating a perfect woman who does everything you want (a horrendously sexist idea that is hardly redeemed by the weak moralising at the end), we have snow falling in someones' bedroom, a kitchen turned blue, nuclear warheads sprouting through a bedroom floor and furniture flying through chimneys.  The one part of this film that really strikes me as odd is where did Kelly Le Brock (who plays Lisa the created woman) get her powers to make all this weird stuff happen?I was pretty disappointed when I revisited this.  Nostalgia had created this movie as a minor classic in my rose tinted eyes. In reality all I found was a plot full of holes, an unpleasant teen fantasy and a director who looked like he couldn't give a damn about any more 'nerdy teens come good'.",Weird Science
152,try2awake,ahead of its time,10,8 April 2005,"This film seems way ahead of its ahead of its time, in its music quality and production. This film rocks ... the kind of film I can watch again and again. It is entertaining, funny, and touching near the end when Lisa says goodbye. Gary and Wyatt and a great duo, one of them the nerd, the other the cockier one who makes out to be cooler. I'm not into teen or sci-fi movies, but this has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. It's up there with the classic eighties movies - Back to the Future, Superman 3, Karate Kid, Rocky 3. I recorded it on VHS when I was twelve. Call me a nerd, but I'm twenty-five now and still enjoy watching it. The funny bit for me was when Chet and Wyatt are in the kitchen, Chet says ""next thing you'll be wearing a bra on your head"" and Wyatt looks to the camera.",Weird Science
153,larvellishere,WEIRD SCIENCE (1985),7,31 March 2018,"Weird science is a raunchy comedy for younger teens but still gets away with more than a lot of other raunchy comedies.

And she is played by the beautiful Kelly LeBrock and this film awesome so go check it out.",Weird Science
154,Carver-3,Longevity - still funny today. John Hughes is masterful.,10,29 January 1999,"For anyone who spent their pre/early teens in the late '80s, this film made a huge impact.

155,imagineer100,A Wonderful Film for this age and the last!!!!,10,25 May 2007,This film by director John Hughs is simply fantastic!! The movies begins with you jeering the second rate special effects and wondering where the hell this came from. Then the movie actually gets started and you can't help but laugh yourself silly!!! Anthony Michael Hall and co-star Ilan Mitchell-Smith light up the show with one of Hall's best performances and Smith is perfect for the role of the best friend. LeBrock sends a sexy performance through and Paxton is a hoot to watch in one of his first ever films. Wonderful acting!! More important than that is that the film is funny!!!! You will not go two seconds without laughing and Hall and LeBrock have some of the best lines ever put in a comedy movie.Wonderful film for all the ages!!! 100/10,Weird Science

They are oppressed by the society. Lisa - the cool fictional woman - teaches them how to become popular and brings out their best qualities. The good story combined with the excellent jokes and awkward situations creates a very nice setting for a true comedy. The characters are very well ""constructed"". One of the most important features of this movie is that it teaches people to be brave.I watched this movie as a child and i loved it. My opinion is that this should be a classic not just a mere comedy of the 80's. I hope all who watch the movie will be very satisfied with it :)",Weird Science

I think it's just because i'm only 13 and i like those kinds of movies...also in movies that i watch, they seem better with some attractive guys in them. In this movie Ilan Mitchell-Smith(who played Wyatt) was really hot!This movie is great, it's by far the best movie from the 80's ever. I think it's awesome to watch it and think of how times have changed movie-wise. This is kind of a cheesy movie compared to movies today, but it's still by far, my favorite ever!The best part in that movie is where at the end all the bikers come..i can't remember if they were bikers or not, but i think they were.

I'm a huge fan of 80's films and this film does not disappoint. It's extremely entertaining and certainly worth a watch. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone. Some may find it cheesy, but that's half the fun of it! It's not meant to be taken seriously anyways. What makes this movie great, is that even though this movie is meant to be a comedy, it is also romantic in showing that looks and popularity aren't always what matter.To me, with this film there is never a dull moment..and someone must agree with me, as it spawned it's own T.V. show (which was also wicked)!

I cant thin of a better movie. If anyone is wondering it has just been re released in the UK on region 2 DVD i been waiting for years. If you have seen it and want something a bit more modern from the other perspective i.e girl makes lad then check out English film virtual sexuality. Both films are excellent but the original weird science is better in my opinion but check them out for yourself.There was once a American TV show in 90's of weird science but Lisa was blond and it had been modernized. Not heard about that show for years though.,Weird Science
