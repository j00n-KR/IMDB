0,Leofwine_draca,All-star western is great fun throughout,8,26 January 2017,"This all-star American western of the 1980s appears to be quite divisive on the site, but I thought it was great fun. It does have something of a TV movie atmosphere to it - you just know that it's never going to be too violent or too dark, but rather quite family-friendly - but the plot is good enough to keep you interested and the cast is excellent. Director Lawrence Kasdan injects plenty of life into the proceedings and despite the lengthy running time I was never less than intrigued by the story.The early parts of the film introduce the main characters in their own sub-plots. Hard-man Scott Glenn attempts to look after his precocious younger brother, played by Kevin Costner in a very youthful, slightly annoying turn. Danny Glover is a brooding hero type, coming home to his family after years away. Kevin Kline, best known for a career in comedy, is surprisingly efficient as the expert gunslinger. Others, like Brion James and Rosanna Arquette, don't really have much to do, although Linda Hunt is very good in her smaller part. John Cleese is miscast but thankfully not around too long.The story comes and goes and even during the middle part, where the action scenes are in short supply, I was entertained. Brian Dennehy's larger than life sheriff character helps a lot and seems like he's been imported from FIRST BLOOD. The latter part of the film and climax play out exactly as you'd expect, but the action is well shot and exciting, and the cinematography makes this a gorgeous-looking experience. Overall, I found very little to dislike about it, and in actuality I loved it.",Silverado
1,SnoopyStyle,having some good ole time,7,28 September 2013,"Emmett (Scott Glenn), Paden (Kevin Kline) are a couple of guys bonded over their bad luck with criminals. Emmett and Paden goes to Turley and finds Emmett's brother Jake (Kevin Costner) locked up to be hung. Mal(Danny Glover) is thrown out of town after bigoted men refuse his 'kind' in the bar. When Emmett and Paden break Jake out of jail, Mal helps to keep the posse from catching them. The four horsemen find a wagon train that's been robbed, and they set out to retrieve the money.This is a rip roaring old fashion shoot em up western. Kevin Kline has some fun playing around. Lawrence Kasdan has renewed the western but not necessarily reinvented it. The good guys are good. The bad guys are bad. And the good guys have fun while they rewrite wrongs and battle evil.",Silverado
2,claudio_carvalho,A Constellation of Stars in a Spectacular Western,9,17 April 2004,"While riding to Silverado to meet his brother Jake (Kevin Costner), the lonely cowboy Emmett (Scott Glenn) meets Paden (Kevin Kline) and Malachi 'Mal' Johnson (Danny Glover) in peculiar situations and they become friends. Along their journey to Silverado, they join and protect a caravan of new comers. In Silverado, they find a group of bandits frightening the locals under the protection of Sheriff Cobb (Brian Dennehy), and they join forces to fight against them. This western movie is spectacular. Yesterday, I saw it for the first time, and in 2004, it is amazing the cast joined by Lawrence Kasdan and the producers. With lots of funny situations, full of action, politically correct, with the `good guys' winning the `bad guys', it is impossible not to like this film! The role of the agile Kevin Costner, in the beginning of career, is very funny. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Silverado'",Silverado
3,kosmasp,30 years later,7,2 May 2015,"It had been a while since I first saw this movie and I just refreshed my memory the other day. And while it remains likable with some fine actors in it, it didn't age well at all. Other reviewers have written about the clichés along the way. But you can't fault a movie for things that are now a given, when they might not have been at the time of the production of said movie.The movie is still good though, but some character choices seem odd to say the least. Kevin Costner is a great actor, but while he seemingly has fun with his free spirited character, you don't really buy it as a viewer. Kevin Kline makes the best impression of all, which all boils down to the fact, that they tried too much. Too many characters, too many things going on, none of which stay long enough to keep the viewer hooked all the way through. This may be nit-picking, but it's what is missing from making this a really superb western",Silverado
4,classicsoncall,"""I'm not a great believer in doin' nothing.""",7,29 November 2006,"The highly improbable logistics of the opening scene with the exploding stove top sets the viewer up for a fun ride, one in which you don't know what to expect as the opening credits roll. Kevin Kline and John Cleese - is it a Monty Python Western? Scott Glenn looking like a misplaced Carradine brother. Kevin Costner way back in 1985 - with not a thought of ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Open Range"" in sight. Brian Dennehy, Danny Glover, Rosanna Arquette, you have to pinch yourself over the names that back then weren't household words, but combined here make up one of the more eclectic casts in the genre.It's too bad actually that Cleese didn't have more to do here. His first appearance on screen as Sheriff Langston is so out of place that it adds another layer of ambiguity to the film. I couldn't restrain myself from cracking up over his line after Mal (Glover) breaks up the barroom - ""I don't tolerate this kind of thing, it's hard on the peace and hard on the furniture"".The on again, off again relationship of the four companion protagonists is nicely balanced with focus on the characters as individuals as well. Kline's character Paden is probably the most rounded, particularly in his relationship with Stella the Midnight Star (Linda Hunt). His final showdown with Cobb (Dennehy) relives the classic falling out of partners seeking vengeance and justice in a gunfight with only one outcome possible.Still, the film winds up confusing at times, like in the treatment of Rosanna Arquette's character. She starts out married, feigns a flirtation with Paden, is eyed by Emmett (Glenn), and then winds up without a partner by the time it's all over. There's also the separate rivalries between the good guys and Cobb's men, as well as the good guys and the McKendrick bunch. I kept wondering how all the elements would eventually tie together, but they don't. It seems to me the story's flow would have been better served by a buildup to a single confrontation in the tradition of your standard Western. However I don't think director Lawrene Kasdan was going for standard in his homage to the genre. If you go with the flow of the story, you're better served by the action scenes, gorgeous cinematography, and exciting music score when each take their turn.",Silverado
5,gavin6942,"A Nice, Modern Take on the Western",7,24 July 2017,"A misfit bunch of friends come together to right the injustices which exist in a small town.The western genre is not something I grew up with or really cared much for, bu it is starting to grow on me. And films like this help a lot, because it is somewhat unconventional and has an excellent cast. Some of these guys were huge, or just on the verge of being huge. And then casting John Cleese as a sheriff... an Englishman in the Old West? I do wish there had been more Jeff Goldblum, and the ladies never get a lot of screen time. This could have been a big film for Amanda Wyss, but we barely get to see her. At least we have Scott Glenn, who really ought to be a bigger name than he ever was.",Silverado
6,ccthemovieman-1,"An Entertainng, Underrated Western",9,24 June 2006,"If you are looking for a very entertaining western, it's hard to top this one. It's fairly long at 134 minutes, but the deep cast and always-interesting story make the time fly by.The first half of the film is about as good as it gets but two climactic scenes at the end get a little too carried away with the ""Rambo"" mentality of good guys not getting shot when they should have, etc. But, overall, it's so good it is still very highly-recommended. Among the ""lists"" you see on this website's message boards and elsewhere, you rarely see this movie mentioned among top westerns and that is a huge oversight.There are four main ""good guys"" that are played by well-known actors: Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner and Danny Glover. I especially liked Kline as ""Paden"" with his gentlemanly manner about him and Glenn's voice always makes him interesting. Costner is so young looking he almost looks like a teenager.Brian Dennehy, as the villainous ""Sheriff Cobb,"" is verbally restrained in here, which was nice to hear, for a change but he's still intense and fascinating. (This movie marked the 10,000th time Hollywood made a lawman the villain since the 1960s).The story is fun, a straight cowboy movie with no romances or gratuitous sex scenes thrown in and has the usual beautiful western scenery and photography. The only problem was the sound. The soundtrack is so loud so have to crank up your center speaker to hear the dialog over the music.",Silverado
7,rmax304823,Boys Just Want To Have Fun.,6,8 February 2018,"Four cowboys meet by happenstance in the Western wilderness, have lots of fun, and then are subject to serious transgressions by a corrupt sheriff and some evil cattlemen. Kline, Glenn, Costner, and Glover are the initially happy travelers. Their characters' names are Padem, Emmet, Jake, and Mal. I conducted a scholarly study of cowboy names of the period and not one of them had a name like Padem, Emmet, Jake, Mal, Matt, Link, Ringo, Jesse, Clay, or Latigo. As a matter of fact, the four most common names were Governeur, Montmorency, Noble, and Bolingbroke. The results can be found in ""Onomastics of the Post Civil War American West,"" readily available in the back of the bottom shelf of my grand garçon, never published and never will be.The movie? It starts out kind of fun. Costner is a light-hearted young man and a dead shot. You'd have difficulty imagining him in his later roles. Danny Glover is a dead shot too, with his Henry rifle. In fact they're all dead shots and fast draws except the bad guys who are uniformly slow and ragged in their aim. Linda Hunt has a rather prominent role as a saloon manager. She was born with hypopituitary dwarfism but is a fine actress and actually looks pretty good here. Ben Goldman is an overdressed professional gambler, a sneak who sides with Brian Dennehy, the corrupt sheriff, although how and why he does so, only the editor knows. A few laughs and action aplenty without bath tubs of gore. All the usual conventions of the genre are adhered to. It's diverting and sometimes fun.",Silverado
8,ma-cortes,Very good Western about four tough gunmen who ride together in search of their destiny at a little town,8,11 February 2012,"Epic and breathtaking major Hollywood Western dealing with a strong feuding among some good guys and some very bad guys headed by two-fisted rivals .

9,JohnHowardReid,One for the all-action fan!,8,28 September 2009,"Although it runs a mighty 132 minutes and contains loads of percussive action, Lawrence Kasdan's ""Silverado"" is somewhat hard to take. Unlike ""Heaven's Gate"" which (at least in its uncut version) goes to great lengths to explain the motives of its principal characters, this movie does the opposite. Maybe I missed something, but by the movie's end, I still didn't know what the friendly sheriff (played with a charismatic affability by the solidly built Brian Dennehy) had against the heroic foursome. After all, he had earlier saved Kline's life at the cavalry outpost. True, Scott Glenn had come to his rescue a little earlier, so what we have here is a hero with divided loyalties. That we can understand. But somewhere along the line, without an apology or a by-your-leave, Kline switches sides and joins up with Glenn and his psycho brother (chillingly played with an appropriately hideous hilarity by Kevin Costner) and the equally fearsome Danny Glover. Still, even though his script is faulty, the movie is directed with considerable style and panache by Lawrence Kasdan who had the acumen to cast the always wonderful, multi-awardwinning Linda Hunt in an important role. The scenery, the art direction, photography and music scoring are superb.",Silverado
10,michaelRokeefe,High-spirited and creative western.,8,11 April 2014,"Lawrence Kasdan directs this return to Old West adventure for a new generation of fans. Four unwitting heroes cross paths on their way to a small town called Silverado. They have no idea that their friends and family in the tiny town are controlled by a corrupt sheriff that can command a murderous posse at the snap of a finger. Emmett(Scott Glenn), Paden(Kevin Kline), Jake(Kevin Costner) and Mal(Danny Glover)meet trouble before even getting to Silverado, but the whiskey drinkin', hard fightin' quartet are hard to take advantage of. After getting to Silverado, they end up breaking each other out of jail and methodically try to figure out the bad guys from the good guys; and then go about cleaning up and restoring law to the sleepy little town. Very authentic look and fun watching tricks of the trade to restore the peace. Costner actually proves to have a comedic streak; and I found a new respect for Kline's talents. This outstanding cast also features:John Cleese, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt, Jeff Fahey, Rosanna Arquette and Sheb Wooley.",Silverado
11,hitchcockthelegend,Hi Ho Silver!,8,10 July 2018,"Silverado is directed by Lawrence Kasdan and Lawrence co-writes with his brother Mark. It stars Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover, Kevin Costner, Brian Dennehy, Jeff Goldblum Linda Hunt and Rosanna Arquette. Music is by Bruce Broughton and cinematography by John Bailey.As a big Western fan it's most interesting revisiting Silverado some 30 odd years after its release. In context of the time it first came out, when the genre was a dead duck, it was a bold and beautiful romp. How wonderful to find that with one or two 1980s irks aside, it is still a fine Western beast beating a true genre heart.Ok, it's hardly pulling up trees thematically, in the main because it embraces what it homages, every cliche in scene and writing is respectful to its predecessors, the Kasdan's achieving everything they set out to do - entertain like minded film lovers.Cast are on fine form, clearly enjoying the material and setting of such. The locations are outstanding, the vistas gorgeous, with production design to match. Broughton's musical score is rambunctious and lifts the spirit, even if much of it feels 1980s as opposed to the era of films setting. Action scenes are expertly staged, the improbable irrelevant for joyous rewards, and stunt work high end as well.Themes such as prostitution and racism are only given small acknowledgements, but character building is evident at every turn to fully involve audience from first reel to last. Heroes and anti-heroes, psychos, thieves and power hungry villains, no stone left unturned here. This isn't for those after the grim textures of something like Unforgiven and latterly Hostiles, this is more in keeping with something like Tombstone, or even the much divisive Lone Ranger.Saddle up and enjoy if you haven't already done so! 8/10",Silverado
12,Hey_Sweden,"A robust, large scale, and diverting Western.",7,1 May 2015,"Co-writer, producer and director Lawrence Kasdan did his part in keeping the Western genre alive with ""Silverado"". It may not be innovative, but that may well have been the point, as Kasdan aims to pay tribute to a beloved movie genre that dated all the way back to the silent era. Admittedly, this one came along when the Western was going through a bit of a dry spell, which made it all the more welcome.Four very engaging stars - Kevin Kline as Paden, Scott Glenn as Emmett, Danny Glover as Mal, Kevin Costner as Jake - are an interesting combo, as these characters, united by circumstance, eventually band together to fight against the injustices occurring in the town of Silverado. More than once, they prove their worth, in a story (written by Kasdan and his brother Mark) that is fairly episodic.""Silverado"" is extremely well shot, by John Bailey, in widescreen. It gets the look of a classic Western just right. It hooks you right away with an opening moment of quiet suddenly interrupted by a gunfight, and promises a substantial amount of entertainment to come when we're introduced to the tough and resilient Emmett and get a load of the majestic New Mexico locations. Admittedly, this doesn't work quite as well when you start to think about it too much, so it's better to just go with the flow and appreciate all that Kasdan and his cast & crew have packed into this presentation. Certainly, it would be hard not to get roused by that stirring and wonderful music score composed by Bruce Broughton.There's a lot of acting talent to go around here, but giving things a curious quality is some unexpected casting. Linda Hunt? Jeff Goldblum? JOHN CLEESE? Rosanna Arquette is fairly appealing if somewhat aloof as the gal who catches both Klines' and Glenns' eyes. Jeff Fahey makes his film debut as scruffy psycho Tyree. Lovely ladies Amanda Wyss and Lynn Whitfield play local girl Phoebe and Mals' sister respectively. Recognizable character players in the cast include Marvin J. McIntyre, Sheb Wooley, James Gammon, Ray Baker, Joe Seneca, Earl Hindman, Jim Haynie, Richard Jenkins (also making his film debut), Pepe Serna, Ted White, and an uncredited Brion James as Hobart, the wagon master. The real standout for this viewer is Brian Dennehy, who never overplays his role as villainous sheriff Cobb, instead suffusing the character with a good deal of charm.The pacing rarely slows down, and the action scenes are first rate. Especially good is a scene involving a stampede.While lacking the overall impact for this viewer to consider it great, it's still pretty fun while it lasts.Seven out of 10.",Silverado
13,LeonLouisRicci,The Mild Bunch,6,13 December 2013,"You know there might be trouble in Dodge City when Kevin Costner gives the most endearing Performance in an All Star Cast. But that's not the only problem with this Entertaining, but surprisingly flat, supposed Homage to the Classic Western.It sure is a bloated and beautiful Film, full of many things but shallow to the point of distraction. Clichés are here by design and that is acceptable but that's not enough. There has to be something more, something to make this stand out as its Big Budget demands. Actually the horses and cows show as much panache as the Cast.Everyone seems underwritten and unresolved accept at the most superficial levels. There are jarring inconsistencies in the Editing and the Gunplay is so sterile that it hardly penetrates beyond old TV Stuff. There are some things that make this watchable, notably the Scenery and Costner's before Stardom, free-style of a Jitterbug, Pulpy, twirly Hotshot.Overall, it is a mild and Family Friendly Western done in an era of blood filled Screens. A definite throwback but without much Style. It just sort of is there for the Popcorn Crowd and is a somewhat Overrated Oater that has some charm but not enough to make this anything more than slightly above Average.",Silverado
14,zardoz-13,A Memorable Frontier Shoot'em Up!,10,2 March 2014,"""Bill Chill"" writer & director Lawrence Kasdan made the perfect western ""Silverado"" with Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Kevin Costner, and Danny Glover. This four-fisted horse opera finds an oddball assortment of individuals thrown together into an alliance when they encounter common foes. Clocking in at 133 minutes, ""Silverado"" boasts a number of rambunctious gunfights, with Costner imitating Steve McQueen, right down to riding his horse side saddle. This atmospheric western is reminiscent of those oaters from the 1950s rather than Spaghetti westerns. Kasdan has assembled an impressive supporting cast that includes John Cleese, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt, Jeff Goldblum, James Gammon, Rosana Arquette, and Lyn Whitfield. The production values are stupendous, and ""Silverado"" looks thoroughly genuine. Kasdan's dialogue is memorable, too. The opening scene with Scott Glenn cornered in a shack while several gunmen try to kill him is interesting because we in the audience are trapped alongside Glenn. Relying on his wits, Glenn's cowboy hero never sees any of his assailants but he makes mincemeat of them with his fancy shooting. He is riding to a town called Turley to rendezvous with his impulsive younger brother Jake (Kevin Costner) and runs across Paden (Kevin Kline) left to die in the desert. Emmett nurses Paden back to health and Paden sets out to find the dastards that left him for dead. Meantime, Malachi (Danny Glover of the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise) is going home to see his parents. Kasdan doesn't waste a second in this heavy duty sagebrusher that doesn't rub your nose in gore. Composer Bruce Broughton has created an Elmer Bernstein type orchestral score. Western fans must watch this western!",Silverado
15,view_and_review,"I didn't want a fight, but I'll give you one",8,17 January 2020,"""Silverado"" is nice throwback. The 80's wasn't a decade of many westerns so this was a welcomed sight. It was simple, straight forward, and good. You knew the good guys, you knew the bad guys, and you knew there'd be a shootout.Silverado is the name of the town where everything took place. It all boiled down to the bad guys: the McKendrick gang plus the bought sheriff, Cobb (Brian Dennehy), and the good guys: Emmett (Scott Glenn), Paden (Kevin Kline), Jake (Kevin Costner), and Mal (Danny Glover). Naturally, the good guys were outnumbered but that's OK because the good guys have ways of evening the odds.There were a couple of added wrinkles in the story. The main wrinkle was with Paden; would he stand idly by or would he get involved. Every other good guy had a vested interest in fighting the town terrorizers, but Paden only had a loose connection to the whole matter. He was a key figure that could tip the scales in the favor of the wronged party. The only problem was that he worked for Sheriff Cobb.Decisions, decisions.Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Cobb was a perfect fit. The only guy who could've been as good or better would've been Gene Hackman. Dennehy and Hackman were born to play bad guys. It's like it's in their DNA. I don't know if it's their look, their voice, their easy smugness, or all of the above, but they play such hateful and hateable guys. If there were a Hollywood hall of fame with a wing for bad guys they'd be in it.Kevin Costner played a different role than I'm used to seeing from him. He's normally a calm, reserved, strong silent type. In ""Silverado"" he was an amped up cocky fellow and he played it well.The whole movie played out like you'd hope. There was enough injustice from the antagonists to get you hot and bothered. The good guys were ostensibly on the ropes. When things seemed their direst the rallying music played, the posse was formed, and things got to jumpin'. Yeah, it was everything you wanted in a western.",Silverado
16,neil-476,"Great fun, but...",7,26 July 2009,"I like this movie a lot, but I'm not blind to its faults.So let me point the main ones out before singing its praises.One - it rambles, taking far too long to tell far too much story, much of which is of no consequences (there are so many stock western sequences in it that one gets the impression that, if Kasdan had thought he could have got away with it, there would have been a sequence with Indians attacking the circled wagons).Two, Bruce Broughton's main theme is so ubiquitous that it finally becomes intrusive. You don't have to use the main theme for everything, y'know - you are allowed to have other sub-themes.OK, the good stuff is headed up by the cast - this is a pretty stellar movie, and everyone in it is firing on all cylinders (Costner, do more like this, please). Next, even though much of the movie is concerned with recycling stock western situations, they are all done well. Finally, it is a handsome movie. Every frame looks beautiful.So, worth a visit, but you might get irritated with the music, and your bum may get a bit numb towards the end.",Silverado
17,HotToastyRag,Best western of the modern era,10,8 June 2020,"If you've never seen Silverado, you're missing out on probably the best western to come out of the modern era. Set to one of the best western themes ever written, Bruce Broughton practically conducts the entire movie with his music. I'd listened to the soundtrack for years before I finally watched the movie, and the visuals did not disappoint.Scott Glenn finds himself the target of an ambush, and on his way to town to try and find the villain who ordered it, he comes across Kevin Kline stripped down to his long-johns and left in the desert to die. He rescues Kevin, and they travel to town together. While there, Kevin has an unpleasant interaction with a former friend, Brian Dennehey, and Scott witnesses a bar fight between Danny Glover and a bartender who refuses to serve him. Scott also rescues his impulsive brother, Kevin Costner, from jail, and the four new pals ride off into the sunset together.That's just the beginning! The fantastic introductions make you hopelessly attached to all four leads, and as they each pursue their own revenge goals, you'll be on the edge of your seat. The action scenes are fast-paced (even watching it 35 years later) and exciting, and the plot is just complicated enough to keep you guessing but not confused. Plus, an added bonus is four good-looking leads to drool over (if you can get past Kevin Kline's scraggly beard). Scott Glenn is as rugged as it gets, Danny Glover is charming and sentimental, and Kevin Costner is shockingly adorable. This is one of his earlier movies, before he adopted his ""too cool for school"" attitude, one that perhaps he took on in favor of his next film: The Untouchables. Maybe he took away his wild, youthful enthusiasm to play Elliot Ness and the crusty, unenthusiastic Crash Davis in Bull Durham, and after that, the dye was cast. If he was as cute in all his movies as he was in Silverado, I would absolutely love him.So there you have it, four fantastic reasons to rent or revisit this classic western, and a bonus reason of a beautiful, exciting musical score. As someone who loves good westerns and hates bad ones, I can wholeheartedly recommend this one.",Silverado
18,Wuchakk,"Fun, rip-Roaring Western with too many characters in a complicated story",5,13 March 2014,"Released in 1985, ""Silverado"" is a Western about two brothers (Scott Glenn & Kevin Costner) and two other gents (Kevin Kline & Danny Glover) who become friends and ultimately team-up to take on the corrupt sheriff of the New Mexican town Silverado.The first time I watched ""Silverado"" was in the mid-90s and I was turned off by the implausibility of the prison break scene in the first act, not to mention the nigh goofiness of Costner's character. There's an unrealistic vibe, almost verging on Indiana Jones territory, which is easy to explain since writer/director Lawrence Kasdan also wrote ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981). So it's necessary to accept the implausible heroics to glean from (and enjoy) the meat of the picture, which is essentially a serious story running the gamut of the human condition (e.g. injustice, action, drama, comedy, conflict, etc.).I only bring this up so that viewers who favor realism in their Westerns, like ""Shane"" (1953), ""True Grit"" (1969/2010), ""The Long Riders"" (1980), ""Unforgiven"" (1992) or ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994), will make the necessary mental adjustments before attempting to digest the film. ""Silverado"" is a rip-roaring, rollicking Western in the truest sense. There are a few moral ambiguities (e.g. Jeff Goldblum's character and Paden's conundrum in the story) but, for the most part, the heroes are heroes and the villains drip with evil.One aspect of ""Silverado"" I like, which most post-50s Westerns lack, is the palpable spirit of life, liberty and joy that the heroes & their friends possess. Despite the various evils they experience (which we can all relate to one way or another) they maintain a certain joy of living, the jubilance of life and freedom itself. As such, the film isn't a downer; it's somehow uplifting.Stories like this need a good villain and Brian Dennehy more than fills the bill. He's almost horrifying as the swaggering corrupt sheriff of Silverado. Remember his part as the sheriff in ""First Blood"" (1982)? This is essentially the same role, just exponentially WORSE.The main hero is Kline as Paden. Kline is effective at playing the perfect, likable everyman. Glenn is a quintessential Westerner as Emmett while Costner plays his younger gung-ho brother, Jake. The latter is notably different here than in his other Western roles, ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) ""Wyatt Earp"" and ""Open Range"" (2003). Here he's young & spunky, full of mirth, yet also an expert and deadly gunslinger.After the contrivances and goofiness of the first act, ""Silverado"" finds its footing and I was absorbed & even thrilled by the story up until around the 70-75-minute mark. Unfortunately, from there the story gets convoluted, although it ends with a long, rousing gunfight in the town. It's just that there are so many characters that you tend to lose track and it seems like some expositional scenes were left on the cutting room floor in order to keep the runtime at just over two hours (133 minutes). The subplots concerning Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Goldblum and Linda Hunt are good examples. However, the positive thing about a story like this is that it's not superficial; hence, the movie's worthy of repeat viewings since you're not likely gonna digest it all in just one or two viewings. Yet an intricate story like this needs at least 2.5 hours of runtime in order to breath and be effective. It demands the length of ""Dances with Wolves"" and so I'd be interested in seeing a Director's Cut.Speaking of subplots, I enjoyed certain ones like Kline's love for the midget saloon bartender (Linda Hunt), love in a son/mother sense, that is, but their relationship isn't developed enough. You have to read in between the lines. I also appreciated the love and loyalty of the four protagonists; the fact that Glover is a black man is of no issue. Love in its purest sense is spiritual in nature and transcends blood, skin color or raw lust. You never know who you'll meet in life and form a strong love-bond with. It's amazing.So why not a higher rating? I didn't find the story all that captivating like, say, Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon"" (1991). I'm talking about the last hour where I had to struggle a bit to keep attentive, not to mention keep track of all the characters and what's going on. Then there's the nonsensical editing, obvious missing scenes and a few idiotic implausibilities. Beyond these negatives, ""Silverado"" has most everything you'd ever want in a Western: gunfights, quick-draw showdowns, smoke-filled saloons, saloon girls, homesteaders, wagon trains, outlaws, posses, jailbreaks, stampedes, box canyons, glorious Western locations, and more. Actually, it verges on overkill. About the only thing it doesn't have are Native Americans and an uncomplicated story. The latter explains why you DON'T see ""Silverado"" cited on many Best Westerns lists.The film was shot entirely in New Mexico.GRADE: C+",Silverado
19,Mr-Fusion,"A huge cast, a great director and just a terrific movie",9,6 September 2011,"Easily one of the great Westerns of the last 30 years, ""Silverado"" is one big unapologetic ode to the genre, and an all-around rollicking good time. Boasting a stellar cast, particularly Kevin Kline, Brian Dennehy and Linda Hunt (who steals every scene she's in), it's a well-written, acted, directed and features some gorgeous scenery. Kasdan's expansive story not only weaves together seemingly unrelated threads into one overall destiny, but it imbues its four heroes with a righteous sense of friendship and justice. It's the kind of Western you hope was as fun to make as it is to watch. An undeniable classic.9/10",Silverado

21,JamesHitchcock,A Compendium of Stock Clichés,5,4 March 2011,"By the mid-eighties received opinion in the movie industry was that the Western was dead and buried. Although opinions differed as to the precise cause of death, it was generally agreed that the final nail in the coffin was the failure of Michael Cimino's massive ""Heaven's Gate"".Two men dared to defy received opinion; Clint Eastwood and Lawrence Kasdan.That Eastwood should stand out against the tide was perhaps unsurprising; he had after all, both starred in and directed some iconic Westerns during the genre's last hurrah in the late sixties and early seventies. That Kasdan should have done so is more of a surprise. In 1985 he was a rising young director who had already made two successful films, the steamy neo-noir thriller ""Body Heat"" and ""The Big Chill"", a psychological drama about a group of sixties radicals trying to cope with the more conservative climate of the eighties. It was therefore perhaps a surprise that he should choose a traditional Western as his third film.The film tells the story of four cowboys- Emmett, Paden, Jake (Emmett's brother) and Mal- who travel to the town of Silverado, where they help free the town from the grip of a ruthless rancher and his corrupt sheriff. Anyone familiar with the Western genre will realise that that is not exactly an original plot- it goes back at least as far as something like ""Dodge City"" from the late thirties, and probably much further- but in fact the storyline is more complex than that brief summary would suggest, with each of the four being given a back-story. All four have good reason to want revenge against the rancher, McKendrick.In the sixties and early seventies there had been a trend towards ""revisionist"" Westerns, films like Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" or Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs Miller"", which reacted against traditional portrayals of the Old West and tried to deglamorise it or debunk its mythology. Like all revolutions, however, this one gave rise to a counter-revolution, in this case films which quite defiantly celebrated the heroic Legend of the West. Most of John Wayne's later Westerns, such as ""True Grit"" or ""The Cowboys"" can be seen as anti-revisionist in this sense, and ""Silverado"" is another example. Kasdan was setting out to celebrate, not call into question, traditional ideas of the West; his is a West where the heroes are heroic, the villains villainous and the men in the metaphorical white hats always come out on top.Most of the cast play their parts well, including the two Kevins, Costner and Kline, as the brothers Paden and Jake, Brian Dennehy as the villainous sheriff and Danny Glover as the black cowboy Mal. (The presence of a black cowboy is one of the few things to set the film apart from old-time Westerns, which were normally made on the mistaken assumption that there were no African-Americans living west of the Mississippi). Scott Glenn, however, is rather dull as Emmett, and former Python John Cleese is horribly miscast as another sheriff, whom he plays as an upper-class Englishman. This is not necessarily inaccurate- doubtless there were English immigrants in the West- but Cleese's style of acting has always been more suited to comedy than to serious drama.The main problem with the film is that Kasdan does not really succeed in bringing anything new to the Western genre in the way in which one of his stars, Kevin Costner, was to succeed in doing with ""Dances with Wolves"" a few years later- or indeed as he himself was to do in his next Western, ""Wyatt Earp"", which also starred Costner. The other well-known Western from this period, Eastwood's ""Pale Rider"" is not particularly original either; in many ways it is an unacknowledged remake of ""Shane"". It is, however, a handsome, well-made film with an iconic performance from Eastwood himself as the mysterious, possibly supernatural, Preacher.""Pale Rider"" may recycle one or two well-worn situations, but ""Silverado"" seems to be a compendium of nearly every stock cliché from the previous fifty years of making Westerns- the villainous rancher, the equally villainous lawman, the wagon train, the cattle stampede, the man wrongly accused of murder, the man seeking revenge for the murder of his father, the final climactic shoot-out in the main street of the town. Only the cavalry and the Indians are missing. Twelve years earlier Mel Brooks had done this sort of thing for laughs in ""Blazing Saddles""; Kasdan seems to be expecting us to take it seriously. He may have been hoping to reverse the decline of the Western, but unfortunately ""Silverado"" is a film which unconsciously reveals one of the reasons for that decline, namely that so many Westerns had been made that it became difficult to say anything about the West that had not already been said. Kasdan's next film, ""The Accidental Tourist"", was to be much better. 5/10",Silverado
22,disdressed12,very good western,8,19 April 2008,"this is another western i thoroughly enjoyed.i really liked the story and the interesting mix of characters.this was Kevin Costner's first big role,and he certainly has fun with his character.Kevin Kline though is really a standout here.but there are also some other great actors involved.Brian Dennehy is good,as is Scott Glenn,and Danny Glover.I also really liked Linda Hunt as Stella.but again,there is one actor who i felt just didn't fit in this movie.that was Jeff Goldblume.he just seemed out of place to me.the movie itself is well paced,and has a very rousing score,which is perfect for this film.so far though,there are two westerns which are my favourite up to this point.both Open Range,also with Kostner(and Robert Duvall)and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.however,Silverado is still an immensely entertaining film.for me,it's a strong 8/10",Silverado
23,lost-in-limbo,"""We're going to give you a fair trail, followed by a first-class hanging"".",7,1 September 2012,"In the mid-eighties Westerns were quite a dying breed, but then ""Silverado"" came riding along with it's sprawling old-west backdrops, spirited old-fashion heroism and a star-studded cast from its leads to minor support. In all honesty the main pulling power for me was that it featured Scott Glenn and everything else was an added bonus. Kevin Kline (never seen him this charismatic before), Scott Glenn (starch as ever), Kevin Costner and Danny Glover play four unwitting heroes who cross paths on their journey to the town Silverado. But the town is run by a greedy landowner and a corrupt sheriff, where our four heroes all seem to have some sort past to overcome when reaching there. ""Silverado"" doesn't go that far beyond its common ground, but its compelling enough as it makes up for it with its authentic look and enthusiastic direction in installing the western myths. In support you got the likes of Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt, Ray Baker, Jeff Fahey, Rosanna Arquette, John Cleese, Jeff Goldblum, Lynn Whitfield, Amanda Wyss and James Gammon. The chemistry between everyone simply clicked. Dennehy, Baker and Fahey were great in their villain roles. Even Cleese in a rather deadpan turn was a hoot. Hunt stood out too. Sadly Arquette was under-used with most of her story hitting the cutting room floor. It's a rollicking adventure, done in a traditional style harking back to those westerns of the 40s and 50s era. Our four protagonists have their own responsibilities, dynamics and the story gives them equal weight to express them as the multiple stories come together in one epic standoff. Gunslingers Kline and Dennehy final showdown goes on to cement the competent, if stagy style that's cemented through out, especially the use of the camera in its scenic positioning. Plus the opening sequences with Glenn impresses too. One thing that did feature heavily in the script was that it didn't take itself too seriously by taking time out for some self-knowing quips. It could have come across as an uneasy mix, but it did seem to pay off more so than not. The music had that grand feel. Well-worn clichés can't harm a flamboyant western with a stellar cast.

24,kenjha,Too Much Plot,7,22 July 2010,"This large-scale Western has an impressive cast and good acting, with the exception of Costner, who is much too annoying as a punk gunslinger. While it's quite exciting, there is too much plot here. Instead of a sustained central story arc, there are plot threads going every which way, making it difficult to become involved in the story. There are also too many hokey elements (e.g., an injured Glenn suddenly gains strength like Popeye on spinach upon hearing of his nephew's kidnapping). The gunfights are silly, with the good guys essentially supermen who brush off bullets and fight on. However, it is entertaining and the score is rousing though overused.",Silverado
25,slightlymad22,Kevin Costner Steals The Show,8,6 August 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to his second movie of 1985 Silverado. Plot In A Paragraph: A bunch of misfits team up, to right the wrongs in a town called Silverado. Quirky and fun, it's more of a flashier western, in the mould of Young Guns or Tombstone, than Something like The Outlaw Josie Wales or Pale Rider (the latter released the same year) with beautiful location photography, a fantastic score (which was one of the 2 Oscars the movie was nominated for) it's a very fun easy watch.It's a cliché story with stereotypical characters, but each of the four leads (Kevin Klein, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and KC) performances are so good, none more so than KC, it never for one minute bothers you. Here he shows great promise for more important roles in the western genre. His fast- moving performance is a lot of fun, and he makes the most of his role. KC establishes his character as a likable egotist right from the start. Of the four lead actors, he is he is the only one that looks like he belongs in the western genre. I don't think it's bias, if I say KC steals this picture. Watching it now, it's clear the guy has Stardust all over him.It's not without its problems though..... There is enough plot/sub plots and characters for two movies. The movie is saddled (yes pun intended) with an overly complex storyline involving numerous subplots. For example each of the four main Cowboys has their own subplot, as do other characters, and it ends up a bit disjointed, and contains a handful of characters that are just unnecessary to the story. John Cleese seems to think he is in a different movie and Jeff Goldblum (of whom I am a fan) looks totally out of place in a western too. But the faults can't stop the enjoyment of the movie.

26,sol-,Four Men from Now,6,5 May 2017,"Four heroic individuals keep running into each other as they trek to the same location for diverse reasons in this popular lighthearted western from Lawrence Kasdan. The film was released during a time in which western movies were on the decline and it received some acclaim in its day for paying tribute to the conventions of the genre. Watched as a contemporary viewer though, 'Silverado' is a far less riveting affair. The film's best asset is the colourful cast with the likes of Kevin Kline, John Cleese, Brian Dennehy and others at their most charismatic, however, by attempting to include nearly every western trope in the book (saloon fights; shoot-outs; stolen horses; burned houses; jail breaks; etc), the story comes off as rambling and rather bloated. The film also features so many principal characters aside from the four protagonists that one never gets to truly know any of them in real depth, and the film feels unfocused rather than deliciously complex as one might hope for a film with such an onslaught of main characters. The movie is certainly entertaining in parts and there is no denying the attention to detail with the period sets and costumes, however, the film makes one yearn for the alternative westerns that started to emerge in the 1970s, such as 'High Plains Drifter', that actually tried to do something more than just throw some rousing action together.",Silverado
27,Rodrigo_Amaro,The greatest western of the 1980's,10,31 May 2012,"Western, the genre that cannot be killed almost died in the 1980's after the financial mega disaster of the epic ""Heaven's Gate"" (good film prejudiced by the ego of its tyrannic director), studios were reluctant in investing on projects like that, but the few ones made in that decade were incredibly well made yet criminally underrated (okay, the golden era of western was between the 1930's and 1960's but even today we have great pictures that will become western classics in the years to come). To me, Lawrence Kasdan's ""Silverado"" and Christopher Cain's ""Young Guns"" (1988) are the greatest westerns from the 1980's, films that brought some positive innovations to the genre; the most memorable sighs the genre had in that period before its ultimate resurrection in the following decade with the acclaim of titles like ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""Unforgiven"".Hardly original but always effective, this homage made by Kasdan (who also paid a tribute to the noir with ""Body Heat"") presents four good guys (Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and Kevin Costner) dealing with a great load of trouble and danger while trying to make their way to the city of Silverado (and there's trouble in there as well), and there they're gonna fight with the corrupt authorities of the place. They might not be the most respectable guys to trust, they all have their share of arrests and wrongdoings but they stand for the right causes, battling against injustices and helping the honest workers to get a decent and peaceful life where they live.As for its theme and story there's no much novelty of what we're used to find in westerns; the presentation of its content and the precise use of humor are excellent though and all that are some of the qualities of ""Silverado"". Kasdan succeeds with inspiration in scenes like the final shootout; Costner and Kline escaping from prison; Kline trying to get his stolen horse back, dealing with a gun salesman for the ""rent"" of a gun since he can't afford to buy one. Kudos to the magnificent cinematography of John Bailey and the respectable music of Bruce Broughton, all greatly integrated with the movie.The structures are classic but the faces in it are not, so it's really cool to see big names of the 1980's starring on a genre that was more popular years earlier. Besides the mentioned main stars, there's room for veteran heavyweights like Brian Dennehy, Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Fahey, Jeff Goldblum, John Cleese, Lynn Whitfield, Joe Seneca, Richard Jenkins and the memorable performance of Linda Hunt, playing the helpful saloon owner.It shows that the Old West wasn't just a place for bad guys and hard faces, but also a place for guys that weren't so good in their behavior but always tried to do the right thing for the right people and for themselves too. It's all great! 10/10",Silverado
28,Dr_Coulardeau,Slow justice but effective and lethal,9,6 September 2007,"A good western, and yet. For one it is slightly too slow at times. That makes the film a little bit lengthy and that is not good in a western that must have a constant rhythm and when it slows down it is to create suspense in a situation that requires it. Here we have slow scenes that are not in anyway suspenseful. The second reason is that this film has little originality. It is a clear assemblage or patchwork of many references and borrowings from all the previous westerns ever made. And it is very difficult to invent anything in 1985 after also the Morricone and Clint Eastwood films, not to speak of the black and white TV series mile Dead or Alive. It is entertaining because of the way things are assembled and that is nearly all. Two elements create some perspective. First the presence of black settlers that reveal the strong racist trend in the West. Then the character of Stella, a midget saloon manageress. But apart from these two elements the rest is pretty standard. But I must admit the setting, the scenery is particularly beautiful. Some of the mountain and desert scenes are in gorgeous natural surroundings. Then the theme of the rotten sheriff (two in the film mind you, one rotten by authority and the other rotten by the local rancher) and the theme of the rancher who decides to push away, and kill if necessary, the farmers are very ordinary and common place, and once again nothing new is really added to the theme. All these borrowing, even in 1985, make the film systematically anaphoric and that is a shortcoming. Even the street duel is banal: check in Back to the Future III, the ""character"" of Clint Eastwood makes that anaphoric reference a lot more creative.

Thanks to great acting performances by Kevin Cosner, Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn and Danny Glover etc all the characters come across believable and likeable. These 4 righteous cowboys ride into town with an evil sherriff and a glorious battle between good and evil ensues...The movie lasts 2 hours and 15 minutes, but this long running time is spent wisely on learning to know all the many characters well. The story does meander quite a bit though between different characters during the first hour, so one has to have a little patience before the story really gets going...The great thing however about the first part of this movie is it's charming, lighthearted nature with some great tongue in cheek jokes. This story slowly gets more grim, gripping and dramatic near the end though and for that particular more dramatic end part I award this western with 8 stars.It is not a masterpiece, because it is still made to simply entertain, but it does that in a glorious, uplifting way that is undeniably very enticing. Really a solid Hollywood western, with great acting performances. Funny supporting roles by John Cleese and Jeff Goldblum. Great glorious western soundtrack. Great fight between good and evil.

Lawrence Kasdan directed this excellent 'throwback' (i.e. To pre-anti-hero times) western adventure featuring great characters, fine action sequences and just enough humour to take the edge off without drifting into farce. The four straight-shooting leads (Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and Kevin Costner) are excellent, with Kline's conflicted former outlaw Paden a standout. They face off against a variety of black-hats who clearly deserve to be extirpated, led by the phlegmatically menacing Sherriff Cobb (big Brian Dennehy) - one of the best western villains to ever slap leather. The scene in the bar where Cobb spills just a drop of coffee on his left hand when drawing and gunning a man down with his right is one of my favorite in the genre. Little Linda Hunt adds some offbeat charm as Stella Star, the manageress of Cobb's saloon and John Cleese is hilarious as a British-expat turned frontier sheriff (""As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.""). With excellent cinematography, a good score, rambunctious horsemanship, and lots of vintage gunplay, 'Silverado' is a well-crafted, light-hearted horse-opera that ranks up amongst the best of the genre.",Silverado

But that was Mitchum and Wayne of course.Silverado brought the story up into the era of the 80s and single-handedly re-energized the Western genre.I would not say that Silverado is based on the two previous movies but there are a lot of the similar elements, there is an injustice done, and then somebody has to make that right but in order to make it right, a small group of people have to go against a large group of people.Almost like Conan the Barbarian, right? I mean the Arnold version, not the Ronon Dex version.Despite the themes that has been commonly used not just in western genre, but adventure, fantasy, even science-fiction, this film gave us a fresh take on the whole business. using the great character actors of the mid 80s, and also a very young Kevin Costner who is slaphappy and goofy with his dual pistols.What surprises me here is Kevin Klein playing against the types that he normally portrayed. And he even confronts his cohort Jonathan Cleese.And another thing that I heard was that not only was this Danny Glover's first movie, but in fact he had very little experience with acting, at least film acting when this was done.A good Western isn't supposed to be taken as seriously as a football game, it is simply supposed to be enjoyable and give the viewer a fantasy of looking back into the iconic imagery of the old west.

36,slokes,Genre Exercise Without Spurs,4,30 March 2007,"A good movie scene can become a cliché, but a cliché can't become a good movie scene. Not unless it's ""Airplane,"" and this isn't, it's ""Silverado,"" director Lawrence Kasdan's heartfelt but cluttered Valentine to the Western.Heading west, reformed outlaws Emmett (Scott Glenn) and Paden (Kevin Kline) become a band, first by springing Emmett's wild brother Jake (Kevin Costner), then by getting saved from a posse by Mal (Danny Glover), crack shot with a Henry rifle. Then it's off to the beckoning town of Silverado, where Paden finds the bar of his dreams while the others are reunited with family. All is great - until trouble rides in.""There's nothing' wrong with the land,"" says Emmett's sister Kate (Patricia Gaul), ""it's just some of the people."" That goes for Silverado the movie, too. Kasdan was coming off a bumper crop of hits as screenwriter and director, and thus had the ability to do whatever he wanted and work with whoever he wanted in 1985. He had some trouble cutting down on the scope of his ambition. ""Silverado"" is a big sprawling epic of a western with one of the most eclectic casts ever brought together. Kasdan and his co-writer, brother Mark, didn't know what to do with what they had, and it shows.Rosanna Arquette is the most obvious casualty, playing a homesteader who floats around the edges of the story. Kasdan admits much of the point of her character was lost on the cutting-room floor. But even parts that made the final cut seem uneven and sketchy. Linda Hunt won an Oscar just before this was made, but she doesn't seem to have any purpose in the story except to trade rueful japes with Kline playing a bar matron with a good heart. Jeff Goldblum drifts in as a gambler, like Kline and Gaul a member of the cast of Kasdan's last hit ""The Big Chill."" When he played a cowboy in ""Buckaroo Banzai,"" it was supposed to be a joke, but here it's for real, only it isn't as Goldblum never finds a character who serves no point anyway. Glover just glowers lifelessly about ""what ain't right."" Even Kline, a favorite of mine, feels shallow and flat here. Wearing a beard and duster don't make you a cowboy.The bad guys come off even worse. Brian Dennehy is their leader, Cobb, who smiles wryly in that Dennehy way and never kicks it into the next gear. He's still got that wry smile on when he faces down old friend Paden at the end. His gang lacks any sense of motivation or personality. ""Why are they doing this?"" someone asks, only to be answered: ""Because they enjoy it."" That's not enough to go on here.The editing is atrocious. Action scenes lack spatial reality. Less than a minute after some bad guys appear out of nowhere to ambush Emmett, Mal pops out of nowhere to ambush them. A few seconds after we see Jake riding out after some villains, he's in a bar getting into a fight over a girl. Kasdan shot too much footage, and without any organic flow to begin with, the result is a hazy mess.So what did I like? Costner surprisingly plays a goofball to good effect, and Glenn does nice work in the lead Cooper-Wayne role. The opening scenes, of him and Paden finding each other and springing Jake, have a nice flow to them. John Cleese is another example of stunt casting here, only it pays off as Cleese finds a nice blend of humor and menace playing a lawman who's not a bad guy, just narrow and selfish.But then ""Silverado"" descends into cliché, bouncing from rustlers' hideout to stampede to showdown in mechanical fashion. It never bores you completely; its desire to entertain is palpable throughout, but it never rises above predictability.""What a waste,"" Dennehy says at the end. I couldn't agree more.",Silverado

On this film, Kasdan pays his homage to the western genre, by resurrecting it from the dead(besides the occasional Clint Eastwood western) in a more modern and refreshing way with a great ensemble cast of Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Brian Dennehy, Danny Glover and a young Kevin Costner in an early role. The story and direction is tight, the film looks great and is driven by a lot of action and solid performances. Although this is a movie that would be appropriate viewing for the whole family, Silverado is far from stupid and holds its own pretty easily against other classics of the genre. Overall, I think Silverado is a great movie and was done well.",Silverado
38,ShootingShark,Terrific Latter-Day Western Adventure With Excellent Cast And Great Story,7,14 September 2008,"In the Old West, four drifters meet by chance on the trail to the small town of Silverado, where the corrupt sheriff is in league with the local cattle baron to run some new settlers off the land. Can anyone stand up to these bullies and their hired guns ?Written by brothers Lawrence and Mark Kasdan, this is one of my favourite westerns, a fond and lovingly directed tribute to the classic old movies and serials. It's not unfair to say that it borrows heavily from lots of other films - notably Shane and The Searchers, and in a weird way it's Rio Bravo turned inside out, but what it really is is a collection of favourite western scenes; a wagon train fording the river, a jailbreak, a canyon shootout, a town fire, a cattle stampede, a showdown on main street, what have you. It's like an old-time fifties picture, but with sparkling sharp photography (by John Bailey) and a first- rate ensemble cast. Actors like Glenn, Baker, Fahey and James (who appears unbilled) are just the right kind of casting for a western - unlike most movie movie-stars they don't look silly wearing cowboy hats, spurs and gunbelts. Dennehy is especially strong in the Judas role as Cobb the crooked sheriff, and I particularly like Glenn as the quiet, self-effacing Emmett; with his lined features and brooding eyes he embodies the classic mythology of the frontier adventurer. There's also a cracking good score by Bruce Broughton, a traditional mix of brass and strings which romps along, and if you don't feel your heart stirring as the heroes ride through the gorgeous New Mexico locations then you should be starting a lifetime subscription to the novels of Louis L'Amour right now. In the nineteen-eighties nobody had made a good western for ten years (since The Outlaw Josey Wales), and then two came out at once - Pale Rider and Silverado - both of which are terrific. If you like a good cowboy picture - and everybody should - this one is funny, exciting, action-packed and beautifully made.",Silverado

Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Kevin Costner and Danny Glover are all incredible. Brian Dennehy and Linda Hunt are both great and John Cleese is really good in a brief but memorable role. Lawrence Kasdan's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed with great gunfights. It's extremely well paced and the music by Bruce Broughton is amazing.",Silverado
41,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A western with many familiar faces during as old as it is,8,26 April 2020,"By the 1980s, the genre of Westerns had pretty much died off. Unfortunately, due to the enormous failure that was Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate (1980), Hollywood not only reconsidered giving total control to directors of the projects, but also closed the curtain on big budget Westerns in general. They were seen as time consuming, costly and returned little revenue. Despite this, the genre went on but continued to see little financial success. Such goes for this film which not only had its set reused for other films that came later, but also manage to gain critical acclaim for how it was handled then. This is baffling even more when considering who took part and how the story was executed. It's really surprising the genre didn't bounce back with films like this.The plot is about a group of rag tag strangers who end up crossing paths and manage to develop a good working relationship with each other. All who end up passing through the city of Silverado. Written by Mark Kasdan, with co-writer and director Lawrence Kasdan heading the project, this western is one that not only has a fun story but also features a number of familiar faces from back in the day. Emmett (Scott Glenn) and Jake (Kevin Costner) are brothers in hopes of making it to California. Emmett's a sharp gunslinger, as is his brother. However, Jake is much more reckless. On their journey, they meet Paden (Kevin Kline), a traveler recently robbed from another group he once was close with.Then there's Mal (Danny Glover), a wanderer looking for place he can be accepted for who he is. His sister Rae (Lynn Whitfield) is a popular lady among the saloons and is good friends with Slick (Jeff Goldblum), a wealthy gambler. Also found in Silverado is also one of Paden's old associates; Cobb (Brian Dennehy) and Tyree (Jeff Fahey). All of these supporting characters come to a head as the story comes to a conclusion. The only aspect of the script that should've been twisted differently were backstories to certain characters who more often than not are put in difficult situations. Understandably so, some are unavoidable due to the time it takes place, but these kinds of scenarios do not always have to happen.Supporting the cast are other well-known actors like John Cleese, Linda Hunt, Joe Seneca and Brion James. For anyone unfamiliar, Lawrence Kasdan was also known for writing Body Heat (1981), The Big Chill (1983), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983). The action was staged well for this feature. Considering this is a western, it is expected to have the local bar fights, fist fights, gun fights and horseback riding. All of which are executed like everyone involved has been doing it all their lives. There's even a sequence involving a stampede, which no doubt is dangerous if not controlled properly.The cinematography was shot competently too. Behind the camera for this feature was John Bailey. Capturing wide landscapes along with matte paintings helped greatly in giving the film that classic western outback look. Prior to this Bailey also worked on Premonition (1972), American Gigolo (1980), Cat People (1982), and The Big Chill (1983). Lastly, the music composed by Bruce Broughton was very well done. Having a revisited motif for the feature made it all the more the memorable. Using classic orchestra and tambourine, the sound of it matches the tone and setting of the story completely. Thankfully for Broughton, after the initial release, Intrada released an expanded score which makes the experience that much more enjoyable.Aside from one subplot being rather common place for many westerns, the rest is an enjoyable trip back to the past. All elements like music, camerawork, acting and action all help make the feel of it as authentic as possible.",Silverado
42,screenman,Unexpectedly Good,8,11 July 2010,"When talking great westerns, 'Silverado' doesn't exactly leap into mind. Yet I have to say that there are at least some great moments here that lift this movie above the ordinary.Firstly, there's an amazingly solid A/B-list cast. A lot of money must have been spent recruiting this ensemble. And they're well chosen, too, offering clearly-defined and contrasting characters to the various sub-plots. I'm biased here, perhaps, because they're some of my favourites. These people really do ACT as well as any top-dollar star. Each brings an entirely believable conviction to their roles.There's a decent script, too. Not over smart, but still convincing with one or two shrewd little one-liners.Technical issues such as camera-work and lighting are all up to snuff. I just think that the editing is a bit choppy at times. Some scene changes come and go too suddenly. A decent soundtrack moves the whole thing along.If anything, this movie has an identity crisis. I recollect that it was billed as a comedy. And with John Cleese popping-up you would hardly expect otherwise. Yet when he plays it straight he is a surprisingly convincing hardcase, he just lapses into Basil Fawlty from time to time and the volte-face is a little jarring. At the same time, there is some pretty unpleasant roughstuff, evident examples of suffering, and one or two brutal killings. Overall, it doesn't come over as comical most of the time.With a straight actor instead of Cleese, to minimise the silliness, I think this would be a serious and seriously good western, almost a classic of the genre. In a way, it reminds me of 'Fistful Of Dynamite', which also suffers from a comedy/tragedy identity issue.Still; I think it's well worth a watch.",Silverado
43,Gislef,The Western of the 80's,10,23 December 1998,"Okay, maybe there's not a lot of competition in that regard:  Westerns have fallen on hard times in the last decade or so, and they tend to be more ""revisionist/realist"" types of movies (i.e., Unforgiven).  Silverado is very much the ""traditional"" Western updated for the 80's.  It has an incredible cast, from the four main leads (Glenn, Costner, Kline, and Glover), down to the secondary types (particular Brian Dennehy, but also Linda Close) down to even minor roles like Jeff Goldblum, Jeff Fahey, Roseanne Arquette and John Cleese). This is a big-budget extravaganza with the money well spent on film (the incredible scenery is filmed in all splendor), script (see quotes), and paying for a good actor for even the most minor roles.",Silverado
44,shakercoola,A hark back to the silver screen days of the Western,6,17 February 2019,"With an array of 1980s movie acting stars, ""Silverado"" easily makes a fist of its talent. It's a standout Western film of its era.
It's a story that's been told many times before, the plot is a little protracted and it is agreeable rather than compelling viewing but under Lawrence Kasdan's direction there is never a moment wasted. It is exuberant, and sleek, with enough gunfights and skirmishes to keep action fans happy too. The cinematography is good too - visually stunning, and the production design helps create the right atmosphere for what is an easy-on-the-eye escapism.",Silverado
45,jjnxn-1,Solid western with a nice sense of humor,9,5 May 2013,"Expansive western updated somewhat to modern sensibilities. Kasdan obviously has great affection for the westerns of old and never strays too far from the traditions of the genre while still making them seem fresh. He's aided by a great production team who make sure everything feels lived in and the cinematographer takes full advantage of the sweeping vistas to give a feel of the old west. Another advantage the film has is the great cast the director has assembled. The four leads, Kline, Glenn, Glover and Costner, make a terrific team with Kevin Costner especially standing out. He's never been this lively and likable on screen since unfortunately. There really is no weak link in the entire film but some of the others who stand out are Linda Hunt, tough but gentle as saloon keeper Stella and Brian Dennehy whose character could have been just a great hulking bear of a villain but because of the magnetism he brings and the way he plays the part with a twinkle in his eye makes him far more interesting. This is something that is talked down nowadays, a rollicking good time at the movies. Highly recommended.",Silverado

47,TheUnknown837-1,I have nothing but compliments for this gun- and trail-blazing Western opus; a symbol of the genre's unwillingness to die,9,2 May 2009,"After the financial disaster of Michael Cimino's ""Heaven's Gate"" in 1980, the Western movie genre had appeared to slip away into an unexpected demise after so many decades of enormous popularity. Then in 1985, two filmmakers, who owed their inspiration and in one case, their career to the old Westerns, brought it back from the cinematic grave of the cutting room. The first one was a revolutionary Western by Clint Eastwood. ""Pale Rider"" (1985) brought back the dark, cynical life of the gloomy but powerfully allegoric Westerns like ""Shane"" (1953). And then there was ""Silverado"", which instilled new life into our perception of the old classic gun and trail-blazing Westerns like ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960). As an avid fan of the Westerns, both old and new, I have nothing but compliments for ""Silverado"" and even now, almost a quarter of a century since its theatrical debut, it still holds up as a terrifically entertaining good-hearted Western action film and fills the souls of its viewers with the same wild love and thrill that the classics and the men who made them have.While ""Pale Rider"" and later, ""Unforgiven"" (1992) brought us a gritty, cynical view of the 19th century world, ""Silverado"" brings us one full of glory and spectacle from its magnificent scenery to its pulse-raising downtown shootouts and standoffs. Back with a new look, but the same charm, are the tough laconic heroes riding on elegant steeds and hauling flashy bullet-spitting hardware on their legs. Back are the sneering, equally laconic villains who spit before they draw their guns. Back are the classic shootouts where the good guys score a direct hit with every shot—no matter the distance or the situation—and the bad guys miss with every shot and yet somehow, this improbable and certainly unrealistic formula still works. ""Silverado"" is basically the same kind of film as ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960) and the other gun-blazing Westerns from the golden age revamped and upgraded for a more contemporary audience, but still working more or less in the same way.""Silverado"" is full of old-fashioned, but terrifically entertaining action scenes ranging from fistfights to classic one-on-one showdowns in the middle of a deserted dusty street, but part of what also keep it standing on its own feet are the background stories of the colorful characters, many of whom are played by actors quite unfamiliar to the Western genre. Again, some of the subplots are old-fashioned and familiar, such as the commonly used bout between homesteaders and range men, but because its freshened up and ramped up, it works. Director, producer, and writer Lawrence Kasdan is to be congratulated enormously on this thundering, exciting Western opus. Full of witty dialogue, beautiful backgrounds, colorful things in the foreground, a wonderful Academy Award-nominated music score by Bruce Broughton, and again, that same old-fashioned, but never dying charm of the old 50s and 60s Westerns, ""Silverado"" is the kind of film that the whole family can sit down and enjoy. The Western genre may have slowed down and may be a little more obscure today than it was forty years ago, but it will never die completely. A flower may wilt, but its elegance is forever remembered. ""Silverado"" is, just like its tagline claims, the ride of your life.",Silverado
48,FightingWesterner,Better Than I Expected And A Lot Of Fun,7,9 January 2010,"I resisted watching this for a long time, under the impression that anything from the director of The Big Chill and featuring such cosmopolitan actors as Kevin Kline, Rosanna Arquette, Danny Glover, John Cleese, and Jeff Goldblum would be overly pretentious hogwash. I was mostly wrong. It was politically correct but not bad.This story about four fast friends and their adventures in and around the title city, an earnest attempt to recreate the feel of the epic westerns of the fifties, is pleasant entertainment and worth watching, with Kline effectively cast against type.I only have two substantial criticisms. One is that the first half with Kline getting back his hat and horse, his and Kevin Costner's big jailbreak, and Danny Glover's introduction, is so good that the second half pales by comparison.The second is the fact that third-billed Rosanna Arquette's character has nil to do with the story and is pretty much wasted, as if she were (typical of the fifties!) inserted in order to get a female name on the marquee. They should have gave her something to do!Overall, it wasn't the best western ever made, but pretty watchable nevertheless.",Silverado
49,morrisonhimself,There shoulda been a sequel,10,13 April 2009,"There are two reasons I say there should have been a sequel: One is that, simply, this was so great, so nearly perfect that it deserved and deserves follow-up.From largest role to smallest (and I don't mean Linda Hunt), the acting was superlative ... and here I have to pause to say it took several viewings for me to finally admit that, yes, even Kevin Costner, whom I generally and thoroughly dislike, was darn good as a cowboy.I saw this first in a theater, in Hollywood, with people from the industry, and absolutely LOVED it ... except for Kevin Costner.I was in awe of the script, of the acting, of the photography, of ... well, of everything ... except Kevin Costner.Well, I watched it recently on Turner Classic Movies and, reluctantly, decided it was just prejudice, however deserved, and in truth Costner really made a very good cowboy.There is a little secret here I won't completely divulge: Watch how actors mount their horses, and you'll see if they really know Western riding and, for that matter, if the director knows his business.One of the actors deserving special praise is Brian Dennehy. As far as I am concerned, he can do no wrong. He is one of the very best actors in the business during the last 20 or 30 years, just an absolutely fabulous talent.Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised, but even Jeff Goldblum was great in this role. Oh, I know he's good, but I would have thought, and did think, that a Western setting would find him out of place. Wrong.Sheb Wooley has a small part and it was great to see him in what turned out to be one of his last roles. He, of course, was right at home.Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, and Danny Glover also looked right at home, as if they had been born making Westerns.Linda Hunt, another actor who can seemingly do no wrong, was in another movie this same year, 1985, the terribly unfairly ignored ""Eleni,"" and it and ""Silverado"" both were much better than the movie that carried nearly all the awards, and which I won't name here.That other film might have deserved the Oscar for its score, but even the score of ""Silverado"" was first class and would have got my vote if I were allowed to cast a ballot. Bruce Broughton, who has scored mostly for television, looked to be on the way to picking up the mantle of Elmer Bernstein, and I even bought the recorded score -- at retail rates! Which I never do. It is excellent music.""Silverado"" is an almost perfect movie.Oh, and the second reason there shoulda been a sequel: The last words shouted by the Kevin Costner character. Watch this movie and listen.",Silverado
50,Ben_Cheshire,Four cowboys struggle against bad direction to make a throwback western script come to life.,2,16 September 2009,"Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and Kevin Costner play four cowboys struggling against bad direction to make a throwback western script by the writer of such classics as The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Some fare better than others. Danny Glover makes a lion sized effort. Scott Glenn is nearly convincing. Kevin Kline and John Cleese seem to have the least respect for the genre and their place in it, and give entirely unconvincing performances. Kasdan, an engineer of the beloved Star Wars saga, made his much-loved directorial debut with The Big Chill, which he also directed, and my theory is that he should stick to scripting. The script of Silverado is great fun, providing plenty of material for a terrific western, but the weaknesses are all in the making of the actual movie. Kasdan clearly was not a source of strength on set, for starters, as no-one exhibits a sense of being comfortable in what they're doing, let alone the sense of bravura we're used to in a good western. If you came here for fun and excitement, can I suggest you try The Quick and the Dead instead, which is a much more unique film, anyway; and if you came here for beauty, likable characters and an epic western, go to Dances with Wolves instead, its terrific! Lastly, if you were after comedy, I'd suggest you go to a comedy. My favourites are Groundhog Day and This Is Spinal Tap. Silverado was not a comedy script to begin with, it was just a rollicking action/adventure western with some solemn extended speeches. However, if you're young or haven't seen many westerns, you just may think this is as good as it gets, so go ahead, make your day.",Silverado

""Da da da da dasaaa da da da da da""...Enough! In one scene, leading lady Roseanna Arquette is told she is pretty.. and she agrees! Then she keeps talking about being pretty... but she's not. She looks like some kind of elf faced person. Kevin Kline's bad acting or lack there of, singlehandedly ruined this movie. He acted like Chandler from Friends throughout.

There is not too much gun-play and more and well played drama with a few side stories, the general story is great and matched by the screenplay, the music is also good.The casting was superb, with all actors putting in a good shift, Kevin Kline is on top form as Paden, with very able assistance from Scott Glenn (a very underrated and excellent actor) as Emmett, a young Kevin Costner as Jake and Danny Glover (who you can always rely on) as Mal. Rosanna Arquette, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt and Jeff Goldblum, with John Cleese in a cameo, Ray Baker and Jeff Fahey and even Brion James popping up uncredited also do a great job.There have been a few excellent westerns and this is one, its current average of 7.2 rating on here seems a bit low to me, I gave it a 9, Kevin Kline and Scott Glenn are worth 10 each.",Silverado

The plot is very old-fashioned and the situations sometimes get close to the ridiculous. Well, funny, as the fans of this movie picture would prefer to say.I won't tell you the end of ""Silverado"", but it is exactly what you are thinking right now. No different things or some innovations. Just the same old revenge thing. OK, I know ""Silverado"" is like an ode to those old ""bang bang"" stories, and that's why I think I can't rate it so bad, but I think Lawrence Kasdan could have make it better.

You have an opening gunfight, the stranger rescued after robbers left him to die. You've got frontier towns rising no more than a couple of ramshackle stories from the arid, rocky expanse of New Mexico (where the entire picture was filmed).There are stampeding cattle, saloons filled with hard-drinking trail-riders, cowboys jumping on their horses from roofs (cowboys who know and love their horses more than their women), a couple of love interests that waste the talents of some decent actresses (but a strong performance by Linda Hunt as the ""Miss Kitty""-type character, Stella, who runs the local saloon), and you've got several deliciously quirky villains played by the likes of Brian Dennehy, Jeff Goldblum, James Gammon and Jeff Fahey. You have all of these bad guys doing things to other people that they shouldn't oughta do, from shooting an old man to kidnapping a little boy to threatening women. And you have big gun battles as the team of four unlikely heroes rescue the hostages with clever ploys that make up for the fact that the heroes are always outnumbered by the villains' henchmen.You have the final, high-stakes showdown between the chief hero and chief villain that is dramatically promised from the first twenty minutes of this rather long movie, following which, all is put right so that the four heroes can go off in different directions to meet their destinies (except that one always stays because now he belongs to the town he saved). And it is fortunate that of the two towns mentioned in the script, Turley (a relatively civilized town controlled by an only mildly corrupt sheriff - an Englishman played by John Cleese who admits he is ""not from these parts"") and Silverado (a wild town controlled by an extremely corrupt sheriff), the movie was not named for ""Turley"".

John Cleese actually had a serious role as a mayor of a small town. There were some good lines. I liked when Danny Glover's character said ""you really don't know much about 'being human'""? That's true. You can spend your whole life not knowing about people and how to deal with people. Kevin Kline was great as a very cool, intelligent gunfighter. He wanted to keep his friendship with his old friend played by Brian Dennehy. It took him a little time to look into things and find out that his buddy had become a really bad guy.

The plot moves along at a pleasant pace and never seems hurried or too slow.There is enough action to please most any fan of westerns and most likely enough to please fans of Kevin Kline, Scott Glen, Kevin Costner, and all the others. None of the stunts seemed ""over the top"", unreal. I found this to be a great movie, one I can fully endorse to anyone over 13 due to the shoot outs and the occasional violence.Grab some popcorn, some soda, and get set for an action packed, enjoyable movie. Oh, did I forget to mention some Milk Duds? Just isn't the same without some Milk Duds. Or Juji fruit, or some Dots, or...............",Silverado
65,dkncd,An enjoyable but mostly average western,7,9 August 2007,"""Silverado"" is Lawrence Kasdan's rendition of a classic western. The film's scenery and score are excellent. A number of recognizable names appear in the cast. Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Danny Glover are memorable as the defenders of justice. Kevin Costner plays his character with a sort of child-like enthusiasm, an interesting contrast to his later roles. Brian Dennehy is appropriate as the corrupt Sheriff Cobb and Linda Hunt was touching as Stella. Jeff Goldblum and John Cleese have small parts in the film. The scene with John Cleese was top-notch and I only wish he had a larger role in the film.The last half hour ""Silverado"" was fast-paced and enjoyable, but most of the scenes leading up to it were mostly average. ""Silverado"" featured a great cast, but its script could have been better.",Silverado

67,deacon_blues-3,The mother of all westerns!,9,14 May 2015,"This film is like a culmination of the classic western film genre. It's got it all: great memorable characters, great cinematography, great music soundtrack, and a compelling classic story line. Is it innovative? Not really. But neither was J.S. Bach in music. He culminated the Baroque era that had preceded him. In doing so, he happened to bring baroque music to its highest zenith. This film does much the same for western films. It's chock full of all the most endearing clichés with a little modern flavor added here and there. Most people are unable to get the fact that originality in art is vastly overrated. It's much better to do something really well than to sell out everything to merely do something new. There's a lot of really crappy art out there that has little besides originality going for it! I'd rather admire a story that's been retold with passion and a high level of craftsmanship, and that's what Silverado does!",Silverado
68,chvylvr80,An epic western,8,17 September 2003,"Westerns don't get much better than this. At the risk of insulting a lot of western fans, most westerns are corny and poorly made. Even some of the classics by Randolph Scott, John Wayne, and Clint Eastwood can grow weary with the passage of years and repeated viewings. Silverado is not like this. By the time the credits finish you've already been sucked in the saddle. Boasting a large, big name cast with many accomplished performers. It takes the typical western plot of good guys against bad and makes that an art form. A long film, it can get a bit tedious at times but for the most part it keeps you swept up in this entertaining saga. Bottom Line: Westerns don't get much better than this. If you haven't seen it you're really missing out.",Silverado
69,grahamvr,Excellent Classic,9,1 October 2020,"Nice to see Netflix adding some exceptional classics, especially westerns. SILVERADO is one of them. A rip roaring western with an excellent cast of many of today's actors in their younger years. Magnificent scenery and brilliant music score which is missing from so many of today's new movies. And NO CGI, everything is real. Also good to see movies which one could read the credits at the start and not be wondering if you are watching the right movie. Credits one can read without a magnifying glass. Thank you Columbia for all the western the studio has made over the years.",Silverado
70,pswanson00,Great entertainment,8,11 January 2005,"I love this movie, so much that I finally got tired of renting it and bought a copy. I tell anyone who asks that it's ""...the western for 12-year-old boys of all ages."" I'd guess that women would enjoy it also, if for no other reason than the superb male cast. I can't think of a film which has a cast with greater depth. I love the humor woven through the episodes of action and buddyhood, and nearly fell out of my seat laughing when John Cleese first appeared on screen. His first line is an all-time great, right up there with Tommy Lee Jones' ""My my, what a mess"" in The Fugitive (I won't quote it, in case you haven't seen the film). If you want to be thoroughly entertained for a couple of hours, and don't require powerful social import in your viewing choices, I'd recommend Silverado strongly. Actually, the relationship of Danny Glover to the main protagonists IS socially important, so enjoy that too.",Silverado
71,DeuceWild_77,"Kasdans' love letter to the Old West, featuring an astonishing shot on location cinematography, a catchy epic orchestration and a well-cast group of actors !!",9,2 March 2020,"Writer Lawrence Kasdan (""The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") turned director (""Body Heat"") always dreamed to make a Western film shot in the old style of the old american classics. After the huge success of ""The Big Chill"" ('83) that opened the doors for big budget productions and creative control over his craft , Kasdan with the help of his older brother, Mark, wrote, produced and directed, ""Silverado"", a love letter to the Old West and its heroic figures featuring all the Western themes, situations, characters and sub-plots, present in this beloved genre for decades.A veteran gunslinger, Emmett (Scott Glenn), after being ambushed for (then) unknown outlaws on his way to Turley to meet his younger brother, Jake (Kevin Costner), finds an adventurer, Paden (Kevin Kline), lying in the middle of the desert, having been robbed and left to die.
Paden joins Emmett and after a turmoil in Turley, where Jake was falsely accused and sentenced to be hanged, the trio escapes with the help of an african american, Mal Johnson (Danny Glover) and ride together to Silverado.
On the way, they help a wagon train of settlers which the money was been stolen by two false guides and meet a young beautiful widow settler, Hannah (Rosanna Arquette), that caught both Emmett and Paden attention.
When they arrive at Silverado, they found a town ruled by a corrupt Sheriff, Cobb (Brian Dennehy) and his goons, paid by an unscrupulous cattle owner, McKendrick (Ray Baker).
An old friend of Paden from the outlaw days, Cobb hires him as his associate in the Saloon, managed by Stella (Linda Hunt) and tries to buy him to close his eyes in what McKendrick is doing to the townspeople and the settlers, but when his new pals, Emmett, Jake and Mal are caught in the war against the corrupt forces of Silverado, Paden needs to pick a side, before it's too late...Beautifully shot on location in New Mexico, in the widescreen camera of John Bailey with an inspired direction of Kasdan, it's visible how the director's heart was within this project, ""Silverado"" was made in a time that the Western was in severe decline, after the genre's revisionism in the cynical and crude 70's decade.
Kasdan chose to bring back to life the old westerns from John Ford, Howard Hawks, Raoul Walsh or Henry Hathaway, toned down the violence (almost no blood can be seen) and staged the gunfights and death scenes with a lighter tone, shooting it in the old style of using virtuous stuntmen and stunthorses, suitable for all audiences in the vein of the old matinee's.The Oscar nominated orchestration by Bruce Broughton is as catchy as epic, even if it's basically just two themes, it's a great example how the music and the events on-screen makes the perfect match and enhances the film to something even better.The ensemble cast is fantastic, featuring some of the very best actors that performed in the 80's, led by Kevin Kline, joining Kasdan again after ""The Big Chill"", the very best actor of the main cast, even if Paden have some modernist touch in him, he's impeccable as an ex-gunslinger that wants to erase his past and start a new life; Scott Glenn embodies the Gary Cooper, Joel McCrea or Steve McQueen kind of taciturn on screen persona properly and he surely can draw out his revolver and shoot fast; Kevin Costner, in a breakthrough role, after Kasdan cut off his character from ""The Big Chill"" (he played Alex in the flashback scenes), he promised a meaty role in his next film and keeped his promise, Costner delivers a 'scene-stealer' performance as the good-hearted, sometimes childish in his manners, the reckless gunfighter, Jake, and his scenes with his horse are way impressive, and last, but not the least, Danny Glover, until here mostly well-known to general audiences for playing villains (""The Color Purple"", ""Witness""), gives a great performance as Mal, and his screen presence, heroism and sense of duty gained him the iconic role of Roger Murtaugh, 2 years later in ""Lethal Weapon"" ('87).The supporting cast presents the fabulous Brian Dennehy (""Cocoon"", ""F/X""), in Sheriff Teasle (from ""First Blood"") mode; Linda Hunt, fresh from her Academy Award winning in a supporting role for ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" ('82); the always baddie, Jeff Fahey (who later joined Costner and Kasdan again in ""Wyatt Earp""); the beautiful young starlets, Amanda Wyss and Lynn Whitfield, it's a shame that their careers never really took off; future Academy Award nominee, Richard Jenkins in his film debut; the Kasdan's regular, stock actor James Gammon (""Wyatt Earp"", ""I Love You to Death""); the late great character actor, Brion James (""Southern Comfort"", ""Blade Runner"", ""48 Hrs."", ""Flesh+Blood""), strangely uncredited in the opening and final credits, and in a rare case of playing a 'good guy' and Joe Seneca (from ""Crossroads""), among lots of others...John Cleese (""Monty Python"", ""A Fish Called Wanda"") have a funny cameo as the Sheriff John Langston from Turley, and the then rising stars, Rosanna Arquette (""After Hours"", ""Desperately Seeking Susan"", both also from '85) and Jeff Goldblum (joining Kasdan again after ""The Big Chill""), appear in more of cameo parts than supporting roles, maybe due to their scenes had been shortened in the editing process, affecting the duality of Goldblum's character, which may be confusing for the viewers and the love triangle between Rosanna, Kevin Kline and Scott Glenn that wasn't fully explored.The aforementioned flaw is probably the only reason i do not rate ""Silverado"" a perfect 10/10. Some sub-plots are left behind, and some characters just disappear to appear again at the end (Rosanna Arquette), it looked like the movie needed more half an hour to explain everything correctly, but at 133 minutes already, the Studio's pressure passed over of Kasdans' creative control, keeping it more as an adventure / action western film, and less an epic of big proportions (they were still afraid of another ""Heaven's Gate""...)In short, ""Silverado"" and Clint Eastwood's ""Pale Rider"", both released in '85, revitalized the Western genre and opened the doors to future productions such as ""Young Guns"" and its sequel ('88, '90); ""Quigley Down Under"" ('90) and the acclaimed and Oscar winner films, ""Dances with Wolves"" ('90) and ""Unforgiven"" ('92).I rate it a 9.5 / 10Highly recommended !!",Silverado
72,SeminolePhenom,Heroic western that can easily be related to a few classics.,7,8 October 2005,"Paden(Kevin Kline), Emmet(Scott Glenn), Jake(Kevin Costner), and Mal(Danny Glover) join forces to take on the corruption and evil that has taken over a small town.The plot is very simple, which is very closely related to previous westerns. A small group of heroes take on corruption in a town. The plot has been used over and over and over. But this movie is different in the way that there is not only inner struggles between the characters, but the fact that the main character gets caught up in a bit of corruption himself, brings forth a sense of obscurity to the movie which i enjoyed. Overall, its an above average western that is just a little different from all of the others but highly enjoyable.I recommend this movie.",Silverado
73,ciscokid1970,Entertaining western that does not disappoint,9,8 September 2007,"This was one of the best westerns of the 80s and also a good movie that many people could enjoy. The story is solid with many subplots that keep you paying attention. At the same time the movie does a good job of sprinkling action scenes throughout the movie. The only negative of this movie is probably that it tried to do to much there were enough scenes to fill a miniseries but at least they were good.The cinemetograpy is great showing some brilliant landscapes from open desserts, dry highlands and snow covered mountains.The actors were brilliant all the way around. The main characters Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Kevin Costner and Danny Glover. But the Producers and directors did not stop there they hired good actors for the smaller scenes also like Brian Dennehy as the corrupt sheriff, John Cleese as another sheriff, Rosanna Arquette as a newly widowed homesteader, they even gave small parts to Jeff Goldblum, Jeff Fahey and Linda Hunt.This movies action scenes include jail breaks, bar fights, fist fights and of course the showdown.This movie stands the test of time and is good enough to watch over and over again.",Silverado
74,donb-519-335075,The Kevins are great,7,4 March 2013,"Silverado has long been one of my favorite Westerns. But it had been so long that I had forgotten why. Having just re-watched it - I remember - Kevin Kline's smart mouth - sarcastic lines. Many very funny quips in the first half of the movie.Unfortunately, it seems the writers ran out of steam about 1/2 way & relied on traditional shoot em up to carry the story - not as good as the first half. But there are some classic scenes such as when K Costner, S Glenn, D Glover and K Kline are riding abreast as they fearlessly travel into Dodge (or actually Silverado).Kevin Costner's exuberant, yet pretty skillful young cowboy is endearing. He is young enough to pull it off. And Danny Glover is pretty convincing as the black man who has had enough (Racism. intolerance, bad guys, etc.) Pretty good commentary on the post Civil War years - the black man was free - officially, but not actually. Good sub theme there.Even though I enjoyed it, I would rank the following Westerns ahead of this one: Lonesome Dove (of course); Appaloosa; True Grit (remake); Unforgiven and THe Good, The Bad, and the Ugly and Tombstone. In fact maybe I should change my rating - nah. DonB",Silverado
75,crowrobot,"""Let's get 'em!""",10,22 October 2005,"That one line from Jake (Kevin Costner) as he, Paden (Kevin Kline), Emmett (Scott Glenn), and Mal (Danny Glover) are riding into town for the last battle against a corrupt sheriff (Brian Dennehy) exemplifies everything that is great about 'Silverado'. It's a high-spirited adventure that is fun, does not take itself too seriously (well, maybe a little), and cheerfully reenacts Western clichés. It's the kind of movie where you can tell the actors had fun making it, and you have fun too.The acting is uniformly excellent. Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, and Danny Glover all bring quiet dignity as well as low-key humor to their roles, but it's Kevin Costner who impressed me the most. As Glenn's cocky young brother, Costner doesn't even bother to contain his glee at being in a Western. He gives the most fun performance in the movie, and it's good to see a younger Costner not taking himself nearly as seriously as he does now. The supporting cast has some nice players: John Cleese shows up as a fair-minded sheriff who seems to have walked over from a Monty Python skit; Academy Award-winner Linda Hunt ('The Year Of Living Dangerously') steals scenes as a strong-willed bar owner who Kevin Kline befriends; and Brian Dennehy is thoroughly slimy as the villain.The action is fun, and director Lawrence Kasdan shows a gift for this material (granted, he was the person who wrote 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'), and the screenplay (also by Kasdan) is joyous in the way it resurrects the Western. The movie also has one of the best action scores I've ever heard by Bruce Broughton, and I was humming the title theme as the movie concluded.'Silverado' is a shining example of the Western genre, and it stands as one of the greatest pure entertainment Westerns ever made.",Silverado
76,latsblaster,Silverado: A Question of taste?,7,9 August 2003,"This is a entertaining but hardly original and maybe unrealistic modern Western, with a plot filled of traditional Western-elements. It is similar to the most of the famous Westerns of Ford, Hawks and Leone. ""Silverado"" shows that Scott Glenn could perhaps be a powerful Western-star, but his whole potential is hardly used to it´s best here, and I guess that the direction from Lawrence Kasdan is overall uneven. Kevin Costner makes the very best performance I´ve ever seen from him, Glover and Cline are solid but Goldblum is miscasted. The best part of ""Silverado"" is the first hour, the second hour is more uneven. At times a very fine movie, but mostly suitable for more unexperienced Western-fans.Rating: 7+ of 10.",Silverado

The plot is your basic western plot, and done well! Scott Glen is Emit, the unwilling hero just released from prison for killing an evil cattle baron, and Kevin Costner is his 'Billy the Kid' brother on the way to Silverado. Along the way, They meet Paden, played by Kevin Kline, the soft spoken gunslinger, and Mal, played by Danny Glover, who fights his own fight on prejudice. The supporting cast is great too!All of the hallmarks of the old westerns are built into the plot as well. You have the wagon train, the bandits hiding in a box canyon, the saloon with gamblers, and the tough as nails bar maid played by Linda Hunt,.......it's all here! (Well, except Indians on the war path)This should rank right up there with the John Wayne, and Clint Eastwood westerns.

79,rbsjrx,An excellent western,9,31 December 2006,"Westerns have largely gone out of style and that's a pity. Like good SF, a good western can teach valuable lessons from a perspective that makes us more amenable to accepting them.Silverado has all the trappings of a traditional western while updating it with more contemporary references. While it remains true to the usual mythology of a traditional western (strong, taciturn heroes who are impossibly good with their weapons), it also touches on more mature subjects and relationships between the principle characters.The cast is excellent. Brian Dennehy gives another excellent performance as a 3-dimensional villain. The principle good guys, Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover, and Kevin Costner are all excellent (except for Costner who only rises to the level of ""very good"" - a real achievement for Costner). The secondary roles, played by Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Goldblum, and especially Linda Hunt are equally well written and played.If you like westerns, and maybe even if you don't, this is an excellent film.",Silverado

I believe the Italians made great job and they had magnificent portrait the real ""cowboys"", the dirty fellas, the hard rough life, the violence, etc...
The American western films on the other hand are too ""theatrical"", too perfect, they showing the characters with perfect clothes, haircuts, etc. like John Wane and others.This is an American DIAMOND, though!!! This takes the ""roughness"" of the Italian western films and the ""class"" of the American ones and makes the perfect match, the great combo.Great sites/areas of the film shooting, lovely realistic SFXs, nice costumes (not too ""damaged"" as the ""spaghetti"", not so perfect as the classic American films), with a good cast of nice actors and above all.... an AMAZING SUPERB SOUNDTRACK!
This film's soundtrack/music is SO PURE WESTERN than anybody else I remember! When you listening the main them of ""Silverado"" and close your eyes... you smelling the leather, the horse bellow your legs, the gun-powder from the Colt hand-guns,...

The characters are the best part of this film. Paden, Emmett and Mal are all really cool. Even the bad guys are cool, with John Cleese as a town sheriff and Jeff Goldblum as a gambler.The action scenes are cool too. The shootout at the ranch towards the end is amazing. Most of the characters are likable and relatable, and each of the main characters has their own story arc. Well, all except for one. My only complaint with this film is that the four character of the four main characters has no personality.He does absolutely nothing in the film until the end and he's just a loudmouth alcoholic. It doesn't help that he's played by Kevin Costner either.

One thing other reviewers seem to forget is how good Jeff Fahey was. He is always SO good at the nutty, cruel crazy type of character. Must be the contrast of his blue eyes with his dark hair. Did a great job. And, even if you don't like Kevin Costner, as some don't, he did a fantastic job as the cocky, young, afraid of nothing brother of Emmet. And, he looked like he had a blast playing the part. And he sure could ride. I remember that Scott Glen had a harder time adjusting to being a cowboy during the training for the film.. and got hurt I think. He sure overcame that..looked like a natural too. Yes, they should have made a sequel, the group of actors were too good together to not see again. Other favorite westerns? Tombstone.....Val Kilmer as Doc was SUPERB.

87,mikavir,1980s moderate western,7,26 March 2021,"The 1980s didn't offer much to fans of Western movies. Lawrence Kasdan's Silverado is one of them. It respects very much the legacy of older westerns.The main characters are Paden (Kevin Kline), Emmett (Scott Glenn), Jake (Kevin Costner) and Mal (Danny Glover). They arrive to Silverado, which is a little town, for different reasons. Brothers Emmett and Jake visit their sister and her family, Mal goes to see his family and ex-criminal Paden is looking for a new start. But Silverado is very corrupt town. Sheriff Cobb (Brian Dennehy), his deputies and McKendrick, a ranch owner, with his workers drive settlers and farmers away from the town. Cobb owns a saloon where Paden is working and requires that Paden and his colleague Stella (Linda Hunt) don't intervene in McKendrick's criminal activities, although they would like to stop it. McKendrick is an enemy of Emmett, Jake and Mal. The situation is solved in traditional ways of western movies.The beginning part of the movie is little boring and contains side branches of the plot which aren't so important. The quality of the movie improves towards the end. The landscapes and music are great. Some actors are very good for example Glover and Hunt. If the movie were shorter it would be better. Traditional western elements are very nice to watch. 7/10.",Silverado
88,clck2001,One of the best Westerns ever made.,10,16 September 2007,"I absolutely love this movie! I could watch it every night. Favorite scenes: early scene when Emmett kills the guys who try to jump him, steps out of the cabin with the rifle on his shoulder, when Jake steps out of the saloon, says Hey! and kills Tyree and the other deputy, when Mal kills Slick, when Emmett's rifle is damaged, he dropped his pistol, but he knows he has to kill McKendrick, so he steers his horse into a building, turns it around, and wallops McKendrick in the head with the horses' hooves when McKendrick rides by, when Paden shoots Cobb, and when Mal is jumping from rock to rock with his rifle in hand. Each character has a scene which defines their personality, their willingness to do away with the bad guys, and caring about what they thought was right. All of the cast is great. Sure, the story is very simple, and has been used before, but who cares? This movie makes that type of story an epic, and so does Open Range, also starring Kevin Costner, but in a different way, because it is a different movie. Favorite characters: I like all four of the heroes, but for different reasons. I like Emmett because he is not like the other characters. He does not make jokes like they do. He just laughs at them. Of course, he probably thought that it was pretty funny when he pulled that stunt on Sheriff Langston. Emmett is just different, which is a good thing. I like Paden because he is friends with Cobb, but does not know what Cobb is doing behind the scenes until later. But when he does find out, he does not get nervous, or mad, but instead, is calm, cool, (very cool), and collected. That is why I had to watch this movie several times before I realized that Paden knows what's going on much earlier than you would think. That is because he expected that something was fishy way back at the cavalry outpost, when Cobb said he had a legitimate job. But Paden just tried to blow it off by making a joke about it because he was hoping that Cobb was not doing that kind of thing anymore. His suspicions mounted when Tyree came onto the scene, with an evil look, a sneer, and a joke about a dog to go along with his instantly not being liked by the audience. Cobb still was doing that kind of thing. It was not actually affirmed to me that Cobb was the main badguy until the scene where Cobb punches Kelly in the stomach, throws him out the door, is ""warned"" by Stella, and shoots Kelly. But Stella was not warning Cobb, she was warning Kelly, even though she has a distaste for Kelly, and later, hates Cobb's guts and everything else about him. I like Jake because he does not have any personal enemies, but still just comes in, and starts a ruckus. That is what makes him so funny and energetic. I like Mal because he cares for his sister and his father even when they thought he was not coming back, and Rae does not want to have him in her sight at first. He cares for his sister, that he is even willing to kill Slick, who did not do anything especially bad to Rae personally, but he did to Mal himself. That is why Mal had to kill him- he obviously did not think he deserved to live. And to top it all off, they are all VERY good shots. Favorite lines: Hey!, Where's the dog?, Welcome to Heaven, Looking for this?, Oh, Kate! Sweet Kate!, I don't want to kill you, and you don't want to be dead, and you better start lookin'.",Silverado

91,dbryn,Silverado Review,5,9 February 2012,"As a screenwriter, I can see how this movie was made and I'm taking notes NOT to do this in my own work. With four characters, none are developed enough to create strong empathy for anyone. In fact, perhaps the strongest empathy created is to Mal, who loses a father and witnesses the shooting of his sister - yet Mal isn't perceived as the main 'hero'. Of the other main characters, Jake (Costner) simply tags along acting goofy, yet he has one of the better performances of the bunch. Emmett has no clear motivation in the story until the last 40minutes. Paden's development is weak and he finally befriends the bartender over an hour into the movie. Knowing her for only a 24hr period (and not in a romantic way), he's willing to step aside and watch his friends get shot up so that she won't get fired? It's not believable. In my opinion, the story doesn't work and surprisingly some of the acting looked like... acting. It didn't seem natural. At the 1hr 45min mark I was hoping the movie would end and 30minutes later I was granted satisfaction. If this film can be considered one of the better westerns, it's no wonder the western has disappeared over the past twenty years.",Silverado

93,mike683,You have got to be kidding?,4,26 July 2006,"Silverado arrives as a typical Western, with your standard good guys, villains, intruding and ill-prepared settlers, all of their women, a town in corruptive turmoil, personal vendettas, a ranch, and the obligatory stampede. Spice it up with the centralized saloon-gambling hall with a guy named ""Slick"", gunslingers, ladies of the evening, and a vertically challenged version of Gunsmoke's Miss Kitty. Then you epically conclude it all with showdown gunfights, including one in front of a church no less.Yes, Silverado covers all the bases and zealously steals every Western cliché' ever conceived. However, with its abundance of cliché' Silverado misses the opportunity to be daringly different. In comparison to Eastwood's 'Unforgiven', Silverado's message of good eventually triumphs over evil (only if evil gets careless) is sadly mundane and it begs the question, why did they even bother to make this film?The answer lies somewhere in the conceptual thinking of the producers, writers, and director, who tragically missed an opportunity to take a talented ensemble and make a poignant and meaningful film that actually had the potential to send a distinctive message.Ironically, the last line in the movie, ""We'll be back!"" is telling and I sincerely hope it never comes to fruition. So far, so good!",Silverado
94,brtndr,A Return to the Classic Western(but with a modern touch),10,18 August 2012,"By the time ""Silverado"" was released in 85' the tone of the western genre' had moved dramatically from TV shows like 'Gunsmoke', Bonanza and John Wayne movies of the 30's, 40's and 50's, way over to Clint Eastwood's (anti-hero cowboy) beginning with Sergio Leon's highly stylistic 'Spaghetti Westerns' of the 1960's. Clint Eastwood's and Sergio's - No Name Gunslinger - was so iconic by the 70's that it was almost impossible to imagine that westerns could ever return to its former epic past of movies like 'Stagecoach' and 'The Searchers'. However, Lawrence Kasdan's, ""Silverado"" is a great blending of both the classic epic westerns of John Ford and John Wayne with the more modernistic nomadic ""anti-hero cowboy"" of Sergio and Eastwood. Silverado begins with Scott Glenn as an ex-con cowboy named Emmet - best known in 85' as the baddie' ex-con in 'Urban Cowboy'. He is engaged in an intense gun battle against several men for reasons unknown to the audience at that time. All we know is that these people want to kill each other for some reason, and it doesn't end well for the guys not named Emmet. After starting the movie off with lots of bangs, Emmet soon teams-up with the down on his luck Paden (played by Kevin Kline) who has been robbed and left for dead in the desert. Paden is a soft spoken mild mannered gambler (until you steal his stuff) with a mysteriously dark past who loves a saloon. One of many vice's Paden eventually confronts in a showdown by the conclusion of the film.Emmet and Paden make a quick stop in the small town of Turley to meetup with Emmet's younger brother Jake before continuing their journey to 'Silverado'. Jake (played by Kevin Costner) is more of a loud, wild and reckless James Dean type of cowboy gunslinger. You could describe him as, 'A Rebel with a Two Gun Rig', who often gets himself into a lot of trouble when ever he kisses a pretty girl in a town. After our 3-protagonists (Emmet, Paden and Jake) are chased out of the sleepy town of Turley by Sheriff Langston (played by John Cleese) and his possee, they're unexpectedly joined by Mal (played by Danny Glover) who was run out of town the day before. Mal is a butcher from Chicago who is also on his way to the outskirts of Silverado to reunite with his family and help run their cattle ranch. So, with the movies 4-protanganist now firmly established we continue our journey to 'Silverado'. However, not before a little male bonding along the way that involves a gang of thieves and some wagon settlers who are also on their way to Silverado. After everyone eventually reaches Silverado alive and still kicking, our 4-protaganists (Emmet, Paden, Jake and Mal) go their separate ways. This is where the story takes on a whole new unexpected turn, beginning when Paden walks into the Midnight Star saloon of Silverado. Come lookin' for a possible saloon job, Paden first meets the older but charming saloon manager Stella (played by Linda Hunt) who Paden quickly establishes a close friendship and deep bond with. Then, Paden discovers that his old outlaw riding buddy Cobb (played by Brian Dennehy of 'Rambo' fame) is not only the owner of the saloon, but is also the sheriff of Silverado. Warning to all of Cobb's future employees: You definitely don't want to get on Sheriff Cobb's bad side. Soon after Paden accepts Cobb's job offer to help run his saloon, Jeff Golblum joins the cast as a professional gambler named Slick. Who runs an honest poker game but, is not the most straight-up and honest person himself.
 
From here, all the conflicts in 'Silverado' center around corrupt sheriff Cobb's behavior and Paden having to choose between siding with his old pal Cobb and his lucrative saloon business, or his own sense of personal ethics by siding with his latest riding buddies (Emmet, Jake and Mal) who are now in a war with Cobb and his deputies.All of these wide variety of characters and their separate plot lines all come together in a very exciting and emotionally poignant manner by the conclusion of the film. Which many film makers try to accomplish, but very few succeed at. Watch 'Silverado'. You'll be glad that you did.",Silverado
95,hipcheck,The Western of the 80's,10,18 September 2000,"Take a Western.  Open with a guns-blazing scene with genre veteran Scott Glenn, then run the credits through a shot straight out of The Searchers. It sure seems that this film is heading toward the same ground that almost every other Western has covered...but you'll quickly find that this one is on ground all its own.I am admittedly not a fan of Westerns.  There are those that I find to be really terrific, but I can live without most of them.  Silverado was the first that really showed me something other than the Fords and Hawks (classics to be sure) that I grew up with--the second was Unforgiven.Silverado takes an unlikely cast, most of whom have not seen much time in the old West, outside of Glenn.  People like Costner, who for better or worse (better) is in top form.  Kevin Kline and Brian Dennehy, who are both at their charming best.  All the leads really shine, in what feels like a troupe effort, wherein it seems like they are a tight-knit group of co-artisans.Kasdan's direction is where it pretty much always is, so if you appreciate his work, you certainly won't be let down here.  Anyone who can write and direct a great performance from Costner deserves ample praise.  And speaking of the script, written by Lawrence and brother Mark Kasdan, it is really one of the best.  It manages to weave all the elements of the genre around some of the best dialogue a Western's ever had.  Danny Glover may have been thinking of bad Western scripts when he says, ""That ain't right.  I had enough of what ain't right.""Still, there is something beyond all of this, something that I think I'll attribute to the collaborative nature of filmmaking, and that is the soul of the film.  It presents itself as something that doesn't take itself too seriously, however it is heavy enough to carry any classic fan of the West. What may be the most amazing thing about the film, is how long it is.  I believe the available print comes in right around 2 hours, and the pacing and length feel just right...but there is a longer print that adds nearly *90* minutes!  Rumor has it that this print is only in the hands of Kasdan himself, and he has no plans to show it to anyone.  I, for one, would nearly die to find out how there could be another hour and a half.  Maybe someday...",Silverado

Bumping into each other on the sagebrush, in the saloon . . . There is great writing, pretty good writing, and some writing that just falls flat immediately, E.g. When Kevin Costner asks Danny Glover if was ""Wonderful."" Despite those flaws and the fact that the entire movie was far too long, it also dramatizes some great scenes! I enjoyed being entangled with the love triangle between three of my favorite actors, and I thought that Danny Glover's every line carried menace, grit and authenticity. Kevin Kline and Scott Glenn portrayed characters who were consistently true to self, true to type and true to life. Linda Hunt was solid and integral to her character and the plot. These three performers made me forget immediately that they were not truly the flesh and blood individuals they were enacting. The scene in which the little boy was taken was over the top for me, lugubrious and the music was more than occasionally overpowering. Brian Dennehy was perfect, malicious, egotistical and delighted with his machinations throughout the movie. The cinematography and editing were both exemplary. I thought that Jeff Goldblum's considerable talents were wasted for the most part, however, Lynn Whitfield shone in every scene, even as a minor character. I watch it every year, but I always wish that Lawrence kasdorn had disciplined himself to keep only the very best events, characters, speeches, lines and effects. Despite my criticism, i wish I were gifted enough to have written the screenplay and I recommend it highly for devotees of classic westerns.

I thought he played a goofy roll, but there was just something about it that clicked with me. I am a western movie fan a hundred percent. I love the wild west. Silverado was the perfect example of the west. It has beautiful scenery, a great cast, four men who believe in truth, justice, and the American cowboy way. My favorite part is when Kevin Costner kicks in the saloon doors and comes out to kill two at once. Sensational! The only problem I have with this movie is that there isn't enough of Kevin Costner in it. I was left wanting more, more, and even more. He has an adorable laugh too. linda Hunt as the little saloon keeper was great. John Cleese as the sheriff was humurous. Everybody did their parts to perfection. This is truly a 10 plus movie.

But, this movie got lost in time.It is easy to call this movie derivative, only because Hollywood and Television made hundreds of westerns that everyone and their grandfather must've seen before this was made. That doesn't make it a bad movie--and, at least, Lee Marvin doesn't sing.I saw this movie a few times when I was in junior high, and didn't get much of a chance to see it later.

Wayne shoots 14 times with a 6 shooter in 'sons of Katie', and l. van cleef has a magic gun in 'few dollars more', one whose accuracy wasn't affected by the fact that black powder residue clogged the rifling on pre 1910 weapons after a few shots. but in silverado, this 'truth stretching' goes to the 'Outer Limits'.in one scene, glover is on a roof mowing down bad guys with his rifle, and Kline, on the ground 75 yards away and perceiving an important secondary threat, gets glover's attention by shooting, from 75 yards away, the side plate of glover's rifle with a pistol shot. riiight. but then what does Danny do? he smiles a thank you, receives his instructions from some wig-wag gestures, and then proceeds to mow down more bad guys WITH THE SAME RIFLE!!! this a scene worthy of the 2nd stupidest western ever made.then there is Mr. Kline as Paden. i have enjoyed his work in the past- Fishy Wanda, Big Chill, Soapdish, etc. but his attempts at the spaghetti-western-Eastwood-wallach-type-stare are just plain embarrassing. he doesn't have a clue about the tiny little eye-muscle tics needed for an essential Super-Western eye-to-eye encounter.it's like travolta talking to devito in 'get shorty'. ""look at me, martin"". ""i am looking at you"". ""are you trying to tell me that you are sleepy??"" if the kasdans' had tried to make something original out of this, maybe this would have been as good as their other stuff, but they apparently tried to do a spaghetti western copy, and they did not get The Joke well enough to retell it successfully.this is a movie to own so that we can put something on for the in-laws on thanksgiving. you know, this is a western for those who do not know the western genre very well.the cinematography IS awesome, and that is what will rivet the in-laws and other losers, but true western lovers will not be satisfied by this 'top gun' styled rip-off.""it couda ben a contender"", but it's a joke, it's a caricature, no more.",Silverado

Costner(not a big fan) does a much better job in Silverado than in his flat acting style of late.  I wonder where his acting got sidetracked? A strange mix of actors but they all did a credible job.

The plot had much going on, but was always honed back to the humor, action, and suspense that doesn't let a moment go by as dull. Perhaps, a few westerns have outclassed it in cinematography, but Silverado has its spectacular moments. The acting, though, propels this movie. The actors in most classic westerns of the 40s, 50s, and early 60s are absurdly flabby. They never get out of their urban physicality. Scott Glenn oozes authenticity. Kevin Kostner is prized colt. Danny Glover is a real person with his own dramatic story as opposed to the ""nice token good Indian/black guy sidekick"", and Kevin Kline is a far more affable and identifiable hero than the stoic machismo of a John Wayne.

And these are just the principals.Silverado is a sweeping Western demi-epic that takes some classic genre cliches and weaves them into a modern classic, emboldened by Bruce Boughton's masterful score.

Like other directors who failed to watch the above films and note that the genre is complete, Lawrence Kasdan took his shot at it with ""Silverado"" and the result is a train wreck. The plot is either incomprehensible or simply missing; it's really hard to tell. It seems as if the director shot two or three full-length movies and then edited the thing, in random order, into a single product. What happened to Rosanna Arquette? She disappears about a third of the way in and them magically reappears at the end as if she'd been there all along.The actors, as others here have noted, are pretty much phoning in their performances. John Cleese and Kevin Kline seem to be in the wrong movie, Danny Glover seems to be in the wrong century, and Jeff Goldblum seems to be in the wrong universe.The script, which many mistake for homage, is simply a tired retread of every single cliché ever used in a western. The only thing missing was someone saying, ""This town ain't big enough for the both of us."" I suppose there may be a clever way of rehashing tired movie clichés in a new script, but you won't find it here.

You can also see why Jeff Fahey's eyes made him famous (he also possesses just the right amount of facial hair). After this movie, I became a real Danny Glover fan, too, he is smashing and cuddly in that soft felt hat.IMDB demographics show that this movie plays well with females of a middle-age, and it probably always will. The sets, the landscapes, the costumes have great intrinsic appeal. Scott Glenn's buff-colored wardrobe is peak. There are such a wide variety of hat styles, each of them speaking perfectly to the characters' personalities (which is what cowboy hats are supposed to do: guys in the real world, take note).Since there's only one woman for us to identify with (as usual, in a Western), Rosanna was a good choice. She's cute and pert, but not a glamour queen. She doesn't even seem as anachronistic as you might think.The horses are fine, too. The scene where their breath puffs out in the brisk air and they trot through the snow is a Christmas card. Ah, to be in New Mexico or Montana...And in case you're worried about Kevin Costner, he's kind of okay in this, maybe even cute.

Scott Glenn plays the gruff but caring older brother. You really could believe that Glenn and Costner were brothers. Danny Glover is fantastic and his character shoots as straight as he does with his acting We can only hope that these characters will be back on the big screen someday.

116,ghenrikson-1,The Last Traditional Western,8,25 February 2006,"""Silverado"" is a milestone in cinema. It's the last truly traditional Western made on a big budget. The major Westerns of the '90's have been revisionist to at least some extent. From ""Unforgiven"" to ""Tombstone"" and ""Open Range,"" if you went back in time and played them to a 1940's audience they would storm out on the film. However, ""Silverado"" would have made perfect sense to them.The plot is a distillation of hundreds of classic Westerns. The script is free from profanity and is straight enough to have come out of one of the big studios of old. The film itself is traditional, with no strange angles or excessive hand camera work. Many long shots are taken, breathing air into the film in a way that reminds the viewer of John Ford's Monument Valley westerns. And most remarkably, the film ignores the gritty realism that had already come to characterize modern Westerns by the mid-80's.No big-budget Western since ""Silverado"" has tackled the genre in such a traditional fashion, and it's doubtful one ever will.

The fullscreen version of Silverado is a truly wonderful movie, but it suffers terribly from losing so much of the image.

The single most important example is the climax of the film - Paden and the Sheriff's old-style fast-draw - wherein the audience cannot see the action until too late. It simply doesn't appear on screen. Many of Kevin Costner's best sequences also occur off-screen or mostly off-screen. Thankfully, there has been enough interest to result in a limited widescreen release on DVD in 1999, but it has been discontinued, and is now only available used from collectors. This comment is to encourage the many fans of this wonderful film to also seek out the widescreen version.

John Ford, Howard Hawks, Henry Hathaway and others who really knew how to make westerns must have spun in their graves with this piece of stuff came out.

And also apparently, said villains couldn't shoot worth a hoot, hardly ever hitting or even coming close to the heroes. If the old west was really like this, no one would have survived. Everyone would have been killed. In summary, Silverado is a weak story, of nearly continuous episodes of killings and violence, too infrequently punctuated with dialog or any meaningful exposition.",Silverado

123,mscottmcconnell,2nd best western of the 80's,10,11 February 2007,"Easily the best western made in the 80's after Clint Eastwood's ""Pale Rider"". The one place that it far outshines Pale Rider is in the large amount of humor. Pale Rider is a fantastic movie, but depressing. Silverado is a fantastic movie that leaves you smiling and wanting more. The cast is great including Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover the always overrated Kevin Costner, Brian Denney full of menace, a very slick Jeff Goldblum ( until recently engaged to a girl from my town of Winnipeg, resulting in regular sightings of him here ), and even an appearance by John Cleese from across the pond. Everybody gives great performances. Even Costner is decent, probably because he only has to play a man-child. If you enjoy a good western then this is for you. The movie starts off strong and keeps up the interest right through till the end. The length of the movie is nice too, it is long enough to develop a serious story, but not of epic lengths such as the Lord of the Ring movies, which were far too long.",Silverado
124,jshapiro-1,Great Start makes up for weak finish,8,1 April 2003,"LOVED this movie until they got to Silverado, at which point it tailed off.

I am not a mayor western fan, but I am a great admirerer of that rare thing in Hollywood movies: A Good Script. Great characters with a lot of depth and real lives walk around in Silverado and do stuff. Not because of the story, but because of who they are. Even the women are completly fleshed out and no, I am not talking about the size of their breasts. Kevin Kline is brilliant and after seeing him last week in The Wild Wild West, he completly redeemed himself, even though Silverado was made 25 years before that turkey. Even Kevin Kostner did a great job (and didn't end up on the cutting table like in the other great Kasdan movie, The Big Chill). Only the music is dated in this wonderfull adventure, were you are really scared that one of the main characters may end up dead. Because Kasdan is not playing by the rules, you get something even rarer then a great script; a western without cliches.",Silverado

The plot, while seemingly simple, is made more intricate as there ae really about 4 lead characters, each with his own ""mission."" Scott Glenn is superb as the cowboy riding to meet his brother so they can travel to California.  Kevin Kline is outstanding as Paden.  In a part that could have been overplayed, Kline is brilliant in his portrayal of a man in search of a place to put down roots.  Not outdone by either is Danny Glover, as the man seeking to reunite with his family only to find tragedy.  And Kevin Costner is hilarious as Glenn's brother, a wild fast-gun shootist.

138,baldterror,A Feel Good Western,7,9 November 2000,"It's probably the best feeling Western made since the heyday of Roy Rogers. It's specially crafted to make us feel good.  There's no disturbing subtext, and it takes a very modern approach to the issue of racism.  Yes, there is racism but only the bad guys exhibit it.  And there's no injuns, because you can't have injuns in a Western nowadays without it dwelling on the redman's plight and that's just too depressing.  That's what this film gives you: the fun myth of Manifest Destiny without the sad reality of the subjugation of the native peoples.Yes, when we were kids we played cowboys and indians, but now we feel guilty about it.  Thankfully, when we were kids we also played white hat vs. black hat.  Good guys with six shooters versus bad guys with six shooters.  That's what Silverado taps into: the cool, still politically correct aspects of the Western.  Good fun without the guilt.  That's something Kasdan knows how to do.  He wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark that conjured up a similar formula for the old pulp serials.That's not to say the characters are simplistic.  They compare quite favorably to characters in such classic old Westerns as Stagecoach.  They just don't have the kind of depressing depth of character that you see in The Searchers.  There are good guys and there are bad guys and there really isn't much doubt which is which.  Still, there is really only one unsympathetic character in the whole film and that would Jeff Fahey's Tyree. You've got to have one really dirty dog in the movie, after all.  The two main bad guys are Ray Baker's underdeveloped Ethan McKendrick and the charming Cobb played by Brian Dennehy.  It's probably Dennehy's best performance.  He's Claudius in the old West, ""that a man may smile and be a villain!""  Yeah, those are the best villains, not the dreary scowling ones.There are four protagonists but the star is Kevin Kline as Paden.  He's actually got a complex back story.  He used to be a criminal and ran with Cobb!  The film's approach to good vs. bad is not deterministic.  Kline's performance is cool and collected, but the character really comes to life in the scenes with Linda Hunt's Stella.  They have a real chemistry, they are kindred spirits.  Danny Glover and Scott Glenn are solid, but it is Kevin Costner who really steals the show.  This is the movie that set him on the path to stardom and he's never really given a more charismatic performance as the slightly crazy man-child samurai six shooter master Jake.Fine supporting performances are turned in by John Cleese as a sheriff with the intelligence to know when he's run across the heroes of a Western, Joe Seneca as Danny Glover's father, Lynn Whitfield as Glover's sister, the scrumptious Amanda Wyss as phoebe the barmaid, Jeff Goldblum as the gambler Slick whose alliances are always up in the air, and a curiously uncredited Brion James as the curmudgeonly coot who leads a wagon train.The plot revolves around the old conflict between farmers and ranchers.  If you think about it now I'm sure you could successfully guess all the plot points ahead of time, but when you're watching it the movie's energy takes over and you just enjoy the roller coaster ride of fun and excitement!Good, clean fun about a time we know was neither, but in the movies it can be.",Silverado

I love a good western flick as much as the next man, but when Silverado aired this morning, it just went ""clunk"".Perhaps what got under my skin is that it's just dripping with modern political correctness, a glaring anachronism for the time period portrayed. When John Cleese's character says ""I don't much care for that word"" in response to someone uttering the ""N"" word in a bar, I just lost it. (My late great aunt used the ""N"" word in polite dialog well into the 1970s, to her it was just a descriptive word with no baggage attached. I can't imagine that folks had similar heightened racial sensitivities in the late 1800s!) Of course, all of the real evil villains in Silverado are white males. All the heroes and heroines are persons of color, female, physically handicapped, or if they're cursed with being Anglo and male, they have some endearing internal conflict or past victimhood to excuse their gender and paleness. Yawn. It's really getting trite.How I yearn for the cowboys heroes of the old genre, simple unconflicted stories where good triumphed over evil, the bad guy had a black hat for easy identification, and the hero got the girl in the end and rode happily off into the sunset. John Wayne and John Ford, you are missed terribly these days.",Silverado

The cast is like a dream, with Kline, Hunt, and Costner turning in some really smashing performances.

I first saw this on opening day and I still enjoy watching it on DVD, just last night, in fact. It certainly ranks in the top five of all time. The best scene in the film is during the shoot out at the ranch. Jake (Kevin Costner) has been declared dead from falling off a horse. When he swung down from the rafters to help Paden (Kevin Kline) in the barn scene shoot out,the audience broke out into cheers an applause. I've never seen another western that brought out such a reaction from the audience before or since. My only disappointment is that there was no sequel. At the end of the movie, when Jake calls out, ""We'll be back!"" as they ride off, I thought a sequel would soon follow. But, I suppose that Costner's rate probably went too high.",Silverado

It also represents the first and last decent performance by Costner. Even if your not into westerns you should give Silverado a try, you won't be sorry! Where's the dog?",Silverado

As a western it manages to pay homage to nearly all Western tropes but not too seriously - gunfights, saloon fights, stampedes, posse chases, wagon drives, corrupt law enforcement and even the strong pioneer woman who really helped settle the Old West.But....the one thing I really couldn't stand was the constant reference to the character of Augie as 'the little boy.' He's not a little anything. He must be 16 years old trying to pass as 11. It just doesn't work. And because it doesn't work, there's no real heart tugging at his predictable kidnapping.But that is my only objection.",Silverado
148,beajohnson8183,"A great movie with lots of plots and stars, some, before they were famous!",10,7 September 2005,"I fell in love with Kevin Costner and his character watching this movie!!! I had never seen him before but his character in Silverado is well portrayed as a carefree fun loving young adult. All his mannerisms were very endearing and unique. Scott Glenn is superb as a decent law abiding cowboy just trying to do what's right and Danny Glover's character is wholesome, earthy and strong. Brian Dennehy is great as the older villain you love to hate and Jeff Fahey is super as the younger villain who is equally as evil but a very cute bad boy. Then you have Kevin Kline who does a wonderful job playing the intelligent yet not wanting to be too serious type citizen but who always does what's right, not what's easy. John Cleese and Jeff Goldblum are terrific as well as very colorful western men. The amazing Linda Hunt is even in it as a strong woman standing her ground as is Rosanna Arquette's character. I couldn't believe it when I first saw it because of all the big names and how great all the plots were and how they were all inner twined so beautifully. I couldn't wait to find out how it all came together in the end and when it did I was not disappointed. I bought the movie as soon as I could and I still love watching it. I consider it a classic as a newer Hollywood western. I thought it was very realistic yet entertaining and exciting because of all the big names. The ones who become famous later did a fantastic job because I was immediately curious as to who they were and wondered why they weren't famous already. The action is great, the violence is effective without being too harsh, the sweet and tender moments are just right, the morals represented are wonderful even for today's lessons and I wish everyone could see it and enjoy it. It reminds me of ""It's a Mad Mad Mad World"" because of all that is going on and of all the stars who keep popping up while you are intensely watching it.

Most of the stars seemed miscast, no one seemed to draw acting talent out of the stars. Must have been done at studio behest only. Phoned in, if you know what I mean, but an expensive phone call. Somehow Costner didn't even look appealing, Klein looked out of time, Dennehy looked like a canned sheriff, Goldblum also seemed like he was dressed up for the wrong century.

153,trrytchr,Reviving the Cowboy Genre,10,21 October 2006,"I thought this was one of the greatest cowboy movies made in modern times. It completely revived the cowboy genre of the ""old"" days - when the bad guys were bad and the good guys were good. That the good guys were slightly bad and could be redeemed. I'm tired of movies that the lines of who is good and who is bad is extremely blurred. I realize this is a black and white attitude; but in today's society, we need to return to that value. I grew up on John Wayne and Gary Cooper and Clint Eastwood movies. They were Westerns you wanted to watch - the good guys fighting for the little people and overcoming the odds (which was really impossible, we knew, but we wanted it to be that way). It harks back to the view that movies should entertain - and Silverado entertains from start to finish. I loved Kevin Kline; and Scott Glenn as the monosyllabic cowboy was fantastic. From the opening scene, reminiscent of all the good ole cowboy flicks, to the closing--maybe we'll make a sequel (extremely too bad that they didn't)--ending, you enjoy and are entertained.",Silverado
154,historygeek-2,An Homage that works on it's own,9,24 February 2007,"Many other people here have commented on how formulaic this movie is. Sure it is- it's Kasdan's tribute to the Westerns he loves. One doesn't write a tribute to the Beatles without some kind of imitation. Take it for what it is, on that level.But it's also a great movie on it's own. The acting is terrific, the plot is pretty much what the plot of a Western is supposed to be, and we all agree on the scenery and music.I have trouble with some of the other (negative) reviews. Several state that the characters are too black and white. I didn't see it. Look at the 4 main characters. Emmet is just out of prison, for murder. Justified? Sure, but still ""murder"". Paden is a reformed crook, seemingly trying to go straight. Mal is a ""black sheep"" whose family thinks he abandoned them. And Jake-well he's immature, and thinks with his guns. (All three of them.) How are they too good and pure? The movie is about writing wrongs, and redeeming oneself, so there have to be some skeletons buried.The actors portraying the main 4 do a great job. Scott Glenn makes Emmet a man of iron will. Kevin Kline's Paden is a fatalist, just trying to keep alive. Danny Glover plays Mal as a man that wants to be treated as a man, with dignity and the desire for what's right. And Kevin Costner is just having a rollicking good time.The bad guys are somewhat formulaic I agree, though I think Brian Dennehy as Cobb comes across as a crook who is trying to (sorta) go straight. Sure he'll do what he has to, but he's found a place where he thinks he can fit in, and he'll do what has to be done to keep it. Jeff Fahey as Tyree is terrific- there's not enough of him. He's a complete psychopath, but Fahey does a great job- he's got the whole ""Helter Skelter"" eyes thing going on.Other roles are less interesting. I agree that Jeff Goldblum's ""Slick"" is not much, nor well-played. I think the idea of the crooked gambler was good, but the part didn't work out well. Too bad. John Cleese worked as a sheriff. Sure, he added a light touch, and I think the role was written specifically for him (just a hunch), but he's also a realist. He wants to keep the peace in his town, and that's it. If the Bad Guys get away, well good riddance. Just don't come back.I did like Rosanna Arquette. She played a hard-working woman with some ""funny"" ideas. Understated, and true. It's impossible to make her look anything less than breath-taking, but they dressed her in a matronly fashion, and avoided the temptation to have her bathe in a convenient body of water, which broke my heart then and now.As for the story, well so what if the climax was predictable. This is a movie- it's not a documentary. The good guys win, and the bad guys die for their sins. Duh. Was it surprising that Cobb and Paden faced off in the street? No, but that's what one expects in a Western. And it was done well. Both men knew it was coming, and both faced Fate, knowing that their friendship (if that's the right word) means nothing. Lots of bad guys got killed, but that's what happens when you back the wrong horse. They made their choices, and it ended badly.I think that the biggest problem here is the lack of background. As mentioned above, the characters have histories that bring them all together here, but we don't know any more. Why did Mal leave his family? What is the background of Paden, and so on. Given the length of the movie, none of this could be covered, which is why a prequel would be a great idea. Perhaps LK could do one now, with different actors portraying the younger men and women....? So overall, it's a great movie, and a great western. It pays tribute to the great ones that went before, even requiring the same suspension of disbelief as some of them. But it's a good vs. evil story, and succeeds well. Was it as ""real"" as Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" (which I found boring)? Probably not, but Clint was going for the Anti-western. Kasdan went for the real thing. What he achieved is a classic movie of it's genre. Watch it, know it, love it.",Silverado
155,louise-317,Classic Proof? Can be watched 100's of times!,9,29 September 2007,"The is the true test of a classic, how many time you can stare at it ... not to mention that even if you're on your 20th time it's difficult to leave the room because that ""line"" or ""that scene"" are just about to come up. One of the delights of this movie are the character that pop up in each new town the venture through ... the scene with Paden and his horse, the next town and the characters with his hat ... Oh, my goodness John Cleese's Langston his part is so short yet so sweetly perfect. Then to imagine it's not until they finally arrive in Silverado that we meet the unbeatable embodiment of grace and confidence Miss Stella played by Linda Hunt and if that is enough special surprises along the way you still get to meet ""Slick"" (Jeff Goldblum) when he comes to town. When I read through the quotes for this movie I realized the best way to support my nine is to say the entire script should be there. My family and many others I met are obsessed with the script ... many of the lines are household phrases we use over and over again ... I think they missed ... ""Yer empty Mr."". Watch for the facial expressions between Paden and Stella when they're attempting to ""stay of of the middle"" of the town trouble. Linda Hunt's one look, when she figures out what ""Cobb has on him this time"" should win her an academy award. We have a whole room at our cabin devoted to Silverado. I guess someone could watch it and say, yeah, this is kinda dull ... I guess. It's NOT ... it's all about the one liners and amazing acting ... Lawrence's other movies are great but when you see the humor than Mark Kasdan adds to things you'll be pleasantly surprised.

158,mikeholloway,I always love watching this movie.............,10,6 July 2012,"SILVERADO was released in 1985 and brought westerns back to America and the world. SILVERADO was a sleeper that did excellent here in the states and Europe. It has continued to be a popular rental and has actually become a cult classic. Its popularity has continued to appeal to new audiences that were not even born when it was released. Hat's off to Lawrence Kasdan for hiring the best gun coach in the business, Arvo Ojala (1920-2005). Arvo was the father of fast draw, a sport born from the television westerns of the 1950's. Arvo was the fast draw expert who taught all the big name stars their gun handling skills. His job on SILVERADO was to make Kevin Costner proficient with a pair of Colt Single Action Army revolvers and by the way Kevin handled them in the movie, it seems that Arvo taught him well. If you have never seen this movie, go rent it. You will end up buying your own copy!",Silverado
159,hardingerdk,"When the music started, I was 10 again.",10,22 October 2019,A GREAT western! Fantastic actors and villains die by the dozen. What more can you ask for? Costner was incredible as an ADHD teenager (almost). Will enjoy it again soon.,Silverado
160,weasel626,SIlverado The Birth of a Western Hero,10,7 December 2015,"Silverado 1985 spoilersAs far as westerns go there're two big names Clint Eastwood and John Wayne. I would like to submit another name for the famous western actors Kevin Costner. Kevin Costner has been in Wyatt Earp, dances with wolves, open range, etc. My favorite Western to feature Kevin Costner is Silverado. As a whole I feel Silverado is under appreciate. The story is unique featuring a group of heroes who are less then honorable. We first me Emmitt (Scott Glenn) in a lonely dusty cabin in the middle of nowhere. The silence is broken by the sounds of gunfire and a battle rages. Next we meet Paden (Kevin Kline) a man left stranded in the desert by his friends. Paden and Emmitt head out to find Emmitt's younger brother Jake (Kevin Costner). Jakes being held in prison for murder. The trio ends up staging a jailbreak and head off toward Silverado. Along the journey, they Mal( Danny Glover) a man headed home to help his Paw. The group of four men end up taking up a common cause and ending the reign of tyranny in Silverado. As far as westerns go Silverado has a lot of heart and Kevin Costner's character Jake made a large impact on me growing u. Jakes the ultimate wild card and the reason I give Silverado an 8/10",Silverado
161,shipofthesun,"If you didn't watch close, you haven't seen the best western ever",10,18 February 2005,"I saw this movie in it's original release and thought ""good flick, but hard to follow"". Now I've seen what apparently is the new and improved cut and it contains many more scenes and fleshes the story out into a real western. The story line is actually coherent, the bad guys aren't cartoonish, the good guys aren't lippy, the humor is understated, subtle and hilarious, and the running dog joke goes right up to the end. With apologies to Gary Cooper etc., Scott Glenn as Emit is the Ur cowboy of all times, while Costner, Glover, and the hated Kevin Kline all turn in what may be the performances of their lives. The rest of the cast, especially Brian Denehey, turn in fine roles. Plenty of great lines, the cinematography is breathtaking, along with the stark backdrop of the southwest U.S. in winter. Which is not to say it gets a whole lot less stark in summer. bottom line. Top Western, Top Twenty all time. I'm out.howard",Silverado
162,rblais-790-117183,Bad,1,13 September 2013,"This has to be THE worst movie I have ever suffered through during my 57 years of breathing oxygen on this planet. It is not worthy of any more words from me. This is the first and last review I will ever write for IMDb being that they actually see this movie fit for review. OK, so the actors may have had fun making this movie, but I did not have fun watching it. I apologize to all movie lovers for giving this movie a rating of "" 1 "" . It does not deserve it, but I am as corruptible as the next guy, and will give it a 1 only because I have stooped so low to actually review this criminal production. I want to apologize to my family and friends for not only watching this rubbish, but actually commenting on it. If there is a hell in our universe, then I hope to go there and suffer for the crime of giving this movie any acknowledgment at all. My I suffer in eternity - it can't be as bad as the suffering I've been through watching Kevin Coaster make a total fool of himself in the worst movie ever made. Thank you for reading, and I apologize to you if you did.",Silverado
163,SgtHeaton,This is an excellent parody,10,5 April 2005,"As a parody this movie has it all. Taciturn cowboy. (Danny Glover, ""That ain't right."") Corrupt Sheriff. (Dennehy) Crooked gambler. (Goldblum) Fallen woman with a heart of gold. (Hunt). Saving the ranch. Range bullies. Dishonest wagon master. Super gunfighter. (Costner shooting two guns in two directions at once). Jail break. A Posse. (Led by Cleese) Duel in the street at the end. Hostages. Unbelievable rifle shots by Glover. The only thing missing is the fancy Double Buscadero rig and the Roy Rogers Costume. (Oh yeah. Jake does that on a Pinto horse while doing gymnastics backwards. Never mind.) This movie isn't a Western, it's THE western. There isn't a major cliché left out of it and every cliché in it is well done. To me it appears to be loosely based on John Wayne's 'Tall in the Saddle': (TITS) as we GRITS collectors call it (GRITS being Ghost Riders in the Sky). The title 'Siverado' is a play on the Edgar Allen Poe Poem entitled 'El Dorado' and is as good a tongue in cheek parody of Hollywood film making as we are likely to see any time soon.",Silverado

165,timhildy,Very Underrated Film,9,17 April 2020,"If there's a trinity of great western films in the modern era, they are: Unforgiven, Tombstone, and Silverado. Three very different films, but each fantastic in their own way. Unforgiven is the artist's western...mature, superbly crafted, dark and reflective. Tombstone is the embellished historical action/drama, based on true events. And Silverado is a wildly fun fictional homage to the great westerns of old.The acting in Silverado sets it apart from other attempts at remaking the old western. Kline, Glenn, Glover and Costner play 4 very different men, and the commitment to character makes them each believable, despite their near- superhuman abilities with a gun. The score is resounding and Oscar-nominated. The cinematography is breathtaking. The production design is fantastic and the costuming, etc., has withstood the test of time and aged wonderfully. Still feels authentic 35 years later. The action is relentless and deftly handled.The plot is a little more complex than is perhaps necessary...but it IS a Kasdan movie after all. This movie is still fun all these years later. It holds up. It's really a shame they never made a sequel...very shortsighted by the studios.",Silverado
