0,Leofwine_draca,Awful. Just awful.,2,26 October 2015,"SPRING BREAKERS is a wannabe exploitation flick that warns of the dangers of drugs and free sex, but turns out to be an extremely trashy and poorly-made movie in the process. It ostensibly features a quartet of young and nubile spring breakers (who spend the entire movie wearing their bikinis for no other reason than to titillate the viewer) who decide to go on an odyssey of crime, drugs, and violence, just for kicks.The problems with such a scenario are manifest, namely the entire lack of any sympathetic or likable characters. The girls and the girls alone are responsible for getting themselves into this mess and you don't really care how or if they manage to extricate themselves from it. The acting is poor, particularly from James Franco's black gangster caricature (not a patch on Gary Oldman's similar character in TRUE ROMANCE) and the film as a whole is preoccupied with sex, nudity, and bad taste situations, instead of delivering anything approaching a real plot. It's a dog of a film, there are no two ways about it.",Spring Breakers
1,SnoopyStyle,Candy coated emptiness,5,31 July 2013,"Harmony Korine is a great artist. One of my favorite films is Kids. Its most appealing aspect is its ultra-realism. Its docudrama feel was enhanced by its unknown cast. That's certainly not the case here in Spring Breakers. This movie stars 2 Disney princesses Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez plus Ashley Benson and Harmony's other half Rachel Korine. Obviously this is all about a couple of Disney princesses trying to show that they're all grown up. James Franco does an admirable job as an outlandish rapper. But at no time does any reality seep into this movie. Harmony made this candy color coated confection and it's just as emotionally satisfying as a tub of ice cream. It's a whole lot of empty calories, and you'll sugar crash right after.",Spring Breakers
2,Horst_In_Translation,A symphony in pink and yellow,6,12 February 2016,"""Spring Breakers"" is an American movie from 2012 written and directed by Harmony Korine and this was one of the most controversial films of the year back then. You could basically only love it or hate it, even if for me it is something in-between. One of the best aspects of the film is certainly the visual side. The cinematography is very well done and the use of colors, settings and backgrounds feels like a delirious dream from start to finish. The music helps the matter as well. And same goes for all the voice-over comments by the protagonists in this film. It's not a problem at all that you rarely know which of the girls just made the last comment.Speaking about the girls, I must say that only one of them was a stand-out in terms of their performance. And that would be Vanessa Hudgens. Of course, it was surprising to see her with blonde hair, but that was just one aspect that fit really nicely here. She captured the spirit and tone of the film very appropriately with her portrayal of a girl that gets sucked deeper and deeper into the abyss of crime, complete freedom and unconditioned affection in terms of love and life. Ashley Benson is known to many from her portrayal of Hanna on ""Pretty Little Liars"" and I must say she is a pretty mediocre actress that has yet to show a performance that convinces me. Selena Gomez has, in theory, the best material to work with, even if she has not as much screen time as the other chicks, but the only thing that really stands out about her in this film is that she is the only non-blonde in there. Rachel Korine is entirely forgettable and also seems too old for the part. Her husband should really have cast somebody else for that part. So yeah, all in all, only one of the girls managed to convince me here.And then there is James Franco of course, the Oscar-nominated actor (""127 Hours""), who is the real standout here. He scored tons of awards attention and I would say most of it was deserved, even if he came short in terms of nominations at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs and Oscars. He certainly is not a great singer, but his humming here works so well with his character because he is truly unique in his own right. And he does not even need to be a good guy for it. He is as much of a villain as the bad guys in the end, but yet somewhat likable, even if he shows sociopathic tendencies occasionally. And he is the one leading the girls into real crimes, so he may be even the biggest antagonist in the film, even if they perceive him as their Messiah.Finally, this movie had a couple really memorable sequences. Most of these are closely connected to the use of the colors pink and yellow that I mentioned in the title already. And be it only the colors of the ice the girls were eating. However, the most memorable sequence is the mix-up of a Britney Spears song combined with us seeing the gang robbing more stores. Violence and harmony (no pun intended!) collide. It's not a realistic film or one that has a particularly convincing plot, but it does not need to do so as the filmmaker's objective was clearly something other than that. And Korine made it work nicely. I recommend watching ""Spring Breakers"". Check it out if you don't mind all the nudity, drug abuse sequences and violence of course. I don't and that's why I enjoyed it as a whole, even if most of the performances were underwhelming. Thumbs up.",Spring Breakers
3,Prismark10,Skin deep,5,15 April 2017,"Spring Breakers starts off its title sequence with scenes of a typically American rowdy party picture with women baring tits n ass. In fact you see many young ladies in bikini and several bearing all throughout the picture.Underneath this shallow opening is a quirky, moody coming of age fantasy as the film follows four college girls Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) Faith (Selena Gomez) Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) on their first spring break in Florida after robbing a restaurant to fund their trip.Once they arrive in Florida the girls partake on a hedonistic time of partying, booze, drugs and sex. However when they are arrested they come to the attention of wild guy gangster Alien (James Franco.) Alien is an unlikeable sleazeball and Faith wants to go back home. The others remain even being turned on by being his neon clad gangster babes as he duels with rival gangs.Director Harmony Korine said he was inspired by the film version of Miami Vice and he does present many moodily, neon lit scenes accompanied with a gangster soundtrack and Britney Spears.The film does lull in the middle, the main female characters seem to be lightly sketched in, even deluded. Only Franco makes an impression as the devilish Alien.",Spring Breakers
4,nogodnomasters,EVERY TEMPTATION HAS A WAY OUT,4,4 June 2019,"This is a poorly developed film. Four College girls didn't want to be stuck at college during spring break so they stuck up the Chicken Shack for csah, except for Faith (Selena Gomez) who like her name, has faith. She supplies some ridiculous first person narration and is the only character they bothered to develop and PLOT SPOILER, she exits early on a bus leaving us with a bunch of people we don't know much about, behaving badly because they can.While on spring break, the girls get into trouble, imagine that, and they get bailed out by a scuzz-ball who looks like James Franco.The film is interlaced with amateur style party video which consists of drinking, drugs, and boobs. I suggest if you want to watch girls on Spring Break, get those films instead, they have about as much plot sense as this one. The theme of the film ""Every Temptation has a way out"" was poorly developed also.Perv Guide: F-bombs, sex, and nudity.",Spring Breakers
5,kosmasp,Breaking Bad,8,17 August 2013,"With a title like ""Spring Breakers"" you might be forgiven expecting something different. Though the movie does deliver on that premise too (at least for some parts of the movie, so there is nudity and alcohol and other things). But it goes beyond that. We are following 4 girlfriends who are on a journey of self exploration. Something that might and could also be said about some of the lead actresses who are not really known for more than being Teenagers (or were known that is).Selena Gomez seems not to be able to cross that line though and while she seems to be a really sweet and good person to talk (having only seen interviews with her), she still has to mature as an actress. Vanessa Hodgens seems to be stealing the show, coupled with a great performance by another actress that I almost mistakenly identified as Amy Smart. But the girls almost get out-shined by James Franco! At one point during the movie it seems like he's taking reigns of the movie ... but worry not, it gets back on its track and if you let yourself, you'll enjoy the ride too",Spring Breakers
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"Trashy, tacky, unbelievable, but fun.",6,29 July 2019,"Spring Breakers is one of those films, you keep wanting to switch off, but have to get to end, it's not exactly a good film, but the story is such that you have to know what comes next.It's so outrageously over the top, that it pretty much belongs in the fantasy genre, however there are a few concepts which are sadly all too realistic.James Franco is good, but is like a parrot with gold teeth, he repeats many lines over and over. Selina Gomez does a fair job.Nonsense, but watchable, the ending is at least bold. 6/10",Spring Breakers
7,jboothmillard,Spring Breakers,7,21 September 2013,"I saw the poster for this film while it was on at cinemas, I assumed it was either a cheesy teen holiday film, or something that would be full of sex and drinking, the second was almost correct, but thankfully that's not the only reason to see it. Basically since grade school Faith (Selena Gomez), Candy (Vanessa Anne Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) have been the best of friends, they live the boring college life in the dorms and seek adventure, so they have been saving their money for the holiday of a lifetime. Spring break has arrived, the girls have packed their belongings, and they are heading for the tropical paradise of St. Petersburg, Florida, where parties, drinking, stripping and lots of reckless behaviour await them, many of which they partake in themselves and have a lot of fun doing so. After one particular night of partying all four girls are arrested, along with some other party goers, they are likely to have to face two day in a jail cell, but they are suddenly bailed out by local rapper and gangster Alien (James Franco), he was told about them by two twins who met them, he is keen to get to know them and tells all about himself, i.e. his wealth and his business. While Candy, Brit and Cotty enjoy the lifestyle Alien is letting them into, Faith is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the situation, and even when he tries to convince her to stay and her trying to convince the others to come with her, which they refuse, she leaves to go home alone. Back at his mansion Alien calls Brit and Candy his ""soulmates"", and he opens up much more about how illegal activities have made him so rich, and one night he takes them to a strip club, owned by his local rival and former friend Archie 'Big Arch' (Gucci Mane), he warns him that he should stop selling drugs and just rob ""spring breakers"". Alien ignores this warning, gives the girls pink ski masks and shotguns, and together they carry out a number of armed robberies on ""spring breakers"", there is a point when Big Arch and one of his gang members approaches them while in the car, but Alien shoots the gang member in a drive-by shooting. When this happened Cotty was shot in the arm, and feeling traumatised, and even with Alien telling her that they will get payback she wants to leave, so while she returns home Candy and Brit start a sexual relationship with him, and they get revenge on Big Arch. It flashes forward to see the girls calling home and promising to better themselves, and they throw their masks into the ocean, and next we see the three of them speed in a boat towards Big Arch's mansion, while Alien is killed by a guard Brit and Candy go on, killing all gang members before Big Arch himself. While all the dead bodies are seen, including Alien, Candy describes the experiences she and Brit have has as beautiful, they feel like they have found themselves, they drive away in the dead gangster's Lamborghini, and the final moments sees the girls kiss the dead body of Alien. Also starring Heather Morris as Bess, Ashley 'Ash' Lendzion as Forest and Emma Jane Holzer as Heather. Franco is terrific as the drug dealing music producer who takes the girls deeper and deeper into the world of crime that it consumes them, Gomez and Hudgens prove themselves as good actresses getting away from their former teen idol images, and the other two girls are good as well. Most films about spring break you get teenagers trying to lose their virginity or just messing about causing havoc, obviously this film does seem some sexual imagery and heavy drinking, but this is matched with a good and gritty plot about the drug and crime worlds and how people sink into it, and it has some good choice of music, the best sequence being the armed robberies while ""Everytime"" by Britney Spears plays, overall it is a fun and interesting drama. Very good!",Spring Breakers
8,BA_Harrison,"It's certainly unique, y'all.",6,28 April 2015,"I'm going to find it hard to rate Spring Breakers: on one hand, it is painfully hip in its approach, its erratic narrative and dreamlike, neon-coloured cinematography occasionally effective, but also extremely irritating at times, and yet I find I find it almost impossible not to have fun with any film that revolves around four attractive young women in skimpy bikinis who like to party hard and flout the law.The four girls in question are Faith (Selena Gomez), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson), and Cotty (Rachel Korine), who head to the beach for spring break, their trip funded by a spot of armed robbery. Arrested by the police at a wild, drug-fuelled party, the girls are bailed out by white gangster Alien (James Franco, looking like Drexl Spivey's younger brother), who takes them under his wing and promises to show them a good time.Faith, the only one of the group with any sense, feels uneasy and heads for home, but the other three remain, joining Alien for some gangster action, robbing other spring breakers. Naturally, this all ends badly, with Cotty shot in the arm by rival gangster Big Arch (Gucci Mane) and Alien left for dead after he and the remaining two girls launch a retaliatory attack on Arch's crib.Gaudy, daring, a tad pretentious, and just a little bit controversial (exploitative titillation or female empowerment flick? You decide), this is one of those films that I imagine most people will either love or hate.Some people, like me, will both love AND hate it.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",Spring Breakers
9,edwagreen,*,2,22 December 2015,"Thinking of the spring break from college shall never be the same after this terrible film.Bored with college and with life in general, 4 girls get more than they bargained for when they rob a store to finance their trip to greener pastures. There are constant flashbacks showing the girls having a great time dancing, swinging, drug taking and running wild. Arrested for taking drugs, they are bailed out by a gangster who naturally expects certain things from them.The movie further deteriorates into one of violence, shooting, killing and all sorts of mayhem.The two remaining girls walk away in the end after a blistering shootout with a rival gang who had wounded another of the girls.One of the girls was smart enough to go home when she saw trouble coming. You'd be wise to do the same thing before you see this pathetic, sickening film.",Spring Breakers
10,zardoz-13,"""Taxi Driver"" Meets ""Kids""",10,7 April 2013,"""Gummo"" writer & director Harmony Korine has clearly surpassed himself with the narrative-driven ""Spring Breakers."" This contemporary crime melodrama set in St. Petersburg, Florida, follows four girls on an odyssey of initiation and truth. These aren't ordinary girls, and Korine differentiates them so each possesses more than a modicum of character. James Franco stars as a pot-smoking, second-rapper, drug dealer, ""Scarface"" wannabe in a performance that is both memorable and invigorating. Imagine the Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" crossed with ""Kids,"" and you've got a good idea what ensues. Four desperate college girls, Faith (Selena Gomez), Brit (Ashley Benson), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), and Cotty (Rachel Korine) want to get out of their small town and experience life beyond their parents. Two of them rob a chicken restaurant with water pistols and another acts as the wheel man. Faith joins them reluctantly. She accompanies them to Florida until they are arrested by the police for using illegal drugs. When the four cannot pay their fines, they get lucky and an unlikely benefactor appears. The guardian angel turns out to be Alien (James Franco) and he takes them into his world of illegal drugs and guns. The girls and he get along together, but he doesn't force them to do anything they don't want. Eventually, the religious trained Faith insists that she be allowed to leave and Alien buys her a ticket. Meantime, Alien explains to his new found friends that he has a problem with former best friend and mentor, Archie (Gucci Mane of ""Confessions of a Thug), and wants to kill him. The finale with the two-woman raid on Big Archie's compound is reminiscent of ""Scarface."" Nobody gives a bad performance, but Franco walks off with top acting honors in a role that rivals his ""Pineapple Express"" performance. The editing is exceptional, too, especially in the last scene when one of the girls is describing all the nice people she has met while she guns down complete strangers. Korine creates a palpable sense of authenticity.",Spring Breakers
11,neil-476,"Sleazy, empty, unedifying and boring",6,12 April 2013,"A group of college girls rob a small eatery to get the money to go on spring break. Having been arrested, drug dealer/DJ Alien bails them out and involves them in his dubious activities.There was a British author called Enid Blyton who wrote children's' books in the 1940s and 50s. This wholesome fare included tales of school friends who went on adventures - Five Go Camping, Five Hunt Treasure, Five Go Sailing etc. In a similar vein, Spring Breakers might be called Four Go Drinking, Four Go Swearing, Four Smoke Dope And Sniff Coke, Four Go Talking Dirty, Four Shoot Gangstas With Uzis etc.This film has a notoriety (which, perhaps, it has aimed for) as being the movie in which the two Disney princesses Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens behave badly. Well, yes and no - Gomez bows out early without overindulging in naughtiness, but Hudgens appears to revel in swanning around in a bikini (until it comes off for the 3 in a pool rumpy pumpy session), smoking a great deal, saying ""f***"" a great deal, talking dirty generally a great deal - pretty much the same as the other two girls, really. The trouble is - well, there's a lot of trouble of this variety, so here goes.The trouble is that it is not actually adult performance as such: it may be full of rude words, cocaine and nipples, but it all comes over as terribly adolescent. Maybe that is part of the target, as well as the notoriety. As a parent might say, ""it's not big and it's not clever"", but let's put that to one side too, because it is far from the main criticism. The film is hardly believable either, particularly the final sequence, but that also is not the main criticism. Neither is James Franco's ridiculous performance of an idiotic character who is genetically programmed to insert ""Y'all"" into every sentence that leaves his metal-framed mouth.No, the big, big flaw in this movie is that it is deadly boring. Strip away the ludicrous repetition in the dialogue (""look at all my f***ing sh*t"" for instance), the endless slow motion shots of extras jiggling their breasts, scenes that go on way after the point is made (Alien's piano recital to name but one), and this 93-minute movie would be hard pushed to last half an hour. There is little point in showing us all this bad behaviour if you bore us while doing so and, for all that there is a certain inherent appeal to young women in bikinis (or less) talking naughty talk, I looked frequently (very frequently!) at my watch.Unedifying and morally bankrupt I can live with, but please at least interest me.I would recommend this for a deaf person who is in the process of recovering his sight. If you don't have to listen to it, and don't have to watch the detail, the bright neon colours will at least provide some kind of optical stimulation.Oh, and please save me from Emperor's New Clothes-watchers who say things like, ""For those who are prepared to see beneath...."" - this is shallow trash with some visual flair, and it is disingenuous to make out that it is anything deeper.",Spring Breakers
12,anaconda-40658,Spring is Broken.,8,15 September 2015,"Spring Breakers (2012): Dir: Harmony Korine / Cast: James Franco, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, Vanessa Hudgens, Rachel Korine: Extremely disturbing film about the illusion of spring break through the eyes of those seeking sin. Four college girls rob a diner so to afford to go to a spring break beach party. This leads to being arrested at a party where substance abuse is a factor. When they cannot make bail a white rapper named Alien bails them out with ulterior motives in mind. Director Harmony Korine does an effective job at portraying the state of drug craze as well as constant shots of beach party drinking and nudity to the extremes. This film is not for everyone and it contains something to offend most everyone but it is stunningly shot and visualized. One major problem is that the ending defeats the message. It presents an opening Biblical montage with regards to one of the girls that works when two of them realize that they are in over their heads but the ending is corrupt with regards to its presentation of violence and a payoff. James Franco delivers a flawless performance as rapper Alien who owns guns, loads of cash, and a mouth full of gold capped teeth. He is bad news but has persuasive charm. Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Rachel Korine are terrific as girls who all react differently to the dangerous lifestyle of Alien. Two of theme will realize that the storm will engulf the calm, while the other two run towards the storm free of care or consequence. Graphically disturbing but achieves the illusion that was long written in the garden of Eden when the forbidden seemed promising. Score: 8 / 10",Spring Breakers
13,Wuchakk,"If Terrence Malick based a movie around ""Girls Gone Wild""",6,18 April 2017,"Released in 2012 and written & directed by Harmony Korine, ""Spring Breakers"" chronicles events when four freshmen girls (Ashley Benson, Vanessa Hudgens, Rachel Korine & Selena Gomez) dubiously acquire funds and go to Spring Break in Florida where they party hardy and eventually land in jail. The situation takes a potentially hazardous turn when a stranger, a gangsta rapper named Alien (James Franco), bails 'em out. Gucci Mane is on hand as Alien's rival. This is a combination art film and serious crime/drama, but it also satirizes Spring Break libertinism and ventures into fantasy in the final act. The overall filmmaking is top-of-the-line, including the surprisingly excellent acting of the four anti-heroines. Franco is unrecognizable (to me) as the rapper, obviously modeled after Dangeruss and RiFF RAFF (the latter suing Korine because of it). The movie's entertaining as a mesmerizing look at Spring Break hedonism and all that goes with it. Rachel, the director's wife, is particularly fetching. The debauchery is interestingly balanced out by some spiritual references, particularly one of the girl's Christian fellowship. However, the second half switches gears once Alien is introduced. I liked the message concerning the anchor of faith, hope & love making a person sensitive to impending peril, granting the wisdom to abscond.What lowers my rating are some eye-rolling vulgarities (e.g. the gun fellatio scene) and, especially, that I couldn't buy the two main girls as intimidating lethal hoodlums, whether at the beginning with squirt guns or later. The ending in particular was thoroughly unconvincing, IF we're to take it as reality. The picture runs 94 minutes and was shot in St. Petersburg/Tampa/Sarasota, Florida. Be forewarned: This is a hard 'R' movie with loads of profanities, vulgarities and nudity but, like I said, surprisingly balanced out by pious elements. GRADE: B-",Spring Breakers
14,zetes,Entertaining exploitation flick,7,18 August 2013,"I've avoided all of Harmony Korine's output up until now. I'm a cult film aficionado, but his reputation is offputting. It was weird to see one of his films as a mainstream hit earlier this year, and it seems like some people legitimately liked Spring Breakers. It's exploitation, plain and simple. Dumb as Hell, basically just a modern day version of Reefer Madness. But if you look at it through the exploitation lens, it is a bit amusing. Four basically interchangeable girls in neon bikinis rob a restaurant to afford their spring break trip to Florida. There they get in even more trouble, especially when they meet up with rapper/criminal James Franco. Franco's the most amusing thing about it, chewing that scenery like crazy with his shiny grill. The music (by Cliff Martinez and Skrillex, along with plenty of rappers on the soundtrack) is awesome, I loved the neon look (though it's not as cool as the similar look of Only God Forgives), and the weird editing patterns are pretty cool. The girls are the weak spot. I didn't really look at their faces too often. The ""nice"" one of the four leads is played by teen pop star Selena Gomez. I know the name Vanessa Hudgens, but I doubt I could pick her out of a crowd (I remember several years ago, during a trivia tournament, I mistook Selena Gomez for Hudgens). For whatever it's worth, the film is at least more amusing than Sofia Coppola's turgid The Bling Ring.",Spring Breakers
15,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Spring Breakers,4,15 May 2013,"Babes gone bad. A simple enough premise, set around teenyboppers who just cannot wait to break their goody-two-shoes mould, and take on something grittier on film. Written and directed by Harmony Korine, Spring Breakers is that film you may feel nauseous when sitting through, no thanks to its psychedelic colours, repetitive voiceovers, in your face camera angles, and non linear chronological presentation that seemed high on moving backward and forward to rock your cognitive balance deliberately, providing that first hand experience on the perpetual state of high the characters all seem hooked on in their search for hedonism and narcotic nirvana.It's like a guys wet dream fantasy come alive when dealing with characters who are uninhibited in wanting to try crazy stuff, and the story follows four college girls - Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson), Cotty (Rachel Korine, wife of the writer-director) and Faith (Selena Gomez), the latter playing that religious girl enticed into the life of hard partying by friends who resorted to robbing a restaurant to fuel their spring break vacation. Then it's scene after scene of merry making, sometimes with the aid of drugs, that we see the drowning of values within Faith as she falls deeper into the rabbit hole of trouble.Faith may be the character differentiated enough from the rest of her friends, but it's a little bit limited to what she can do, given the subject of peer pressure. The others were bland one-dimensional characters who bond deeper because of their clique that had survived an almost impossible pulling off of a robbery, catching the eye of Alien (James Franco), who decided to help the girls out of jail, posting their bail and taking them under his crooked wing.James Franco stood out for being the thorn amongst the warped roses, and credit to the makeup and wardrobe team for completely knocking off his good looks, and replacing it with a gangsta inspired wardrobe with metallic braces, sun shades and plenty of tattoos. But the outfit doesn't make the character, and Franco owns it as Alien, a rapper cum drug dealer/distributor, complete with small army and a fortune to go on the recruitment hunt that would put the fun-seeking girls in his predatory path.It's ultimately light in treatment, trying its best to ramp up the final act with the introduction of a gang rival, and the extent of rot the girls descended into, courtesy of the seduction from the dark side. There's little pleasure obtained from watching the movie, like a desperate exercise by the cast to show off how nasty they can actually be for film, playing to the fantasy of the filmmaker.",Spring Breakers
16,christopher-underwood,Extraordinary achievement.,8,8 November 2016,"Wow, did this film turn out to be a surprise! Having seen the trailer and having heard teens enthuse, upon finding it, I thought, misplaced on my DVD shelf, I decided it might brighten up a dark cold evening. The opening scenes of raves and beaches, lots of sun, lots of skin and lots of screaming met my expectations and I settled down to see if I really could endure an hour and a half teen movie. That this film had been slipped onto my shelf next to Larry Clarke movies was as it turned out not inappropriate. As well as having written Clarke's 'Kids' the director shares the ability to get inside youngsters' contemporary hopes dreams and nightmares, convincingly. I thought I was taking a break from my usual diet of horror movies but this is as horrific as many a film I have seen for a while. This is that cliché the American dream writ large, stamped on and then inverted. Brilliant camera-work helps to make this so watchable, Harmony Korine though must take full credit for articulate if disturbing script and audacious direction. Much of the time having more the feel of a Japanese movie, events are anticipated and then repeated, as is the dialogue making it more pertinent each time it is uttered with increasingly provocative imagery. Extraordinary achievement.",Spring Breakers
17,StevePulaski,"A sad, sad portrait of societal degradation",9,23 March 2013,"Not since Ron Fricke's Samsara have I experienced such an enormous sensory and auditory overload. Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers annihilates both senses with absolute impunity, truly making this one of the most engrossing and consuming pictures so far this year. It possesses a style and a message that is so bluntly honest and terrifically captured that it deeply pains me that the audience that needs to see this the most likely will not, due to its eclectic nature and limited release.Let me begin by saying that this is not the film you think it is. The trailers and commercial spots have done a solid job at attempting to communicate this, but I feel some will still be expecting something a bit too familiar. To go into Spring Breakers expecting something along the lines of a raunchy comedy will be nothing but a cruel and colorful letdown. This is a smart, vibrant, hypnotic fever-dream of a film, heavily accentuating a mix between mainstream raucousness and subversive indie-style. It's something unlike anything I've seen in years.The plot follows Faith (Selena Gomez), Brit (Ashley Benson), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) and Cotty (Rachel Korine, writer/director Harmony Korine's wife), lifelong besties who decide to ditch their monotonous lives to hunger for something bigger and badder over spring break. They head to the sun-soaked ""paradise"" that, allegedly, is Florida, where the girls, already low on cash, first commit a robbery on a fast-food restaurant in order to fund their trip. After that, it's all the dancing, partying, drug-using, drinking, screwing, and gyrating they can stomach.The girls are then arrested for being a part of a large band of twentysomethings, who entirely demolished a hotel-room. They don't spend too much time in prison since local, second-rate rapper who calls himself ""Alien"" (played by James Franco in an astonishingly direct fashion) decides to bail them out. In return, he takes the four girls (and then three, when one boldly makes the decision to leave when things are beginning to go awry) under his wing, showing him his wealthy lifestyle and exposing them to the violent drug-culture.This story doesn't move nearly as fast as you'd like to think, either. It's punctuated frequently by loud, bombastic musical numbers (often scored by popular techno-artist Skrillex), repetitive montages that heavily emphasize nudity and senseless debauchery, long shots of dreamlike sequences, among other things. It is one of the most accurate replications of this MTV-driven culture I've seen in years. I will go ahead and say there's not another movie you should see this year as much as this one.Writer/director Harmony Korine has erected his career off of making shocking, often nihilistic pictures with some sort of emphasis on the degradation of teen culture. His debut film Gummo remains as shocking and as raw as it did when it was made in 1997. However, his best work is still Kids (which he wrote, and his close friend Larry Clark brilliantly directed), which centered on an HIV-positive teenager who made a habit out of deflowering young girls in New York City. The film was hard to watch, heart-wrenching to fathom, and so jaw-droppingly pure and authentic in its dialog that it would be difficult for me to experience again.Korine's statement in Spring Breakers is one that is difficult to directly pinpoint, but I think I may have something. What I can extract is that Korine is trying to show how inconsequential the actions of adolescences have become within the last few years. It seems with every decision, we move further and further from thinking of others and how they may be affected by our choices and attempt to achieve self-gratification and satisfy our impulsiveness. This is a lethal, depressing, but an apparently upcoming standard in teen behavior. Take for example the robbery that happens early in the film. The girls do not seem to carefully plan the event, hence the very impromptu execution we see, and frighteningly, show no remorse when the incident is over. Only one girl, who ups the courage to leave the group, becomes tired of it all and heads home. The other three girls seem to be unleashing something more than just a ""YOLO"" attitude when hanging out with Alien; something far deeper and more psychologically troubling.Moreover, the neon-cinematography featured here can just be described as hypnotic and nothing else. It's plagued with every color of the rainbow, often resulting in a dizzying, unrelenting trance that gives this film the vibe and uncompromising energy it needs. I can only seem to equate the effect the cinematography has on the viewer to watching the color bars on a TV (usually when a network signs off) and having someone shake the TV in every possible direction. This leads to the overwhelming sensory annihilation I spoke of earlier.Spring Breakers does everything boldly, beautifully, and shockingly unsettling, as it even goes as far as to brilliantly subject former Disney-branded starlets Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens to the drug-fueled, sex-crazed drudgery of this film. If this doesn't sound like your kind of film, 21 and Over should still be playing in the same multiplex, not too far down from the theater Spring Breakers is in. Perhaps that is more your speed, and that's perfectly fine. Just be aware that that a growing culture and, quite possibly, the one you enjoy, is being satirizes and accurately depicted in a theater near you. Happy viewing.NOTE: My video review of Spring Breakers, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7qUTpYRQ6oStarring: James Franco, Selena Gomez, Rachel Korine, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Gucci Mane.

18,KineticSeoul,It's seems like a dream,3,8 July 2013,"This is suppose to be a cult movie or whatever but it's a bland superficial movie with no substance or entertainment. James Franco in a interview claimed superficial is not a bad thing because the whole society is like that. Which didn't make much sense and this movie shows otherwise kind of. Because the ending is just plain awful. When it comes to the vibe of this movie, it reminded me of the movie ""Savages"" except this one is crap. Maybe it's getting recognition because of the crazy electronic style with people partying like crazy. But besides that I don't really know why this movie has been getting positive responses. Besides James Franco's performance as this hustler that is a mix between lil jon/t.i. and a redneck. As a matter of fact he looked like the character from ""Malibu's Most Wanted"". The only thing that stands out about this movie, is how it goes in a unexpected direction sometimes but it isn't cleverly crafted or anything like that. I don't know if this movie is trying to show the epitome of the ugly side of superficial dumb and crazy people. But it leaves nothing after it's finished. There isn't anything controversial or even felt like it left a message. It's not thought provoking or leaves an impact by the end of this movie. It just seemed like a trashy art house movie that fails in just about every direction. It shows the craziness of spring break parties but you can see it anywhere online.3.3/10",Spring Breakers
19,Hellmant,It definitely leaves an impression and is artistically unique and visceral.,8,27 March 2013,"'SPRING BREAKERS': Four Stars (Out of Five)Another 'kids behaving badly' youth gone wild flick from writer/director Harmony Korine. Korine also co-wrote the 1995 indie hit 'KIDS' as well as wrote and directed 1997's equally dark and disturbing 'GUMMO'. This film is a 'spring break vacation' tale about a group of college girls who are so desperate to escape to Florida for some fun and excitement that they rob a restaurant in order to get the money to do so. Once there they get into even more trouble and hook up with a gangsta rapper named Alien. The film stars former 'good girl' Disney child stars Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez, giving them the chance to show their more adult and dark sides. It also features Ashley Benson (of 'PRETTY LITTLE LIARS' fame), Rachel Korine (who's worked with her husband, the director, multiple times before) and James Franco as the scene stealing rap artist Alien. The movie is extremely dark and disturbing like Korine's other films but it also appears to be extremely pointless and morally bankrupt as well (but maybe that's the point). Regardless of how you interpret the message or morality of the film it definitely leaves an impression and is artistically unique and visceral.The film begins as four college girls, who have been best friends since childhood, finish school for the term and begin their spring break. They're bored with their mundane and uneventful lives and really want to go to Florida for the vacation they've been planning but don't have enough money. Candy (Hudgens) and Brit (Benson) decide to rob a local restaurant with squirt guns and Cotty (Korine) agrees to be their getaway driver. 'Good girl' Faith (Gomez), who attends a church group regularly, doesn't know what the others are doing and is shocked to find out what they did. Nevertheless she decides to still go on vacation with them and the girls have a blast. That is until they're all arrested at a party and bailed out by a drug dealing rapper named Alien (Franco). That's when things really take a turn for the worse and Faith realizes it can only lead to more trouble. The other girls want to have more fun though and begin relations with Alien. The movie seems to be about young sociopathic girls who want nothing more than to party, do drugs and have lots of sex and fun (regardless of what it costs or who gets hurt). Selena Gomez (who probably has the cleanest image of the cast to uphold) plays the only character in the film that seems to have a conscience. The other girls don't seem to care about what's right or wrong at all and Franco's Alien character is the same. So one could easily argue that the movie does promote delinquent and immoral behavior but you could also argue that that's not the film's point. Regardless of the morality or message of the film the point is definitely not clear (if it even has one). I'd say it's completely up to viewer interpretation, one can read whatever they want into the film and anyone that says it has a clear message is full of it. Still the film is always interesting to watch and visually engaging. Korine does have a nice style to his directing and the music is perfectly fitting (Britney Spears is heavily referenced and idolized in the film as well). Franco gives a strong and memorable performance (and is as creepy as hell) but the girls (while all hot) don't show any talent whatsoever (their roles don't give them an opportunity to though). It is a crazy and messed up film but it's definitely an entertaining and unique one as well. It does offer something to those just looking for an experience and that's what film is all about.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJalgBjCCrg",Spring Breakers
20,Buddy-51,Not what you might expect,7,31 October 2013,"If you go into ""Spring Breakers"" expecting a dumbed-down, flesh-jiggling sex romp, you may be sorely disappointed. What you'll get instead is a sobering cautionary tale about four sexy coeds who get more than they bargained for when they head down to St. Petes for a week of fun-and-games in the Florida sun.The allegorically named Faith (Selena Gomez) is a good Christian girl who yearns for a chance to break free of the confines of her tedious college life and thinks spring break the way to do it. The problem is that she and her three girlfriends don't have enough money to make the trip. So they opt to steal a car and hold up a diner, then use their ill-gotten gains to get them to where they want to go. After a few days getting stoned and plastered, the girls find themselves in jail with no one to bail them out. Enter ""Alien"" (James Franco), an uber-creepy street hustler with a mouth full of silver teeth who posts the money they need on the condition they spend some time with him. What is he up to, and can a venture that started on such a violent note end on anything but? The thing ""Spring Breakers"" has most going for it is its total lack of predictability, for just as you think you know where it's headed, it turns right around and goes off in a different direction entirely. The girls remain strangely underdeveloped and undifferentiated throughout (except for Selena), but, in a way, that's perfectly in keeping with the theme of female objectification that permeates the work.Writer/director Harmony Korine has conceived the work almost as a tone-poem, with long lyrical stretches punctuated periodically by the sound of a cocking rifle. That symbol for the ever-looming threat of violence serves as the refrain for the story the movie is telling. Some of the scenes are astonishingly realistic, while others have an almost hallucinatory quality to them. This makes it so that we don't really question the plausibility of some of the plot choices Korine makes. It's all in the service of the thesis that there's a yearning ""to be bad"" lurking deep inside each and every one of us. All it needs is that one special circumstance to set it free.""Spring Breakers"" is one of those odd films that keeps hammering us with titillating visuals, while at the same time warning us against the dangers of partaking in what it's showing us.It may make you depressed about the youth of today and make you despair over the future of the nation, but, love it or hate it, as a movie, ""Spring Breakers"" is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.",Spring Breakers
21,thesar-2,Pray for Piranha,1,11 July 2013,"Never have I wished so hard for the little devil fish to show up and chop on the spring break characters, like in 2010's Piranha 3D, as I did during Spring Breakers.This movie, that's easily categorized as: zero redeemable characters, almost zero plot and zero focus, makes up a 45-minute depressing music video stretched twice as long. All the way through it, it reminded me of the 2001 Bully movie, but without the interesting characters, depth, good dialogue, plot and believable and satisfying ending.Granted, James Franco actually had a good performance here, pending he was attempting to channel a 2003 MTV gangsta character. Sadly, for the performances of the rest of the film, that was it. That was not just the stand-out acting job, it was the only one. When the movie contains mostly blonde, distastefully inhuman and interchangeable skanks, it fails by establishing who's who.The three main actresses here aren't just cardboard characters, they're completely identical. It's bad enough we don't care a lick of any of their futures – or present or where they came from, but we can't even tell each other apart. No matter; there's nothing to cling to.Unless all you want to do is look at soft-porn for a feature-length film. And if so, you've come to the right place.Spring Breakers is just that: soft-porn with a slightly higher budget and multiple gun cocking. Repeatedly. Annoyingly. Over and over, you'll either hear guns cocking or the same scene and set of dialogue recurring. As stated, this movie probably would've worked best as a 45-minute film, something MTV would've broadcast 10 years ago.The incredibly basic rundown of the movie, is four selfish, bored and terribly annoying college chicks with not enough money to fulfill their spring break appetites decide it would be a good idea to rob a place for their missing funds and in the process, cause as much damage and terror just for the thrill of it, I guess.Well, they get away with it – and get used to that, and off to party they go. A deserved, albeit way too short jail stint, matches them up with the thug and appropriately named: Alien. Together, they all make a terrible team of sadistic nobodies in search ofnothing. At least, they don't see it that way.Things get progressively worse, as did the movie and the repeated scenes and sounds – the ones that might have worked fine for effect the first time, but not the twentieth, continue to the absurd and unbelievable finale.Admittedly, I didn't have too much of a problem with this feature as it began and throughout the first act. It just felt like this was just a 49-year-old horny male's fantasy project and I wasn't too far off: the male writer/director's 40. And I've become immune to watching greedy, narcissistic and self-centered young adults on screen since (the even more miserable) Project X, but as the movie continued, my loathing escalated.Part was due to the already noted repetition. Part was because spending any more time with these disgusting, immoral and remorseless characters that I could never distinguish between – nor cared to. And part was due to missing that incredible scene at the end of 2001's Bully where sane people in the courtroom showed a glimmer of conscience with a simple glance.My friend at work stated my (then, verbal) review of Spring Breakers – a movie he liked, was too biased and only my opinion. I could only give him the same blank stare as those adults at the end of 2001's Bully.",Spring Breakers
22,paul2001sw-1,Ambitious and banal (and both by design!),5,26 October 2015,"Spring break is a uniquely American phenomenon, when young people flock to the beaches of Florida and, at least according to this film, flash their breasts, get stoned, and play with guns. Harmony Korine's movie is a strange one, combining a celebratory hedonism, a tale of people disconnected from moral society reminiscent of 'A Clockwork Orange' or 'Natural Born Killers', and in places, an elegiac mood of fractured innocence. If you wonder how these elements can co-exist, the answer is that Korine almost pulls it off through a unique but stylised presentation in which his heroines' trip down south appears more as dream than reality; but in truth, there's not really much substance holding the film together. The end result is an interesting failure, that hints at something real and disturbing between its near-pornographic surface, but can't really do much more than hint.",Spring Breakers
23,bowmanblue,"Well shot, but could have been so much better",5,13 January 2015,"I had high hopes for 'Spring Breakers' judging by the trailers and marketing, however, sadly I came away feeling a little let down.It's about a quarter of attractive young ladies who decide to join their (equally unbelievable attractive peers) on the beach during Spring break. However, they don't have the money. So they decide to steal it. This presents the first of the film's problems. It's hard to have much sympathy for central characters who, when faced with not having enough cash, just choose to rob someone at gunpoint. Then, when they get to the beach, they just party, party, party, taking drugs, drinking and 'hanging out' with the lads, never really thinking much about what they've done.Finally, the party they happen to be at gets raided by the police and they have to spend two days in the slammer. Therefore, they feel massively aggrieved at having their partying interrupted and choose to hang out with a borderline psychotic drug dealer/arms dealer/murderer/gangster. Again, we have to wonder about these girls' choice of judgement. From there, it only gets worse as they decide to continue this dodgy relationship and mix with the city's underworld.Despite, having possibly the least likable cast list since Jar Jar Bink's Chistmas family gathering, there is some good stuff in there. It's well-shot. The direction is slick and many scenes are visually stunning on the eye. Sadly, that's about it. Most of the film is 'filler.' By that I mean extended shots of semi-naked girls gyrating to tunes I don't like (yes, I am over thirty). If this film cut all this out, it would probably only be about twenty minutes long! I got it: the girls are sexy, but I'd rather see them being sexy in a STORY than just dancing like they were in a pop video.Despite having a promising story idea, i.e. girls funding their holiday by ill-gotten gains, you just have a bunch of really shallow people dancing for an hour and a half. By the end of it, you probably won't care who lives and who dies. Also, I found the ending a little unrealistic, but I won't go into that for fear of spoiling it for you. I'm sure Spring Breakers has an audience somewhere, but I just found it was like having MTV on in the background while you did other things.",Spring Breakers
24,g-bodyl,Very.......Interesting Film!,8,8 July 2014,"Spring Breakers is not a film to shy away from controversy. Based on reviews, you either love or hate this film. People call this film out because it has an excessive amount of drugs, sex, and crazy parties. This film has been called out for the lack of plot, but I view this film as a social commentary on today's teen life and basically how today's generation is acting in today's society. This film has some flashy visuals, good acting, and a rather interesting story.Harmony Korine's film is about a group of four girls whom decide to travel to Florida for spring break. But they are arrested for excessive partying, but they are bailed out by this rapper named Alien. Thanks to Alien, these girls are now exposed to the criminal underworld of Florida.I must credit the actors/actresses known for their Disney roles for one thing and that is that they want to break their image and that they do. Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, and Ashley Benson all do a respectful job. However, I think the best goes to James Franco as Alien. This is one of his better and more challenging roles.Overall, Spring Breakers is Korine's first mainstream film and perhaps that is why people don't like this film much. This film is quirky and different and perhaps it caught people off guard. This isn't your typical college film for sure. This has an incredible social commentary on today's society and is worth paying attention to. Is this film perfect? Not at all, but at least it's something new. I rate this film 8/10.",Spring Breakers
25,lesleyharris30,"Reasonably Entertaining, Nothing Spectacular,",7,6 July 2018,"Spring Breakers is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific cast. The four main actresses in this movie are all very believable in their roles and convey the struggles of their characters with a lot of realism. However, James Franco is without a doubt the highlight as Alien, he is unrecognizable with his disturbing characterisation in this part that makes it impossible for us to take our eyes off him. On the otherc hand, the film has a lot of ambitious ideas that it is always afraid to fully embark on, it tries to be different and stylistic, but also remaining tame enough to appeal to the general public.It never felt sure of what it was trying to be. As well as that, it is immensely bleak, the trailers made the movie look very fun, but its hardly ever playful or presented as what the advertisement made this look like it was going to be. Enjoyable, but forgettable. Spring Breakers has its moment, but never manages to fully deliver its potential, do not go out of your way to see it, but it's worth the watch if you happen to see it online or on television.Four students are drawn in to crime after they rob a store to fund their spring break.

26,Irishchatter,A messed up film,1,20 June 2015,"Y'know the characters said the place for spring break was gonna be a true American dream, however this movie is showing us the drugs and dangerous types out there that you don't wanna stick around with.I really feel for Selena Gomez's character, she knew what she was talking about and she got out of there just in time! I would be the same and y'know she was hanging with people who were meant to be trusted. I wouldn't consider them a trustful bunch to hang with. Man, they were involved in such extremely bad ways to have a good time. Having that kind of fun isn't the proper way to have a good time!I really didn't like Alien in the movie, he just was such a selfish person who took advantage of the girls.

Some can handle it and some can't. I have to start off by saying that this movie is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a movie called Spring Breakers. Lots of drug use, drinking and nudity. For a movie like this to have the cast it does makes the movie more intriguing to see (for me anyway) and they all do a good job in it that you forget who you are watching. The movie started off pretty exciting, the middle really drug but the ending makes you glad you stuck with it.

28,callanvass,"Despite issues with the second half, this is a fairly powerful film. I commend these young girls for putting on brave performances in such controversial subject matter.",6,10 September 2013,"(Plot) Four college girls who are fed up with the pressures of life head out for a Spring Break Vacation. They turn to drugs & crime, and they all have a stint in jail. Things soon spiral out of control when they meet a drug dealer (James Franco) who bails them out of their predicament in jail.Selena Gomez & Vanessa Hudgens are very cute for their age. They have embraced their young followers by staying out of trouble for the most part. Hudgens only blemish, according to a lot is that she smokes cigarettes (Who cares! It's an unhealthy habit, but you could do a hell of a lot worse) whilst Gomez has a squeaky clean reputation. I don't know a lot about Ashley Benson or Rachel Koirne, but the point is that this was a huge risk for the girls and they nailed it. A lot of this movie is quite unpleasant to witness and appropriately gritty in nature. I was heavily gripped throughout the first half watching these girls use drugs and party uncontrollably. It was riveting to watch, but what I say next might not be too agreeable to some people. I thought the movie started to get a bit dull in the second half, and that's when James Franco entered the picture. People seem to love his performance, but I'm not one of them. I felt his character was a bit redundant and thoroughly annoying. It became too convoluted and the film started to lose me, when it had me by the balls for most of the first half. * SPOILERS* If you don't want to be spoiled, don't read any further!I also was a bit disappointed when Selena Gomez disappeared in the second half. I was emotionally invested in her conflicted character. She was much different than the other girls. It also felt to me like they didn't wanna go all the way with it. It does have many disturbing moments, but I got the feeling that they got cold feet a little bit in the second half. Maybe Selena was hesitant to submerge herself fully into the role to the point of no return, but I ended up being cold and rather indifferent when the movie ended. I got the message. I understood what they were trying to do, but it just felt a bit contrived to me. After such a strong first half, it disappointed me a bit. What about the repercussions for a couple of the girls? They committed murder It ended abruptly in my opinion. But overall, I have to give this movie a lot of creditFinal Thoughts: It made me think for the most part, despite quite a few issues in the second half.

30,ironhorse_iv,"Spring Breakers is an awful art-house movie that has girls gone wild! Yet, it's disturbing interesting.",4,27 March 2014,"Honestly, if this is this generation coming to age's film; I have little to no hope for humanity. This movie was pretty bad. Directed and written by Harmony Korine, the film highlights the mindless U.S popular cultural event known as 'Spring Break'. Spring Break serves as a break from the social norms, where youth can relax from the stresses of life. Over the years, Spring Breaks celebrating in Florida with each generation has got more extreme and stupid. I don't have a problem with Spring Break, as it's does boost the local economy, but I do see this sort of party fascination is blindly controlling youth in the worth direction. Colleges are become less and less about teachings of proper education, and more and more about majority in being a drunken fool, lately. I hate dumb young people. The film depicts the shallowness of one such event, and the extreme examples of letting loose of society control. It's pretty sad to see four gifted smart college students allowing themselves to do dumb things that seems 'cool' because of these YOLO phenomenon. Ideas like long drinking binges, whoring themselves out, and lots of drug use. These bad behaviors are cause by two factors: A fear of not being good enough (the fear of failure) & the fear that his or her life's not going to be good enough (the fear of loss). Sadly, this movie doesn't explain it well. There is little to no amount of intellectually subtle social commentary in this movie. It's not even that thought-provoking. It gives no insight, message, or underlying theme. I found this to be the most depressing part of the film. We never truly know why this girls do the most despicable acts and behave with such depravity. If the movie had more inside of the character's home or school life, maybe we can understand what they're going through, but no. This movie doesn't know if glorifying the demoralizing activities portrayed, if it is a satire it, or its just mindless shock value. It's in no way, a comedy as the majority of the sexual, and violence content is actually presented in a dramatic or uncomfortable fashion. Very rarely is it meant to be comedic or taken lightly. I just have to say, it was painful to watch. No amount of eye candy, and nudity shots can make this movie any better. Most of the Controversial of this film comes with the fact that the four college student turn robbers are mostly ex-Disney TV teen idols. Seeing Selema Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine in this film is a bit disappointing, as they all could had pick better adult themes roles. I'm not talking about roles that degraded women to being near dumb sex objects like this movie does. They really need to follow the Emmas (Emma Stone, Emma Watson, and Emma Roberts, who majority in my opinion, start in pretty good movies). Emma Roberts was supposed to start in this film, but dropped out in early 2012, reportedly after hearing she would need to gain body fat for her role. Good for her. There is little to no character development, but glad the movie shows that at less two of girls came back to their senses, as less I think. So I guess, that counts. If there is a protagonist in this movie, it would be the development of Faith (Selema Gomez). I doubt this movie will hurt Selema Gomez's movie career. James Franco as the weapon-dealing, wannabe rapper Alien is pretty bad in my opinion. I know a lot of people like his performance, but I found it to be annoying as hell with his looping voice of Spring Break is forever. At less, it wasn't real rapper Riff Raff playing Alien. That would be worst off. I give some credit to the movie as some scenes are pretty beautiful shot. I like how it was shot like a weird dream, with its poignant use of slow motion, and its use of bright beautiful colors. It was well-shot kinda, with a few scenes that are going a bit too soft-porn. There's a beautifully crafted scene during their robbery of a restaurant that features one of the girls rolling the car around the building, catching glimpses of what they were doing inside. There is something disturbing about having seeing two maniac women kill people, and be OK watching My Little Pony: Friendship is magic. There is a pretty good scene where Alien is with the girls around a piano singing, 'Everytime' by Britney Spears. The electronic techno dubstep music by Skrillex is pretty catchy. The movie is pretty smart with its foreshadowing. It does it with sounds. The movie is broken into roughly four segments, and the transition between each is a specific event that has a distinctive sound. The sound is worked into the edits and shot changes in the scenes leading up to their events. Specifically, sounds of crashing and hammering leads up to the fast food robbery, sounds of the jail cell door leads up to the arrest, and sounds of gun fire leads up to one of the characters being shot. The bloody ending is a bit a stretch of being unrealistic with season gangsters that can't shot at a target that is wearing bright colors; while a bunch of teenagers with no marksmanship skills are able to kill people. I do feel disturb seeing a bunch of white girls killing a bunch of black people shortly after the Trayvon Martin killings in 2012 in Sunrise, FL. I doubt the producers care. About the people saying its feminist. I really doubt that, too. Killing men isn't feminist. It's more sexism than ever. Overall: I have to say, Spring Breakers isn't the worst movie ever, but it's no way, good.",Spring Breakers
31,The-Sarkologist,Memories of a Party of a Lifetime,8,8 June 2019,"I can say right from the start that this is not going to be your typical spring break movie. Yeah, they do sort of come about every so often, but nowhere near as much as they did in the 80s, where the objectification of women was tended to be considered, well, okay. Yet the thing is that this might be something that can be levelled at this film, particularly with the number of bare breasted women that we see throughout the first half.However, as I mentioned, this film isn't a typical film. Rather, it feels much, much more like a dream. The dialogue really only seems to emphasise certain things, and while it isn't clear, it feels as if it is more of a memory, of people looking back at a time of their life, where things really aren't all that clear, and that only certain things can be remembered. It is this aspect of the film that I believe pretty much sets it apart from many other films that I have seen - it is a film that goes out of its way to attempt to capture, and understand, the concept of memory.You see, the film doesn't have a progressive flow that you would expect most films to have. Yeah, there is a definite beginning, middle, and end, but much of the scenes seem to warp around and coellecsque into each other. As I said, it is memory, and while we may not know whose memory we are referring to, you could say that it is pretty much the four main characters.So, we have these four college girls who are board and they want to go to Florida for Spring Break, something that is considered an American tradition. So, three of them rob a store, and they all jump on the bus and head down. Now, this is interesting because it seems as if the scenes are actually done in a way that overemphasises what is going on. Once again, this is memory playing a role - we tend to overemphasise things in our mind, and this is why the scene in the bus is so cool - it is just way over board. In fact the whole part of the film where they are partying is just way overboard - in a way it feels as if it is over emphasised, broken with some down time.However, things sort of turn bad, when they end up in prison. Interestingly they are all in their bikinis, but once again, I believe this is a game of memory being played out here. The reason for this is that when we remember things, details aren't always that specific, and the fact that this was also a drug and alcohol fueled escapade indicates that one's memory is going to be every worse in remembering the details.Look, as I mentioned, this isn't going to be your typical Spring Break film, and in fact it probably falls more into the category of experimental. However, it works, and it works really, really well. The truth is that we can't actually be all that sure about authenticity of what we are watching, particularly considering that the narrators are certainly going to be unreliable, but it is certainly a hell of a ride.",Spring Breakers
32,Reno-Rangan,The power of two faces of feminine; Beauty and Beast,7,3 August 2013,"I tried hard but this movie won't let me dislike it.The movie was about the teenagers especially the girls who choose the life they wanted with unlawful and freedom over the boring regular one. The movie was kinda new age culture of the young teenage girls which tells they are nothing less than the any gangster and smuggling men.It was a totally different experience to watch the movie. All the four girls were good but it was shocking to see cute Disney girl Selena Gomes in this avatar (I can see why she broke up with Bieber). The movie was presented with a flashy style cinematography with good background musical score and many tracks were very nice and even some of them were hot and sexy in lyrics. But I liked the end credit song 'Lights' by Ellie Goulding.And finally how can I forget to mention James Franco as an Alien, He was fantastic especially his metal teeth. Usually he's more like a chocolate boy with his smile who did justice to his role in the movie to fulfill the masculine part of the story. I must Warn this movie is too sexy and hot to handle by the parenting audience.",Spring Breakers
33,tomgillespie2002,Tedious affair livened up by the performance of James Franco,5,2 October 2014,"Anyone unfamiliar with the unconventional work of former film-making brat Harmony Korine may mistake some early scenes of Spring Breakers - seemingly his first venture into 'mainstream' directing - for the youth and skin-worshipping work of MTV, or even a pop video. The camera pans across and lingers on an endless array of bikini-clad, big-breasted babes, toned, air-punching jocks, and all kinds of behaviour you wouldn't want to see your adolescent child participating in. But there's something vacant and lifeless in their expressions, and the film captures them with a mundaneness despite the thumping beats and gorgeous cinematography. It would seem Harmony Korine doesn't like the youth of today one bit.He voiced his distaste (or at least wrote it) with his screenplay for Larry Clark's Kids (1995), as it's various characters spread HIV throughout the youth of New York and generally waste their days smoking pot, drinking alcohol, skating in the park, and committing petty crime, all with a disturbing lack of responsibility. Spring Breakers is less realistic and less confrontational, but taps into a youth culture more people can recognise and even relate to. The film often feels like a banal Facebook status brought to life for 90 minutes. And this can often be as tedious as it sounds. Our young and gorgeous heroes spout bull-s**t teenage poetry and do hand- stands in corridors and car parks, and these scenes often repeat themselves to nauseous effect.The film follows four college girls - Faith (Selena Gomez), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson), and Cotty (Rachel Korine - Harmony's wife) - on their spring break. They're short of cash, so they rob a diner armed with water pistols and a hammer, and set off to St. Petersburg, Florida to indulge in sun, sex and alcohol. All is going well until they are busted and thrown in jail for taking cocaine while partying with some older, less-friendly types. Unable to pay their bail, the girls find themselves facing spending their spring break behind bars, and missing out on the life-changing event they have been so looking forward to. Things look up, however, when a rapper named Alien (James Franco) bails them out.He seems to be in everything these days, popping up in soap operas, TV shows and movies alike as well as finding time to dabble in poetry, short stories and directing. It would be easy to be sick of the sight of James Franco, but his appearance in Spring Breakers takes the film out of the realms of the dreary into something all the more invigorating. It may even take you a while to recognise him, with his cornrows, gold teeth, tattoo's and gangster swagger. He makes Alien, for all his cartoonish behaviour, scarily believable. He brags to the awe-struck girls, ""look at my s**t!"", while he shows them his collection of guns, tanning oil, shorts, and piles of money. Two of the girls lap it up - the other two are wise enough to bail - and are more than willing to participate in his gang activities.Sadly, Franco's best efforts aren't enough to rescue Spring Breakers from humdrum. While the film intermittently comes to life, scenes drag and linger while monotonous narration plays over the soundtrack and the camera ogles breasts and crotches. There's certainly a message here, and Korine's viewpoint is crystal clear, but perhaps it's too clever for it's own good, becoming just as dreary as the world it is satirising. It will be certainly interesting to see where Korine goes from here, and hopefully his shift into more conventional film- making doesn't mean the peculiar quirks and off- the-wall tone that made Gummo (1997) so utterly brilliant is gone forever.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Spring Breakers
34,Thanos_Alfie,Nightmare...,3,20 December 2018,"""Spring Breakers"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a group of college girls robbing a restaurant in order to fund their spring break vacation. Once they start partying, drinking and having fun they were arrested and a stranger who is a drug and arms dealer pays out their bailout. From that point, they start to feel very strange since they cannot understand what that man wants from them and what they have to do from now on.I didn't like this movie because it tried to present a sad story of four college girls who don't care about anything except themselves and their way of having either by drinking or taking drugs, but it failed since the cast wasn't so good. The plot was very simple something that wasn't bad, but it created some plot holes which weren't covered at all. I liked the interpretation of James Franco who played as Alien the drug and arms dealer and he was very good at it but it wasn't good enough to save this movie. I didn't like the interpretations of Selena Gomez who played as Faith and Ashley Benson's who played as Brit because I believe they didn't reach their potential. Regarding the direction which was made by Harmony Korine I think that it was average since the plot wasn't clear and I had that feeling that the cast didn't know exactly what to do.Finally, I have to say that ""Spring Breakers"" is an average movie that had a very clever and interesting idea with good potential but the execution of it didn't go as they planned it. I don't recommend this movie to anyone since there are better movies with more or less the same or similar story and with better execution. If you want to watch this movie just be prepared for it and don't have high expectations or hopes about it because you are going to be disappointed.",Spring Breakers
35,Floated2,Not for everyone,7,9 July 2013,"To say anything else would be a disservice to Harmony Korine's twisted exercise in exploitation and lunacy. For this is a film that opens with a five-minute montage of young 20-somethings frolicking, partying and drinking on the beach, scored to loud and powerful dubstep by Skrillex. It is the furthest thing from subtle and is near baffling perverted and raucous it quickly becomes. But it sets the tone for everything to come in this gigantic ninety-minute cesspool of excess and fantasy.The other thing to say is that Spring Breakers is never concerned with any semblance of substance. The storyline is held together by mere threads and the entire idea behind why these four girls desperately need to go to spring break is never made clear. It is the MacGuffin that drives the film and one that forces these girls into many unbelievable situations. And even looking past that, many of the events that occur (specifically after Alien comes into the picture) come off as disconnected, bewildering fantasies. There is no rhyme or reason for some of them to happen; they simply unfold almost at random. But that is the world of that Korine has created within the film, where the high gloss look rules and just about anything goes.Credit must be given to the cinematography by Benoît Debie and the editing by Douglas Crise. From the opening shots to the finale, they compose a world of hedonism and exploitation unlike any beach or spring break-related film I have ever seen. The harsh close-ups, the dream-like aura that hangs over many scenes and the dark surrealism of many others is simply brilliant to behold.James Franco's acting alone is worth watching, alone with the stunning visuals, symbolism's, and its unexpectedness. The film clearly isn't for everyone and those who dislike it, is no reason to call out others for liking it. Also it is a film which grows on you as you watch it more or look further into it.As a rewatch 06/12/19' and nearly being 6 years after the initial watch, much of the film had been forgotten from memory. It still holds up as an entertaining adventurous and wild film. Lot of nudity, bright neon colors, violence and everything within the end gels together as we get a full picture. Spring Breakers is perhaps one of the more misunderstood and more hated films of the decade, and judging by its current IMDB rating (5.3) it is most definitely underrated (and not for everyone)",Spring Breakers
36,leonblackwood,What was the Point? 2/10,2,17 August 2013,"Review: I'm still struggling to find a point to this film. Whilst watching the first 30 minutes of the film, I really wanted to switch it off because of the annoying music and the stupid on the beach slow motion footage of teenagers jumping up and down, but I wanted to see what the hell James Franco had to do with the movie. Once he gets introduced, the movie veers of into crime and the characters dark world, but the film still seemed pointless. There isn't much dialogue throughout the movie and there is loads of naked bodies, but you do want the director to get on with it. James Franco's character would have been good in a totally different movie, because he is quite funny, but they tried to make the whole thing serious once the party finally stops. I honestly got fed up with the film and I didn't find it interesting at all. Pointless!Round-Up: James Franco really does take on some weird roles! On paper, I wouldn't haven't taken on this project because it was a recipe of disaster due to its weak storyline. I'm sure that there is a lot of men that will enjoy looking at naked bodies and watching people doing drugs for an hour and a half, but I don't really find it entertaining. It does make you think if there are actually places in America like this because I'm sure that there would be loads of people around the rushing to get there when they are on there Spring Break. Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross $32millionI recommend this movie to people who like watching teenagers taking drugs and young girls running arid in there bikinis. 2/10",Spring Breakers
37,TheMovieDiorama,Spring Breakers dances through vivid neon colours sensorily with that added splash of objectification.,5,6 September 2019,"If ever there was a film that I was destined to loathe, it would be this. Women partying in skimpy bikinis, devouring alcoholic beverages, sniffing lines of white powder and James Franco gone, what I like to call, ""Full Franco"". And unsurprisingly the above criticisms are included in Korine's divisive crime caper, but for everything he executed incorrectly, he somehow combated through sensory visuals that narratively took hold of the thin story. A group of young girls attended spring break in Florida where they encounter a local drug dealer who spirals their lives into the descending world of drugs and violence.Immediately, the film commences with a montage of flesh. Half-naked teenagers are having a gay ol' time at a beach, drinking their sorrows away whilst the pounding beats of Skrillex' dubstep causes sensory overload. When the torture ended and my ears re-adjusted, Korine takes the direction through a fascinating receptive tunnel that strangely entranced me.Acquiring Debie's gorgeously vibrant cinematography and Martinez' minimalistic score, he controversially turns a seemingly buoyant party extravaganza into an artistic reflection of modern superficiality, presenting the tainted American dream in all its vulnerability. The self-destruction of today's youth proving far more visceral than your average spring break getaway. This is where Korine truly inhabits the contemporary aesthetic, with stunning tracking shots, particularly the restaurant robbery, taking hold of the narrative. The use of visual storytelling worked wonders, particularly when the female-led cast is less than impressive. Gomez singing a Spice Girls song is the extent of her ""acting"" ability.However Korine distracts us with Crise's ornate use of editing techniques. Consistently jumping forward for one second, then cutting back to a previous scene, made for a hallucinogenic experience that felt both erratic and sensational. The minimal narrative content, whilst provided an entrancing experience, acted as a broken beer bottle. Forcing me to yearn for some character backstory just to cling onto an ounce of relatable investment. Unfortunately, the chaotic lighting didn't provide much character depth, merely limiting this experience to a superficial shell rather than an intrinsic perspective.However my main annoyance was the constant objectification of females and how they were likened to ""play things"" for wealthy men. The portrayal of women was absurdly animalistic, with various scenes comprising of girl-on-girl action, crotch shots and enough buttocks meat to start a local butchers. Yet with no real purpose other than to remind us that we're watching a spring break party. Was there any need to constantly keep submerging the camera, that's floating on a pool, to focus on thighs and skimpy bikinis? It doesn't anything other that more objectification. Not even Franco choking on, not one but two, firearm suppressors was enough to invalidate the male superiority. ""Good girls gone bad""? Not exactly, let's be honest.I cannot dispute the fact that this is an interesting conversational piece, both thematically and through its execution. Quite rightly so, it's one of the most divisive films of the modern age, to which I acknowledge both juxtaposing viewpoints. I'd lean slightly closer to the positive side, yet so many aspects didn't sit right with me leaving me smack bang in the middle. Not the euphoric experience it thinks it is, but certainly won't be causing any hangovers either.",Spring Breakers

The film itself I felt was a little uneven, some real highlight moments as well as those that could have simply been edited out.The message of the film, though interesting and meritorious, gets a little lost as I think many may get distracted by girls behaving badly and boobs.James Franco looks like he is having a good time, such a good time I laughed to myself and wondered if he was living out some kind of fantasy!!Watch this one closer to get more out of it :)",Spring Breakers
39,jtindahouse,If there's beauty in this film I couldn't find it,5,2 August 2021,"'Spring Breakers' has a bizarre following. It may be the definitive ""love it or loath it"" film. It featured in the BBC's top 100 films of the 21st century list, Quentin Tarantino called it his favourite film of 2013, and yet it contains a 5.3 rating on IMDb. What did all of us mere-mortals miss? Sometimes I watch a pretentious and arty film that I don't like at all, but I can at least understand how some of life's more damaged souls can find beauty or something relatable in it. This was not the case with 'Spring Breakers'. I can not see what people could possibly see.As with most of these types of films there is no real definite plot. Things happen here and there, but there is no overall purpose to the film. How exactly filmmakers pitch a film like this I'm not sure. As far as the acting goes - I simply don't know. The film is so bizarre in nature that I can't tell if James Franco was magnificent or simply dreadful.Maybe in another life I'll have a brain that can appreciate a film like this, but not in this one. I will say it isn't quite as boring as other similar films though. There is just enough going on to keep it watchable and even mildly entertaining in the odd scene. Not one I'd recommend though. 5/10.",Spring Breakers
40,Turfseer,Girls Gone Wild meet The Manson Family in this tawdry but watchable Franco vehicle,6,22 January 2014,"'Spring Breakers' can best be summed up as a mixed bag. On the positive side, this is a film with some excellent cinematography and editing as well as a surprisingly good performance by James Franco, as a tough as nails drug dealer. The story, on the other hand, is problematic. We're introduced to four attractive female college students, who are bored to death attending school and believe that their salvation lies in going on a spring break to St. Petersburg, Florida, where all the action supposedly is. Only one of the girls, Faith (Selena Gomez), a member of a church group, appears to have any conscience at all. Some of her friends try to warn her about the other three, but probably due to peer pressure and probably because she's a bit of an airhead herself, she decides to join them on the spring break.The only problem is that the girls don't have enough money to go to Florida. So Faith's friends put on masks and using squirt guns, rob a fast food outlet and obtain the necessary cash. For almost the next half hour, nothing much happens, as there are numerous shots of the girls partying with other out of control spring breakers.The girls are finally arrested and lucky not to be hit with drug charges (as drugs were found in the house they were in). Nonetheless the judge tells them if they can't pay a fine for what appears to be disorderly conduct, they'll be jailed for two days. James Franco as 'Alien', bails the girls out and he introduces them to the scary drug scene he's part of. Franco is unrecognizable as Alien, sporting a set of silver metal braces on his teeth. Franco is quite convincing as Alien the drug dealer, with his menacing demeanor and thirst for violence. Faith is scared by Alien's lifestyle and decides to return back home.The other three girls remain with Alien and like Charlie Manson's girls, decide to join him in his life of crime. Alien's rival is another scary drug dealer, 'Big Arch', who threatens to kill him on more than one occasion. The girls commit a number of robberies with Alien and then one of them, Cotty, is shot in the arm by one of Big Arch's girlfriends, in a drive-by shooting. Now demoralized, she too decides to leave the group.The end of Spring Breakers proves to be completely ridiculous. Alien and the two remaining girls, decide to assassinate Big Arch at his island lair. Instead of trying to shoot Big Arch where he's accessible, we're asked to believe that Alien takes a speed boat out to his rival's island retreat and assisted by the girls, go up against Big Arch and an armed posse of at least six or seven bodyguards. Sure enough, Alien is gunned down as soon as he steps off the boat; but the girls, in slow motion, shoot the bodyguards and then gun down Big Arch, while he's inside, in his sauna (I wonder why Big Arch didn't hear the gunfire outside, before he's dispatched).So the two bad girls go on their merry way, back to school, and the two drug dealers, meet a dismal end. The conceit that these two girls would so easily be able to kill all these dangerous criminals, is of course, absurd. Only the slick production values coupled with the Franco performance, saves the film, which notably has little character development (except for Franco's part). 'Spring Breakers' is worth seeing for the visual experience but don't expect much of a brain massage at all.",Spring Breakers
41,tadpole-596-918256,"""Act like you're in a movie or something""",7,28 March 2013,"So says the female narrator to herself, and the four Spring Break girls to themselves, and no doubt the actual actresses featured in the current release SPRING BREAKERS (Vanessa Hudgins, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, and Rachel Korine) to each other during filming. And why not? In real life, their boy toy the Wizard of Oz--oops, I mean Alien (portrayed by James Franco), would be gone in two seconds, smoked by any real gang banger he ran across. Even Zimmerman would have no trouble offing such a flaky dude as Alien. In Grandpa's day he would be depicted sucking on his Binky blanket like Linus. In this movie, he substitutes cheap carnival midway PAUL-style Little Green Man paraphernalia, and drives a Chevy which looks tackier than my old Alien Ware laptop. As everyone else has no doubt said, SPRING BREAKERS is less about bare boobs (what's on display is mostly anonymous extras), and more about doing a version of SCARFACE for the teeny bopper cotton candy crowd.",Spring Breakers
42,meeza,"""High School Musical"" it's not!!!! Francostein is wickedly masterful!!",8,31 March 2013,"My childhood of watching Vanessa Hudgens' Disney movies & shows will never be the same. OK, so there is a blatant lie in that last sentence; not all the acting that Vanessa did as a child was Disney; blink, blink. Nevertheless, Señor Walt Disney is probably rolling in his grave in reacting to Hudgens' looking incredibly sultry and adulterated in Writer-Director Harmony Korine's ""Spring Breakers"". This movie is not a formulaic t*tty tale of college students jumanjing to the hot spots of spring break partying to unleash their wild side alongside their partners in spring break crime- Jack Daniels, Johnny Walker, Jose Cuervo, Bud Lite, and let's not forgot the rubbery one, Mr. Trojan (he does not have a first name). Instead, Korine has presented us stunning visuals and an inventive semi non-linear narrative in ""Spring Breakers"". The movie features four longtime female friends all around 19 or 20 years old, and I must mention very attractive (hey, I am a guy, what did you expect?) who are craving for the fun in the sun time that is spring break on the beaches of St. Petersburg, Florida. Ashley Benson and Hudgens play Candy & Brit, the college devilish hotties who are fed up with their mundane university education, and are in need of a desperate break from the books. Rachel Korine is Kotty, the most sexually-loose one of the group (even though it's a ""not so tight"" I mean ""tight"" race for that designation) who alongside Candy & Brit is trying to wrestle up some coin for the spring break sexscapade, I mean escapade. And to wrap up the eye-candy quartet, there is Faith played by Selena Gomez; cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith, I gotta have faith; well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body..; sorry the George Michaelnotsoangelo in me got a bit carried away. Anyways, Faith is the religious one (sense her name) who decides to lead herself into temptation by partnering up with her rebellious gal pals into the spring break partying tsunami. The big problem for the gals is that they don't have enough money to go on the trip, so they decide to knock off a chicken restaurant for their spring break budget. After some hard partying in the St. Petersburg party valley, they get arrested in a police raid, and end up in the can with their bikinis on throughout the whole time. How come I never saw that in my field trips to county jails as a kid? Anyways, much to their surprise they get bailed out by Alien (no not the thing that comes out of John Hurt and Noomi Rapace's stomachs). Alien is a drug-dealing gangster who moonlights as an aspiring hip-hop artist. Alien is as wicked and gangster as they come, and also has ulterior motives in why he bails out the Foxtastic Four. James Franco's performance as Alien is, what's the phrase? O yea, far out!!! It is a show-stopping performance that reinforces what a diversified talent Franco is. Hudgens and Gomez might have caused a Disney uproar with their seductive personas in ""Spring Break"", but in the end, it's not a small world after all, and eventually these Disney girls do have to ""wish upon a star"" to be big adult stars and that means appealing to other demographics as they age. Both of their performances were very effective, especially Gomez who showed sparks of brilliant thespian talent. Rachel Korine, who should be called Rachel So-Fine, was powerful in her delivery; and the same could be said of Ashley Benson's bravado effort. Korine's screenplay was not all that magnetic, but it was his directorial vision that was the filmmaking spark of ""Spring Breakers"". However, I don't know if Harmony was in a bad harmony state of mind when he orchestrated the film's very unauthentic and swashbuckling ending; which unfortunately downgraded the film from excellent to good. Nevertheless, ""Spring Break"" is not just T & A, and shits & giggles; and it is worth baring your bucks to experience. **** Good",Spring Breakers
43,estebangonzalez10,Behind the neon lights it's all a vast emptiness,5,28 September 2013,"""I got Scarface. On repeat. SCARFACE ON REPEAT. Constant, y'all! I got Escape! Calvin Klein Escape! Mix it up with Calvin Klein Be. Smell nice? I SMELL NICE!""Spring Breakers begins with its colorful neon lights, its catchy score, and its hallucinatory hedonistic atmosphere in such a way that it draws the audience in from the very beginning. There is no character development whatsoever or an interesting plot, but there was something magnetic about this social commentary on today's youth and search for pleasure. Spring Breakers was written and directed by Harmony Korine, and at first I was really drawn in to this film that had a very unique mood and energy to it. The music and the slow motion allowed for Korine's social commentary to get across pretty easily. But as the film progressed and continued to be repetitive (there are literally several scenes and voice-over narrations that play over and over again) I felt like I was getting more and more irritated with it. By the end it got so repetitive that I felt like I was watching the same music video on repeat several times. Even at the short length of 90 minutes this movie felt too stretched out. This could have worked as a short film, but instead Korine decided to stretch it out in order to get his point across. He focused so much on the hedonistic and immoral side of today's youth that I just felt overwhelmed by this movie. What began as a provocative film slowly began to lose itself into a fluorescent nightmarish dream. I understand that the one dimensional characters were actually intended, but the plot could've used a little more work and less repetition. I preferred Coppola's The Bling Ring, which I felt worked as a better social commentary about today's celebrity and fashion obsessed youth. In Spring Breakers, Korine focuses on this generation's hedonistic search for pleasures such as sex, alcohol, drugs, and violence. Finding one's identity seems to be related with having fun and searching for as much pleasure as one can find. Korine got his point across, but he seemed to be repeating himself too much. At the end it just felt too preachy.Faith (Selena Gomez), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson), and Cotty (Rachel Korine) have been best friends since they were in grade school. Now they are all studying at the same University and they are looking forward to spending time together during Spring break. They are planning on going to Florida to have a good time and discover themselves. They talk about this event as if it were going to be some sort of spiritual experience and self discovery, but in reality all they are looking for is to party. The only problem is that they never come up with the money to travel. Candy, Brit, and Cotty all have similar character traits, they are very outgoing party girls. Faith on the other hand is a little more reserved as she has a Christian background and likes to go to church and prayer groups. The three troublemakers decide to rob a local restaurant in order to come up with the money for their trip. With only a couple of water guns they succeed and are all set for their adventure. Faith joins the girls and together they begin having the time of their life in Florida. But the fun and games don't last too long after they experience some trouble with the law and end up behind bars. A stranger, a gangster rapper named Alien (James Franco), bails them out and invites them to hang out with him. He has some interesting plans for these special girls. The film has some very interesting performances here, but the stand out without a doubt has to be James Franco. He plays a very different character from the ones we are used to seeing from him. Despite how much I enjoyed his performance, I still think you could enjoy it from the trailers alone because there isn't much more in the film. Some scenes actually felt like if it were the trailer repeating itself over and over. Selena Gomez also gives a very different performance from her Disney roles as we see her smoking and drinking, although she is a little more reserved then the rest of the girls. The other three girls are very hard to distinguish in this film. They all play similar roles and it was as if director Korine was purposely mushing the three characters into one. They were all hungry for adventure and all they were looking for was to experience as much pleasure as they could having no morals at all. When James Franco comes into play at first we see him as this dangerous figure for the girls, but soon we realize that he might be in for a surprise. I had no problem with the performances here, I enjoyed them. My main issue had to do with the fact that the movie had no plot and it continued to repeat itself over and over. The magnetic appeal it had at the beginning slowly went wearing off on me until I could care less for what was happening.",Spring Breakers

45,3xHCCH,Awful Nihilistic Teen Decadence,2,9 July 2013,"""Spring Breakers"" is not an easy movie to watch. This would especially for parents of teen girls, who are the main characters of this disturbing and disgusting film, graphically showing crime, drugs and sex. Four high school girls rob a diner in order to get money for their dream spring break vacation in Miami Beach. There, they get involved with white gangsta named Alien, then all hell breaks loose. Their dream vacation turns into a nightmare.The only girl I recognized was Selena Gomez, and she does not stay on screen too long. We feel for her character the most because she was obviously out of place in that situation. She felt out of place in the whole film actually.It was only after the film when I found out that Vanessa Hudgens was one of the girls, and up to now I do not know which of the other three blonde girls was her. That was how generic and nondescript the other three trashy girls were.The character of Alien was played by an unrecognizable James Franco. I was totally surprised at the final credits to find out that it was him. He totally transformed into this sleazy character so different from how we know him from his other films. The character was creepy, but James Franco did a pretty good job bringing him to life. I'd give him a star for his effort.I do not get the stylistic choices the director Harmony Korine used to tell his story. I did not like it at all nor will I recommend it to anyone. However, I do consider the scene where Alien sings a tender Britney Spears ballad to the girls the highlight of this otherwise awful film.

46,jfgibson73,"Spring Break Forever, Y'all",4,13 July 2013,"Spring Breakers has a simple plot: four girls rob a restaurant to pay for their spring break. They hook up with a drug dealer and get tangled in a turf war that ends in violence. A lot of effort went into the technical aspects of the film--editing and cinematography, mostly. The look and feel of it seems to be the biggest focus, but it probably was meant to have a point to it as well. The music is very moody and atmospheric, and the colors are hazy and filtered, kind of like the Mexico scenes in Traffic. The girls over-indulge in bad behavior, but are also surrounded in debauchery. There are lots of scenes of out-of- control partying, along with mountains of sex and drugs. It could have been made to warn parents about what goes on at these gatherings, and probably doesn't exaggerate. I wish someone unknown had played Alien because I could only see James Franco. I kept imagining him congratulating himself on his portrayal instead of suspending my disbelief. As I watched the movie, I imagined that people would criticize it for being gratuitous, for its thin storyline, and for the stylistic choices. My main problem with it is that I felt like it the writer/director was making a ""comment"" with this film, but that it was not done in a way that makes itself clear. And if he wasn't judging, but just trying to objectively show us something about the characters and their choices, it still feels like something is missing. Either way, it doesn't add up as a viewing experience. Plus, I don't think I'll ever get James Franco's drawl out of my head. Left me unsatisfied.",Spring Breakers

Faith calls home and tells her mother how nice everyone is, how she's exploring things.After one wild party everyone gets arrested. The judge gives the four girls a choice, to pay bail or spend another night in jail. Apparently they're already out of money and aren't willing to spend another night in jail. A local gangster named Alien decides to bail them out and offers to be their driver around the area. His homies are two twin thugs. Then he takes the girls to hang out with his crew I guess, just more gangsters. Faith is starting to get real uncomfortable, and despite attempts by Alien to seduce her, she decides to go back home. The other three girls stay and Alien introduces them to his life of crime, guns, money, drugs. They become his groupies and eventually partners in crime and they all start robbing his mentor's crew. At a run in with the mentor shots are fired and one of the girls is hit in the arm. So she too decides to go back home.Alien and the other girls decide to retaliate and go after this guy in his well-guarded mansion no less.Spring Breakers features a decently attractive cast in a fairly good-looking movie. Occasionally we get some unreal coloring and lighting. It would be irresponsible to make a movie about spring break and feature no skin so there's plenty of nudity, mostly from extras and there's also some footage from the 80s or 90s or made to look like it. Our girls spend most of their time in bikinis and sneakers. By the names of the cast you can tell there won't be a whole lot of sex really.The whole movie is filmed like an intro credits scene with constant analog synthesizer sounds, voice-overs, frivolous camera effects. I was waiting for this to end so we can get to the characters and the story, but it never happens. We learn absolutely nothing about three of the girls and about Faith only that she's a Christian. The only character about whom we learn something is Alien. We learn about his dreams and aspirations in his past and that he is living the dream life. Of course the greatest seduction is to ravage innocence. And Alien sees his chance when he meets these girls in trouble.Spring Breakers offers a lot of empty style and little in terms of character analysis. It's is more like one of those European movies where one simply witnesses someone's life for a short period of time but nothing profound is offered. That leaves the viewers then to make something out of nothing and some think this is a virtue and over-analyze a movie and then attribute their thought process to the creative genius of the filmmakers, a move that isn't really warranted. I don't think there's some hidden depth to Spring Breakers waiting to be discovered. It is only mildly thought-provoking. The writer/director said that his inspiration was the movie Miami Vice, and you can tell he attempts to borrow Michael Mann's style but not his attention to detail, his character development, his immersive story lines. Michael Mann does create a distance between the movie and the audience, and Spring Breakers does too, but its the story that creates the intimacy between the audience and the movie, something missing here entirely. You do want to like Spring Breakers for its enthusiasm but the movie fails to deliver.",Spring Breakers

That does not make it any less shocking than his previous indie teen sex porn flicks and the pubescent antics of 16 year olds, but at least there is some acting here and some actual storyline. James Franco is a miracle of skill depicting a truly uneducated low IQ gangster wannabee with no life other than imitate the dregs of glitter rap and the 4 girls, as pliable and Bambi like as they are, especially Selena Gomez enter the fray as chicks in fluorescent bikinis, some splashed with foamy beer and guzzling scotch whilst eventually rolling in cash and waving assault guns. It is flouro filth, all booze sex and danger. It actually is a terrific horror film. However, it way outstays its welcome, and eventually becomes ridiculous and the truth of it falls away for a shootout finale that totally sinks the film. Once the second of the 4 girls (wisely) leaves for home, the film shoots itself in the foot and you will be glad when it is over. However, I do believe 14- 18 year olds should watch it with their parents, especially if the teens are planning a wild beach sex and booze holiday after they graduate.

There's nothing to do on this town. I never see anything different."" It is the plight of the millennial.

Revolving around four young girls Faith (Selena Gomez), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) who rob a restaurant to go on Spring Break ends up becoming a film about youth revolt especially when Alien ( James Franco) is brought in causing trouble for the structure of these girls and changing their live direction for each of the four girls.Harmony Korine mostly has made small films that not much people see and this film with the cast involved seems to make it his most known film which uses this girls as well as all the women in the movie to ways that it was hard to watch. The first half of the film is less impressive then the second have of the film because Faith leaves and is replaced by Alien the most interesting character in the film. The story was not interesting and most of the bright colours of the film made me unaware whether what I was seeing was real and what was fake with some scenes being real actually being effective. The many shots of Spring Breaker partying was hard to watch because of their slow motion and how they were used as sexual images which does not seem to what the women do while on this Spring Break even in Florida.The four main girls where the focus of the film but I was never interested in any of their performances and while Korine did give them some scenes to show their talent I just did not like those scenes overall because I never cared for the four main characters and every bad mistake they kept making throughout the film. James Franco has been mixed for me when on screen because he has had his share of great performances and really bad ones that are just about him being miscast, as the outlandish wannabee Gangster Alien Franco shines to steal the film as soon as he shows off making his performance terrifying to see but also made me understand what he was doing and how these women where attracted to his new lifestyle. The women really travel to their life direction throughout the film was an OK part of the film.I did not like mostly anything about this film other then Franco who is watchable while playing a disgusting smart character at times. Too much style was in the film and showed a fantasy of what wildness can be like but all the while knowing what the girls are experiencing is really what they wanted.MOVIE GRADE: D- (MVP: James Franco)",Spring Breakers

53,jadepietro,Gimme a Break,4,13 January 2014,"(Not Recommended) Oh, those child stars that want to drastically change their clean-cut images! This latest act of desperation comes in the form of a dirty little movie called Spring Breakers. Written and directed by Harmony Korine and starring Disney Channel favorites, Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez, the film is a cautionary tale without much caution. More exploitation movie than serious drama, Spring Breakers tells the story of four college girls gone wild. (The other two roles played by actresses Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine, wife of the filmmaker.) These party girls, named Candy, Faith, Brit, and Cotty, meet Alien, a gun- totting rapper and drug dealer, played by James Franco. This is spring break after all. So crimes are committed, sex and drugs run rampant, and morals are corrupted. It's Where the Boys Are 2013.Overusing hand held cameras to give Spring Breakers a cinema verite realistic style works to the film's advantage and the director does have a unique  vision but he is in dire need of  toning down his excessiveness and need to shock his audience. Too much time is spent on atmosphere and flashy editing with little concentration on character development and plot structure. The dialog is practically non existent and some scenes border on self parody, especially an unfortunate and unintentionally laughable musical serenade with pink ski masks and guns as a slow motion ballet set to Britney Spear's Everything. However, the film is worth seeing for its vivid photography by Benoît Debie, an effective electronic music score by Cliff Martinez and Skrillex, and a nearly unrecognizable Franco, the only actor here to actually give a performance. Franco is all gold teeth, cornrows, and false bravado. He leaves a strong impression as a hedonistic gangster, but then who couldn't, as he gives fellatio to a semiautomatic weapon in one scene alone. It's far from nuanced, but at least he's sincere. Spring Breakers may become a cult classic to some, but it's all surface treatment and as shallow as its interchangeable one dimensional characters. The film seems more interested in titillation than explanation. For me, after seeing these repulsive and unlikeable characters for nearly two hours of endless lust and debauchery, I needed to take a well-earned break from this uglier side of life.

54,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Spring Breakers,5,15 May 2014,"OK picture this: Four college kids (Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, Vanessa Hudgens, and Rachel Korine) are bored with their existence. It's Spring Break and everyone at their school has already left. With little money in their pockets and in a drug fueled haze, they decide to rob a fast food restaurant to bankroll a trip to St. Petersburg, Florida for Spring Break madness. While living it up, these girls are befriended by a gangster/rapper named Alien (James Franco) who draws them back into a life of crime with more mischief and mayhem. That's the basic idea behind Spring Breakers, a mindless farce that's kind of a cross between the films Point Break (1991) and True Romance (1993). However, it's the rude stepchild of both of them. A sort of poor man's hangover version if you will.First off, Spring Breakers is a monumental case of an exercise that is all style and no substance. Possessing a couple of well done sequences and an Oscar worthy performance, it painstakingly thinks that it's a better movie than it really is. You also get the feeling that the cast felt the same way, like they were making a uncompromising college film classic. With a slew of former teen actresses who are all now in their twenties, this vehicle was probably chosen as the type of work that would shed their wholesome good girl image. However, the idea of these girls playing characters who infiltrate a fast food restaurant and put guns in people's faces is ridiculous and sad. What's even more sad is how disorienting this mid-March release is. There is never enough time to take in anything on screen especially the tone at which actors are gauging. Director Harmony Korine is obsessed with cutting from one thing to the next, and I know it's a Spring Break theme movie, but he has an annoying habit of constantly panning from an important plot point to a bunch of half naked woman doing alcohol shots.That's why you have to hand it to actor James Franco for literally saving ""Breakers"" from being a total disaster. He shows up halfway in the movie and to his credit, he makes the other cast members look better despite their limited acting range. Alas, everything in ""Breakers"" kind of slows down to tell a more coherent story the minute he's on screen. It's a shame he wasn't inserted in the proceedings earlier because his performance is downright Oscar worthy.With the exception of Franco being the only true bright spot, there is one more flaw in this film that sticks out like a sore thumb. A lot of the script is tainted with dangling loose ends. You get the feeling that the actors didn't have much to say toward the end of the dialogue. The solution: Yell out the words SPPRRIINNGG BREEAAK! or SPRRIINNGG BRREEAAK FOR EVVEERR! Utter nonsense. That's why I can't possibly recommend this movie. It continues the trend in today's dreck where there is sort of this lousy MTV style of not letting a shot just pan out. You know, keeping a scene in frame for longer than a couple of seconds. Therefore, in truth, we need an immediate ""break"" from films like this.",Spring Breakers

56,p-stepien,Phantasmagoric teenage angst,6,11 March 2014,"After a bout of flying nuns and Michael Jackson impersonators, Harmony Korine returns with his most mainstream production yet. A mesmerising tale of a quartet of cash-strapped teenage students, living in small-town USA, that decide that a Florida escapade during spring break is a necessity to lighten up there dim, repetitive existence. Devoid of the monetary means they decide to hold up a local diner, thus already pushing the limits of their expectations as to this excursion. Somewhat the outlier of this group of friends is Faith (Selena Gomez), a bible-hugging devout Christian, who nonetheless knows the worth of going crazy with the like of Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine).With the ill-gotten gains they venture to student-crazy Florida beaches, where breasts are bouncing, beer is pouring and the foursome aim to spend a moment of eternal perfection in this vapid spurge of debauchery. Faith wishes for time to stop and the sun and fun to become permanent, as the four friends ride the town on their rad scooters. With a backdrop of destructive parties, lack of hindsight and total no-holds-barred partying, the inevitable occurs as the dream collides with a breath of reality. Enter Alien (James Franco) who offers of prolongation of the dream - undying lack of responsibility for your actions. Faith hits her limit and promptly resigns to return to drab existence, but the remaining threesome delve into the gangster lifestyle of robbing spring breakers and pushing dope. Spring break forever, y'all!!!Harmony Korine borrows his artistic style heavily from fellow auteur Terrence Mallick, delivering a similarly sombre tone of existentialist dramaturgy, where flashbacks, flash-forwards, jump-cuts and images are juxtaposed to off-camera narration by the characters. Nonetheless Korine introduces a cascading chaos to the proceedings, as if attempting to replicate the drunken orgy that are summer Florida excursions in the way he tells it story. The end result is a unmissable sense of resigned acceptance of the inevitable countered by the joyous bliss of expectations, which basically underpins the whole concept of the movie. The movie falls back on spring break as a hopeless attempt to remain young and live the eternal party, dauntlessly striving to avoid the lingering reality to filter through teenage euphoria.The artistic premise works well, although people either unaccustomed or repulsed by Mallick's method of storytelling may be taken back by the hypnotic narrative. Nonetheless severe flaws populate the overall movie, as Korine decides to forgo certain structural story-telling necessities or dashes headfirst into logical pitfalls, thus severely weakening the overall impact. At one point, for example, you can't help but wonder how a semi-renowned characteristically looking gangster-rapper like Alien can audaciously hold up people at gunpoint without any police blow-back.The biggest issue itself is the presentation of the female leads. Or its lack. Apart from Faith, who is given some background as to her church praying everyday life and some insight into her thought processes (with a key monologue about the mundanity of life), the remaining threesome are an amorphous being, which are hard to differentiate from each other, not only as to their character traits, but also physically. Rachel Korine stands out somewhat with her pink hair, but it took me the better part of 40 minutes to distinguish the actresses between each other and with the closing credits I still had no sense of identity to any of them. This in part brings about the misogynist accusations, which are sometimes hurdled at the movie. With such disposable barely-clad anti-heroines with strong sexual innuendos often present, the overall concept tends to be laid to waste by the utter lack of interest into who exactly these women are.",Spring Breakers

58,brando647,A Surreal Mind-Trip into the Seedier Side of Spring Break,7,13 September 2013,"Can someone explain to me why SPRING BREAKERS was in the comedy section of my local department store? I can only imagine how many people saw this movie sitting on the shelf with it's cover portraying Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, Rachel Korine, and James Franco in beach-mode and thought, ""Well this movie looks like a fun time! It's like THE HANGOVER for the Disney crowd!"" I am, of course, assuming that the majority of people buying movies from my local department stores are fools who aren't familiar with movie ratings or aware of movie reviews. And I'm pretty sure I'm right. Anyway, SPRING BREAKERS is not a comedy and, if it is, I missed something somewhere. This movie is a 90 minute hallucination and a rough one. It centers on four longtime friends: Candy (Hudgens), Brit (Benson), Cotty (Korine), and Faith (Gomez). Spring Break has arrived and their too poor to leave campus when everyone heads down south to the beaches of Florida for a week of insane debauchery. We receive our first hint that these girls aren't quite right when Candy, Brit, and Cotty decide to rob an all-night chicken shack for their Spring Break funds. From there, it's beaches, booze, and bongs as the girls party it up until their arrested in a narcotics bust when they're in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Aliena wannabe gangster who makes his living dealing drugs and robbing spring-breakers. He bails out the girls and enlists them to join him in business, and it all goes nuts from there.SPRING BREAKERS isn't so much a film as it is an experience. It's a visual journey, popping with neon color and thumping with an electronic soundtrack, that won't settle with most average viewers. I had a friend that wanted to see this movie purely for the bikini-clad stars but I warned him against it because I didn't want to hear the eventual complaints that he had no idea what was going on. While I'm totally cool with helping others experience new movies and different styles of filmmaking, I know there's a line and, in this instance, that line is filmmaker Harmony Korine. There is a story present in SPRING BREAKERS but it's done in such a unique and mind-bending fashion that I guarantee it'll turn a lot of people off. Personally, I enjoyed it. After I first watched it, it didn't take some processing on my part and multiple viewings have only made me appreciate it more. I'm a newbie when it comes to Harmony Korine's previous work. I've never seen KIDS or GUMMO but I've heard enough about them to know I need to check them out at some point. For now, SPRING BREAKERS is my first exposure to his work and it's got my attention. It pits a dark crime story against the vibrant energized atmosphere of the crazy college world of Spring Break. At least, the Spring Break you've seen on MTVdrunk, sexually jack-up college students going totally insane.This is a movie about evil people. Seriously, all but one person in this movie is a sociopath. The only objectively good person in the movie bails as soon as things start going sour. The most fun is watching the dark side of these girls slowly reveal themselves as the movie goes on. You start to wonder who's really the one being manipulated: these girls or Alien? You know they're not your average college hotties early on when you see how easily crime comes to them, but you don't realize how cold they can be. Despite the girls' rapid descent into the seedier side of Spring Break, the violence isn't over-the-top here. The nudity isso, you know, this really isn't for the actual longtime fans of people like Hudgens and Gomez. This is their attempt at breaking free from their Disney Channel roots. Hudgens had some success with her turn in SUCKER PUNCH but this secures it. I'm pretty sure pot-smoking and threesomes are a surefire way to bust out of that mold. Gomez doesn't go as nuts here but she's still doing her best to be seen as an actual actress. The performances are pretty good for what they are. James Franco has been receiving a lot of praise for his role as Alien. Honestly, he annoyed me the first time I watched the movie. Horribly. But it wasn't his performance, it's just that people like the grate on my nerves. Franco does a great job here, and it's one of his most strange performances.SPRING BREAKERS isn't for everyone and I'd hope most people would know what they're settling in for if they decide to watch it. It's a gritty, surreal film with some nice eye candy and a foreboding atmosphere playing against the Spring Break wonderland we all envision when we think of college co-eds going nuts. It's a refreshing change from the usual mainstream release, even if it can be a little frustrating to watch at times.",Spring Breakers

I've seen 3 of his other films, Gummo, Mister Lonely and Julien Donkey Boy and I thought they were decent to good. I can often see what he's trying to do but its lack of character and substance hurts it. Spring Breakers is perhaps his most mainstream effort given the concept, stars and the slick production but it's probably his least interesting. With MTV style cinematography and editing, a dubstep soundtrack and drama distant from the camera, the result is an unpleasant nightmare. I'm not sure who this film is aiming at, the type of person the film is about or the art-house crowd where the the techs are the furthest to their taste? It wants to be a comment on contemporary party culture but its unrealistic characters make it unbearably tedious. Every time a character starts to becomes sympathetic, they leave the film, and far too easily at that. Why are we even trapped in this nightmare if the characters are deliberately raising the stakes? It's a film that relishes on forced juxtapositions such as singing Britney Spears over robberies and it ends up obvious or pointless, nulling its effect. I still don't really know what to make to Spring Breakers but it definitely isn't my thing.5/10",Spring Breakers
61,rivertam26,You've never seen anything like this,8,25 March 2013,"It's hard to put this film into words. It's an outrageous visual feast thats attacks your senses and leaves it's neon toned footprint on your psyche. Centering on a group of rambunctious girls on a spring break bender which starts with them robbing a restaurant and than has them descending upon Florida and unleashing their shenanigans. Which include but are not limited to various sexcapades, loads of drug use, lots of dirty dancing and talking, a stint in the slammer and befriending a white rapper/drug dealer named Alien played by James Franco in the performance of his career. Everything I have told you about this film and everything you've seen about it doesn't capture how unique and smart an experience it is. At face value it's easy to hate these girls they seem spoiled, act entitled and make some huge mistakes but if you dig a little deeper. You will see an exploration of youth and purpose from todays generation. A satire to some extent one that doesn't follow any of the old cinematic tropes. Instead of being victims these girls well two of them at least know exactly what they are doing and freely indulge in it. Maybe to give their lives some meaning, in search of some excitement, maybe because of a deep rooted friendship or maybe just to get their rocks off. A smaller more shallow film would have pinned the girls as easy victims and had them learn some type of lesson. But this version is far more intriguing instead of objectifying their beauty and vulnerability it treats those qualities as strengths. They are in charge and although the culmination of violence seems a little hard to believe it's easy to believe that the characters that have been created are indeed bad asses. As genre clichés go Selena Gomez shows up as the films only real ""good"" girl and bails out halfway through and thank god being that her's is the worst performance. Rachael Korine reads a bit better and her character Cotty feels complex. For instance in a scene where she is surrounded by wasted, hard bodied young men in a room as they pour alcohol over her you would expect her to be taken advantage of but here she instead controls the situation flirting and teasing that they won't have a chance at getting at her. Vanessa Hudgens should be given credit for committing so fully to the role but lacks the acting bug to really pull it off. The star of the girls here is Ashley Benson her character feels so real whether smashing a sledge hammer into tables, singing Britney Spears and making Franco's character give oral sex to the tip of a loaded gun she explodes with a raw pizazz. Her character may not be as developed as I would have liked but her moments hint at a promise of a long future in the business. And as for Mr. Franco his depiction of ""Alien"" is so insane and over the top and just completely brave. it walks the fine line of being a complete joke but because of his utter commitment he never flails off slimy, charming, self obsessed and corny he is amazingly addictive as his character one that is sure to have a very long cult life. And that's the thing about Spring Breakers, everything about it screams absolute camp and bad movie. Well it is campy but it is far from being a bad movie, It's a modern hypnotic, hallucinatory, celluloid trashfest that has much more power than you would expect it to.Not to say it's flawless they could have gone a little deeper into the films subtext and the characters but Trust me you've never seen anything like this. 4/5",Spring Breakers
62,punishmentpark,"How boring, how inane.",2,18 January 2016,"This reminded me a little of a 21st century update of the old Miami Vice series (without Sonny or Tubbs) mixed with some MTV dance show (with just a little of it unrated) and a cinematographer that was very, very drunk^. The plot is totally simplistic and silly, the characters are totally simplistic and silly, and, on top of that, it all was very, very boring and inane.I can appreciate what cinematographer Benoît Debie did in quite a few films that I saw, so my remark should not be taken áll too seriously, but, for example, those scenes in the hallways were totally lame, for the lack of a more sophisticated word.On the upside - yes, there is one! - I liked some of the (fluorescent) lighting and the four leading babes (among others) weren't hard to look at, at all!That's about 2 out of 10, I suppose.

Focussing on the exploits of four bored girls who rob a bank to fund their trip to Florida in order to party and ""find themselves"" - only to become entangled in drugs, weapons and gangsters - Korine creates a lurid, confronting flick that is short on narrative and high on mood. Spring Breakers is essentially a string of montages set to dance and hip-hop tunes; the slick and well selected beats dictate the tempo and tell the tale. There are some choice scenes - a slow-mo sequence played against Britney Spear's ""Everytime"" is a highlight - and Korine has a bag of visually stylish tics up his sleeve, but how much you enjoy this down and dirty odyssey will be largely dependent on your tolerance levels of the languid and repetitive nature of the storytelling, as well as your taste in music. James Franco's gangster Alien is slimy yet charismatic, Selena Gomez is wooden as the impressionable Faith whilst Vanessa Hudgens unequivocally obliterates her Disney princess persona as the morally corrupt and money hungry Candy.

64,napierslogs,Breaks the spring-break-genre mold by telling a dark story of college girls getting into darker and darker places,8,7 April 2013,"""Spring Breakers"" takes the spring break vacation and turns it on its head. It's about everything that spring break represents and nothing it represents all at the exact same time. Four college girls do in fact go to Florida for spring break; they do in fact wear bikinis, get drunk, and do drugs. The film isn't lying when they say that's what it's about. But it takes that culture and places it in a whole new genre.For starters, this is a drama not a comedy. The movie's enthusiasts who got everything out of it that Harmony Korine was trying to say may refer to it as a comedy in the sense that the film makes fun of how that culture is revered in our current society. But there isn't a laugh to be found, and there isn't meant to be any. Others will laugh because it's so ridiculous. But that depends on your frame of reference on watching. If you're expecting these girls to behave similarly to anybody you have ever met, then you will find it ridiculous. How quickly they go from their boring college lives to the dark recesses of the human psyche, is shocking and extreme. And probably ridiculous to some. But this film is better than others of its kind because these are wholly unique characters – we've never seen them in a movie like this before. As the film goes on, we're never sure if they're in over their heads, or if they're about to turn the Floridian spring break hot spot on its head.Three of the girls start out as pretty despicable people (the other one is religious). Their actions are bad but then their situation gets worse and that's when the plot, or let's call that character study, starts getting interesting. The girls meet Alien (James Franco) – a rapper, spring break gangster and philosopher. His name is Alien because he's an alien – in his own philosophical way. He's also unlike Franco as you've ever seen him before. He's probably unlike most actors as you've ever seen before.There are a lot of interesting power dynamics along with the dark but powerful evolution to the girls (or at least three of the girls). Sometimes what the film has to say can get lost amongst all the gratuitous shots of naked girls, alcohol and hard-core drug use. We're also almost 30 minutes into the film before the story gets moving and it becomes apparent that the plot is a character study of these girls ""finding themselves.""The film is likely just going to be one of many extremely divisive films from 2013. ""Spring Breakers"" breaks the mold of spring break films and presents us with a film that is dark, dirty, and disgusting. At one glance it is completely unrealistic, but at a second glance these girls might be more frighteningly real than we would like to believe. On the surface, the film was everything that I hate, but I really liked it. It's a story that doesn't seem familiar even if it has been told before, but it has never been told in this setting before. And for that reason I do think ""Spring Breakers"" needs to be seen from all cinephiles alike.",Spring Breakers
65,areatw,"Trash, but very enjoyable trash",7,2 February 2020,"I decided to watch 'Spring Breakers' after a friend recommended it to me and was expecting to hate it as it isn't something I would typically choose to watch. Despite the fact that it lived up to my expectations of being a piece of well-produced, style-obsessed garbage, I did actually find myself enjoying it a lot more than a thought I would.Quite why, I'm not sure. But as a piece of entertainment, 'Spring Breakers' certainly does its job as I was entertained from start to finish. I was also pleasantly surprised by the acting in this film, particularly by Selena Gomez who exceeded my (admittedly low) expectations as one of the main characters. There isn't much of a credible story to speak of, but more than enough fun and silliness to keep you interested.'Spring Breakers' will not be for everyone, but it does have an audience for those who enjoy over-the-top, trashy teen movies. Considering I was expecting to hate it, I was pleasantly surprised.",Spring Breakers
66,aciessi,Spring Break Forever?,5,7 April 2019,"Spring Breakers is an experience meant to feel like a blur once you finish it. When I was a Senior in High School, it was the word-of-mouth film everyone was talking about. Some said it was amazing and some said it was the worst film ever made. But those who saw it then, in large multiplexes, sadly knew nothing of it's creator Harmony Korine. The Godfather of hardcore hipster cinema. Surreal art pictures like Gummo and Trash Humpers. If you know what you're getting, you'll understand Spring Breakers, and realize that this is actually his most commercial film to date. If you don't know that, you probably wont like it at all. The right word for this is polarizing.Spring Breakers is intoxicatingly unpleasant. That's an oxymoron, but it's an apt description. Korine introduces us to these four girls. Right off the bat, you are repulsed by them. They come across as vapid seekers of cheap thrills, no matter how depraved and sadistic. Instead of getting money at the ATM, they arm rob a chicken restaurant. How sweet. Gomez plays the outlier of the group. A good Christian girl who sees nothing but trouble from the jump, and is the first to bail when things get real. Curiously, as Alien (James Franco) enters the scene, Gomez exists thereafter. We never see or hear from her again. I'll admit that this makes for shoddy character development, and at this point in his career, Korine should know better. But forget that. Just go with it.Shots of sweaty bodies and beer guzzling occupy the frames of the wild parties these girls go to. Think of Project X, but artsier. At this point, we are introduced to Alien, played by James Franco. A low-life drug-dealer, small-time rapper and wealthy baddie, surrounded by cars, wads of cash and machine guns. He's a white trash train-wreck. Evidently, this may be James Franco's best onscreen role. At least until he played Tommy Wiseau, but does that even count as an original performance? He takes these girls under his wing, and trains them to be his personal hit squad.Spring Breakers is what it is. A nonsensical film about sex, dugs, alcohol, guns and crime in sunny Florida. In some ways, it's a cautionary tale about getting caught up in the wrong crowd. In other ways, it's a midnight stoner flick. I can't say it's a great film, but I don't think it's bad either. Once you are sucked in to this world, it's hard to come back out of it, and you end up being seduced by it's vile nature.",Spring Breakers
67,cultfilmfan,Spring Breakers,10,29 March 2013,"As, I walked out of the theatre of Spring Breakers, I was awestruck. I had just seen another masterpiece from writer/director Harmony Korine, whose films and work I have admired since my early teenage years. I consider him to be one of the best writer/directors working today and one of the most unique visionaries and geniuses behind a camera that we have in an industry filled with Hollywood blockbusters that are cliché and overloaded with special effects as well as remake after remake being shelled out. It's such a breath of fresh air to see another great original film by Korine. To some, Spring Breakers will seem like pure and simple exploitation and it will be dismissed as trash. How further from the truth could those people be. This is a cautionary tale of young college/university age girls who go for a wild time on their spring break that leads to a lot of immoral behaviour, attitudes and ways of thinking, that is unfortunately all too common among today's youth of today. Yes, the film does show scenes of wild parties and sex, drugs, violence and all the nihilistic antics popular today and of yesteryear. The film is graphic in it's depiction, which may lead some to classify it as an exploitation film, but I found by showing us an unflinchingly graphic, hopeless and disturbing group of people doing a lot of bad and inappropriate behaviour was crucial to this story and the message that was trying to be delivered and was delivered successfully. The film shows these girls as naïve and bored with everyday life. They don't seem to pay attention much in school and it really does not seem all that important to them. Their lives seem so empty with little, or no love being shown to them and no moral compass, or guidance to steer them in the right direction. Because their lives are empty of anything meaningful, or of substance, these girls conform to the out of control antics that are the ruin of today's youth and a path that will only lead to more and more trouble and destruction. It's fascinating to see how each one of these girls comes to this. The one girl in particular does have somewhat of a life invested in faith and others do show that somehow what is going on around them is not right. The film is quite disturbing by showing us just how low and depraved they can get, but like Korine's penned Kids, it is also a wake up call both to parents and young people alike. The character played by James Franco, who goes by the name ""Alien"", is also a lost person trying to base his whole existence on the failed life philosophy of living big and dying young by filling up life with drugs, sex, violence and living a life without any real responsibility, or guidance other than that of Al Pacino in Scarface, and other failed gangsters. The film shows how pathetic all these people's new found lifestyles really are and that they will not make them rich, happy, or better in any possible way and the film makes us feel that they are utterly and completely hopeless and that is the point. It's a disturbing yet powerful display of at risk youth which is also a very thought provoking experience as well. James Franco steals the show as Alien, and does a very good job here playing a character who thinks he's much larger and more important than he really is. He is often amusing and pathetic to watch and I mean that in a good way. Kudos to Franco for a great spot on performance. The girls themselves are all quite good here as well. There is much more to their performances than meets the eye and I felt they delivered. The film has a unique and appropriate visual style of bright neon lights and fast jump cutting editing which works very well here. The film's score by Cliff Martinez, who also did the fantastic score for Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive, does a great one here too that completely suit's the film's story and visual style. While the film is full of despair and pity, it is also very entertaining in the sense that I could not take my eyes off the screen and really wanted to keep watching with it's haunting yet almost beautifully eerie style and way of storytelling. This is not a mainstream film, so a lot of people will leave feeling let down. However, for fans of Harmony Korine's other great films in his body of work and anyone at all interested in a stylish, haunting and thought provoking film, will want to see this. This is the best film so far this year and while the year is young much like these girls, I know it will be one of my favorites still by year end.",Spring Breakers
68,CountZero313,a bore,2,26 July 2014,"Spring Break is apparently something of a social phenomenon in The States. Akin to how some European women completely let go in resorts in Spain, Greece and Turkey, Spring Break is an amoral interlude from the pressures of day-to-day life, a social space where the rules are not so much different, as non-existent.Fertile ground, then, for a filmmaker to come along and analyze and debunk some preconceived notions. And it still is, because this shallow, immature little oddity sheds no light on the phenomenon other than to treat it as a slow-mo backdrop to some highly improbable shenanigans by a group of fit high school girls. Girls in bikinis and matching ski masks posing with big guns is clearly not going after realism, so symbolism, or some kind of absurdist comedy, a scathing expose of the nihilistic heart of America's consumer culture, may be implied. Unfortunately not, as everyone just mopes around snarling at each other, getting drunk, and waving guns. This is a music video without the music.James Franco as Alien seems to be trying to do something interesting, but without any narrative to anchor the performance in, it becomes pantomime. Selena Gomez playing against type could have been worth watching, except she doesn't, as she is the goody two-shoes, an angel out slumming with three demons. Just when it might seem her character should face difficult choices, they put her on a bus and send her home. Such moments typify this film's failure to say anything of note at all.In the end, this is incoherent nonsense marketed on the exploitative promise of holiday debauchery, that seems to sneer at the audience for falling for the film's own marketing. An unpalatable waste of time.",Spring Breakers
69,Carycomic,"Well, at least it was less boring than ""Blunderstone.""",2,23 March 2013,"But, that's still not a recommendation to go see it. I mean, of all the ""-isms"" floating around in this movie (hedonism, narcisscism, materialism, voyeurism, alcoholism, vandalism, racism, and sexism), the only one missing was moralism. As in; what was supposed to be the moral of this story? That crime doesn't pay? That wealth and power don't make anyone bullet-proof (unless you're a trigger-happy bimbo wearing a pink ski mask and a glow-in-the-dark bikini)? That Floridian arraignment court judges are little more than black-robed rednecks trying to extort money from the parents of Yankee college students?Heck! There wasn't even a sneaky epilogue after the ending credits to show whether Britt and Candi returned to college, or went ""Thelma and Louise"" full time. Either way; if your only motive for seeing this film is to wait for the court room scene, where all four girls are standing before that self-righteous idiot of a judge (who seriously believes he's trying to scare them straight) without even being allowed the dignity of wearing orange cover-alls? Then, you just might as well head home after Alien bails them out.Because, the rest of the film after that is a guaranteed cure for insomnia.",Spring Breakers
70,Likes_Ninjas90,A hasty attack on a pop generation,5,5 May 2013,"In 1995 Harmony Korine wrote the screenplay for the Larry Clark film Kids, an unflinching drama about kids engaging in underage sex and drug use. Two years later, Korine made his directional debut with the bleak, apocalyptic Gummo, which charted more absurdist waters in a post- apocalyptic world of boredom and young people running amok. Troubled youths is a reoccurring theme that has stayed with this former skateboarder right up till now. Spring Breakers is a more accessible and commercial film than Gummo but its short of a narrative and it lacks the matter-of-fact treatment of Kids. There's a memorable visual style and a bizarre, entertaining performance by James Franco, but not enough story or insight to certify its importance. The film is long and flabby, its characters and plot underdeveloped and Korine's direction lacks certainty. Is this a critique of a self-absorbed generation, a comedy, a thriller or just an exercise in perversion? The film is about four bored college girls named Faith (Selena Gomez), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine), who want to party during spring break. When they can't pool enough money together for the trip, they decide to rob a diner. They reach the spring break destination, only to be arrested by the police and then bailed out by a man calling himself Alien (James Franco). He is a drug dealer that encourages them to join him on a crime spree and wipe out a nearby rival gangster. In an interview with the Australian movie magazine FilmInk, Korine discussed his intentions for the film: ""I make movies because I like the story and the characters. I'm not making a movie that's an indictment on American culture, or a movie that's about boobs or guns - those are parts of that world and that fabric, but it's not about that."" As Korine suggests, the film's point becomes extremely elusive, particularly when the filmic style is separated from the theme, and his direction relies on technique to substitute plotting. The early scenes work to instill feelings of belonging. The long shots of the still, tired, grey and empty college grounds reflects the girls' isolation because they fear they won't experience anything new or meet anyone exciting as everyone has already left for spring break without them. These shots are juxtaposed by the party scenes, which are filmed through the extensive use of montage, with music playing over slow- motion and highly saturated images. It provides these ugly scenes of drinking, drugs and senseless nudity as a dream-like vision of paradise in the minds of these morally corrupted girls. ""Pretend it's a video game...act like you're in a movie,"" one of the girls says to further highlight their detachment from reality. The night scenes reflect darkness in mood and lighting but also moral decay, with only the fluorescent colours of the girls' costumes brightening the screen to suggest their belief in their own self-importance, while the broader landscape of society fades into the shadows. However, the film's voyeuristic disposition reveals Korine's apathy towards character development and narrative thrust. Korine's costume choice of leaving the girls in their swimsuits for most of the film, and the way that his camera lingers over those raunchy party scenes, evokes an unintentionally creepy sense of perversion. Apart from the opening scenes, the elaborate neon visuals eclipse the story and characters, with the repetitive vision of raunchy partying making the film seem excruciatingly long and banal. Selena Gomez is the only standout of the girls, proving that she can act by showing some believable emotion. However, the religious symbolism of her character barely registers as one-dimensional and the other three girls, despite their intimidation factor, are underwritten and lack distinction. James Franco provides the most memorable role of his career as Alien, a cross between a hip-hop rapper and the Devil, who has a cornrows haircut, gold teeth and dresses like a gangster.He's utterly mesmerising and funny, but what exactly does his character want? He uses the girls for crime jobs but never really needed to as he has his twin henchmen. Sex is an option he fulfils, but not straight away either. A promising seed of conflict is planted when the girls look as though they'll rob or kill Alien, only for the moment to fizzle out. He embodies a bastardised version of the American Dream: to take everything you want, while you can, but not understand what to do with it. In a very funny scene, he showcases all of the useless things he was able to obtain, including several kinds of shorts, a looping copy of Scarface, and nunchucks. Alien's artlessness is amplified strikingly through the film's best and strangest scene, where he sits at a piano, surrounded by the girls dressed in pink balaclavas, carrying assault weapons, and declares Britney Spears as one of the best singers of all time. He starts singing Britney's song ""Everytime"" and then a montage opens with the song playing over images of the girls' crime spree. Decadence is visualised magnificently but in the end the film is hypocritical: a hasty attack on a pop generation when the film itself is not art but poorly disciplined and morally questionable.",Spring Breakers

72,PeterMitchell-506-564364,A fair spring,6,9 May 2013,"Four hot down on their luck girls, bikini beauties, resort to robbing a restaurant to pay for a spring break in good ol' Florida. This is familiar territory for Korine, recurring flashbacks, flash forward shots amidst a lot of profane if repeated dialogue (Spring breeaaaaak. Spring breaaaaak). Also it has thankfully a lot of, sex, nudity and cleavage, one shot if I was not mistaken, featured a guy getting s..ked off. These four girls almost out of high school, but stuck in this dead end town, yearn for this break, where it comes as a godsend. After getting arrested for noisy behavior at a loud party, they're bailed out by Alien- a wealthy drug dealer, avid rapper, budding pianist, and you should see all the s**t he's got in his pad, where's he quick and proud to brag about it, which makes for one of the funny scenes. Although SB has more drama about it, it does have an uncomfortable and a sadness about these girls, you really wanna see got do the right path. The party pooper, the hot Gomez, a church goer, bails out on them, returning to her dead town existence. You'll actually think she might return later but doesn't. Franco who takes the girls in, like candy to a baby, though Gomez sees above his act, which really it isn't, when you get to know his character better, vows vengeance on a former friend/drug dealer, after the second beauty is wounded and heads in the same direction as Gomez. Franco is the one savior of the film, a serious, seriously good actor, where we're sure to see much more impressive stuff from this guy. This film could of seriously plummeted without his performance. The shooting montage scene, against his piano playing/singing track of a ten year old Brittany Spears track, I liked very much, stays in my head, it was quite a surprise to hear this particular song. This movie is worth the view for the obvious birdwatcher, but really this one, which is something different, doesn't have much potency to it, where we could of delved deeper into these girl's characters and problems, where too many shots of bouncing boobies, or bikini's, got in the way.

74,asda-man,High School Musical meets Gummo,8,6 July 2014,"I remember when Spring Breakers first started rearing its head with its trailers and posters, and I was so confused. It starred these ex Disney channel girls and was written and directed by the same man who created Gummo, a film that I still dare not see due to how much the trailer and clips, I've seen have scared me. Harmony Korine also did an even weirder looking film called, Trash Humpers which basically follows people wearing old man masks and dry-hump skips. Harmony's films have never been mainstream. They instead appeal to the sick few of us, who are interested in the weirder side of film.Spring Breakers is definitely Harmony's most mainstream film, and it makes me wonder how on Earth he was able to convince such high profile mainstream stars to take part in his experimental art film. Of course there is genius behind these casting choices. Spring Breakers was presented as a teen film with a bit of action in, when actually it's a little experimental art-house film about our generation who follow celeb culture and have dreams of getting as much sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll and booze as possible.To my knowledge, Harmony Korine has never been one for too much plot and Spring Breakers continues this fashion. It's basically about four girls who are looking to break away from their mundane lives and thus go over to Florida's famous spring break, only to be arrested and bailed out by a slimy James Franco who leads them into a strange world of violence. There really isn't much to the film, but that didn't really bother me too much. Spring Breakers is all about the execution and atmosphere. There's enough narrative to stop you from getting bored though.Every review that I've read (love or hate) has agreed that the film is pretty spectacular to look at. The neon-soaked images reminded me of the masterfully moody, Only God Forgives and the unnaturally bright daylight gives off an unnerving vibe. As with most art films, it will either click for you or it won't. Spring Breakers clicked for me. I felt kind of swept away by the dreamlike images and unconventional editing. It's executed in such a strange way with lines being repeated over voice-over, random shotgun noises, slow-motion nudity over dub step, I couldn't help but feel sucked into its strange world.The acting is pretty OK all round. James Franco is good, but not as great as people rave about. His performance is extremely over-the-top, which may impress some people, but to me it was just hammy. He did have a more than a bit of Bobby Peru in his character, and I think he must've taken notes from Willem Dafoe's legendary performance in Wild at Heart. Spring Breakers becomes incredibly hallucinatory towards the end with a bizarre shootout, drenched in some beautiful colourful lighting and complete with glow-in-the-dark balaclavas.I'm not really sure what Spring Breakers means, but I think it's definitely a film that you have to feel rather than understand. If you go along with its loony execution and lose yourself in the images, then you might find something quite special. It was an experience I quite enjoyed and one which I'd happily relive. I completely understand why most people hate it though. It appeals to the wrong market. Tweenagers aren't going to give this film a chance, unless they're into weird cult films like I am. I think that Spring Breakers is a very cool and colourful film, and one which makes you think too.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com",Spring Breakers

Three young girls simply want to go to Florida, like many-many others during the spring break. The only thing that stands n their way is the lack of money and so they just...go for it.The abundance of pretty young bodies that often fill the screen, highlighting their hedonistic needs forms the backbone for this movie. Life is a party, a joy. Why place limits and kill the fun? Abuse now, face consequences later.Our three naive youngsters, do not seem to deal well with consequences which is something the bailing gangster knows only too well and the sprng break takes a whole new form.Stylish and sensual, fun and exciting that is ultimately let down by a known Hollywood tendency to move way beyond the realms of possible and real in order to achieve a higher box office taking.",Spring Breakers

77,rubenm,Looks like an extended music video,5,23 March 2013,"This is a strange film. On the one hand, it looks likes an extended music video, filled with mindless scenes of teenagers having one big party. On the other hand, there's clearly more to it. Some characters are so one-dimensional and cartoon-like, that the whole film becomes a sort of mockery of the modern teenage culture. This ambiguity is very clever, because the film appeals to a teenage audience as well as to the art-house audience Harmony Korine is usually associated with. But at the same time, this ambiguity stands in the way of 'Spring Breakers' being a really good film. Unlike other serious movies about teenage culture, like 'Thirteen', 'Ghost World', Korine's own 'Kids' or the recent 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', this film looks too easy. The temptation of showing lots of girls in bikini has been stronger than the ambition of trying to tell something meaningful. Still, there are some nice moments. The hold-up in the restaurant is beautifully filmed from the window of a car slowly passing by. It's nice that, later on in the film, the director shows some short moments of what happened inside the restaurant.

He devoted himself to finding beauty in the gutter which has been polarizing the audience during his career. As his body of work accumulated it became possible to find some patterns. It seems as if he carries a video camera with him all the time and films what he's going through then reworks this into scenarios and movies.But we're living in a world that is not perfect, where you get funding not only according to artistic merit and quality of script. Spring Breakers continues where Mister Lonely (2007) ended, yet in a more accessible manner. As if this movie didn't address loners and movie buffs but a wider audience.This is exactly where the problems starts. If Spring Breakers is meant as a far fetched docudrama on Generation Y, or whatever is the name for the youth of today, then we've seen this all on Facebook already. And if it had the ambition to convey a deeper message, then it is simply not there.Nevertheless, the script is good despite slow pace. Just as you start wondering whether anything would happen, James Franco steps in, turning spring break into a runaway train. Actors deliver surprisingly good performance and it is hard to tell which from them are professionals and which amateurs. Selena Gomez is seen in bathing suit, yet doesn't conduct unworthy of a church going young lady. Actually, her character is the first to get a grip on herself, which is true to her image in real life.What speaks in favor of this movie, though, is that it never uses violence just for the shock value or to create ""art"". This was the case in several contemporary movies with artistic ambition, for example, Lars von Trier's Antichrist (2009) or Nicolas Winding Refn's Valhalla Rising (2009).

80,FilmFlaneur,Spring Breakers not a broken film,7,26 June 2017,"The Spring Breakers, I have always felt, is fascinating since it is a shallow film - but where, as I see it, *shallowness itself* is the message and subject. In other words plenty of films prove shallow - something which, as we all know, is easy to do; this one shows vacuous culture and lifestyle, through processes of absurdity - think Franco on the bed with his firearms - no doubt aided by moments of improvisation, in a way that echoes the message. There's a human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and this film leaves the audience alone to find any, as we watch unique and bizarre individuals in a distinctly hollow subculture. By this director Harmony Konne, who also made Gummo and Kids , shows a world that is flashy and trivial (albeit with striking moments) through a crime drama with an over-the-type James Franco in party mood and, indeed, parties and party-folk everywhere. (A 'party' of course has more than one meaning) The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. Despite my above words, on the looking for meaning in his films Korine states, ""I think people will lose the film as soon as they start trying to figure out my logic or what I'm doing or while they're watching it start to dissect metaphors...

I thought this movie would be a nostalgic look into the modern equivalent of coming of age with these young kitty cats spreading their wings and discovering a little fun in the sun. I was wrong, yes it is about an adventure at the beach but includes some very illegal activities and some extremely bad decision making.

It's mostly chronological, but the way it skips around within the moments it is portraying makes the whole movie feel dreamlike. Whenever music kicks in, it feels more like you are watching a music video, or the trailer for a movie. This fluid way of presenting the story works quite well.It's also interesting how they chose the ""spring break"" setting, combined with the music video like editing. It makes the film look like something completely different than what it is, and I like that it breaks with expectations.Besides that, I don't have much positive to say about the movie. It seems like it's mostly made to be a visual experience, because both story are characters are not prioritized. The characters are hard to believe in, and the story itself matches the music video comparisons made before. Contrasting the naive and innocent, with the thrill seeking and outright horrible, is not enough to make it interesting on a story level. Putting two contrasts together is easy, but it's harder to make a tension between them that serves some other purpose than being unfamiliar or unexpected.If you can easily lose yourself into visuals, mood and sound, I'm sure this can be quite a film to experience.

84,backup-50362,What happens when a creepy director makes a movie out of a fetish.,1,18 April 2016,"It's appalling that James Franco chose to stoop so low and be part of this softcore porn fantasy ""movie"", though I'm sure ridiculous and unrealistic crap like this are ""oh so empowering to women"" and so feminists would like it and support it. That's sad. As this movie is an insult to both genders. And all movies. And story lines.There's not much to be said about the meaningless, simple plot which barely connects one creepy sexual fantasy with another, ""complimented"" by mediocre acting and minor children's celebrities.I guess never hearing about this movie until James Franco's Celebrity Roast speaks for itself. Instead of just making fun of how ridiculously stupid this movie is, they should have straight up warned people not to watch it. But sharing Franco's shame is more fun I would assume.Expected better from you, Franco. Don't let some creepy sweaty director involve you in his pathetic fantasies of putting ski masks on average chicks and sucking their guns, then getting killed in a rain of bullets which they magically survive, all of which extremely conveniently and unrealistically showing exactly what the director's into sexually. And it's sad, I didn't need to know all that weird stuff about some guy out there.Bottom line - don't look for dignity or logic in this movie, but if you're a woman with a weak ego and no respect for yourself or your gender (or a man in exactly the same spectrum of issues) - you might feel ""empowered"" I guess.

85,dvc5159,"""This is the American dream, right here""",8,4 April 2013,"Funny, I was the only one in the theater hall watching this. There were two people who entered late, but they left after about 10 minutes through. They were probably offended by what they saw, and I cannot blame them for that: Even the film's opening scene involves gratuitous shots of the female flesh for a lingering amount of time, dragging on until the scene transforms from glamorously into disgustingly perverted.If the film does indeed make you offended and shocked, then Harmony Korine's ""Spring Breakers"" has succeeded. Right after the opening scene we are introduced to four college girls desperate to have the ultimate Spring Break. One of them is devoutly religious and even thinks about the break as a lifelong goal and nirvana to attain. Two of them are downright sociopathic, and (in a beautifully shot scene) rob a diner to get the money needed for their trip. Beneath those gorgeous faces and bodies lie twisted, dark depths, but Korine shoots straight for the bottom, nearing depravity.After a series of lurid mishaps, the girls find themselves in the presence of rapper and criminal 'Alien', who takes over the scene once he enters it. This Alien, he's something. Making a name all by himself, living ""The American Dream"" his way (""Scarface"" is referenced to), trying to get his music career of the ground, getting at odds with his enemy, and enchanting most of the girls to his charm.I assure you, I found most of ""Spring Breakers"" to be disgusting, perverted, and gratuitous in its portrayal of women and the criminal lifestyle. The lurid cinematography, hyper editing, and music by both Cliff Martinez and Skrillex seem to make the experience feel like a psychotic party-goer's acid trip. Hell, the use of a Britney Spears song has a John Woo-like contrast to it.However, I'm not condemning the movie for it. This was what Korine intended, and he succeeded thoroughly. The film is a scathing attack on the American youth culture today. Korine's cohesive yet high-energy direction depicts an exaggerated ""American dream"" for the new generation, where their ultimate goal amounts to nothing more than endless nights of fun, partying, getting rich and getting made. More like the American nightmare. I can sense most older audience members hating this movie to shreds.The four girls and Alien showcase these through there Malick-like monologues interspersed between the mayhem. Call it pretentious, but I find it much better than leaving them as two-dimensional youths. In those aspects, James Franco and Selena Gomez are very good in their performances, and Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson completely shed their teeny-bop images to portray some of the most depraved youths I've seen in the movies in a while. Rachel Korine is alright but I sense it is just a chance for her husband the director to showcase his wife in a bout of nepotism. Still, her presence doesn't detract from the film.The film's ending, which seemed to good to be true, also brings up a similar discussion to the classic ""Taxi Driver"" - is it all real? Did everything happen in the movie, or is it one giant acid trip for one (or all) of the characters? Where does reality stop and (nightmarish) fantasy begin? I leave you to answer that.This film will probably be one of the most controversial and provocative films of the year. It's high and glamorized sexual and criminal content, coupled with hyper-kinetic camera-work, music, editing, and directing - will definitely turn some heads in the audience. But this film does indeed have something to say - about the American youth, about the American dream. And for some strange reason, the film may stay with you for a while. I know it has with me.P.S. Parents, no matter how big of a fan your child/teen is of Gomez, Hudgens, Benson and even Franco, DO NOT under any circumstances let them see this movie unless you feel that they are ready and prepared to handle this kind of content. You have been warned.",Spring Breakers

88,jackasstrange,Spring Breakers...,5,13 February 2014,"So, I finally watched the so-called Spring Breakers. Yeah, I was curious about this film. Firstly because of all the fuzz and controversy about it. Some saying it was the worst film that they ever saw, others claiming it being a masterpiece, so I wanted to know more about it, and secondly because of the cast being very peculiar. I mean, I've never seen Disney girls making some kind of 'art' stuff so I became really intrigued. And these two reasons lead me to watch Spring Breakers...Well, I can't say I am disappointed, since it wasn't a total waste of time, but is not really a good film either. It tries to challenge the viewer with an 'ugly' depiction of the parties world, but everything is just way too shallow. The character development is 'average', but it's impossible to have any intimacy with the characters on screen. I mean, I couldn't care less for them. Character is a enormously valuable aspect in any film, and in Spring Breakers these characters are weak.And yeah, whatever, the acting by Franco was good, but the constant messy editing barely makes anything noticeable or even coherent. There arw lots of cuts and voice overs that turns the film in an embarrassing mess. I liked the art direction though, some of the scenes were really impactive thanks to the exaggerated use of colors. I also liked the symbolism in the ending, but overall the film isn't really worth. There are films that treats about the same theme in a much efficient and clever way, so honestly, there is nothing interesting about Spring Breakers. 5.5/10",Spring Breakers
89,doug_park2001,"""Just f**n' pretend it's a video game!""",5,7 January 2014,"Some of the more positive reviews have praised SPRING BREAKERS for its brilliant and misunderstood nuances of plot and social satire, complex interrelationships between characters, and so on. Like many others, however, I just see it as a sleazy tale about a couple of psychopathic college girls who, while on Spring Break, chance to fall in with an obnoxious--and murderous--gangster, immediately becoming his groupie-cohorts. Despite their lack of experience as felons, they prove remarkably adept at armed robbery and automatic weapon-fights with hardened criminals. Really cheesy and unbelievable, one of those films that can't quite make up its mind how seriously it wants to be taken.As one or two others state, however, this film DOES do some interesting things with lighting, semi-animation, choreography, and that sort of thing, which helped keep my attention and is probably the only reason I made it all the way through SPRING BREAKERS. Even though they both play characters who don't contribute much to the storyline, Selena Gomez and Rachel Korine also give nice performances.Ah, well. There's definitely an audience for this sort of thing. Even if it's the stuff of fantasy, there's plenty of heart-pounding violence with a fair measure of sex and nudity thrown in.",Spring Breakers
90,shanayneigh,One for the spank bank,1,14 July 2013,"There's no good way to sum up the story as there isn't one to begin with. But is it a character driven piece then, you might ask? Well, the supposed characters' motivation is ""bikini"" and there isn't much development from there. Three of the girls are completely interchangeable party girls, and the fourth is a devout Christian named Faith - that's just how subtle this movie is.The movie goes out of its way to be edgy. Drugs! Violence! Nudity! Controversy!!! Of course, casting Disney pop tarts in the leads is a sly and surefire way to get some publicity (and, of course, the magic word controversy), and I imagine the Disney princesses are happy to do anything to break out of the mouse house fold.The visual aesthetic is quite tiresome. Hand-held camera, long lenses, every other shot is an ECU, non-linear editing. This movie couldn't be much more artsy fartsy if it even tried. (Well, perhaps if they skipped all the pastels and neons and shot it in black & white with the dialogue in Polish. But I don't want to give Harmony Korine any ideas.)Had this movie been made and shot in the exact same way by some other director, like a Brett Ratner, Michael Bay or Justin Lin, it would most likely have been slammed for being exploitative and the directors called dirty old men for letting the camera linger endlessly on the scantily bikini clad bodies of these Disney barely legals. But since this movie is made by Harmony Korine, it's critic proof.Some have talked about the ""social commentary"" supposedly hiding in this film. But when asked to specify exactly what they mean, they are dumbstruck. People who don't like this movie are supposedly too dumb to get it. I get it. Spring Breakers had as much social commentary as a Girls Gone Wild video, and it managed to be far less entertaining. This was one of the worst movies I have seen this year.",Spring Breakers
91,jackmeat,A music video turned to a movie...,4,11 August 2013,"I knew I was in trouble when the credits began. ""Girls Gone Wild"" is all this movie screams out, and that is about the extent of it. This movie caters to teens who believe that drinking, drugging and screwing are what life is all about(spring break forever). So after the boobs bouncing around wears off it attempts to have a plot in between music video cut scenes. That is all this was, a long-ass pathetic music video. Some really annoying chicks rob a restaurant for cash to go to spring break. So they go, party it up, get into trouble and get bailed out by some thug named ""Alien"". Yep, they somehow drugged James Franco in taking part in this movie. Granted, he was the only part worth seeing at all (you can get GGW movies at your leisure). Well, of course the spring break doesn't last forever as reality starts to creep in, and is shown off in a very anti- climactic ending. So there really isn't much to go into, just overall repetitive scenes and music. A lame attempt at drama here and there. 4.3/10(without Franco, much worse)",Spring Breakers
92,noahgibbobaker,"Not for everyone, but I loved it.",7,21 September 2020,"Spring breakers is my first taste of Harmony Korine and I can't wait to see more of his work. You won't get the same experience spring breakers provides from any other movie.I think this film has a lot of say about the superficial nature of the american dream and the United States as a whole. Alien is a representation of the american dream in a, not so subtle way. The american dream is, ""the ideal by which equality of opportunity is available to any American, allowing the highest aspirations and goals to be achieved"", it's all about working hard and most of all, being successful. Alien is successful and he does work hard but he is a criminal. it's like he says, he's a gangster, even though he is an awful person he is still a success in the eyes of the United States of America.The first half does not have a plot once the girls go on spring break, it is more about capturing the feeling of spring break, the drugs, the sex, the music, it captures the vibe of the situation perfectly. In New Zealand we don't have spring break, our equivalent is our end of year holiday, even though I don't have spring break it's the same thing so I can still judge whether the energy of the situation is captured well.During the second half of the movie, as the girls slowly leave spring break you slowly come to realise that such a superficial life can't last forever, spring break is not forever. No matter how bad you want to live that life in the end you will end up like Alien or Archie, two people who did live spring break forever could not sustain that lifestyle. They were living the most frivolous life possible, in other words, they were living the american dream. This is why Brit and Candy loved him, he was living the life that they want to live, they didn't see anything wrong with what he was doing because it was fun, they were always having a good time.My biggest complaint is that the characters are very weak, they get a small bit of character development but not enough for me to actually care about them at all. I think Alien was the best character, he was at least the most interesting.Technically there are a few problems like the editing, it was fantastic at times but there were some pretty major pacing issues going from high octane montages to slower paced dialogue scenes and back again. My two favourite technical elements were the lighting and the sound design. The lighting was really clever and different, again the dialogue scenes were not lit as well as some of the others but it was far from bad. The sound design was also brilliant, I loved the use of different noises when characters made certain actions. Without spoiling anything my favourite example of this was when Alien was talking about murdering, he abruptly moved his arms, as he moved his arms a gunshot sound played. This is also not the only example, it happens constantly and I think it's really neat and interesting.I'll keep this point short but the ending, visual, was really stupid. How did these girls learn to shoot so well and clear out so many people. it was dumb.Spring breakers is far from a perfect movie but I really enjoyed it. I'm happy Harmony Korine is making movies because I don't think there will be another filmmaker like him for a while. You should definitely watch this if you haven't. I'd say it's a must see, it's so out there.",Spring Breakers
93,ghost_dog86,"Sluts, Keg Stands and a Satirical Experiment",6,24 March 2013,"From the writer/director of ""Gummo"" comesFor many of you, that's probably all you needed to know in order to be dissuaded from seeing ""Spring Breakers"". That said, for as much as I hated EVERY SINGLE ONE of Harmony Korine's prior films, ""Spring Breakers"", starring James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and even Gucci Mane, while problematic, is more than just ex-Disney channel girls in bikinis or boobs for days. The story Korine attempts to tell actually has a lot of potential, in conjunction with some beautiful camera work and underscored with a fascinating script. It's just too bad that he almost ruins it, simply because he can't get out of his own way.The Story: ""Spring Breakers"" is a tale of two halves. In the first half, which belongs to Selena Gomez's character Faith, we get a story about four college girls whose goal is to have the most memorable spring break imaginable. This particular storyline is quite strong, with an interesting ""pure girl corrupted by the big city"" motif. But once James Franco's character Alien, a more thugged-out version of Kevin Federline takes the reins (about 45 minutes in) that particular storyline goes right out the window. The second half follows this white rap sensation, as he sets out to corrupt these girls (or maybe it's the other way around). But while the latter half of this film is forcibly injected with a shot of adrenaline, headlined by a larger than life performance from Franco, it unfortunately contains such flawed storytelling, that it all becomes a bit tiresome, repetitive and just downright weird; especially during a scene of simulated oral sex and a montage scored by James Franco singing a Britney Spears ballad, that is sure to have audiences snickering in disbelief. Here are a few more issues with this film: 1.And this is a problem which plagues almost all of Korine's past films. There is only about 30 minutes of actual plot here. Not to say that the 30 minutes isn't well thought out, but by default everything else comes off as an overlong, desensitizing music video montage, set to repeat. This aspect may be the most detrimental to the viewing experience because it causes a 94 minute film to seem like a 120 minutes, as ""Spring Breakers"" overstays its welcome.2.As I mentioned before, Korine has a nasty habit of not being able to get out of his own way. In the case of ""Spring Breakers"" this translates into Korine's Spike Lee-ish tendency to stop the progression of his story dead in its tracks, in order to make continuous points. This technique of pumping the breaks on a film to make a point about sexuality, or violence or violent sexuality, or sexuality in violence, completely takes audiences out of the film, and slowly mutilates the plot. In short, as Korine stops to make more and more visual points with extensive montages, the more audiences completely forget about the story itself.3.As creative as I thought this storyline to be, it still doesn't erase the fact that the situations and dialogues Korine creates are overwhelmingly exaggerated in order to make a point everyone in the audience should already be aware of. Example: In ""Gummo"" he makes his white trash characters extremely physically and emotionally filthy; or extremely white trash, and in ""Spring Breakers"" he makes his skanks skanky to the extreme, by putting them in constant states of undress, no matter what the situation. But we get it already! I don't need another boob montage.4.Being an admitted hater of the High-Defness in movies of today, when Korine makes a movie like ""Spring Breakers"", which, at times, looks like a big budget Michael Bay film, and uses Top 40 hits as his soundtrack, he is obviously trying to make a condescending point about beauty and the American culture of today. But to your average viewer who hasn't had the displeasure of sitting through ""Julien Donkey-Boy"" or ""Trash Humpers"", ""Spring Breakers"" may come across as uncomfortably free formed and simply too strange, with no context to pull from.The Acting: With all of its flaws, the acting from Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens was a high point within some of the messier portions of this film. But the real star of the show is Franco, in a performance which admittedly took me a few minutes to get into, but ends up as the best performance of his career; and maybe worth the price of admission alone.Final Thought: Writer/director Harmony Korine is essentially the creepy kid with the camera from ""American Beauty"". He claims to be attempting to find beauty amidst the filth of the world, but in reality he comes off as a provocateur/non-conformist, who seems to have a distain for the subjects in his films. And that all would be fine, if he just presented a coherent story, that wasn't disjointed with his form of ultra experimental filmmaking. With that said, ""Spring Breakers"" is Korine's most accessible film, with his most coherent (and deepest) storyline to date. So, while I thought a lot of this film was too over-the-top for its own good, there is stuff here that I liked very much; enough to recommend that people see this film, but only if you know what to expect.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

However, both those camps would be missing the wisdom that Korine is trying to impart.Spring Breakers was an infantile approach to screen writing and movie making. Within 15 minutes of the film, despite the massive amounts of bare breasted women, I wanted to leave the theater and ask for a refund.My gut reaction is just tell you this sucked. I had a few days to mull this one over though and the benefit of time is that it has allowed to appreciate the film a little bit more. I am definitely not suggesting that I thought this was good butIt does work on some levels. There are some scenes in this film that really impressed me. The long tracking shot of the robbery was great, and sequence where Franco is trying to seduce Gomez was so uncomfortable I was shifting in my seat. But then there are other parts that just don't work at all.

Four college age girls go on spring break and discover who they really are. The four girls are Faith, Cotty, Candy and Brit. Faith (Selena Gomez) is a girl with some Religious connection, who discovers she enjoys partying as much as any girl. However she draws the line when it comes to getting involved with a gangster. About half way through, she disappears from the rest of the movie.Cotty (Rachel Korine) has no problem with being gangster, but backs away from that lifestyle after getting shot in the arm and disappears from the movie.Two girls Candy and Brit (Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson) discover they are every bit as much a predator as their male counterpart Alien (James Franco). This story brought out through a series of shots that reveal that Director Harmony Korine has a style of movie making that best is described as different, with slow motion shots and stop action, using different types of film, foreshadowing and changing the time line, different views of the same activity, and an influx of color and repetition that are wellunique.Many of the reviews with higher ratings praise his style. All and all the movie is not an uplifting experience, but then again not every movie can be.There have been many reviews of this movie since, I wrote this one. I am adding a few comments to my review, to address some of the unfortunate critiques I am seeing. First of all a lot of people were disturbed by the movie, because it was not what they expected. These comments mostly focus on the second half of the movie. This is pretty understandable - I'm guessing they either expected a Disney comedy or Disney girls gone wild. It was advertised as a comedy with Disney girls, but it is far from a comedy. It is a dark and nasty movie about nasty, (some people might even say psychotic) female predators. As far as - Girls Gone Wild - not quite. Only the first 45 minutes can be considered Disney girls gone wild, then it becomes Disney girls gone Gangster! In the second half, two of the girls (Candy and Brit) show in numerous instances, that they have fallen in love with the power of a gun. They love to make people kneel before them, and tremble in fear. This is shown in one scene particularly well, when these two demonstrate armed robbery to the other two girls, interspersed with a second view of an earlier seen ""Chicken Shack"" restaurant robbery, that these two committed, except this time as we hear how excited this made the girls, we also see and hear the terror they girls revel in creating. This segment of the movie appears particularly disturbing and unrealistic to many. This part is constantly punctuated throughout by the sound of a gun cocking or shooting. Unrealistic, maybe, but its a movie, and stranger things have happened in movies. I found the sound of the gun cocking/shooting throughout this segment to make me aware, I was not watching pretty little Disney girls, or even Girls gone wild, rather, I was looking at dark minded, lady predators taking charge in an ugly reality. The only thing I found particularly unrealistic, was that Brit and Candy seemed to be capable of reading each others minds. They often seemed to communicate telepathically. I see comments here suggesting the girls are in a rape culture dominated by men. If you think this, you missed a major point in the movie. The girls definitely take charge after the first half of the movie and they are dominant over their male counterpart, Alien. If you disagree you should watch it again. People are saying the movie does not have a plot. This movie had a plot of two female predators going down a slippery slope and deep into crime. It also created two of the most shocking female characters ever on film. Just as an aside I have a sequel idea:""Spring Breakers 2 She Died For Nothing."" I wont go into it.",Spring Breakers
103,JPfanatic93,"Babes, bikinis, booze and death",7,23 September 2013,"Harmony Korine's provocative take on the death of the American Dream – or the exact opposite, its ultimate realization – follows a quartet of young college girls (including Harmony's wife Rachel) who will stop at nothing to celebrate Spring Break in Florida just to engage in endless mindless, decadent sex and drug use. Being penniless proves a bit of an obstacle at first, but their solution is as shocking as it is effective: just rob a restaurant, get in a car and don't look back. It's only the beginning of a nightmarish thrill ride into the mind of America's hedonistic youngsters who, despite being educated and full of opportunity, prefer to opt for the easy way out in order to live a careless/carefree life, even if only for a short while. Just when they're living their fantasy to the fullest, the police intervene and haul their asses to jail for abuse of illicit substances. Fortunately, a rapper/gangster/parasite called Alien (James Franco being quite the chameleon, to say the least!) bails them out and introduces them to his world of everything. Thanks to his wild and violent life style leeching off the American way of life, he has loads of guns, loads of dope and loads of sex to offer, which the girls accept all too eagerly. Except for the devout Christian of course, who decides to return home: quite the hypocrite, considering her religious values ought to have kept her from coming along for this ride in the first place, knowing full well what she got herself into but opting to look the other way for her own pleasure. The other girls have the time of their life for a while, until the situation turns dark when a rival mobster threatens Alien's turf. Soon however, it appears Alien got more than he bargained for when the remaining teens prove quite resilient in helping him deal with the aggressor in a surprisingly violent manner.Casting several former Disney Channel stars like Selena Gomez (Wizards of Waverly Place) and Vanessa Hudgens (High School Musical) was a brave and perfect choice, both underscoring the point Korine tries to make and allowing these girls to break completely with their 'sweet & innocent' stigma. People who expect lots of booze and boobs in an overly simplistic story get exactly what they expected, just handed in a different way than they would probably have liked, since Spring Breakers is not a simple exploitation flick, but a mesmerizing descent into madness rife with wildly divergent visual gimmicks and hallucinatory effects, making the audience less of a viewer and more of a participant. Korine's rebellious denial to uphold to cinematic conventions made distributors rather uneasy, since the expectations of mainstream teen drama mixed with evocative artsy display caused them, in their limited money driven line of thinking, to be unable to successfully classify this film. As a result, Spring Breakers witnessed a release in both multiplexes and art-house theaters, but failed to fully win over both audiences due to its rough, offbeat style and confronting thematic contents. Mission accomplished, Korine!",Spring Breakers
104,dharmendrasingh,Makes you want to be young again. Not.,5,11 May 2013,"Somewhere in Harmony Korine's tenuous tale of teenage angst there's a point. But for some reason all I seem to remember are all those slow-motion shots on a sun-kissed beach of rowdy teenagers, drunk and highout of their minds, acting up in nothing but their birthday suits. It's 'Kids' all over again. The film follows a fearsome feminine foursome on their mission to do whatever it takes to get enough money to enjoy spring break, that supposedly special time for American youths which sees them forget their studies to concentrate on the more important part of school life – getting absolutely wasted.Chubby-faced cherub Selena Gomez and voluptuous Vanessa Hudgens swap the Disney channel for the Adult one, as they prowl around half-naked with two other girls on the streets of Florida's neon night time. Cash strapped, they decide, inexplicably, to hold up a diner – with water pistols! They triumph in their daring raid but are quickly jailed for forgetting to remain inconspicuous. A gangster-rapper named Alien (James Franco) bails them out on the condition that they be his personal playthings. This is where the story gets carried away with itself. The girls' transition from independent women to teeny-bopping slaves is so sudden and incredulous that I felt cheated. Two girls become scared of Alien's violent, excessive world and decide to go home. The other two stay and become his bodyguards as well as lovers. Alien plans to takeover the Florida coast underworld but knows this will require killing his former boss (Gucci Mane). At this point the story dies and gives way to random horseplay, involving armed robberies, wanton murders and Alien wooing his two slave girls, in one example by singing a Britney Spears song. Other distractions include scene repetition, and Alien's incessant mouthing of 'spring break' in voice-over. Franco, buff and braided, gives a towering performance that excuses him for the shambles that was 'Oz'. It must have been a very difficult character to get right because of how idiosyncratic it is. Every bad choice could have led to disaster. Not sure he gets the accent totally right, though, unless 'y'all' is meant to come out as 'you all' in a Southern drawl.One pivotal scene instantly repelled me. Alien shows off his awesome arsenal in his beach house ('look at all ma she-at' he repeats) while the two girls feign interest. Suddenly they have him at gun point and force him to do what no man should have to do to his own gun. They scare him, ridicule him and take pleasure in doing so. But then there's more incredulity: they give up the act and allow themselves to be fondled by him. If the story had courage and respect for its feminist tone, it would have been much better to run with a story of how the two girls use Alien to live a life of excess and then turn against him at his most vulnerable moment. That would be a spring break to remember.",Spring Breakers
105,Perception_de_Ambiguity,Yolo,9,1 July 2013,"Instead of going the expected road of showing innocent girls who get so wasted and drugged up that things spiral out of control and they regret it, and they get into troubles that they CAN'T cover up from their parents and they all learn a lesson...well, instead of all that three of the four girls, while going to school and presumably having somewhat normal lives, aren't exactly average girls but criminals from the start.Not even the religious girl (Faith) really gets corrupted which would have been another predictable path the film could have taken, instead she's used to give us a different perspective in the film and maybe also as a reminder that even a person like that could get into this sort of thing because those girls are all looking for things (like an escape from normality) that religion can't give them, especially not young people who are still looking for themselves. I liked the casting of the religion teacher, that guy so obviously had a wild youth, and now the only thing hardcore about him is his Christian faith and his tattoos. He found his path. The Spring Break kids have yet to do that. My favorite aspect of the film was the stream of consciousness editing. Also it's well-acted for having mostly non-actors. *ironic remark* It's 'Spring BREAKERS' because they are destructive in order to find themselves. Their hedonistic trip is more about creation than it is about recreation. Creation in a distorted sense, that is. Hardcore spring breakers don't usually rob places and kill people so as I interpret it the film is about self-destruction that is externalized for dramatization's sake. And it's as extreme as it is to emphasize that you come out of Spring Break as a different person. As a better person? Not necessarily, but as a changed person that has seen and experienced new things that will stay with him or her forever. Isn't that what we often tell young people, at least the well-behaved ones? ""Enjoy life while you're still young, it's the best time of your life, after that it's only downhill, you'll regret it if you don't enjoy your youth to the fullest, etc."" One thing Korine forgot to add in all this was ""YOLO"". What a missed opportunity (to date the movie even more). Hence why I can't give it the top score. But I suppose from now on ""SPRING BREAK FOREVA"" is the new ""YOLO"" anyway.",Spring Breakers
106,MovieProductions,A surprisingly complex and hedonistic thrill ride,6,26 October 2013,"**1/2 out of (****)- FRESHSporting its T&A as proud as a high school diploma, the scantily-clad beauties venture off to their neon-infused Candyland from Hell in the bombastic ""Spring Breakers"". If one were to just take a glance at the posters or the commercials for this movie, it would garner a lot of groans. Another teen sex romp? It's unfortunate this didn't draw in the movie it should've, because if you scoffed at what you thought Breakers was going to sell you, it did it's job. Because this isn't the movie your expecting. At all.The movie opens with a typical Eurotrip-like crowd pleaser. Plethora of boobs, loud party music, visceral beach shots, etc. It's all there. Soon enough, when the scenes are darker (both figuratively and aesthetically), that's when you know you walked into the wrong movie. What I found interesting about Spring Breakers was actually its cinematography. It's like Putting Edge (a neon mini golf facility) splashed onto a movie. If ever your mind drifts from the movie, you still are awe-inspired by the visual aspect of the film.What I liked about Breakers that few movies do right is how you actually feel like your on a ride. Most films try to emulate the experience, but it's stuck in that Hollywood gloss. Fortunately, Harmony Korine's art form drowns his movie out with a euphoric soundtrack, Enter the Void's the hell out of the movie, and gives our characters this odd, dream-like approach. And he takes it a notch further by building this obscene tone and atmosphere.I also think that this movie is highly controversial. I applied the later party shots, depicting the true brutality of parties like this, the over-the-top level of nudity, the debauchery, etc. There's also a saucy pool threesome tossed in for good measure. What might take you out of Korine's tour-de-force is the lack of story. For a movie with a striking tone, a precise direction, and a lot more going for it, a script is one it lacks. But with such an abstract movie like Breakers, a story isn't going to be your biggest issue. My last complaint is how it's not too coherent. It's like Korine wants to enhance this level of madness/insanity you feel watching it by making a very off-the-wall pacing and throwing a lot of rough cuts at you. This leaves you perplexed in places where you really shouldn't feel that way.Breakers is a mostly hit-and-miss affair, but I enjoyed it greatly. You'd think with a ""6"", I didn't care for it much, but it's a high one. When most films concentrate on a story or its characters, Breakers does something new. It concentrates on the tone/atmosphere and in the end, you're rewarded with a unique experience. It might also be one of the most well shot and interestingly directed films you're likely to see this year. Critics or fans may be divided, but I thought Spring Breakers was a good movie.",Spring Breakers
107,themissingpatient,Terrence Malick's Girls Gone Wild,7,19 July 2013,"Faith, played by Selema Gomez, and her three very close friends plan to escape their boring college dorm lives to attend a massive Spring Break party. In order to pay for their getaway, her three friends commit an unthinkable act of terror. Their Spring Break vacation turns out to be a non-stop party of drunken drug use and sexual perversion that lands them in prison. This is when Alien, played by James Franco, bails them out and a new type of party begins.With a dub-step softcore porn music video opening sequence, it is uncertain if Spring Breakers is glorifying the demoralizing activities portrayed or if it is a satire. Even when the film is not flashing to what looks like stock footage of a Girls Gone Wild Spring Break special and we are with the girls, the framing seems to have been done by a sex addict. This will be one of the most uncomfortable experiences Selema Gomez's fans will ever experience. For parents, this will be an absolute nightmare. Younger male audiences, on the other hand, will think they've found their new favorite movie. When the girls are introduced to Alien the film feels like it gets a new director. The feeling of a Girls Gone Wild narrative feature film is lost and we are filled with a great sense of dread. Who is this guy who calls himself Alien? We even find ourselves afraid to find out what he has planned for these young girls he has bailed out of prison.As we continue through the second half of the film, it becomes very clear that we are in fact watching a satire. A horrific and effective satire. This is done though exposing the character of Alien and much credit must be given to James Franco, this is him at his best. Through the course of the film we go from fearing him, to laughing at him, to feeling sorry for him. The film is worth watching just for Franco's performance. The girls do an excellent job as well. These are easily two of the most frightening female characters ever put on-screen.Spring Breakers is written and directed by Harmony Korine, the writer of Kids and director of Gummo. If you've seen anything he has written or directed you already know what you are in for. It has the core of a Natural Born Killers story wrapped in layers of what would be if Terrence Malick directed Girls Gone Wild. What ends up becoming an annoying distraction is the repetition of dialogue we hear over and over again, playing in a loop. It's understood we are in the girl's shoes, things are spiraling out of control and the editing helps get that across. Some of it works but in the end, we've heard the same things so many times it is as if Korine is hammering the message of his satire into our heads, almost desperate to prove it has a point. Through the story it's meaning is made clear, no reason to over-use certain Malick-like editing techniques to over-state what the story has already made obvious.The core story is genius. The way in which the story is told is split between things that play out like a master at work and a new filmmaker still experimenting.",Spring Breakers

109,lovintennis,Kinda...,5,4 August 2017,"I didn't know anything about this one when I watched it (not any actors/actresses, not the plot, nothing). This is the hottest/sexiest movie I think I've ever seen.Here's my criticism: For starters, when the four babes got thrown in jail, I knew they wouldn't be in there for long. I rolled my eyes and muttered, ""They'll get out."" Specifically as they stood before the judge in their swimsuits, I knew they'd specifically get bailed out by some rich dude who's probably drooling over them. The camera eventually, slowly, drifted back into the courtroom's audience and I said, ""See? Here we go; who's it gonna be?"" It settled on James Franco and I said, ""Him."" What I'm getting at is that I saw all of that from a mile away. Very predictable.Secondly, at the end, how does the first bullet peg James Franco right in the forehead for a perfect fatal shot and not one bullet thereafter, out of the tens and tens fired at the two surviving babes from various angles, hits the broad side of a barn? I understand their friend group practiced becoming hardcore gangsta b----es, but come on, they didn't go through any kind of training or target practice to be able to dodge all that crap and blow away an entire property of thugs with machine guns.Also, this is the third pimp movie, specifically with a sex sandwich by two babes, I've seen (Wild Things and Alpha Dog before this one) that ends with the pimp meeting his final destination at the end.",Spring Breakers

He's almost as bad as his dorky brother Dave. Every time I see James Franco I wish that he'd be replaced by a great actor like Vincent Gallo. Franco essentially plays the personification of the white stereotype of blackness. He looks dumber than ever with cornrows and that grill. If Harmony had half a brain and wasn't so trained in on a stereotype rather than a rich culture, he would have had the Gucci Man play that role. I was generous enough to give this 1 star because it is an accurate representation of the lemming-like mentality of spring breakers. The girls can't act a lick, but at least they are hot.

He probably wrote it when high but the real beauty is that the entire sensibility is captured beautifully. The character actions and motivations too are influenced by the drug it seems.

The sprinkling of sexual assault is difficult to swallow, but you'll get over it quickly.The narrative is excellent. It goes unexpected places, and I really enjoy the ending.It's a rather diverse and powerful cast, with James Franco at the helm as Alien.Okay, so here's the thing.Harmony Korine has directed, in the past, what most would consider 'poor' films. I've heard tell of Trash Humpers, and honestly will never see an entry from his early movie-making career.But Spring Breakers, at the very least, is a good movie and I've only heard it mentioned in a derogatory fashion. Particularly in reference to the female cast; about how they didn't know what they were getting into, and blindly trust Harmony.Vanessa Hudgens as Candy, Ashley Benson as Brit and Rachel Korine (Harmony's wife!) as Cotty turn in really excellent performances for difficult roles. And they deserve more credit than they've gotten.Selena Gomez as Faith is easily the least effective in her acting performance. But I don't remember her being particularly bad; just muted and withdrawn, giving 65% and mailing-it-in.Mr. Franco is really a sight to behold. He also delivers a terrific performance as Alien.At one point he swoons the four shotgun-toting ladies (dressed in pink ski masks) with a Britney Spears cover on the white piano beside his outdoor pool.And do you know what? I actually care about his character a little bit in the end. James brings the pathos!This Franco fellow's got numerous tricks up his sleeve. He's great in This is the End from last year as well. Good on ya, James!As for the ending, I appreciate it. It's a bit of an anticlimax but that's alright. It's rather satisfactory in its realism. In fact, the events that follow the climactic moment seem like such a fantasy; perhaps Mr. Korine is drawing a dichotomy here?Do you see what I mean, my Proverbial Audience?Each girl is subtly infatuated with a form of deviancy. One likes guns, one likes intoxication, one likes sex, and Selena Gomez likes moping.The chick that digs firearms fills a water pistol with vodka and squirts it into her mouth. There's subtle stuff going on here!The ending is such a great cap on this film full of debauchery, violence and deviancy.What Ol' Harmony appears to be suggesting is that even after it all unfolds, the two girls will return home to their normal family lives and never tell anyone what happened.That during this window of disconnection, these girls can get away with murder and climb back in without anyone the wiser.It's powerful stuff, man.Kidding, but it's definitely thought provoking.Anyway, if you're a sucker for thought provocation, and you're a young adult, you might appreciate Spring Breakers as much as I did.",Spring Breakers

It's a weird little slice of American hedonism wrapped in an (at times) aestheticly pleasing package. That being said, the plot hardly exists. The characters mainly do drugs and have sex, and that's about it. Nobody puts on an outstanding performance, but James Franco is the highlight. He plays a decent caricature of a drug-dealing rapper. This character is a wholesale ripoff of the image and persona of a real rapper by the name of Riff Raff, and I found myself wishing the role was played by the man himself. Gucci Mane puts on an interesting performance as the film's short-lived antagonist.I really don't know what to say. This film could have been great. I like how unashamed it is in its mantra of style over substance, but it has such little substance or originality that it remains unmemorable. I think the ending sequence is an appropriately ridiculous ending for a ridiculous movie. It's kind of a stupid movie, but I don't think it's for stupid people. I don't know. I enjoyed it.(I've heard people say it's supposed to be a brilliantly self-aware, disposable piece of entertainment. How it's supposed to be a commentary on the impermanence of pop culture, and the degenerate lifestyles pursued by hedonistic youth. However, I didn't get that impression as I watched the movie.

Franco is fully invested and provides momentary flashes of low comedic hilarity while also imbuing the character of Alien with well considered touches of pathetic interest. Still, the film as a whole is slight- entertaining but insubstantial, energetic but flabby and the slick surface camouflages the stolid morality of this music video cum generational commentary.

And it was kind of that, but far more different and dizzingly interesting. Most of the film feels like a wild , intoxicating night and a cash-grap videoclip of a rapper. It is so extreme and stylisticly inconsistent that it is of no surprise that it got pretty mixed reviews. Although it s at times dizzy and just does whatever it wants with its characters and at others a clever, let-loose satire about the American Dream, it is for sure an experience.The film has this ""loss of innocence"" vibe and it the cast really supports that feeling. The actresses are all Disney girls and they a pretty good job with their performances, though they were kind of annoying while they where crying.
It is a film that does not know excactly what it wants to be or say. It is for sure bold and risky and sexy and colourful and works as a satirical illustration of those who dream so big and fall so down,a weird song made for the American Nation and for the so-called ""American Dream"".It often gets lost and they repat a lot of the dialogue and I am sure that Korine should have been high for the most of the filming process.
James Franco was probably the best part of the film. He was fun and got in the role of a ""successful"" American gangster. You was really entertaining, y'all.The cinematography was also well-done, except for a couple of distracting moments. Oh, and the ""Everytime"" scene was perfect.In the end I am sill not sure about this film.

It wasn't made for the purpose of telling a cautionary tale, but to inform. Does that make it a documentary? Maybe. It is so divisive because of it's style and topic. I love the juxtaposition between the clean cinematography and bright colours that show the darkest, most disgusting of tales. The reason this is a 7/10 for me is that I don't see myself rewatching it for a while. It is headache inducing. It is messy (intentionally), but sometimes it does feel like it is trying to disorient the viewer, which I am personally not a huge fan of. Also, the acting is fantastic, James Franco is hypnotising as Alien, and Selena Gomez stands out with a lot of depth. It is a shame that she left early, but it fits the weariness her character felt. Overall this is not for many, its hard to watch. When you get it, you like it a lot.",Spring Breakers

It's Spring Break, these four girls are hot,sexy, eye-candy girls that are willing to do anything to party all day and night but, during Spring Break they end up in a nightmare of drugs and violence.Their's always repeating this phase that goes on throughout the movie and a scenes that just go on and on as well to give a message. Well right away you see a bunch of people partying out in the beach doing crazy things showing off a lot of nudity like so much of it. It makes it realistic so its believable that your seeing the world of what goes on in Spring Break. The visuals are fantastic with the neon colors seeing the locations from the beach to the streets in Florida. As for the story, it can be pretty surprising since you don't know what to expect so that's what I like about it. As for James Franco, he was over the top awesome giving out a good performance I didn't know he could do.

She ended up hating it and I thought it was great - go figure. She said I liked it because of the T&A but that had nothing to do with my thumbs-up (no pun intended). The nudity was stylistically what one would expect at Spring Break in Florida. The story of the 4 college girls and their real and metaphorical journey to Spring Break was what really hooked me. I have to hand it to Harmony Korine for not delivering what was expected in many scenes. A typical American movie usually takes the viewer down very, very well worn paths, SB'ers avoids this. I have to hand it to all of the main actors for their roles as friends and later as comrades in crime. Franco really nails his character (Alien) who I still can't wrap my mind around. All I can say is the images from this will stay with you and the uneven direction, sometimes murky story are a small price to pay. I recommend you see it in the cinema or on DVD.

There is virtually no story, awful dialogue & really uninteresting characters you don't really care about because the actors just aren't very good (with James Franco being the exception). He's the lone bright spot of the film. He's fairly convincing and hilarious in the film, intentionally so I believe. Some aspects of the film are so repetitive the ""Spring Break"" narrative becomes tiresome. I think there's actually some interesting commentary here on loose morals and the indifference of American youth, but it just gets lost in an endless stream of bikinis, gyrating butts and boobs.

I think he's always been over rated. Who would want this grungy thing next t them with a camera running for posterity. It's embarrassing. Franco has played this type of loser druggie so many times he could, as they say, phone it in. When will directors just tell this guy to look elsewhere? And yes, he takes his clothes off.

The trailer used a few key shots from the film to lure a very specific target audience intp believing that this is a product they want to consume: an action movie with loads of guns, dope, titties, and booze.Instead, Spring Breakers offers something even more pathetic than its actual promise : through a totally derogatory process, it gives an entire generation of viewers an overdose of all the most pathetic clichés they've learned to worship.It's very effective in a sense, but painful to watch, as it does nothing but expose its own rubbish emotions, characters, and questionable morals. As if this was a big joke, but purposely unfunny, awkward, and sickening. You can almost hear Korine laughing and whispering : ""Gotcha!"".Several people left the theatre before the credits rolled. And that's understandable with such an approach. ""Spring Breakers"" may be conceptually too hermetic in its approach to really reach out to its target audience.I don't mean to compare this film to any of the following, but if you look at ""The Truman Show"", ""Fight Club"", ""Brazil"", among many others, they managed to pass their message, criticize very precise aspects of modern society through solid narrative structures while offering a ""real"" movie experience, an actual vehicle carrying all these different thoughts and observations that the viewer may hop on.""Spring Breakers"" lets its own emptiness carry the ball. It's innovative, without a doubt, but innovative doesn't always mean good, or watchable.This probably had the YOLO generation go ""WTF"", to speak their language.

134,mistabobdobolina,Aims for scathing critique... and falls short.,5,24 August 2013,"Spring Breakers is packed with ideas that look good on paper but turn out not to work very well in practice. With some of them it's just a matter of overuse or poor execution -- with others it's a question of just missing the mark altogether.So, for example, we have: *Overdosing with images of skeevy, uncomfortable Girls Gone Wild-style debauchery.* These, along with the accompanying over-the-top more-vapid-than-the-real-thing dialogue from our starring ""Spring Breakers,"" are meant to function as part of the film's ""critique"" of corporate media and youth culture. Except: the fact that they're really not all that different from the actual GGW footage on which they're based means that the futility of this kind of ""critique"" is already established; you can't use sarcasm or irony to shame a culture that doesn't really grasp or care about either (and if the point of critique *is* its own hopelessness, which is entirely possible, then Korine is trying to be too clever by half and needs to just try something else).*(Slightly) nonlinear editing and the use of repetition.* The editing is just nonlinear enough to suggest a trip or two to the art-house, but not nonlinear enough to be actually playing with the idea of narrative: it feels more like affectation than anything else. Yes, some of the uses of repeated dialogue and their juxtaposition with different material verge on the interesting... except that the ""different material"" gets sillier the longer the film goes, which robs this tactic of any potential force.*Is it hallucination or reality... and why should we care?* If the film is meant to take place in a realistic universe, it should have gone differently right from the part where a pair of 90-pound coeds try to rob a restaurant using a hammer and a toy gun, since it is spectacularly unlikely that someone in that situation doesn't call their bluff. Even if we grit our teeth and let that go as ""realism,"" as the cinema verite style it's filmed in seems to want us to, surely the same can't be managed with a final shootout that has a pair of bikini-clad college girls casually blowing away a crew of hardened gangsters. On the other hand, if we take a cue from Alien's line ""it seems like a dream"" that kicks off that final shootout and regard everything afterwards as wish-fulfilment in the style of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, then it makes for pretty dull fare as wish fulfilment. It works in the end neither as a gritty crime drama nor as a hallucinatory commentary on America's nihilistic excess.Worse is that what the film winds up delivering in the final analysis is a Slumming-From-the-Land-of-(Mostly)-White-Privilege tale, none of whose protagonists suffer any really lasting consequence or harm from the choices they make. Just as whatever ""critique"" the film was trying to make of hedonism is quickly lost in the shuffle, so to whatever ""critique"" it was attempting of its characters' world view is undermined by this. Franco does some interested work, but overall I wouldn't rate this movie a success.",Spring Breakers

The story gets across but it could've been told more straight forward. Instead we get this long loopy line of a plot that bends in many different ways and it ultimately lost most of my interest. Saying that, I still found it an entertaining watch. The movie is dark, mysterious, and sexual and those themes did their parts well. It was mixed in nicely. There were a few surprise plot twists that made me watch to the end. There is a message in this movie and it gets across but it's as if Piccaso directed this movie because it feels like one confusing art feature.I was entertained, at times.

136,toonyjakes,"""This wasn't supposed to happen.""",4,16 August 2018,"Spring Breakers looks dope at a glance. You've got a great cast, and interesting director/writer, and the trailer was awesome. This movie ends up losing all of its potential within it's redundant, self absorbed ideals.Plot- 4 college skanks plan to go on spring break. But it gets stupid immediately, seeing as they've collectively only saved 300 something dollars from the whole year. So, they rob a store, party in Florida, and get arrested. For some reason, a gangster/rapper (played by Franco) ends up at their trial, wants them as his little crew, and bails them out. After that, nothing but disappointment. You find out what he really wants them to do and it's just stupid and not exciting. The ending is garbage, a cutoff scene. Characters/Writing- The dialogue is so loopy and weird in stride with the characters and their circumstances. You'll often be like ""are the girls all high on ecstasy?"" Or mimicking the dumb lines they repeat ""spring break.....spring breaaakk"" it's just not captivating. The characters themselves serve as nothing but emphasis on being a careless slut. Critics may claim it speaks for the generation, but it only wrings out every last drop of excess in all forms to try to prove something. Not sure what that even is. Acting- The acting is not bad at all, the actors are just being pulled by extremely weird dialogue, weird scenarios, and pointless scenes displaying their slutty ignorance. I'm not against portraying things honestly but you wont have fun watching these girls banter and lollygag. Quality- One fantastic thing about this film is the editing, the style, the cinematography. It looks gorgeous and quite literally feels like a dream. The part when they rob the store is filmed in one take and is really cool to watch. Overall I'd say if you're into unconventional movies and often create meaning out of dirt, this is for you. I tried to watch it twice and cut it off the second time. It looks beautiful and has such a convincing style that you'll probably watch it all regardless of your intolerance. If there was a juicier story, with less oddball scenes and more characteristic dialogue, I'd say watch it.",Spring Breakers

139,giantpanther,James Franco saves this film from being bad,5,29 March 2013,"I think this film was given the greenlight because it was going to be called ""Spring Breakers"" and it would have Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, and James Franco in it and ultimately they knew they could bring in some of their fan base to this very odd art film because they wouldn't know Harmony Korine. On that business level I respect the people who funded this, knowing it would at least bring back its 5 million dollar budget, and who knows maybe it would turn a profit which I think it has to a degree.I have always wanted to like Korine's films, and Harmony himself is usually pretty funny, just youtube any interview he's ever done but his films never manage in my opinion to be anything other than just different. Now in this cinematic landscape some people are so hungry for different that they immediately equate different to genius but thats not the case. So yes Korine's films aren't normal but you also can never get attached to any of the characters or interested in the plot because there rarely ever is one.Here's what I thought Spring Breakers was about - four girls go partying, get arrested, Franco's character bails them out and in return requests that they help him do some robberies / illegal drug stuff. In actuality it was that formula except when Franco bails them out he tells them they can leave or stay with him, or do whatever they want. But thats the whole premise, not much plot beyond that, oh yea and three of the four girls violently rob a place to get money for spring break. Although with a film like this plot is secondary if that.Whats most important for Korine is interesting images, which this film is actually oddly short on, everything becomes pretty redundant, neon lights, cameras that are far too close up for you to get any concept of space which maybe was their intention but still. Regular camera shots mixed with low grade cameras.This would have been a much better film if Korine had just reined it in a little bit and allowed for the audience to know anything about the female characters. Until Franco's character shows up I had a few thoughts that maybe this was going to actually be a horrible movie, once Franco is there you have at least one rounded strange character you can understand. And Franco has a great time hamming it up, but it isn't just that he actually delivers a really great performance. For his role as Al / Alien almost any actor could have taken it on and delivered enough to allow the film to be but Franco adds a lot more to this role than anyone else would have which I found to be impressive.Now as for the nudity, yes this film has lots of it, but of the four girls only Rachel Korine has some nude scenes. Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson have a few implied nude scenes, and Selena Gomez has none. But this film still has lots of nudity because of strip clubs, and various other scenes with random women. Most of the nudity is from women who have no lines in the film and are just there. Having said all of that I don't think I've ever seen a film where the nudity was less played up, like made to sort of entice or seduce the audience, all of the nudity here is just sort of very very un-erotic, like its just sort of there, which maybe was the point, although I think a lot of it had to do with the odd camera angles involved, neon lights etc. Not that I really care, its just people will be curious about this aspect of the film.Ultimately I think Korine wanted to have an excuse to party at spring break, which I think he has owned up to in interviews and so this movie is a product of that. I gave it 5/10 its not really bad or good, nor would I recommend it to people or persuade them not to see it, its just something to check out at some point. I paid 10 bucks to see it in the theater, probably should have waited for video or to see it at a discount theater but oh well.",Spring Breakers
140,Dfschohr-532-549658,Spring Breakers Review,10,22 October 2013,"Having been a Harmony Korine fan since discovering his audacious brilliance in his directorial debut of Gummo, seeing the trailer for Spring Breakers gave my spine a rush of chills, because I know anything in the hands of Korine could be nothing short of original, and something that everyone will be buzzing about, whether you loved the film or not. This is a first time for Korine directing a film with such a pop-culture and star studded cast, but it wouldn't have worked any other way. Having never seen anything that the female leads had previously done, just knowing their reputation in the ""Hollywood"" limelight, played to my advantage in a great way. The religious, wannabe bad girl Faith (Selena Gomez) is the pure hearted one, who is trying to find herself amongst her religious peers, so she rebels by hanging with Brit (Ashley Benson), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) and Cotty (Rachel Korine), girls who are comfortable with their sexuality, and are not afraid to show or express it, they are even willing to rob a local restaurant for the extra cash they need to make it to Spring Break. All of the girls played their parts with perfection. Ashley Benson was phenomenal, having the sweet, girl next door persona, but secretly has a dark side. Vanessa Hudgens sticks to her guns as the more disobedient, and naughtiest one of the wild bunch. Rachel Korine triumphs on the big screen. Working in the environment they did, having Harmony Korine throw the girls into unpredictable situations at real spring break parties. You can tell Rachel Korine had a motherly role on set, being the slightly older one of the bunch.James Franco electrifies as Alien, a sleazy gun/drug dealer and gangster rapper. The role is haunting and unsettling to watch in moments of him being the worlds biggest creeper. Franco steals the show from everyone, and its all done in one scene, where Alien rambles on and on about all the cool stuff, and different colored clothes he has. It's nothing short of brilliant.Overall Spring Breakers is a heavily candy-colored coded pop song that plays select dialogue in recorded loops, just like a hook or a chorus. You can tell that Korine does that repetitive dialogue along with striking visuals to hammer certain emotions, and ideas to embedded them in your brain kind of like a modern day pop song from Rihanna. All I can say is that when I walked out of the theater, I kept saying Spring Break, Spring Break, Spring Break Forever. Well done Harmony Korine. Spring Breakers is a film for the generation and it is my favorite film of the year. I give Spring Breakers a 10 out of 10",Spring Breakers

It looked good and had a cool soundtrack. James Franco acted well, but it's just a stupid awful film. Was it really worth murdering people and dealing with the scum of the earth so that these college girls could travel and see something new? No. This was a terrible concept. We never got to know any of the characters. If this had been directed by a no name director, everyone would have said it was a disaster, but because Harmony's name is attached to it, many people think it's brilliant. It had very little substance. It doesn't challenge the audience at all. If this is the way films are headed, I think I'll stop watching films. I could go on and on because all I have are criticisms.

142,dsa_ca,It's good to go away from reality to find you are dumb!,4,8 April 2013,"During the final reel of this supposedly masterful observation about the degradation of American culture, Ashley Benson's character 'Brit' calls up her mother to assure her that she is fine and has had a wonderful experience in which she discovered herself. She explains that her experiences during Spring Break in Florida enabled her to discover herself and was glad that she was away from reality. I do not know about Brit but in reality everyone goes on a spring break to have a good time. How miserable your life has to be to find enlightenment on a spring break. Reality in this dull piece of film making, story is very thin. The director was definitely away from reality. He just forgot he was supposed to tell a story. The 95 minutes of runtime feels bloated with misogyny and the director would have served better if he had made a short film.Let's get to the myths surrounding this movie. First of all there is no observation of any kind regarding any culture. Each and every culture has gangsters and thieves in a large party town. Each year college students from across America go to beach-side areas at the advent of spring coinciding with a certain one week college breaks between the semesters. They go to party and try to have a great time before the business end of their college semesters. No one is going there to look out for danger nor anyone is turned on by guns and gangsters. There is definitely a large amount of activity that is considered immoral. But that is easy target if the director wants to say it is a slippery slope. We all have seen what spring break down in Florida is and are aware what goes on over there. But still the director and James Franco insist the movie to be culturally important for this generation with new age story telling method that is an inspiration to new film makers. I am praying for next generation of audience if this is what we are served as culture examination because this movie reminded me of those B grade movies like Wild Orchid that had stories situated at places with loose morals. What did the director achieved by showing topless girls again and again getting drunk and forced to get drunk other than enforcing a cultural stereotype. Showing those images over and over with interjecting storyline about four small town girls creates a perverted image that girls ask to be exploited. And those small town girls are frustrated with their quiet life and have some immature fantasy about an exciting life. It is supposed to be comedy but becomes a very dark exploitative movie. The male counterpart to these college going spring breakers are missing and are portrayed by extras who are enjoying and having good time next to submissive girls. Any stories about male college student's behavior in Hollywood are always frat boy comedies in which boys will be boys image is enforced to laugh off their antics. But over here boys are the victims of robbery by these girls who are constantly mentioned as bitches. The countless images of female body flesh and drugs along with showing the girls take a leak on the street with gleeful excitement was anything but mature filmmaking. If the director's argument is such kind of behavior is common hence have to be shown then at least revolve it around a story. Audience has not come over to witness exhibitionist dumb behavior with James Franco's character 'Alien' constantly whispering 'Spriing break y'll'. How irritating James Franco has become after everyone thoroughly enjoyed '127 hours'!The reality is every kind of perversion trick was used. The stunt casting of Disney darlings Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens to piggy back movie's publicity on their popularity was ill conceived. Due to their pop culture image the antics of their characters definitely came off as dumb and they fail to shore up any audience interest or sympathy (if they needed any) for their characters. The exploits of these female characters by being submissive and naive in male dominated world does not require deep observation to conclude this movie being director's male fantasy. But in between the audience end up with four dumb characters who decide whether to stay in a certain situation or not only if they are physically threatened or shot. Until then they think a breaded and tattooed guy named alien talking about rape and gang bang is perfectly fine gentleman to hang out with.",Spring Breakers

But that's just the beginning. During a party night the girls are arrested with drug charges. Hungover and dressed just with their bikinis, they see a judge, but they are unexpectedly liberated by Alien (James Franco), a rare local thug which takes the girls to his home and they have the craziest spring vacations of their lives. All the girls are very happy with him, except one girl called ""Faith"" (Selena Gomez) she does not trust in Alien at all.This movie wasn't as good as I thought. The first half was quite enjoyable and crazy, but the second half is darker, slow and violent. Also, the last 30 minutes of the movie were very awkward to watch. Moving on, all the choices and decisions of the characters in Spring Breakers felt genuine, but there was not enough plot in the film; it was boring and uninteresting to me. You don't care about the characters, because most of them are stupid and annoying. I also want to add that since the departure of Gomez in the second half of the movie, the film became in a disgusting pornographic mess, filled with bizarre sex scenes and repetitive dialog.On the upside, the whole cast did a great job. James Franco's performance was astonishing, he nailed it. However, Spring Breakers is basically 94 minutes of strange pornography to me. Yes, I enjoyed some moments of this pornographic mess, the first act is somewhat enjoyable and funny at times, but most of the movie is just uncomfortable. Maybe you will enjoy it more, I don't know. If you like movies about drugs, teenagers acting like prostitutes, guns and sex, Spring Breakers is your best choice. If you expect an entertaining film about some likable girls in their vacations, you'll be disappointed. This is just a strange crime flick.It has a well-known cast. Vanessa Hudgens was good, but her character was unlikable and dull. Seriously, watching the film I was like... who cares about this whore? Nobody! Also, she just said two lines in the whole movie. Good job, screenwriter! Another one is Ashley Benson, she's beautiful, what else can I say? Well... at least her role was a little bit more interesting. Another girl is performed by Rachel Korine. I think that Rachel is way too old for her character, and she was actually the only one who showed her breasts. Finally, the most decent character and the most engaging performance was Faith (Selena Gomez), she was smart and believable.It's a slow film that boasts an original plot, a talented cast and a bunch of crazy moments. My favorite moment in the movie was a scene between Selena Gomez and James Franco, their performances were excellent. The message of the film is also very thought-provoking and sincere. It shows how some teens just want to have fun, no matter what. In conclusion, most of Spring Breakers is odd and boring, but I still recommend it if you like movies about parties, guns, sex and drug dealers. Do not see it if you expect lots of entertainment or friendly characters. It is just a movie about promiscuous teenagers. The ending was quite good though. (C+)",Spring Breakers

Does that sound like the plot of an interesting movie? If the answer is no you're right. What a complete mess and waste of time. This movie starts with some potential but the story becomes so bad that it crumbles on its own pile of nonsense. There is a fourth girl in the group (probably the only believable character in the movie) but she's totally irrelevant because she is nothing like the other three. They three most ruthless girls of their generation also meet a gang member who deals drugs and weapons but they are even more badass than him. Damn they're even more badass than his rival gang, they kill everyone with their unbelievable super skills. But no worries, they are also searching for spiritual truth and to become better people, that's why the went on spring break vacation to dance with their boobs bouncing around doused in alcohol.

Probably more like 5, combined. It's almost like an R-rated music video.. a terrible, unrealistic, over-the-top music video.I could only get through the first 35 minutes, and even then, I skipped ahead a bunch of times to see if there was a real movie here. I never found one. I couldn't bear to give this another 40 minutes(after credits and such, that's all there is).The really sad thing is that I've been to Marti Gras, Daytona for spring break, frat parties and 4 different colleges (visiting friends and my own school), Vegas twice, many ""drunk"" cruises, Caribbean islands, nude beaches, about 8 different countries, etc, and I have yet to see ANY party like the ones portrayed continuously in this movie. Marti Gras didn't even get to this level of insanity.I kept asking, where are the police, and where the hell are these people that they can drink in the streets/beaches (openly), act insane, trash hotel rooms, and go topless everywhere? 1/2 an hour later, the police FINALLY make an appearance and make arrests.Realism check.In Daytona, you can't go topless. At a wet t-shirt contest, 3 girls got arrested for flashing. In Miami beach, you can, in some places, but you can't openly drink, or get this rowdy.No where else have I see this many women topless, especially for no reason. Even at Marti Gras, it was just flashing, and for beads. I've never even come CLOSE to seeing this much drug use, drinking, or partying in my life... especially without people dying of overdoses.Seriously, who does this much drugs and alcohol? Sorry, but if you did even 1/4 of the amount that they did in this movie, back to back, you would OD and die, or at the very least, be in a coma. I think I only saw 1 girl passed out.It reminds me of a scene in another movie where there's a piñata full of drugs, and when they break it, pills of all kinds pour out as everyone there RUNS to grab them and shovel them down their throats. WTF? Who does that? You don't even know what they are! You mix a couple different pills and YOU COULD DIE. That was a insult to teens everywhere. We all do stupid things as teens, but this? Come on.I wonder what this says to any teens watching this movie.At the beginning, they should just say ""Warning: This movie is not even remotely realistic, and you could die by attempting just about anything seen in this film"".But that's just it... This isn't supposed to be fiction... meaning, the audience is supposed to believe that ""this"" really happens on spring break. Nope, not really, not to the degree portrayed in this movie.I'm astounded that this got as high as a 5.4 here. What does that say about our culture today?

Told in a very jagged, druggy narrative the film follows a group of girls who decide to live it up in Florida for spring break. It's a journey that will become unforgettable for all the wrong reasons. Once they meet drug dealer Alien (played superbly by James Franco) nothing will ever be the same. Fueled by a bumping soundtrack and a great ensemble cast this is a trip you'll want to take.

Most of the characters aren't flushed out well, some inconsistencies come into play, some things are just crammed in, and it feels rushed at times. There are also way too many shots of breast's and butts for no reason, it's just kind of weird. I think this film had a really good concept going, it's just kind of sad that it didn't go all the way.

151,jhmb2003,There is no paradise in Earth. Paradise is just another form of hell.,8,2 September 2013,"Understandably, the film wakes much rejection. A quick view or not reflective enough can mislead us to believe that it is superficial. On the contrary, Harmony Korine's film is a bitter satire (at times cynical) about the American youth culture and, in large part, global. The shallowness of the characters is deliberate. The three crazy travelers do evil in pure boredom, the banality of evil is presented here in an ironic contrast to the free and unlimited sexuality and drug use, the Holy Grial of these girls. At times, the three chicks seem the witches of Macbeth, messengers of death and emptiness. Harmony Korine is a moralist, his film denounces the horror that lurks behind the glamour of drugs and free love. But Korine delivers his message with a style that copies and reproduces the mechanisms of fashion, so that a teenager is attracted yet shocked by what you see on the screen. Watching this movie, it is impossible not to remember Less Than Zero, the novel that enabled Bret Easton Ellis earn his place under the California sun. The state of affairs is certainly catastrophic for Korine: a. The pursuit of happiness is reduced to get lost in a perpetual orgy. b. The perpetual orgy is slightly threatened only by religious zealots as the only challenging force. c. No more parents and adults, no more institutions concerned with the physical and mental health of its citizens. d. Youngsters' paradise is depicted as one of the many faces of hell.",Spring Breakers

153,thefadingcam,"Pretentious, annoying, bad piece of garbage that wants to be considered art",2,12 September 2013,"Well, I don't even know where to start with this one... On the first sight, one would expect this to be a silly, perhaps funny and probably bad, movie about a group of 4 girls on their spring break vacation. Well, it's not. At least, not in that sense. Spring Breakers wants to be different, good and surprising, using techniques that normally would get that result, such as slow paced filming, color themed photography and supposedly profound dialogs. Well, Spring Breakers just miserably fails in every aspect. Those techniques are used, abused, almost raped, while the movie tries to make a deep portrait of what goes on on the minds of these high-schoolers. Well, yes, you could say the long slow paced shots and the strong color filters could be interpreted as the confusion that goes on these girls minds, but what?! Everything that is said is shockingly poor (even if the characters are supposed to be like that), the girls are objectified in a very non realistic way, just as the parties: we have long, boring segments of naked girls dripping vodka over their breasts in slow motion, with a pretentious alternative pop soundtrack behind, probably with a narrator girl saying something like ""This is our moment. This is the beginning of our life. This is the opportunity of finding ourselves."", or, instead of dripping vodka on their naked body, the girls could be sniffing cocaine while a naked man asks them for oral sex (they obviously accept, because this is ""their moment""). Oh, and don't forget to add a red or blue, maybe purple color filter to make the picture more artsy. Well, you get the idea... Spring Breakers is an offensively pretentious piece of crap, a pointless portrait of American youth that will make you walk away half way into the movie. It is so bad you will feel revolted that some people actually believe this false movie can be good.

154,drakula2005,Here's for Harmony Korine's Stylish Attempt at What he Usually Does Best...,5,22 March 2013,".....and that is kicking us right in the nuts, from the first moment on, until the credits have rolled out...and long after.Only, this time this isn't a good thing.From the writer of the critically acclaimed ""Kids"" and the director of ""Gummo"", you just know, that it's going to be brutal, it's going to be sadistic, and most shockingly-it's always going to be real-just as the emotional overload Chloe Sevigny was going through in ""Kids"".But here-unlike his previous works-it's all to blurry and sugary and colorful, and thus Korine is unable to send us the right message about nowadays teenagers and the sheer downfall some of them are experiencing, while nobody's keeping an eye on them.And just like Franco's character Oz....ooops, i mean Alien(after all he's kinda used to the situation, where he has 3 or more (w)itches at his disposal)the movie is nothing, but an alienating attempt at hitting the right social strings and giving the American audience the punches it needs, in order to change the dystopian societies youth creates for itself.Sadly, it all looks so stylish and so outlandish in the same time, that at the end one feels like he has witnessed a low-budget sci-fi movie set in the near future after a war or a plague of some sort-that's how otherworldly it feels at times.And that's the script to blame-Korine has done a terrible job at portraying a world, for which one needs more than just inside information to portray-it all feels overloaded with color, rap, chicks, but most importantly-this world lacks the severity and the raw, serious nature of the typical world of a ""Lord of War""-something that both Franco and his friend- turned-nemesis aren't.The cold-blooded nature of a person, who's willing to do everything and anything to stay alive just isn't present.You would say that it wasn't an attempt at a crime movie, yet all of the components are here.So, the assumption that one could make after seeing this mess is that's it's actually pretty genre-less.And that, for me, is the worst place a movie can go.Now, on a lighter note-movie, that has teen-queens Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez (albeit marketing's done a good job to cover the fact Gomez is absent for a big chunk of the movie), should be fun, right?Right?Wrong.First of all-the likes of Disney Channel princess Selena Gomez don't have a place in such a movie-either you go all the way, showing you are no longer a 10-year old's wet teen-dream, or go home, because you take the part of a person, who's willing to do a performance of Spartacus-proportions here.I'm not saying i wish to see her naked, i'm saying it is stupid to give the role to a teen, that does not even know what she wants to be associated with-being a good girl on Disney Channel, or a bad girl in adults-oriented movies.In Spring Breakers she does neither.And that's maybe why her character looks so oddly in place-because she really just didn't want to star in this movie, just as her character Faith does not want to be around Franco and his friends, therefore in the center of the events in the movie.And she has no reason to go bad-girl-she definitely has in mind her fans.But, sadly, most of them, don't know what a quality film means yet, so they certainly don't know what a low-budget, B-grade, R-rated movie is, as they fill the PG-13 quote(let's face it-Gomez's fans are essentially low-teen teens), in the best case-scenario.So, Gomez can't get her people to the theater, her cast is totally unneeded.And i probably won't end up talking so much about her in my life...again...The more interesting subject here is Vanessa Hudgens-she is the right Disney Channel-cast and she's definitely up for a transition to adults-oriented cinema, as she showed with films such as Sucker Punch or Beastly.I actually think she has some potential to rise above her teen-star-wet-dream-status and no 13-year old would like her in the role of the twisted devil she plays in this movie, which is-in my opinion-a good thing.It's time for her to do the leap, and so far she has been bold enough doing it.Now, back to Alien for a moment.I don't want to discuss Franco's performance any further, 'cause i find words even harder.As a Francophile, i'll just say that in any other day, i would crucified him, but in such a blunt, blank, train wreck of a movie, he would be the only memorable thing in mind after a few hours have passed...he and the 175 pairs of boobs of all kinds and shapes we get to see, mixed with the music Korine thinks young people listen to...well, do we not?So, a couple of nice and stylishly-shot scenes and interesting soundscape don't make for an otherwise surprisingly dull and empty- shelled movie you'll have a hard time remembering in a few days.Voiced over, designed to be repulsive and thought-provoking with a certain social element to rise awareness of the problems of the youth system as a whole, this attempt at a movie feels empty on the subject and just falls short.My grade:5/10",Spring Breakers

156,Forgotten_Conscience_Productions,Anyone up for partying with Spring Breakers?,8,8 September 2012,"What goes through your head when you read the names Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Rachel Korine and Ashley Benson? For people who follow pop culture the first word that comes to mind is the word Disney. Often for filmmakers the words ""pre-packaged Disney kids stuff"" or some variation there upon is what they say. In either case it is something that can put people off when those names pop up on the metaphorical marquee of a film's cast list. They can take a step back and say 'you know what, that's not for me' without even giving the film a chance.Suppose I were to add another name to that list. What if the next name on that list was Harmony Korine? I imagine there would be a few filmmakers reading this who would suddenly find themselves more interested. Those who might be somewhat less initiated should know that Harmony Korine's film credits include such ground breaking and somewhat controversial films as ""Kids"", ""Mister Lonely"" and ""Trash Humpers"". Names which carry a bit more weight in the indie scene then some of the films associated with the previous four names I mentioned above. Of course this broader scope will lead people to another negative comment which sounds like ""Oh look, a bunch of Disney sweethearts trying to break out of their squeaky clean image by being edgy and shocking people"". And this always leads me to... why the heck is that? Why do we as a society, and in particular filmmakers, automatically jump to such conclusions about the people involved in a project if their history is one that is associated with Disney? Why do we place people like Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson inside these boxes when history tells us that they are going to try and break out of them eventually? Perhaps those boxes we put them in never really existed in the first place. Maybe these actors were always serious about their work and we just couldn't see it because we'd rather shove them in a corner. The film industry is a brutal business. No matter where you get your start, whether it's Disney or through some other aspect of the industry, you don't get into it unless you're serious about succeeding. Does it really matter where that success comes from? I try not to carry any such baggage into a film when I go to see one, which doesn't mean that I don't have any such baggage when going into a film. It is often the actors or filmmakers involved in the film that will lead me to wanting to see it in the first place. There's no denying it plays a role in the decision making process of putting my rather limited funds into buying a ticket. But when I sit in the seat and settle in to watch, I try to let that experience stand on its own. A lot of people out there will have to try and do that in order to get them in that seat, but if they can then they will be pleasantly surprised. If they can't, then by the end of the film they will be forced to reevaluate what I think is a fundamentally flawed perspective on the actors involved.Because I honestly believe there's no other way to come out of this film. The story is such a fascinating and well told one. The actors so very clearly embody the roles they play. Of particular note is James Franco in the role of the gangster named Alien, but I don't think that his performance works without the great work of the other four young actors who accompany him. Spring Breakers is smart, funny, disturbing and emotional, sometimes all at once in a really beautiful way.That doesn't happen without the solid and emotionally honest performances of his co-stars. Harmony Korine is known for edgy and controversial films, and Spring Breakers is no exception. There are a number of scenes which are difficult to watch and the fact of the actors involved makes it fairly controversial. What sets this film apart is the way in which the event of spring break and the story become so well integrated.He spoke during the Q&A about the idea of micro scenes and repetitiveness to tell the story he is trying to tell, but I would liken it to a deliberate attempt to give the audience an experience much like spring break itself. The non linear micro scenes and repetitiveness give you the feeling of a drunken, drug filled orgy of sex and violence masterfully controlled from the filming, editing and post-production.

In fact I kept watching it solely because I thought that somehow, something worthwhile would come from it-WRONG!The 4 ""leads' females were so void of charm, intelligence and character-never mind personality, that the continual shots of them heads grouped together gave them an identity that they never individually achieved- they never emerged as individuals- the 3 blonds just were much of a muchness, pouting, prancing and generally making less of themselves than you would think possible. It was impossible to care or even be interested in any of them. James Franco, provides some entertainment as a druggie/ crook, but not much( and WHY does he always look a bit grubby? His skin seems to have greasy film of dullness in every picture, so much so that you wonder if he has a personal grooming problem- I want to pass him some facial scrub, and hope that it gives him some bloom or glow.) The ending is so preposterous that it cannot be taken in any shape, form or way seriously. that these 2 dumb-I mean Really Dumb, girls would pull off this shoot out killing professional crooks, and thugs with no problem whatsoever is laughable-if only the movie was Not so bad. It was (on TV) listed as having strong sexual content and nudity- but even on that level it fails. Why do these directors, STILL continually have the female cast flashing their boobs, and rarely equivalent nudity from the males in their cast- talk about sexism.

159,tuomas_gimli,A few good ideas and James Franco couldn't save this,4,2 July 2013,"When a movie that is only 94 minutes long feels terribly overstretched, you know there's something wrong.Spring Breakers has a bunch of good ideas, a couple of hilarious moments and a terrific performance and character from James Franco. His character, ""Alien"" is a fascinating and fun person to follow, as the viewer expects there to be something under the surface to him, but in the end turns out to be just what he seems. The soundtrack is also pretty cool. That's about all the positive I can say about it. The rest is just a dreary, baggy slog that feels two times longer than it actually is.It feels like the director was making a music video or a short film, but didn't want to cut any of the scenes out, so he just added a bunch of dialogue, edited the clips into something resembling a narrative and released it as a feature film. I'm not kidding when I say that about 80% of the film consists of surrealistic, moody montage sequences of partying, sex and drugs with either ambient music or a narration in the background. Some might call this reliance on visual storytelling, I call it laziness: this way the actors don't need to deliver any lines or act convincingly, they just need to party like crazy and occasionally look sad.The lack of any real story also makes the film feel like a 94-minute music video. The actual events can be summed up in about 5 sentences, the rest is surrealistic, moody montage sequences of--- oh wait! Worthy of its own mention is one particular moment when a few dialogue lines are played four times in a row, word for word. I almost shouted ""YEAH, WE GET IT!"" in the theater at that point.In the end, Spring Breakers felt like a wasted opportunity. The idea of exploring the depravity of this particular subculture is fascinating, and in the hands of better writers it could have been really edgy and thought-provoking. But as it stands, it's just not worth seeing as a feature film.Recommendation: Wait until someone makes a 10-minute supercut of this film on Youtube, then watch that instead.",Spring Breakers
160,FrostyChud,Hit and miss with some Nuggets nonetheless,7,7 March 2013,"Had the director treated his audience with a little more respect, this could have been a great movie. As it is, it is only a good movie.The theme is simple and worth exploring: the brainless pursuit of fun and excitement ultimately leads to perdition. The opening montage is excellent. In fact, all of the party montages are excellent. This is what the characters came here for: close-ups of bare breasts and beer bongs...throbbing music...glistening bodies...the sun...the beach. I loved the long scenes of the four immature but silky and buttery young bikini babes drinking, shaking their butts, and acting like the worst kind of children. The director does a good job here of communicating visually what we should not hesitate to refer to as evil. That's what these girls are: evil. We are still in thrall of the Victorian idea that children are angels. They are not. I think that children are generally better than adults at furnishing us with the closest thing to a representation of pure evil that we ever encounter in everyday life. Where the director goes wrong is shoving his message in our faces. I hate it when they do this. Just tell the story and let us draw our own conclusions. The idea is genius: four heartless and brainless girls wilding out during spring break fall in with a charismatic gangster. Korine should have let the story tell itself. He should have shot it in a more traditional way so we could have come to the conclusion ourselves that what he is showing us is Hell. Let me say also that James Franco is GREAT in his role as Alien. All of his lines are well-written and perfectly delivered. He steals the movie. He is hilarious. The ""Look at all my s***"" scene is the best scene in the movie. Korine makes the girls 90% unsympathetic. Two of the girls are snakes. One of them is more pathetic than anything else. The ""good"" girl, who is totally boring and just as much of a stupid hypocrite as the others, disappears early, which is fine. I would have liked to see her act like even more of a coward. These are all people who have refused anything like an ethics of subjectivity, choosing abstract pleasure over existence as ""real"" people. This film is the story of the consequences of refusing to be a real person. Korine should have made them 100% unsympathetic. Or rather: they were 100% unsympathetic but Korine tried to redeem them a little bit. Those telephone conversations with their parents were not a bad idea as such but I sensed that he was trying to redeem the girls instead of showing just how deep their hypocrisy went. Alien, on the other hand, is a straight up snake and for that you like watching him. There are a lot of really nice small scenes that point up the absurdity of everything that's happening...the scene where Gucci Mane talks about his starving baby...also the scene where he is with two women in bed...in addition of course to the scene in Alien's bedroom mentioned above. These characters are so ridiculous, so disgusting...these are true villains. The camera loves them. Harmony Korine missed a lot of chances here but he also put some really nice images and characters on the screen for us. With a little more discipline and distance this could have been a great movie, but even despite the missed opportunities there is much to like.",Spring Breakers

(literally, he repeats those phrases over and over again), James Franco talks about himself and himself only and how gangsta he is in every scene, James Franco took the role in this piece of cr*p after great films like 127 Hours and even Pineapple Express, Selena Gomez is the only great character and man....oh man do these characters say the title of the movie......a lot. It's as if they director didn't feel a scene was really hitting home unless someone shouts ""Spring Break b**ch!!"".So, now we're past that, you might have notices that I mentioned James Franco more than anything else. That's because he is the worst thing about this movie. He is more annoying than Jar Jar Binks and more hate-able than Alan from The Hangover. Seriously, you will rejoice when he kicks the bucket. All he does in the film is talk about himself and how gangsta he is. If you wanna see the most obnoxious James Franco ever put on screen, this movie is for you. I'm not saying his character isn't important to the plot, but after his contribution is made, you wouldn't miss him if he wasn't there. The only 2 strong points of this movie are the camera-work and Selena Gomez. The film is surprisingly well shot and I know she's something of a Disney channel reject, but man can she carry a film when she wants to. This is probably due to the fact that she is the only likable and developed character in the film, but she leaves over half way through. I didn't wanna watch the film after she left, but committed to seeing it through to the end. All in all, this movie is a steaming dump straight to you from Harmony Korine, wrapped up in pretentiousness and garnished with a heavy dose of awkward. The film is clearly trying to put a pretentious ""art-house"" spin on the typical summer/party movie, which in this case fails miserably. I would go so far as to say that Spring Breakers could possibly be one of the worst films of all time.",Spring Breakers
163,Raxing,"Intelligent concept, boring execution.",5,16 January 2020,"There is no doubt in my mind that the concept behind this movie was very intelligent. The movie is social commentary on the way people leave reality to embrace the fantasy lifestyles that they see on the television. It is about how vapid and overly sexualized pop culture can be and how young people may view it and believe that this culture represents a desirable reality until reality kicks them in the teeth.
With that said, this is not a good movie by any means. I was bored for most of the movie. Some ""art house"" people will say that it was designed that way intentionally and appreciate it as a work of art, but I don't need to watch a boring movie to understand the concept behind it. I wanted to enjoy the movie, not watch a movie that dragged on with repetitive scenes that seemed to drag on forever.",Spring Breakers
164,mulhollanddriveway,Sadly Misunderstood By Many,9,21 March 2021,"I thought it would be fun to go back and revisit/ review this some 8 years after it's release. I've had to defend this film on many frustrating occasions since it came out. Harmony has always been an underappreciated filmmaker that I think would have been revered had he done his work in the 70's. But he came on just at the tail end of the 90's indie boom and dropped his magnum opus smack dab in the middle of the ""digital era"". Maybe 20 years from now some budding filmmaker will discover his work and appreciate his true genius. ""Spring Breakers"" was one of those movies that much of the pseudo intellectual modern film watcher refused to give a fair chance. It's a film that doesn't really take itself serious. Even the casting is ironic and that was kinda the whole (very obvious) point. James Franco honestly gave one of the best, if not the best performance of his career. And how many films have tried to rip-off the aesthetic of this film since it's release? You can't say it was ahead of it's time either. It was a wave that went by a lot of people.",Spring Breakers

166,Baghdaddy,Unique and Sexy,8,16 January 2014,"Found this movie thoroughly entertaining, although towards the end it entered the realms of very bizarre!Initially, I was thinking 10/10 this movie was perfect, encapsulating the friendship of 4 girls, and their desperate desire to travel for Spring Break.The film starts getting weird once they get sentenced to jail, then get bailed out by a local rapper. He then entices them to spend time with him, in return for their bail however, Faith leaves swiftly following her instinct not to trust him. The other 3 girls remain, and join his gang of convicts.Vanessa Hudgens delivers an excellent display of acting and portrays her character the best, and is so damn sexy its unreal!The action scene at the end had a twist at the very beginning of it, and stunned me throughout.Overall, I enjoyed how the film was shot, with the voice-overs of the characters and the flashbacks, however, it was strange how the rapper allowed the people to leave so easily, and how in the final action scene the two masked girls never had to reload their automatic pistols once!",Spring Breakers
167,horitaj,Look at my s***!,8,3 June 2016,"""Spring Breakers"" stars James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Rachel Korine. The film is directed by Harmony Korine, who brought us ""Gummo"" (1997), and ""Trash Humpers"" (2009). The film is about these four girls in college who are planning on going on Spring break but due to money issues they are unable to go. The only solution these girls have is by robbing a diner, which they do. Once on Spring break they party, drink, and do drugs. One day they are arrested for possession of drugs/doing drugs. They are bailed out by Alien, who is a rapper, drug hustler, and arms dealer. Alien takes the girls under his wing to show them what Spring break is all about. I'll be honest I was very surprised with this film, it was better than I'd expected. Harmony Korine is one of the most stylized and original directors in the film industry, the only thing is that all of his films receive average to negative reviews. With ""Spring Breakers"" he finally landed a film with enough positive criticism so he can finally be seen and heard. ""Spring Breakers"" targets the youth of today's society, social media, art, and most of all Spring break. The very first minute of the film demonstrates what's later to come throughout the duration of this movie. The opening of this movie is a bunch of young men and women partying, and drinking on a beach. The thing that mostly affected me were what the people were doing and the way they were presented, they acted like barbaric animals, it definitely demonstrated what Spring break is all about within just one minute. James Franco gives the best performance of his entire career so far in this film, I'm very surprised he did not get an Oscar nomination for his transformative role as this gross and disgusting human being. The film looks beautiful, if you love neon lighting this movie is for you. This movie should've been called ""Neon Porn"" instead. Throughout the film you wonder what more trouble are these girls going to get into next and it just keeps getting worse. This film demonstrates very poor decision making from the younger generation. But hey, they want to party and do tons of illegal activities! Who can blame them!? (Being sarcastic). A couple of issues I have with the film is that it has a lot of female nudity. Now I have nothing against the female body but I felt that it was just a distraction from the film's story and heavily exploited women . Now if I was twelve years old and saw this film I wouldn't have had a problem with it. The film is very repetitive with its dialogue, the characters will say the same thing multiple times, and it gets very distracting. The first 20 or 30 minutes are pretty slow, and you're left waiting for when the film is ready to pick up. Once James Franco is on the screen the film is solid throughout. One thing that I do like about this film is that it has a lot of literary devices in it. You have a lot of imagery, and foreshadowing. I didn't think this film would be so literary but it was and it surprised me a lot. Overall ""Spring Breakers"" is a solid film by Harmony Korine, and demonstrates an interesting story about Spring break and all the things that can possibly go wrong with it. One thing I must point out is that this is a drama. For those of you who are looking for the next ""American Pie"" (1999), you're not going to find it with ""Spring Breakers"". Now if you don't like artsy films you will most likely not like this movie because it is very very artsy. Check out ""Spring Breakers"", it is better than what most people say it is, but hey I have my opinions and you have yours so see it if you want.",Spring Breakers
168,tomassparups,A watchable Korine film?,6,18 July 2013,"Harmony Korine is a director that I generally can't stand. From such films like ""Gummo"", to the unwatchable ""Trash Humpers"" I tend to be very wary of seeing any of his work. ""Spring Breakers"" is one of the films that I missed during the past six moths and now that it is available pretty much everywhere, I decided to give it a watch. The plot is basically a ""good girls gone bad"" type scenario. It stars Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, Venessa Hudgens and Korine's own daughter, Rachel Korine as four teenage girls who desperately wish to abandon the mediocrity of every day life and go on a marathon of partying for spring break. Unfortunately, they don't have enough money so they decide to rob a restaurant. After the robbery proves to be successful, they embark on a drug and alcohol fueled rampage through Miami until they are arrested and charged for possession of illegal drugs. Just as all hope seems lost, they are bailed out by a rapper named ""Alien"", played by James Franco who gets them involved in his illegal activities, which involve even more drugs as well as gang violence. Although, he fails to convince Selena Gomez's character ""Faith"" so she leaves Miami and heads back home. As for the other three girls, they head down a dark, dark path.While I can't say I enjoyed it, it is a great improvement compared to Korine's previous films. By that, I mean it's watchable. ""Spring Breakers"" is stylized very well. The gritty camera-work combined with the colorful visuals provide for a genuinely interesting experience. Franco delivers a dynamic performance and it is clear that he was completely invested in his character. Benson and Hudgens prove that they can do a great job at playing sluts In all honestly though, it was interesting to see these young actresses break out of their childish personas and portray genuinely filthy characters. The film is sleazy, messy and undoubtedly lazy, but in it's own silly way it helps set the tone. Ultimately, ""Spring Breakers"" is a satire as well as a social commentary on modern youth culture and it's obsession with sex and drugs. The girls in the film long for a break from every day life, but in the end discover that they just can't handle it.It is lazy, but very interesting. Harmony Korine's nauseating satire on modern day youth provides us with over the top scenes of violence, sleazy sex and beautiful visuals. It isn't for everyone, but I managed to somewhat enjoy it. I think that the only way I can accurately express my opinion on the film is with a one to ten rating. I don't usually do this, but a film like ""Spring Breakers"" requires it.",Spring Breakers
169,R-Clercx,Totally underrated small masterpiece of a rogue director,8,24 November 2014,"It did not surprise me as a European viewer, this movie would be poorly received by especially the Americans.In my interpretation Harmony Korine manages to provide another blow in the face of The American Dream (as he had done in each of his previous movies). In 'Spring Breakers' he does this by1) showing the (dark) other side of young people living in a mostly religious community, who on the surface pose as devote followers of Christianity, but who on the other hand follow superficial material values and who are ready to do anything to 'get it'2) portraying the decadence of the 'Spring Break' phenomenon of which sex, drugs and partying are the main components, in strong contrast to what American parents believe their children to beThe movie is unsettling and many will be mislead by the poster, promising slick mainstream action and softcore sex. But Korine serves a dark tale and takes another serious stab at the heart of America.Surely not your average 'entertaining' action flick, but a disturbing sociological portrayal of modern America.",Spring Breakers

James Franco's character was annoying however I found his depiction of the type of character Alien was very accurate. The only part I could make out that was supposed to make a point was when Faith realized that her ""friends"" were idiots and that she had to save herself before they drug her into their downward cycle. Of reviews I've read it's supposed to depict college life so accurately but I think it shows more of how the writer believes young people have been raised without any morals or values and that hurting people and just going along without using any type of logical or sensible judgment is OK. Which honestly I don't know anyone I go to college with that would do some of the more moderate things they did without using any type of judgment. And honestly I didn't even make it through the movie I felt my brain turning into mush.",Spring Breakers
172,rahmannoodles22,Spring Breakers - Noodles Review,6,19 December 2013,"When Disney stars go bad... I guess this happens. Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens star in this movie, which takes them far from their previous roles in Disney and family material. I can tell you that this is not a family movie. Spring Breakers is a modern take on what people in our modern society do these days at the age of these particular girls and then what the consequences can be. It follows the four title girls on a quest to have the best spring break ever. So, they try to rob a store, but they end up getting arrested and bailed out by an arms & drugs dealer, who takes them into a life of partying, drugs, craziness, etc etc. I originally wanted to see this film to see how the Disney princesses (Gomez and Hudgens) could transform themselves into such an adult role. Additionally, I'm always interested in the Harmony Korine's films because they're so different and really stand out, even though only one of his films has actually been good. Spring Breakers, on its roots, is a party movie and I can only enjoy a party movie if its characters and events are written well. That was the problem I had with recent party movies like 21 And Over and Project X; they lacked depth or anything characters for the viewer to get into. Thankfully, Harmony Korine is a good writer, because this movie is pretty interesting and deep. The first half of this movie is pretty much a really big music video because we just see partying and women with little clothes on. It's sort of dragging and nothing is really happening that's good for the movie. All we see is the provocative stuff that all the teens paid to see: girls, boobs, music. But the movie really picks up in the second half when James Franco's character comes in. James Franco is an awesome actor with great range; and he really gets into this role as the arm & drugs dealer that brings the girls into the life of trouble-making and craziness. From then on, the movie is very unpredictable and deep, and I really like that. As far the girls, their performances are good as well (just not as great as James Franco, but he's awesome) as you see their lives fall into crime and drugs and the underground world. There are several scenes where it gets emotional or pretty crazy and it actually kept me invested in the movie.Overall, I was very surprised by this movie. It was a completely different tone in the second half and I was really engrossed into that. The writing and directing styles of Korine is unique and sometimes even hypnotic, as well the acting by the main characters being entertaining. Though, the beginning wasn't particularly enjoyable, this movie is still very unique and the second half just sorta draws you in",Spring Breakers
173,nanccakes,Spring Break forever.....,2,13 March 2014,"OK. I knew what I was getting into by watching this. Well. Sort of. I like Ash and Selena and sometimes Vanessa so why not watch this? It was weird. I don't even know why Faith (Selena) is friends with the other girls. It seems like she is uncomfortable with them. So I don't like Vanessa's mouth throughout the whole movie. It's pretty sad that they pretend to have real guns and point them at people's heads just to get money for spring break. so they meet Alien (James Franco) and I am embarrassed to say that I found myself very slightly crushing on his character. He actually seemed to care about the girls and I really thought at first that he was going to kill them because he wasn't trustworthy. So it's weird how first Faith leaves and then Cotty like no big deal and then that's the end of them. Then I found it weird that the girls would take it into their own hands to finish Alien's business with his enemy. I was sad that Alien had died so quickly. It was soo annoying how they kept repeating ""You scared? Scaredy pants. Spring Break. Spring break forever."" Just odd.",Spring Breakers
174,sahamh,A Disappointing Artsy Film,5,10 July 2013,"It's written and directed by Harmony Korine. I personally hadn't watched any of his works, so I wasn't familiar with his style but I still wanted to like this movie because of James Franco's attempt of a very new and different role. However, I ended up with total disappointment. I start with the bright side and then start bitching about the problems. The cinematography is done well here, a lot of beautiful wide shots of the ocean, sky, and sunset. The performances are also fairly fine, I don't have complains about the actors performances. The soundtrack is not bad, very trippy; although at some point it is shitty in my opinion because I hate Dubstep. I'm assuming another positive point for some guys would be the amount of the nudity in this movie.I personally never have understood the point of an excitement for a week of a spring break when there's a 14-16weeks of summer break not too far away from it. However, before watching it I totally ignored my personal judgment, but the story, script, and directing are just so poor and boring that it drives me insane. I'm not a religious person but the amount of nudity is just so unnecessary. Yes, it's about spring break and it's supposed to be like that but when the director is trying to have an artsy tone, it doesn't work, in fact it becomes so boring that I don't think any straight man get a boner. The music is trippy on these party scenes with the poorest and most annoying narrations, then music becomes dubstep or whatever that's not enjoyable. I also don't understand some of these poor handy cam footages, does it supposed to make it feel more authentic? If so, why is it in poor quality? It's not happening in 90's, and in fact some people are recording with smart phones, why not using those footages then? Again, so many useless scenes, or I guess they should be call it ""eye candy"" shots or scenes that have no purpose in forwarding the story. The story absolutely has no point what so ever. The dialogues are even worse, you wouldn't care what they say or narrate, and it's so repetitive that they get annoying. The ending is just the poorest part of the movie where it proves that this was absolutely a pointless movie. Some might say the point is to do what you want to do that makes you happy, in that case I'd respond bullshit! Because some of the characters doesn't end up having that resolution, plus the ending is just directed so poorly that it disapproves with all of that. I don't know why I'm being genuine for not spoiling it at all, but I can tell you it's written so awfully that I could write a book and bitch all about it.Therefore, I highly DO NOT recommend this film, if you want to watch some artsy film with a great story and characters, watch Drive, watch Mud, watch Oldboy, watch The Place Beyond The Pines watch Brick, you watch anything else but not this! I feel like being generous for giving it 5/10.",Spring Breakers

176,cjaye,Brilliant,10,17 November 2013,"I've never seen a movie like this and I think a lot of people didn't get it because they were swept up in the sensory overload. I also believe a lot of people didn't like it because they didn't want to see anti-hero women like these - it was hard to watch these women - women who had more power than men in every way.It was a serious art house movie that made incredibly interesting choices, not one single bit of the movie was not thought out - the cinematography and editing were amazing and the choice, the brave choice to show women such as these - and they exist - is seldom done. But if you're not careful, you'll not see it - because Korine does such an incredible job making you feel as if you are there, sensory overload - and he does this on purpose, to make you feel as the characters feel Some of my favorite parts: The repetitive dialogue and scenes - a commentary on these people's lives how they always live in the present, never move forward in their lives. The amazing visuals - underlying the surreal - just like how their lives are - ""just pretend you're in a movie"" that's how these women view life - as if nothing is real, everything is in the moment, everything is about fun and doing what you want and living a hedonistic life. The use of irony to underline how these women feel - none of it is real to them, it's all fun.I also loved the deep messages this movie had about coming of age and the paths we take and people searching for fulfillment. What was most amazing to me was that it was all wrapped up in a bubblegum teeny bopper wrapper of sex drugs and rock 'n' roll And because of this...I think a lot of people miss the message - they miss the commentary, they take it at face value, they miss the poetry, they miss that it was all done purpose.I thought it was amazing.I loved it.",Spring Breakers

Basically, it demonstrates how people's expectations of an event (such as spring break) rarely lives up to the perception or dream of the future.

They live together in a boring college dorm and are hungry for adventure. They rob a restaurant in order to fund their spring break vacation and shenanigans begin. They land in jail and find themselves bailed out by a drug and arms dealer who wants them to do some dirty work in exchange for all the thrill and excitement they could hope for. With the encouragement of their new friend, it soon becomes unclear how far the girls are willing to go to experience a spring break they will never forget.I entered the dark theater and descended into a black hole of corruption and filth when I watched Harmny Korine's Spring Breakers almost two weeks ago. There was something about the film that looked intriguing despite their being a lot of bad press, and being a big James Franco fan I knew I had to see it, so I went to its last screening in my area. Spring Breakers was an on screen explosion of neon, Skrillex, nudity, sex and drugs. But when you peal away its barely there bikini you realize it is actually so much more; including a metaphor for Britney Spears' total breakdown. It's a bleak view regarding the ills of our society and the increasingly perverse nature of its youth.This is the first film of Korine's to be released to a wide audience. Due to the fact that it is so dramatically different from your average big cinema adventure, and because of Korine's specific style I don't think the casual moviegoer would like this film. There is a lot to take in, and many layers to uncover that on the surface just comes off as weird.At first glance it just looks like you are watching the college party scene taken to an extreme level with a lot of people getting drunk, girls bouncing their naked chests, vulgar language and other trashiness. It is not until you let it all soak in and let it marinade with you a couple of days (or in my case over a week) that you can truly fathom the point of the film.

I would guess most people would turn it off after ten minutes. BUT, they'd be missing an amazing movie that takes a yearly right of passage for teenagers and turns it into an amazingly breathtaking piece of art - visually, musically, ironically, sadly, heroically, etc. Most won't like this movie (morals, etc.). But, I don't watch Saw because I want to kill someone and I don't watch Bridges of Madison County because I want to have an affair. So, I don't watch this movie because I want to go on spring break and do drugs and have crazy sexual encounters, and drink what looks to be almost suicidal. I love movies, and, I'll watch almost anything (except most sci-fi) for the experience. This is a movie that could have been absolutely horrible, but, because of the directors vision, seemed almost a masterpiece (won't win an Oscar tho). It won't stay with you like Life Is Beautiful, but while watching, it is amazing and beautiful in its own way. In my opinion, of course. Oh - the acting was fair. Not sure I've ever seen James Franco quite like he was in this movie. I prefer him in other movies, but good for him for branching out and trying new (weird) things.

Despite the well done (almost Miami Vice-like) neon-cinematography (and an over-the-top James Franco who's acting is on fire, and looks like he was actually just been extinguished) this film disappoints. Most of Korine's previous work (Julien Donkey Boy, Mister Lonely) was much better.The pretentious whispering (almost religious chanting) of the words 'Spring Break') at regular (not to say predictable) intervals during the film tickle the nerves of any finger close enough to the stop-button of your remote, but the potential of (maybe) another outburst of Franco's lunacy can keep it away just long enough for the movie to continue the story, however thin it might be.",Spring Breakers

Suspend belief, suspend reality, suspend taste, and you'll love this stylized movie of paint drying. After the first 20-30 minutes of partying something finally happens, but does the pace pick up? NO! Dragging on and on with interlaced music, stylized scenery and beautiful women does not make a movie. Just bad, period. Boring as hell, no worthwhile message, unlikable characters all around and pointless. Just because The Sixth Sense was great, doesn't make the Last Airbender worth watching. Make something intriguing instead of just a 90 minute painting with sound.",Spring Breakers
189,maxime-chesneau,"SO, that's it?",3,3 July 2013,"After hearing all sorts of things about this movie, I didn't expect THAT at all... I mean, when it started, I really thought this was going to be real crazy and disturbing or whatever the marketing let us think... What did I see instead? A freaking below the average American movie I almost fell asleep watching ! OK we get it girls, you wanna break your image or something, you wanna be taken for serious actresses... Just try and find a role where you actually ACT and you'll see, it will come... But that's not the good movie, you just look fake trashy and we don't care about your character's fate.. I didn't anyway... The only good thing here is James Franco, of course. And the music. That's it. Forget the ads. Forget the poster. Just, forget about the existence of this movie.",Spring Breakers
190,laurenbrigittepool,Um.... so what is the plot?,1,22 August 2014,"One question about this movie - I'm not really sure that it qualifies as a movie - but what was the point of the movie and all its vulgarity? I don't think I've seen a movie with such pointless scenes. More than half of the movie were showing scenes coming out of no where with things such as close up filming of boobs and asses. I had no idea what those random scenes had to do with the story. It was just awkward and uncomforting. I'm glad I watched this by myself. But the movie is just horrible and the acting.... well don't even get me started with the acting but some of these actresses need some drama lessons. Although James Franco, I thought he did a good job. I reckon this movie would've been better if it wasn't so overdone and it didn't keep repeating gross scenes all the time. There was no character development and it was also a very boring movie.",Spring Breakers
191,jasarrubbo,Difficult to watch,5,18 February 2020,"Let me start by saying James Franco was ridiculous in this role.
Reality check for young kids looking to have a good time, without understanding the reality of life! Hard to watch these misguided girls thinking that finding a way out of their boring reality means they have to sell their sole.

Maybe it'll teach some teens a lesson though,3,31 August 2013,"Okay so the end was a bit far-fetched - most people wouldn't go that far - but most of it was so true to life for people that age it was actually quite disturbing to watch. I watched this and was automatically reminded of when I was 18 and the types of situations me and my friends ended up in. Watching this was so seriously disturbing and cringe-worthy - like you wanted to go in and slap them out of it. So I kinda hope that younger people watch this and think WTF are these ppl doing - and then don't end up in the same situations themselves!!! I gave this movie a 3/10 rating purely for this ""learn a lesson"" factor. Otherwise I felt it was quite boring, disturbing, annoying...

193,vince4953529,Strange film with lasting impressions,6,28 June 2013,"Saw lots of 1 or 2 stars reviews. It is a strange movie. It's beautifully-filmed, yet it's very repetitive. I actually lost attention many times and started doing other things only to force myself into watching this film without distraction. This film gives me a sense it's mocking all the clichés being used in today's Hollywood film industries or America's dumbing-down popular culture. Examples: all the stock figures particularly the wigger gangster portrayed by James Franco, the over-the-top antiques from the 4 main girls. The dialogs is banal (""spring break forever..."", ""we're finally going to see the world"".) it's laughable. The antics done by the characters are extremely humorous. Some scenes are just borderline on full-blown ridiculousness (playing a Britney Spears song on the piano, girls wearing pink masks totting guns, Florida white trash bearing silver teeth...). This is a very good comedy. Harmony Korine has done an excellent job calling this film a satire; a mockery of today's mindless youth behaviors and the pervasive stupidity among the masses, or could be a commentary on the absurdity of the Hollywood culture. But if he meant this film to be a ""serious"" thriller, it would be terrible.",Spring Breakers
194,kieronboote-134-969472,Disharmony,8,26 May 2013,"""Trash Humpers"" and ""Mister Lonely"" may be relative failures but the wonderful and chronically underrated ""Gummo"" and ""Julien Donkey-Boy"" demonstrate that Korine deserves the benefit of doubt when he releases a new film.Perhaps the typical IMDb ""reviewer"" doesn't like ""Spring Breakers"" because they were expecting a T&A experience with the gloss of ""cleverness"" that Tarantino brings to his compendium-style of film making. Critics love the Tarantino film-reference style of movies because it makes them feel superior. They know that ""Bande a part"" is a film by Godard and that Tarantino's production company is called A Band Apart - see what he did there? The average cinema-goer likes Tarantino's films because they make them feel smarter than they are. The mirror that Korine holds up to a section of the movie audience makes them look dumber than they are! Korine alienates ""serious"" critics because he doesn't make moral judgments or use his films for overt didactic purposes. ""Sight and Sound"" delivered a review in which the reviewer demonstrated a lack of critical objectivity. Pinkerton accused Korine of using Britney Spears songs because he is ""an aging infant terrible"". Are Korine's use of Skrillex, Cliff Martinez on the soundtrack and the casting of Gucci Mane the actions of someone who is out of touch with ""now""? Pinkerton's blinkers prevented him from seeing that Britney is included because she is the trailer-trash, slutty godmother of the consumer driven production line female who is the victim of ""Spring Breakers"". Britney was the first high profile pop-princess who adopted fetish school girl outfits in ""Hit me baby one more time"" and if Pinkerton can't see that ""I'm not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman"" fits with the themes of the film he should take up another career. Pinkerton accuses Korine and Franco of serving up a ""put on"" because of the knowing elements in the dialog but in a film by some art-house darling this same stylization would have been described as functioning as a Brechtian ""alienation effect""! What Korine has done with ""Spring Breakers"" is hold up a mirror to society in the same way that his mentors Werner Herzog and Larry Clark do. Korine uses this mirror to show the constant media-stream in your head of consume/conform, the diet of hip-hop videos, objectified women and a reality that is transformed morally by ""Grand Theft Auto"". He presents a reality where all that working class teen-women in the post-industrial era can aspire to is to be a sex object, where the purpose of life is, as Franco/Alien outlines in his classic scene, to accumulate more ""shit"".Korine's casting of Disney/HSM/TV teen icons is a comment on the wholesale sexualization of females, even in what were previously bastions of wholesome good taste. There is little actual sexual activity included in the film and what we have is the visual stimulation, the display. The fast food-heist scene distanced through plate-glass, Rachel Korine semi-naked with the group of men, the intimidating pool-hall etc do not fulfill audience anticipation of sex and violence. The mirror Korine holds up says you want your instant gratification. The reality of what the girls have done in robbing the fast-food diner is only made real to Faith when the girls re-enact the attack on her. Behaving, as they say they need to, like characters in a movie, like characters in a video game.Faith ( no coincidence in that name!) played by Selena Gomez is the first to leave the group because she has a family that supports an opposite world-view to ""money, guns and bitches"" and is the only one who appears to have the possibility of a college career and success.Cotty/Rachel Korine is the one who initially buys into the lifestyle with the most eagerness but reality bites in the shape of a bullet and she leaves. The two girls who become acolytes of Alien, who want Spring Break to last forever, who want all of the ""shit"" for themselves play the first half of the film in an understated manner but the life without limits starts to increasingly seduce them until they are assimilated into the Springbreak ""dream"". Vanessa Hudgens, developing a feral sexuality as the film evolves and Ashley Benson acting like someone who has found her purpose in life, shape-shift from ordinary high school girls to bikini clad assassins, buying into Alien's world-view in the same way that Charlie Manson's girls carried out his murders, but this time not to spread fear amongst those with the consumer ""shit"" but to take the ""shit"" from them.The mesmerizing soft edged semi-drug induced tone of the film reduces resistance and the repetition of dialog acts as a symbol of the insidious whisper in the girls heads that the media constantly sends out. This theme is reinforced by the brilliant device of the phone-calls home the girls make. Reassuring their parents that they are having a ""great time"" with ""wonderful people"" and what a ""dream"" the whole thing is. We don't hear the parents on the other end of the line, simply girls repeating lines incantation-like, deluding themselves about this ""magical"" ""paradise"", where girls are measured by the size of their T&A and men by the size of their assault weapons! The jump cuts and fragmented editing serve to show the contrast between the reality and the fantasy, the loss of time and space and the desire to make the immediate now, forever. The dream meets the ultimate reality in the neon lit night-time hit on Archie and his gang, played out like the best video game you've ever seen and leaving game designers everywhere thinking ""why didn't I think of having two foxy girls in day-glow bikinis and ski masks as the main protagonists in my game"". Laura Croft meets Rihanna for the no attention span generation.Ultimately who wins? Is it the girls themselves who ""win"", driving away in the ultimate expression of impractical consumer ""shit"" or is it consumerism itself?",Spring Breakers
195,final-fantasyxcjo,Best movie of 2013 so far,8,27 March 2013,"When I first saw the trailer back in early January, I though this was going to be the dumbest movie ever, especially when I saw who was in it and Im still not over James Francos cornrows, lmao. But when I went to give it a shot this past Monday, I was totally shocked when I left the theater. Spring Breakers is the biggest surprise of 2013, and a damn good surprise at that.To start with the positives, the characters are the man strong point, which was a surprise, really? Selena Gomez, James Franco(with cornrows), and Venessa Hudgens all steal the show, while Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine also supply strong performances. I was also a huge fan of the lighting and the bright colors when nightfall hit the Florida skies. Also for all you guys who like to think with more then just your head, there are boobies bouncing, butts jiggling and hormones flying throughout from start to finish, so there is no shortage of that. Also the pacing of the movie was fantastic, you never felt like it got boring at any moment. Also the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly.Now the negatives, the story was simple but kind of dull at points, but honestly that wont matter if you go into this movie with no expectations. However then end finale irked me a bit, to the point where it felt out of place, and was to a degree, out right ridiculous. That was honestly the only downside to this movie, in that it could have ended so much better. The moral of the story is also confusing, to the point where you tell yourself, ""Is it telling us to do these things or is it telling us not to do these things on spring break?"" But those are to only negativesIn conclusion, this is so far the best movie of 2013, a fresh new take on the whole ""teen party"" like genre. The movie is not perfect, but it is original and love when people try to attempt something fun, fresh and new, which in the end is what Spring Breakers is. 8 out of 10",Spring Breakers
196,TheDancingPanda-692-744536,I don't even know where to start,3,10 July 2013,"Let me begin with one giant Ughhhhhhhhh!!!Where to even begin? The first 20 minutes of the movie are ""spring breakers"" going wild, pouring beer on breast, making out, and very awkward (very zoomed!) views of party girls yoohoos. If you're over 30 I'm sure it would make you feel like a pedophile just to watch the opening scene. Oh yea, did I mention the other 70 minutes of the film was exactly the same, and worse yet, the same party scenes were used on ballpark, around 20 times. I'm sure if ran into a few of the topless teens on a night out on the town I could recognize them, because they were shown that many times.Selena Gomez was trying to act like a skank but with held much of her actual skank ability and seemed awkward and fake throughout. Vanessa Hudgens let her slut flag fly from start to finish. Don't think she had to work all that hard to portray her character. And Franco? Dear god. I honestly spent the whole movie trying to figure our If I was supposed to be laughing or convinced that he was a crazy ass gangster. It seemed like a bad piece of sketch comedy for an hour and a half.Oh by the way the guest appearance and sex scene by rapper Gucci Mane was the least amusing thing I've seen since the STD videos in health class.To sum it up: for some reason I'm giving it a 3/10. I don't know why to be honest. Maybe parts of it were just so bad I'm thankful for it being over. After the 50th time ""Alien"" says spring break. Spriiiing break you'll fight your will to hit the eject button I promise. More repetitive than a 7th grade poem. I'd recommend drinking yourself into a stooper and getting into a screaming match with your neighbor before renting this.

I like rap music, and I like Gucci Mane. I also like beautiful college girls, and I like James Franco. So I gave it a shot. This was a very good movie, very well written, amazing imagery and storytelling, and the acting was really good.The girls were all great actresses, even pop star Selena Gomez was really good. Gucci Mane was too actually. The movie is very adult themed, which the movie posters kind of didn't tell you.There is a lot of nudity, and I mean a lot, slow motion nudity with hard drugs and alcohol all over. Even some serious sex scenes. There was a lot of really cool slow motion scenes, simply focusing on imagery and cool music, which kind of touches an instinctual and emotional chord in you. Blow, and Heat, kind of did the same thing.I honestly cant recommend this enough, it really isn't done justice by the advertisements and poster. This is a sick ass movie with a bad ass story and great characters. The acting and directing are serious as any other movie, give it a shot.",Spring Breakers
198,HenbaineAccount2,Don't spring-break your bank for this movie,1,11 April 2017,"It's a car-crash of a movie.. I saw previews after believing it would be some tacky chick flick and though hey this actually may be a bit edgy and maybe pretty good so gave it a watch..I remain on the fence.I am still unsure as to whether the girls are supposed to just be such deluded kids going on about how magical it all is and how they fit in blah blah blah is meant to reflect how vapid, shallow and clueless and easily led some kids can be now. How we live in a world where people want wealthy music video-esque lives,kids imitate violence,gang culture and sexuality shown on TV and video games without thought- or whether the director was trying to make the audience believe that it was magical and special too and therefore ultimately get their point. I really hope it was not the latter..The movie is pretty well shot and although not a skrillex fan the music worked very well, (apart from the rendition of Britney spears by a ""gangster"" on a white piano- played over slow motion graphic violence and girls dancing with guns,which I believe was supposed to have serious credibility and pose some level of depth,dear god.) But overall, if it is meant to be taken seriously and not as some ironic, farcical teenage fantasy this movie fails at every turn.The whole concept fell flat for me,the girls robbing a restaurant seems plausible when you see the actual execution but they wouldn't get caught after handling guns & grabbing till cash with no gloves? burning a car? sure.Then the ""good"" girl, (why did she even go?) gets all freaked after they get arrested in Florida and meet ""Alien"" the gangster and goes home crying on a bus. ( I had to laugh after remembering Selena saying she loved playing an edgy film role, sure you played the good kid who freaked..)Alien is ridiculous. Some slimy, perverse and overtly stereotyped gangster trying to show depth while being like ""look at all my s***"" constantly.does not work. He comes across as a creep. So stone cold gangster, self confessed dangerous man- hanging with silly little teenagers who are so tough, till one gets shot in the arm, whales like a baby for 10 minutes and- yep, goes home crying on a bus as her increasingly off the rails friends remain with Alien.What really got me was the ending. There was a spat between Alien and some other dude over who runs the area. We know there is bad blood but it escalates pretty fast after pink hair girl gets shot. Suddenly the two teenage girls are somehow ultra calm super killers- they manage to hold powerful guns in the air, one handed - AND take out like ten gangsters at once in cold blood, while super ultra dangerous killer man Alien,is taken out by one guy after 3 seconds. They then kill the opposing guy in his hot tub while he makes no attempt to do anything but shrug.There is then the whole let's call out parents to tell them what a magical time we are having and how we will be home soon, after committing mass murder and stealing a car.The only thing that makes the whole scene even barely feasible is the fact that in the beginning of the movie before casing a cafe they made references to pretending they were ""In a video game"" while seriously hyped on cocaine. The lines between reality seem to have been seriously blurred for these girls, who have gone from being bratty,squeaky girly teens with an bit too much attitude dancing around singing and drinking to stone cold, hardcore killers (in pink unicorn balaclavas and bikinis)less afraid than a gangster and able to shoot guns like pros in seemingly zero time frame.And lastly, the massively grating over use of the term ""Spring Break"" often followed as gratingly by the words ""forever"" and ""bitches"" wow. yes we get it,they are on spring break.And are trying to be such badass bitches,like, you know,forever.Okay now that's established- are we done yet? Or maybe that's the point.you can take two views on this movie:1. It is actually deep and satirical showing the flaws and over ideas of kids and adults who go to any lengths to replicate the media ideas they see to the point where they are living false and dangerous lives like many people of fame. People who cannot live up to the hype of their self created persona in the end.2. It is supposed to be some drug hyped violence fest for horny guys and teenage girls with too much attitude who love the idea of being crazy harlets in the sun fueled by booze coke but then it goes too far so they become serious robbers & killers for the kicks while still believing what they are doing is magic & special.",Spring Breakers

200,funkyfresh91,"You go for the action, you stay for the ""action""",8,22 March 2013,"There are certain movies, just like there are certain people, that you need to be in the right mood to watch and be entertained by. This is basically a weird, half-stupid (in it's brilliance, appropriately so) B movie that works bizarrely well as a cross-section of modern American college students, and the party culture that pervades beach states and college towns. It's fun. It's campy. It's excessive in it's violence, sexuality, drug use and just over-all perversion, because ""Spring Breakers"" is drug culture in every glorious, hypnotic, DESPERATE and barbaric way. The objectification, the racism, all just icing on the pot-brownie. At the same time, it can be shocking enough to make a point... while still wiggling its bare tits in slow motion for a third of the run-time. F(expletive) yes I'd see this movie again, James Franco played a redneck drug- dealer and Riff-Raff parody hilariously well, and the amount of booty that flashes on the screen at any point in time is SCANDALOUS and lemme just say, the sex in this movie, the sexiness and the straight up sex in this movie, is just great. It really is. I don't think a single person under the age of 40 wouldn't/didn't drool through half the movie. These girls act out the life I dream about 5 to 6 times a week with the door locked, only for two straight hours and with a sick soundtrack (not a Skrillex fan, but it's true), and just pure excess dripping from every pixel like the poison that corrupts our youth... and parents of teenage girls would do well to see this movie, just so they know what their slutty teenage daughters could be up to, blowing some idiot with grillz behind Taco Bell, wasted, cracked out, drenched in beer and wearing the same neon bathing suit she's been wearing for two weeks... because the raw honesty of drug culture in this movie can be just as terrifying as more realistic or less retarded drug movies.So to modify my statement from before, anyone male under the age of 40 would probably drool their way through Spring Breakers.

201,emeraldorc,Empty watch...,4,30 June 2013,"Let's hit the breaks here... This a coming of age movie, perhaps 'a natural born killers wannabe', The target audience was clearly already depressed parents concerned about what there kids could become and teenage girls who fantasize about the bad boy life without consequence (Blame the Pitbulls and the Kanye's of this world). James Franco impressed me with how he handled the roll of the 'only white boy' growing up in the hood. An attempt to put some taste into an already disturbing and distasteful plot. Lord knows a black thug using some white girls would not only look inappropriate but will send so much outcry to stop this movie even making the cinema. The teenage girls for me seemed not have a personality, so I did not connect or remember their names, they were just a number, I don't know if this was deliberate but this ruined it for me because now this is just a gangster film. All in all the film comes at you from a scaremongering social perspective and opens your eyes to the fact that society is obsessed with violence and teenagers are the audience. 4 out 10 for me.

202,enilenis,Misleading Poster,9,17 December 2013,"This was one of the movies that I went into thinking it was going to be one of those dumb teenager flicks that I enjoy for being bad to the point of entertaining, yet how surprised I was to find a visual masterpiece and an actual adult story arc with character development! I'm used to encountering actor notariety films written to highlight specific stars, while turning every other character into a throwaway role. It was refreshing to see the stars of this film being treated like everyone else, receiving an equal amount of screen time and no special treatment.James Franco's acting is simply outstanding. Many times I had to remind myself who the person was and still I could not believe how well he carried it.The poster doesn't do this movie justice. It has to be the case of the marketing department taking over and putting a spin to attract younger male audience when in reality this movie should sitting next to Requiem for a Dream and Trainpotting in the adult section.The film is by no means deep or thought provoking. Yet another story that didn't have to be re-told, yet one that set a task and met it. It surprised me and that means it delivered more than I asked for.

The only character even remotely relatable leaves halfway through, and the rest are just girls gone wild caricatures behaving badly with only the barest semblance of motivation.I'll admit I appreciated all the T&A, and it was that and the hope of some plot development that kept me watching, but it was like watching a porn without the porn.I'm not sure what effect the director was trying to achieve by the constant voice-over repetition.

He is a genius almost along the lines of Depp in diverse characters. The lighting and cinematography were very fitting for this movie and gave the illusion of a real life documentary (I thought this was based on real events). Considering the ending of a movie is so critical to it being enjoyable, this shocking and thought provoking ending will have you torn between odd and amazing.However, I think it could have been a far better and higher rated movie had the slow story line added more story elements (or at least had them less hidden), maybe play more on their crime spree than on their romance so the viewer can hate them more as the dangerous, greedy criminals they are. The very strong message against today's ""gangsta, bitch-ho, Benjamins"" culture - which made me up my rating - was also hidden quite well.But understand, in my experience an IMDb rating of 6 is nonetheless relatively decent.",Spring Breakers
205,xThe_Fury,Spring Breakers - A Movie Review by Brandon Krzysztof,5,26 March 2013,"If you are going into this movie expecting a non-stop party movie like Project X or 21 and Over, you aren't gonna get what you were expecting. Instead you are going to get a movie that features partying, but the main focus being the twisted minds of some of these young women.Spring Breakers is the story about three wild party girls (Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, Rachel Korine) and their easy going friend (Selena Gomez) who want to leave school for spring break but don't quite have the money yet. The only way to resolve this in the eyes of the before mentioned three girls decide to rob a restaurant and get money for their spring break trip. When the girls get there they start doing what they came their to do and ended up getting arrested and later bailed out by a gangster named Alien (James Franco)and then things suddenly change for these girls.I went in this movie with an open mind and not seeing the trailers and even though it was hard to watch sometimes; I respect what the director (Harmony Korine) achieved. He had a great style of shooting and I really appreciated what he has doing. There are times where their is a voice over over a scene of partying and then two minutes later, the scene where the voice over was being spoke came. I think that was pretty cool and really haven't seen anything like that. The performances were pretty decent. The three girls who were wild and crazy played their part like I would imagine, pretty annoying but that is the point. Selena has the innocent girl who tags along worked out very well and James Franco as Alien is hilarious. He can do that role of a goofy wannabe gangster off pretty well. The tone of the film was pretty dark and I think that worked pretty well. Like I said before, it's not a non-stop party movie like it looks like. It gets very dark and very deep and I think that alone makes it better.A few people left the theater when I saw this and I understand why they did, it wasn't what they expected. Either you like or you hate it. If you aren't digging it 15 minutes in, you won't dig the other 75 minutes. There is more substance in this film that those other party movies. It does have flaws, its hard to watch. Some of the things these girls say, think, and do make you uncomfortable and question is this what society has come down to. It does open your eyes to the world we live in now where the stuff seen in this movie is what people do now. The second half of this movie gets very hard to watch and takes a direction that I think hurt the film. But its not that hard to make it through it.Overall, its a different kind of movie but with a nice directorial twist. It is a tale of two halves. I am not going to recommend you watch this movie and theaters and this movie is a coin flip on whether you not you like it. Wait for the Redbox or Netflix if you want to watch it.2.5 out of 5 stars.bkstaReviews.blogspot.com",Spring Breakers
206,cblazo,What was that?,3,20 August 2013,"This movie was scattered, unclear and boring right off the bat. Three girls that get a hair up their butt about stealing money to go to spring break instead of earning the money. Then bringing in their sheltered friend (Selena Gomez) to the chaos. In real life, these people wouldn't even be friends. They are too far apart. Then they head to Florida and play horrible music throughout. The Britney Spears reference through the movie is so teeny-bop it made me want to puke. James Franco was definitely having fun. He played the part surprisingly well. I liked him all the way. I also liked some of the imagery near the end. Although. The ending was so fake and jacked. The O.G.'s would of had the upper hand for sure, but they all kept running up front. No battle situation would be like that. Overall. This movie was crap and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 years old. I don't understand how anyone could see this movie 4 times and call it one of the best movies ever! I mean REALLY??? This movie could of been better and if James Franco wasn't in this film I would of given it a negative numbered review.",Spring Breakers
207,Evolution-X,This not a movie for everybody.,8,8 July 2013,"Wow, I see so much negativity on the boards and on the reviews about this movie but I might as well just state what I myself thought of this movie.Now I can very well say that how I came to know about this movie was from when I had seen some promotional pictures of the four lead actresses in bikinis. Now I won't deny that I found those images to be enticing, but then I looked up the page and saw who directed it, I had an idea of what kind of movie this was going to be.Bear this in mind, I kind of knew what I was getting myself into and I can say that I enjoyed this movie and took it for what it is, but that isn't to say that I didn't see any flaws in it at all.I have to respect Selena Gomez for trying to break out of the Disney image she had before. I can't say for sure if the Disney image is still on her, but she showed that has some decent acting ability. Also, it's a shame that her role is cut out halfway through the movie. I was hoping to see her one last time before the end.Also, James Franco seemed to have shown that he could act well. I can say that he has come a long way from when I first saw him in this cheesy teen movie called ""Whatever It Takes."" I know most people know him as Harry Osborn or even his work in ""Pineapple Express."" He has range as an actor and while in some ways I found his character to be a little annoying, he still pulled off his role well.Like I said before, the movie wasn't without flaws. I mean I didn't like how Selena Gomez left early. I noticed Rachel Korine left early as well but I also didn't like how her character didn't have much to do. She slept in the dorm mostly, as well as drive the getaway car from the robbery earlier in the movie and then showed her getting shot and finally showing that she wasn't as tough as she thought she was. While it did kind of give her something to do, it wasn't enough. Selena, Vanessa and Ashley had more to do than she did and they also had more lines than Rachel did.One thing that puzzled me when I saw it was the ending. I seriously have my doubts that a couple of girls who probably never fired a gun before would go through a drug dealer's mansion yard completely unscathed. I found it somewhat comical, but it was kind of stupid.Another thing that puzzled me was the letter Faith (Selena) was writing to her grandma. I later on thought that maybe she either lied in her letter about her vacation or didn't really tell her about all the debauchery that went on. I think maybe it was to show that she had a wild side but fronted it with the whole good girl thing she had going on.Now I still have yet to see a few movies that Korine has done. The only other one that I have seen is Gummo and when I watched that movie sometime recently, it reminded me of the style that was done for this movie. I know Gummo was released more than a decade before this, but I saw that it was somewhat similar. I still have to see Julien Donkey-Boy, Mister Lonely and Trash Humpers. I have seen Kids, but that was a movie that he wrote.Anyway, this is a movie you either like or dislike. I can see why some people would dislike a movie like this. I know it didn't have a big budget. I know that the movie's cinematography looked like it was filmed with older cameras. I know that there was no real story to it, but if someone were to really see what this movie was truly about, they would be able to understand it better.Maybe I am just a little too open-minded and have a strange thing for indie flicks, but I still enjoyed this movie. However, I wouldn't rate it too high because I felt that it was a little strange and different than what I am usually used to seeing. Maybe I should see more of Korine's movies, as well as more independent movies. I still took it for what it is.Again, this movie is really not for everyone. Just know what you are getting yourself into if you watch it.",Spring Breakers
208,Suave785,Outrageous storyline but the cinematography saves the movie,7,30 December 2013,"This movie gets a bad rap because the storyline is truly unbelievable and doesn't add up. I mean hot college girls don't fund trips to spring break by becoming hardcore criminals. They also don't strive to be evil and commit crimes on a daily basis. Lets be honest you go to college so you can be that guy or gal that doesn't have to turn to a life of crime to survive. You want to find a good job and provide for your family. That is what makes this movie more of a fantasy with a touch of reality then the other way around. The filming aspect of this movie is a masterpiece though. The director really know how to capture key moments of the movie and add just as much reality that was needed. I went to college and I can tell you that Spring Break is a time honored tradition where you literally go crazy for a week. The movie shows that through gratuitous nudity, drinking, and partying for the first half of the movie. It also exposes the loss of innocence when experiencing something new. The movie shows how four women are so focused on making memories and living in the moment that they forget about planning for their future. To actually understand what is going on in this movie you have to be able to relate. I am not talking about relating to being a bad girl or a hardened criminal. I am talking about understanding that sometimes in life you do things out of the ordinary to live in the moment and forget the life that you actually know. If you don't see a little of yourself in this movie then my friend you need to live more.",Spring Breakers
209,rapidcereb,Love the Style,8,30 September 2014,"Upon the first viewing of Spring Breakers, while I loved it, I wasn't sure if the director had focused on the serious tones of the movie enough as opposed to the wild drunk teenagers just partying in slow motion.Now having watched it a second time, I believe it was very well balanced. I have been a fan of Harmony Korine for a long time now. Though I have only seen one if his movies, ""Gummo"". Not sure how many times I have seen Gummo, but at least ten. For some odd reason I watched it a lot in my younger years, also watched a couple of movies Harmony wrote the screen play for. And you can see that Harmony has better mastered his style, the similarities in his shooting style from his earlier years are well noticed (and appreciated).Loved the actors, the premise and the style. The colours are vibrant, and the movie is an entertaining ride. This is one of those 'experience' movies, where the viewer gets to experience things they may or may not want to. This movie, i would say, is not so much for entertainment, but more for provoking emotion and meditation. Would make a good watch along with Gasper Noel's ""Enter the Void"" and Nicolas Refn's ""Only God Forgives."" This being said, the ending is unexpected, but fulfilling.Highly recommended!",Spring Breakers
210,krismancini,Masterpiece,8,21 June 2018,"I had no idea what to expect before watching this movie. But I'm happy I watched it, because it was 90 minutes of pure trance. That's all you need to know... Quentin Tarantino said this was his favorite movie of 2013; what more do you need to watch it?!Besides that, I don't need to summarize the plot for you because the blurb on IMDB is enough. It's basically about four girls who go to Florida for Spring Break, but a lot of illegal stuff happens along the way... and it's one of Franco's best roles on top of that.If I had to guess what kind of people would enjoy this film most, I would say young people. Parents, let this be a warning and an added layer of awareness... or a fun ride down your own memory lane.Watch it and be pleased. Oh, and don't be like most of the IMDB raters who couldn't handle the truth that was unfolding on screen, and probably opted to turning it off... this is one of those films were you can't judge it by its rating.",Spring Breakers
211,joshvonhousen,Well...,6,16 February 2016,"I recently heard a lot about this film, one from my classmates at school saying that it is a terrible movie. And, I believed them. I remember seeing the previews and thinking ""Just another crappy teen party movie."" But, then I heard an interesting piece of information: this film was directed by Harmony Korine. You know, that critically acclaimed director who has one of the most experimental styles in film today. So, this struck my interest. So, I rented it, and here's my thoughts. I saw another review on here that has the summary title, ""A Lot Of Style, Not Enough Plot"" or something around those lines. And, those are probably my feelings, too. This film is drenched in art house nuances, from the lighting to weird constant repeated line voice overs. I also enjoyed that during the party sequences, the camera switches to this weird, distorted kind of thing that looks absolutely incredible. James Franco, Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudges (However you spell that) all give great performances. However, that's all the good I can really say about this movie. I mean, the story is nothing that interesting, but the style was enough to keep me interested in the running time. Check it out for some artsy, avant-garde film making.",Spring Breakers
212,Mikeboy0001,It's Not What You Think!!!!,7,1 July 2013,"A movie with Disney stars, and in a genre described by IMDb as ""Comedy""? Yeah right, like that will ever be on the top of my list. But it's not that at all, not even a light comedy. When I gave the movie a chance, I already knew the cover had little to do with the content, but never thought it would be this different. To see this film you must first forget it's Vanessa Hudgens or Selena Gomez on screen. I'm European, and so many scenes seemed gratuitous at first, and dumb as many American school movies, but when I got the tone it, they started to make sense. The only thing I knew about Selena Gomez was she starred in Disney and was girlfriend of Bieber, and pictures of both always reminded me of how much the World we live in, is artificial. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by her, she had a good presence and showed great acting skills. Franco was believable as a gangster, Hudgens really seemed a crazy slut, and the rest of the cast where OK too. The movie isn't perfect, but it's well filmed, has some strong points, so in my opinion, it's well worth watching. If you liked ""Kids"", you'll probably like this one too",Spring Breakers
213,kidjay83,if you skim through it you get a neat music video,3,21 June 2013,From the opening visually i liked the look of this film.It pulled you in on a visual level . That was where the intrigue stopped for me bottom line .This film is very long music video with a shoe string plot attached to it .Don't be fooled all the praise that comes from this movie is strictly fanboy.Very pretentious film starts out with trying to get to springbreak then windes up being a thelma and louise type format .The only good acting is from franco .Evertyhing else is caricatureish anyone who says harmony korine is great.Is obviously a fanboy go watch for yourself and don't listen or buy into the hype. This movie is done up by a college film student who is on the 5 year plan.If your looking for a message go to western union this movie just doesn't have a solid one .At least one that uncovers something we didn't already know about the youthes of today.,Spring Breakers
214,Catrician,"The best film of 2013 so far, an excellent and provocative experience",8,11 April 2013,"Oftentimes people will have incorrect expectations when viewing a film. This generally happens with more hyped up films, and I think the biggest example of this is of Welles' ""Citizen Kane"". You're probably wondering why I would compare such a film as Korine's ""Spring Breakers"" to something that's considered to be the greatest film of all time, and they honestly have little in common besides the fact that people seem to expect such great (or, flat-out different) things from each film. Spring Breakers is something of a mixture of genres; each with their own specific feel. It's part avant-garde, part crime comedy, and part satire. It's honestly quite different from any other film I've ever seen. Korine uses colours in Spring Breakers to give a psychedelic experience, along with images of the ""good life"" of partying, sexual images, drugs, etc. in order to really get the viewer wrapped up in the feel and the lust for these kinds of things, but Korine doesn't do this to encourage the viewer, but rather the opposite. The film has an incredible amount of flashbacks. I'd say about 75% of the images in the film are shown again at some point or another. I equate this as Korine is almost showing a memory of a party; you don't remember things in chronological order necessarily, but rather in order of importance, and oftentimes one remembers something over and over if it was particularly...memorable.Another interesting aspect of the film was that it started out with this trippy half hour, but it slowly turned into a more plot-based film that was more of a crime-drama than this avant-garde looking flick that could have made Stan Brakhage proud. It then slowly degenerated back into this flurry of lights and sounds, perhaps reflecting on the party life never ending and always just repeating itself. While Franco gives an excellent performance, the girls are mostly wooden in acting. Whether or not this was intentional, I'm not sure. Perhaps it was done due to not give anyone emotional attachment to any of the characters? If so, it would fit hand-in-hand with the total lack of character development. Even though the film is unique in execution, its message, or rather in this case what it satirizes, has been done since the sixties, if not earlier. It seems as if it was a cop-out in this sense, but luckily it was creative enough to bring something new to the table.Rating: 8/10",Spring Breakers
215,simplisticreviewsblogspo,Guilty Pleasure of the Decade,8,23 March 2013,"Review by Matt:Every once in a while, a film comes around that changes your life. A film that you'll tell your kids and grand-kids that ushered in a new wave of cinema. A film that will be a landmark moment where all film- goers collectively get out of their seats, and initiate ""the slow clap."" A film that that will be broken down in film schools across the world and film historians will bring up in conversations with the likes of ""American Beauty"", ""Casablanca"", and ""8 1/2."" Well, this isn't this film, not even close, but despite what a lot of people have said, and are saying, ""Spring Breakers"" might not be pretty, but it just might be the biggest guilty pleasure film in recent memory.""Breakers"" can be lumped into two categories; it's either a soft-core porn that is cashing in on the popularity of ""Disney girls"" who are trying to break free of their kiddie-image, but they are being exploited just as bad, if not worse. Or, you can look at it as a caricature of Spring Break culture that you might have seen on MTV back in the early 1990s, and an expose on small town life versus ""the real world."" I promise, I will not dig that deep into this movie, because if you go into ""Breakers"" looking for deep meaning or a reason why the movie was made you are going to miss out on a film that is super fun, super awesome, and super stupid, but stupid in that way that you might have said back in the 1990s, ie, STUPID FRESH!In case you heard, the plot is simple. Four friends, Candy, Cotty, Brit, and Faith, don't have enough money to go to Spring Break in Tampa/St. Pete, Florida so they do what any rational young college student would do; rob a restaurant to finance their trip. After their successful robbery, the four girls head to Spring Break for the time of their lives, that is until they're arrested and the party is over, or is it? Bailed out of jail by a small-time gangster named Alien, played by James Franco in probably his most memorable role to date, things go from bad to worse for the four friends as they leave behind their dreams of the best Spring Break ever, and it turns into a nightmare.....or does it?Part of the fun of ""Breakers"" is not knowing fully what the film is about. Yes, at heart, it's a skin flick that shows PLENTY of boobs, close up shots of crotchal areas, and any parent's nightmare of what their precious little boys and girls are doing in vacation resorts around the country from late March to April. Yes parents, your kids are probably having unprotected sex all over the place, while doing funnels of Natty Light, after doing coke off a townie's a*s. C'mon, we've all been there before.A few things surprised me about ""Breakers"" besides the fact that I truly enjoyed it, almost too much in fact. Say what you will about Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens; but they can act. Yes, I said it, they can act. I was almost surprised at how down and dirty they got, especially Hudgens, who gives the 2nd best performance in the film, but that best performance goes to Franco, who creates a character that is part Tony Montana, part Saul from ""Pineapple Express,"" and part rapper Paul Wall. His creation of Alien is in fact other worldly, and his ""Look at my sh*t!"" and for lack of a better term, gun blow-job scene, are the highlights of the film. And like my co-reviewer said in his ""OZ"" review, Franco loves to mug for the camera, and he's at his best in ""Breakers"" completely self-aware that he is in complete control of character. Oh, by the way, for you wresting fans, your old pal Double J, Jeff Jarrett, makes a cameo as a Jesus freak. Yes, that Jeff Jarrett.This film is polarizing, and people are either going to love it or hate it, just like most of Harmony Korine's films. Let me put it this way, if you've seen ""Kids"" and ""Gummo"" and you hated them, save yourself the money or just be lame and watch ""The Croods"" or ""Tyler Perry's: Temptation.""""Spring Breakers"".......""Spring Breakers"" forever.........Check out more reviews at Simplisticreviews.blogspot.com",Spring Breakers
216,MahaFilmGuru,"Not What you think, very art-house!",7,4 August 2013,"Wow James Franco, your nuts man! I thought this film was going to be fun, no no no, it was dark, sad, real look at what it means to be generation X. Like 'Kids' films rarely give a real look at what it means to be young. Trust me, this is real life, this is like reality TV. We have 'girls gone wild', we have warring gangsters, an we have people like James Franco out there that can barely speak English.The soundtrack, the mind eviscerating images and colors, and James Franco really did it for me. Selena Gomez was also a very believable in her role. Well the other chicks, straight up crazy! I think most people will dislike this movie, it doesn't cater to many people. It is an art-house film for the young generation. And just like in the movie, the young generation most likely doesn't care about art-house films!",Spring Breakers
217,parasolspetticoats,The party is paramount,8,31 March 2020,"I saw Spring Breakers in theaters during its original release, knowing nothing about it other than it being a Harmony K. movie. I knew two things from the opening act. 1. Keep an eye on A24, 2. The visual aesthetic and tone had me hooked.I don't claim to know what Korine's intention was with making this movie, but the satire is fairly thick. If you take the overzealous, party ready nature of the ladies as literal, of course this movie would come across as absurd; but it's absurd on purpose.If you are familiar with the artist David LaChapelle, the visual style, colors and pop-culture centric surrounding of this film would fit nicely in one of his books or music videos. It's over the top, neon covered and beautiful.I feel like this movie is only skin-deep if you cannot appreciate the borderline exploitation themes. It comes across like youth culture in 2011-2012 was being poked at a bit, while also showing you why a sexed-up, nineteen year old party animal would, in fact, want Spring Break to last forever.P.S. Franco is hilarious.",Spring Breakers
218,timvincent-90482,Average movie goers beware.,3,14 June 2015,"It takes a certain kind of person to enjoy this film. I've seen movies with very simple plots, artsy pieces that leave me wondering what the hell the film was even about, and I have enjoyed them. I even sat contently through the movie Rubber, which is about A telekinetic car tire. This movie however.... Well let me start like this.The way the movie is shot is interesting. It's vivid and neon, it makes me feel like I'm at a rave the whole time. Just the art in the shooting of this movie is fantastic. If the movie had no words, the visuals alone paint a picture of A generation of people, A scene. It is a truly remarkable spectacle. UNFORTUNATELY, the movie did have A script and A story...It's hard for me to say what type of person would like this film, but I will say if you are an average movie goer who likes A picture for its story then DO NOT bother with this film. You will only end up turning it off half way through and wasting your time. I unfortunately sat through the whole movie, I got it from Redbox near my girlfriend's house. When the movie concluded I had to apologize to her for bringing it over. The colorful way the movie is shot is remarkable but there is NO content in the rest of the film. This movie could've been just 20 minutes in duration and it would be the same and accomplished just as much. The plot is boring, slow, and just plain dumb. The acting isn't anything to talk about, the characters are annoying and unbelievable, and the ending is more ridiculous than a C- horror flick. In fact, I have actually seen many C- horror flicks with better plots that were all around better cinema. I wish it was better so I could've enjoyed the art aspect but unfortunately it has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I am an adamant movie goer.",Spring Breakers
219,Philattio,It Needed More Control. Very Repetitive.,6,29 May 2013,"The story focuses on four college girls who enjoy taking drugs and living the party lifestyle, getting drunk and/or high and playing games with each other or singing songs together. During the end of their semester of college they discuss their desire of attending spring break out of town. Unfortunately they don't have enough money to travel. So three of the girls Brit (Ashley Benson), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) decide to go out one night and rob a diner, excluding Faith (Selena Gomez). They arrive and successfully taunt and threaten the money out of customers and employees and drive off with enough money to get out of town. They arrive at Spring Break, and party taking drugs and getting drunk with jocks, however they find themselves arrested until a gangster white guy called Alien bails them out of jail taking them under his wing and showing them to his badass, thug-lifestyle. The girls start to find themselves in danger as one by one some of them take a bus back home leaving two of them left to help Alien do the unthinkable and embark on a deadly mission to target his antagonist at his crowded mansion.In terms of casting I was pleased with the fact that former-Disney stars Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez were casted as such crazy rebellious girls. With James Franco showing us an even more gangster side of him since Pineapple Express. The story is good. The plot is good. The casting choices are good. The soundtrack and cinematography is good. However, the editing is just over the top. From the opening shot I cringed at what I saw. It is one of those movies that shows you something annoying and keeps going and going and repeating itself. Lines are repeated over and over again. The story is told with flash forwards and flashbacks with constant voice overs repeating annoying lines like ""Spring Break"" over and over again. This motif is cool at some parts but otherwise way too over done. I felt that the film tried too hard especially to change the way we see Hudgens and Franco in such a raw, materialistic, contrasting roles. It is definitely enjoyable and worth watching but throughout you will find yourself cringing or even annoyed at the repetitiveness. (You'll know what I mean once you see it). Selena Gomez definitely shined in this film and Rachel Korrine had her moments while the other actors just seemed like they were trying to hard. To sum this up, it is a cool film with the right cast, yet it is edited in an over ambitious way. I love the idea and the concept but (I might get hated for saying this) I think it should have been directed by someone else and scripted and edited just a little bit differently and toned down while a lot of parts in the film was unnecessary. I decided to be nice and give this a 6/10. Despite my disappointment I still recommend you watch this. Its totally worth the watch.",Spring Breakers

Hoping for a good story to make the joy of Young women in scantly clad outfits seem legit but boy was I wrong! What an awful story, I have not seen this big of a waste of time in hopes to see breast since some stupid 90's movie about disco days of the 70's. 3 bad ass girls who love to party and 1 simple Christian girl all want to go to Florida but only the Good Christian girl has money. The sexy bad asses decide to steal a car and rob a mom & pop restaurant and magically get enough to go to Florida! They party, They of course have sex with willing guys who by todays standards look like douche bags but I guess that is what girls are into these days! They get busted and are bailed out by the local rapper that no one seems to recognize outside of the stage. Local rap guy played by James Franco takes the girls around rough neighborhoods, try to get lucky with the girls and by then the good Christian girl wants to go home. More and More party's girls are liking the ""White Rapper"" who is really a bad ass drug dealer and seems to be a loner fighting the gang bangers for control of turf and drugs. when by now I am bored senseless and 1 party girl is shot in the hip and wants to go home, wow complete stupidity! but the last 2 party girls are loving the rapper and playing with guns, roughing up people, stealing while wearing bikini's but for the life of me , The Cramps music Video Bikini girls with machine guns was much more entertaining and better music in 3 minutes that this piece of crap movie was in 90 minutes. Well I won't give the ending but no way in Hell a gang of 15 would all die to 2 college sluts running around in Bikini's shooting up the place and no one within miles would hear the noise. The girl then decide to take one of the gang bangers hot car and head home, like no way in hell any of this seems logical?

223,faithisagoodthing,The genius of Korine and Franco = Magic,10,20 April 2013,"This movie was brilliant in breaking down what's fundamentally wrong with our current society in terms of greed and ""I WANT IT NOW"" culture, in a unique style format.I've read people complain about too much nudity but if you have ever been to Spring Breakers, it's much much worse, just see Youtube.Also, has everyone forgotten that to be famous now unfortunately, you basically have to act like a porn star? Real talent is now last on the list, and in any given movie or in real life the aim is to show some skin, whether needed or not. Example, look at twitter or facebook and the idiots who post naked photo's of themselves, whether famous stars or not, yes - it's wrong, because there is a time and place for everything but Korine just created what's happening now to the extreme and I thought it worked perfectly.The performances were alright by the four leading ladies, they didn't really have enough to play with in terms of story but the whole movie still worked with the amazing soundtrack.James Franco deserves an Oscar for his role (such a versatile and method actor), and I hope the Academy finally gets something right, as I feel the role of Alien (inspired by a rapper named Dangeruss mainly, who should be getting much more media attention) will become iconic and should be rewarded.If you don't know Korine's work before going into this movie, then yes, you will be extremely disappointed or in shock, so best to check out his previous work beforehand but for those who do, then enjoy the ride it works.Clearly, this movie has already divided people's attention, regarding some saying a classic vs. the worst movie ever or just plain confused.However, at least Korine has made you slightly think than the normal blockbuster. Try, watching it a second time and breaking it down further, this might help (so many different interpretations you can take away from this movie, if you just open your mind).Anyway, I truly enjoyed it and will never consider Britney Spears ""Everytime"" the same way again, that alone deserves the Oscar win for Franco.Well done, all involved and a cult classic for sure.",Spring Breakers

225,AdamBowl23,Could Have Been A Lot Better,6,25 June 2013,"First off, I'm glad I read that the writer of Kids directed this movie so I had a bit of an idea of what to expect style wise and that was my biggest problem with the movie. Its like watching a dream, which some may like, but it was a little too trippy for me. The reason why I gave the movie a 6 is mostly for James Franco, who was great in the brief moments he had dialogue and even the parts he doesn't. And as far as dialogue goes, there's not much of it. I will say the director does achieve with telling its story for the most part, its just the way he does it that's irritating. Its definitely got that ""arthouse"" feel to it, and with a movie about girls in bikinis, guns and drugs it doesn't seem to fit. I was reminded of the movie Traffic and how Steven Soderbergh directed it in a kind of abstract style. But the key with that film is that he allowed for a lot of character development. In Spring Breakers, Franco really seemed to be the only character with any kind of development. The girls are given a little back story, but not enough for me to really care about them. The story is really good, which the director also wrote, I just think a better director could have made a much better film of this if they got their hands on it. I know Korine didn't want to make the typical Hollywood movie and he succeeded, but there's a lot of great directors out there who don't do the typical Hollywood films that he could have handed the reigns to. Probably the oddest thing about the movie is that both IMDb and Wikipedia say this is a comedy and drama. This is the farthest thing from a comedy. Franco is funny in some moments but this is a pretty heavy drama. I think some people may look at the cast and see comedy and think this is a fun spring break movie. Trust me, its not. The only other positive thing I can say is about the soundtrack, which was quite good, aside from the Britney Spears songs. Skrillex does the score and I hope they do more movie work in the future.And on another note, for any wrestling fans out there, Jeff Jarrett has a brief role in the beginning as a youth pastor, that cracked me up.",Spring Breakers
226,Fuad_Ramses_IV,"Just pretend it's a video game, like you're in a movie",10,3 July 2013,"Harmony Korine is an auteur. His films are entirely his own, which leads one into utter confusion when he switches gears from dirty white trash cinema into an unexpectedly profound Spring Break experience. This film is definitely not for the traditional audience of its stars, as it depicts its actresses in an entirely different light than what they became famous for. In no way are these characters friendly child pop icons anymore, but darkly tragic criminals, placed into a surprise journey of danger, indulgence, love, and self-discovery.It sounds weird, doesn't it? Certainly not the movie most people would expect, though this movie does a fine job in destroying these child- stars' family images and proving they have potential to be serious actresses, even if this movie presents them as students who just want to have a good Spring Break. It's more than that. They want a life-changing Spring Break, and here it is.Like many of Harmony Korine's films, this one is a visual collage of events, though there is a most definite storyline underneath this, unlike many of this other films. Despite it's extreme contrast to his other movies, it is still 100% a Harmony Korine movie in the sense of its abstract structure and style, only a lot more focused and visually stunning. This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen due to its surreal neon party atmosphere, its extremely moody vibes and music, and of course, its bikini-clad characters who don't change their clothes very often, and that's a good thing.James Franco is almost unrecognizable in this role, because he plays such a unique character compared to anything else he's done, but he gives an absolutely phenomenal performance and completely steals the show as the hilarious and endearing gangster with the heart of gold.As a fan of Harmony Korine's work, I was expecting to like the movie, but the promotion of this movie doesn't prepare you for the trip it takes you on. The film retains the director's hypnotic charm, yet it completely shatters and reinvents his whole style of film, as well as the teenybopper images of its stars by giving this movie a surprising amount of depth and dare I say coherence. Not only is it my absolute new favorite of Harmony Korine's, but perhaps the most beautiful 90 minute experience I've ever witnessed.I think this movie is going to stick with me for a very long time.",Spring Breakers

229,danielbiland,"Really Great Film, One of my Favorites",9,21 July 2019,"Now, this is not the sort of movie that I would watch, but when I did on someone else's recommendation, I ended up really loving. Where do I even begin on how great this film is?First of all, the main theme is quite clever and relevant to even today's times and is conveyed beautifully and clearly through the visuals and events of this film's runtime. Second, Cliff Martinez's beautiful techno and well composed score permeates this entire film, making me engaged throughout. The non-composed licensed Skrillex and other music is good and helps the movie too.The cinematography in this movie is also absolutely incredible and helps convey the themes beautifully while also keeping the film interesting and engaging. It has an intentionally interesting and dreamy feel to it.The acting all around is good from all the main cast, especially James Franco as the scary yet light criminal Alien. James Franco becomes the character seamlessly. The other female actresses are also good and get into their characters pretty well too. But Franco steals the movie here (in a good way).The characters get pretty much no development, but I think that isn't a problem and ironically works in this film's favor when you note the main themes this story is trying to convey. Another small (but good) thing is that the pacing of this film is good. All of the loud scenes are broken up with more quiet, ambient scenes. Overall, the pacing feels right. Not slow, but not too fast paced either.Overall, Spring Breakers is a very well made, really great film that is good (in my opinion) for most teenagers and adults. Definitely too mature for children though. If you are of age, would strongly recommend.",Spring Breakers
230,zeetgyst,A Promissory Note for a Movie,3,16 February 2014,"To start with I liked the movie ""Kids"", the script for which was co-written by Spring Breakers director Harmony Korine. However I am left wondering if Korine should have also entrusted this script to ""Kids"" director Larry Clark because the movie it most reminded me of was Clark's ""Bully"". Both movies had young bodies on prominent display, hyper-sexuality, a pervasive sense of menace and seemingly vacuous main characters. However, Bully is at least partially based on a true story and the soullessness of the main characters are made disturbing only by its basis in reality and because there is some attempt at development and back story.However, after watching Spring Breakers the only thing that disturbed me was the hour and a half I just wasted. Although I eventually found the short-cut mix-mash style of editing tedious, there is some effort to make the movie visually interesting beyond the obvious eye candy of a movie set in a fantasy world of the ultimate hormone and drug fuelled Spring Break. On that basis alone, and the only reason I didn't give it one or two stars, it can be distinguished from the ""frat boys getting laid"" comedy the title suggests, or the ""guns n bitches"" Hip Hop music video it came very close to emulating. However, each time the movie attempts to surprise and develop what might seem to be an interesting plot line, it spins off in yet another direction. Surprise is offered in lieu of content.The only shadow of a character in the whole movie was offered by James Franco. However, the movie centers around four female protagonists and each time one of them was in danger of becoming a real human being she disappears. The potent sense of tension and danger hinted at throughout the film never pays off. Any chance at provoking thought on the vacuous hedonism on display is lost What is left is a silly unreal ending involving unreal people.",Spring Breakers
231,saad_sa11,Ride that hedonistic neon nightmare or GTFO,9,23 March 2013,"Just came back.Expected a fever dream. Got a fever dream. Loved it. Unpredictable and original. This movie will challenge you and will burrow into your head for days. The more I think about it, the better the movie gets. Totally subverts your expectation of not only being a simple movie about spring break with chicks in bikinis but also what would occur in such a crime movie. James Franco gives a revelatory experience, just completely transformed. The girls also are surprisingly good for newcomers to such a type of movie.Exuded that coolness like Drive, with the mostly midnight neo-noir feel. Korine's naturalistic eye of taking you to another world far from normality (Gummo) worked wonders here. The sunny and dreamy landscape of Florida is right up in your face. Ride that hedonistic neon nightmare or get the **** off.Sex and violence go hand in hand as they do here, exemplified by the silencer scene. The movie's half-cocked for a while much like Drive. It carries that Chekhov's Gun for a long time until violence occurs. Brilliant pacing and a great exercise in juxtaposition such as the Britney Spears montage thanks to the fantastic editing.Loved how it had two main protagonists with Selena Gomez and James Franco, and how their characters had fairly similar philosophies of wanting to live in the moment forever even if they're on completely opposite sides on the morality spectrum.Delicious cinematography, had one memorable long tracking shot of a robbery all from the outside looking in from the getaway car. The Malick comparisons are apt with the spoken word-like narration, flash-forwards and flashbacks, philosophizing, and ethereal camera. Some of the ethereal electronic score reminded me of Solaris, and lo and behold it was the same composer (Cliff Martinez, who also did Drive).",Spring Breakers

But they had the bad judgment to work in this dark, indie-style film that they weren't at all suited for. I'm sure the movie itself can be defended on artistic grounds. I didn't like it, but it does have a certain depth. It might have been believable if edgy actresses had been in the roles rather than fluffy teen idols. I mean, who can imagine Ashley Benson or Selena Gomez having anything to do with the people on the other side of the tracks?

Four very morally defective and erratic girls decide to get their little taste of Spring Break that they desperately crave, seeing how life at their college is very dull and maybe even ""miserable"". Automatically you either hate these girls or love them. The characters they portray might be a dramatization of the scary example of girls today, either way they convince you that these bitches aren't your average bitches. Though they are truly tested when they are finally living the life that they've waited so long for, being the unauthoritative themselves they can finally be.Up-leveled by Franco's performance of portraying the most charismatic creeper of all time, though the dialogue throughout the movie is repetitive and sometimes flat out laughable, strong cinematography help give the illusion that everything can be perfect.

234,Extraneus92,This is an important film,8,3 September 2013,"This film largely gets a bad press. It is criticised heavily and pushed to the sidelines, but when I watched it I wondered why. I loved it. I mean I can understand why so many people hate it, it's an easy film to criticise, it's not perfect by any means, but at the same time there's a very special meaning to much of it which is delivered in a very different way to other meaningful films. I think that this message is hugely overlooked in this film and as such this work bludgeoned by film goers. To me this film is an aesthetic tug against our fast paced, vulgar and narcissistic society. It provides a subtle and neat critique of all that is wrong with our modern selves; the now factor, the psychopathic lack of remorse for actions, the party as hard as you can, the vulgarity and tackiness of the pursuit of money. These are topics that the film handles well.It's certainly not your everyday film, in fact I'd go as far to say that this is one of the weirdest things that I've ever seen. This is a film that you should see; love it or hate, you won't forget it. It's a marmite film, but hell, who forgets about marmite? Never the less, I'd remark that this is an important film with an important message at the right time. In summary, it's overlooked and deserves a viewing.",Spring Breakers
235,johreh,Stay away...far away...from this piece of c***,1,16 January 2014,"Big spoiler alert! Why? Why was this movie made? Why did they do what they did in the movie? There are so many things in this movie which are completely unbelievable and so stupid.It could actually been pretty good but somewhere mid through the movie just went south.Just a couple of examples below: Towards the end of the movie, Candy and Brit phone their respective mum to explain how much better they will be at everything and better at living. And this they do shortly before they go on a rampage with their ""saviour"" Alien.The movie is full of repetition. You see the same scene over and over again. You hear the same sentences over and over again. This makes the movie feel extremely slow. I just wanted it to end...and every time the technique with repletion was used...I just wanted to turn it off...but I forced myself to watch it to the end.And Alien decides to attack his enemy towards the end of the movie with the college girls. How likely is that? Where were his other friends...what happened to them? Perhaps they went on spring break up north? It is just stupid. To add to the stupidity, his enemy knows there is a risk of an attack but somehow Alien and the college girls manage to simply dock next to his house. The girls then single-handedly take out the entire mob, with one gun each and only one magazine each. And this is with a gun you cannot shoot with only one hand. But the college girl can.This movie is simply awful. Stay away Oh yeah, one more thing before I let you go...the girls are supposed to be in the same college class.

236,ThomasStone,James Franco's stoner nightmare,6,26 November 2013,"Starting off, I only saw this film because it had James Franco in it (as I can imagine a lot of you did as well). The plot is a very simple ""quid pro quo"" where Hannibal Lector ends up at spring break, meets some demented teenagers who finally come to their senses and go on a last hunting spree to free themselves from this terrible world of drugs, sex and alcohol. The film has quality but doesn't know how to express them well, for example the very eighties lighting and use of colour is a highlight of this film. The montage has interesting psychedelic effects, but they don't really add to the atmosphere nor do I feel that they show how you would experience any of these substances. When it comes to scenery you can see this film is made after 2010, heavily influenced by music videos and a strong stress on tits and ass. There is barely use of metaphorical play (aka META), a scene where the girls stroke each other and play games in the hallway of their dorms shows their innocence, but there is no counterweight where they lose it so it feels like a fleeting moment of inspiration from the writer. I still gave it a 6 for the ideas it holds as they are becoming part of our modern culture, alas having a poor execution.",Spring Breakers
237,dwoolfe99,"Lurid and at times entertaining, more style than substance",5,31 March 2013,"I saw this tonight and was hoping for better but was not entirely surprised. Spring Breakers plays like a warning about the growing immorality of youth culture, but is curiously lurid and titillating in the way it goes about delivering the too obvious message. The irony was not lost on me.The movie is about a group of four college girls who go on a spring break holiday to a hot spot in Florida. Three of the girls rob a store with plastic guns to acquire the money for the trip. In Florida, they party hard, have sex and do drugs. Eventually they are incarcerated on minor drug charges. It appears that they spend one night in jail. They remain clad in bikinis while in jail and while being arraigned in court. They are then bailed out by a local gangster who wants them to be his harem. Three of the four go along and immerse themselves in his criminal world. The ""good"" girl, Faith (Selena Gomez), declines and returns home.Apart from the Gomez character, none of the other three have distinct personalities. They are essentially interchangeable. They have no arc. They are not corrupted. They were always corrupt. The gangster isn't someone who manipulates them. He is more like a kindred spirit.Gomez does display a flash of acting chops here. The rest are portraying characters too shallow to really gauge their performances. It's too bad the Gomez character exits halfway through. She could have continued to function as a foil for the other three. What ensues in the final acts is predictably just an escalation of everything which had gone on before it but without the morality of Faith as a counterpoint.Korine unfolds the tale in a fragmented and disjointed manner, using slow mo, color saturation/de-saturation and other stylistic techniques. It plays like an extended music video. At its best, it's hypnotic; at its worse, pretentious. Either way, the stylistic overload will leave most viewers feeling rather detached. We cannot really connect with these characters or their circumstance. They are not subjects but objects. This is not a morality tale about how crime doesn't pay. To Korine's credit, he avoids such cliché. However, the film is too thematically shallow for anyone to argue that it isn't simply voyeuristic. This movie is more about flesh than anything else. You know those movies which are comedies and/or romances that feature lots of footage of scantily spring breakers dancing in and around beaches and pools, featuring lots of jiggly parts? This has about as much of that as any 4 of those movies put together. If you like to see hot young women both scantily clad and un-clad, this is not such a bad thing. But let's call it Girls Gone Wild. Don't give us Girls Gone Wild under a thin and shallow artistic veneer.",Spring Breakers
238,Nitesh_Singh,Watch it only if you want to see your teenage stars grown up and spoilt,4,15 December 2014,"In my opinion the sole purpose of this movie was to either revive the image of the teen actresses to a wild and bad girl one or to cash in their innocence of teenage stars so that audience feels like watching something erotic.The plot is twisting and going back and forth throughout the film. You can see your favorite actresses doing drugs, dancing semi-nude and doing James Franco(seriously, what was he thinking before he signed this role) in the pool.

239,dass-istnumberwang,Hated it,2,26 November 2013,"I'm sure there's a lot of detractors who would call it ""sexist"" or ""exploitative"" or whatever, but that's not what's important. What's important is that this movie is BORING. Sure, it's well produced, but what does that matter when you have a two hour movie with maybe three scenes worth mentioning? And going back to that controversial stuff, there's been some debate as to whether it's female empowerment or sexist exploitation. I've heard it argued both ways. In fact, I watched this in a film class I'm taking, consensus seemed to be that it was some sort of commentary on how the kind of life you see in music videos makes for a nice fantasy, but isn't all it's cracked up to be. While I can say there's some merit to that theory, as it certainly feels like a two hour long music video (and I say that as a bad thing), frankly, I have a bit of a tendency to take things at face value. I would honestly say the writer/director (whom I can't remember the name of) just decided to make the movie sleazy and exploitative as a substitute for actually having anything interesting going on. And since it made more than 4 times its budget at the box office, apparently it worked! I guess there's a market for two hours of horny women in bikinis doing drugs and committing crimes! As a gay male, it's clearly one I'm not in.In conclusion, would not recommend.",Spring Breakers
240,soldier9428,Watching this film was like spending 94 minutes in hell,1,29 December 2013,"If I ever wondered what someone could use as a torture device against me, I think I have found the answer. 1 out of ten isn't enough for this movie to describe how dreadful it was. First things first, this film was marketed as a comedy. Not one scene in the entire movie was funny, I never chuckled once. If anything this movie about killed my sense of humor for awhile. This movie doesn't even try to be funny, constant slow scenes with sad voices are not funny. The girls aren't even very hot almost all of them are sub par and this film presents the sexier scenes in an odd sort of way that isn't sexy at all.So the film first starts off with a bunch of girls robbing a store because they don't have enough money. Which makes you think, how terrible must these girls be at planning, like anything. If all 4 of them had worked at McDonalds for just 2 months, they'd have over 1,000 dollars. Yet all they could find was 320, makes no sense. So of course this conveniently explains why 4 rich college girls are ruthlessly robbing a store (how often does this happen) and needlessly bashing everything that looks like glass with sledgehammers.So then we finally get to the actual spring break, and for the next 30 minutes you will watch mostly the exact same scenes play out in front of you as you've already seen. At some point the film director arbitrarily decides that he doesn't want to make a movie about college partying, and instead decides he wants to make a gangster film. Now you'll watch as the movie glorifies guns and violence for the remaining duration of the film (meanwhile none of this has anything to do with spring break).As a Britney Spears fan I also have to add my opinion about the scene with the song Every time. I felt very insulted to see Britney Spears and her song defiled by this movie showing constant scenes of people beating each other up, shooting each other, and generally just toting guns around like they were toys all while her song was playing.If you are a Selena Gomez fan then I really recommend you stay away from this film. Firstly, because she isn't even in half of it. Secondly, because the movie is mainly about her friends doing bad things and while she stays out of it her friends basically become the focus of the film. Lastly because Selena Gomez herself said her fans shouldn't watch the movie.But it isn't just Selena Gomez fans who shouldn't watch the film. No one should watch this film, it becomes unbearable to watch towards the end and succeeds in insulting almost every member of the human race. Personally this movie was everything I despised and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",Spring Breakers
241,stephenmonachello,Art House wanna Be Garbage,2,16 February 2014,"Every year we get an Independent film that tries to be trendy and tries to be a ground breaking art film that tries to sway the audience to feel what the characters are dealing with throughout the film. This year we have Spring Breakers starring Vanessa Hudgens, James Franco, and Selena Gomez who is trying to breakthrough more adult roles. The film is written and directed by Kids director Harmony Korine. Spring Breakers is about four adolescent girls who are stressed out from college and upset that most of their college friends are having fun during Spring Break while they are bored, they have no money, and no car. The girls are determined to have fun so they rob a restaurant and steal one of their teachers El Camino while telling each other act like it is a video game. The girls reach Florida and what ensues for basically the first fifty minutes of the film are deleted scenes you would find for Girls Gone Wild. Lots of musical montages with drug use, topless girls, and lesbian make out sessions repeated over and over again for the viewer to endure. After fifty minutes, the girls are arrested and then bailed out of jail by a rapper/drug dealer named Alien played by James Franco. The second half of the film is a bunch of teens wanting to be gangster except for Gomez who breaks down, cries and heads home. The girls and Franco take turns performing felicio on the guns before deciding to rob people to gain more money to help pay for their college, end their stress, and end their boredom. What ensues for the last thirty minutes of the film are more musical montages of pointless sex scenes and constant drug use that are embedded in a matrix style shootout. The film is a prime example of when a director and a writer, in this case they are the same person try too hard. The film tries to give a trippy feel but the film is just an incoherent mess that even Rob Zombie would laugh at. As for the acting, there really isn't any. Dialogue is at a minimum throughout the film and do character development what so ever. There are no characters that the audience could relate or even identify with. Before this film I enjoyed most things that the actors and directors have worked on. Spring Breakers is easily one of the worst films in cinema history and is to date one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have seen and own a lot of bad films, some are guilty pleasure but there was no pleasure with this film. This film left me empty after viewing. I give them film a half of star and that is being generous. Avoid at all costs.",Spring Breakers
242,rolfhub,More than meets the eye,7,20 April 2013,"Innovative, provocative, deep, and thought provoking. Just let it sink in.It's interesting to read the reviews and realizing that probably, everyone has different thoughts about what was really meant. Also, different people seem to be offended by completely different aspects.My first thoughts (before reading the reviews) were that probably, the director wanted to make the point that just because a person is female, white and healthy, this does not mean that the person is really likable, morally grounded or to be trusted. When the girls sit in prison, cramped together tightly, all of the girls seem to be vulnerable, likable and you just have to feel pity for them. All that they wanted was a little fun and excitement and a break from the boring daily life, and now they are in prison. So you hope the best for them. At least I did, because up to this point, they didn't seem to be really evil. Of course, it was not normal or acceptable to rob a restaurant, but on the other hand, they didn't really injure or kill anyone, so that was not pitch black, just a minor crime.Enter the tough guy (""Alien"") that smells like danger big time, so you can more than understand that one of the girls decides to abort the spring break and head home. It probably was what I had done, had I been one of them. For moral reasons and my own good.But during the progress, I felt growing sympathy for ""Alien"", since at heart, he seems to be lonely, unfulfilled and empty. In German, we have the nice word ""Ersatzbefriedigung"" which means that a person feels lack of something important, which is hard to get for him/her, so other enjoyable things are amassed (excessively) to distract from the lack. And he lacked a lot in life, like: close friends, a girlfriend, a purpose in life, a religion, pets, a soul mate, or whatever fills his soul. All his bling and toughness can't distract from this void (and his lack of mental maturity and education).Just as he has (possibly) found soul mates, his life turns to the worse. His ex-best friend is now his enemy, climaxing into a scene where he even tries to kill him, just to get killed himself.But what I found much more shocking and disturbing is that the two girls that stayed by his side, attracted by the bling, easy money, and sex appeal of his lifestyle, switch from somewhat sociopathic but still harmless to cold blooded killers that mow down about a dozen of gangsters (or gangster wannabees) without any hesitation, not questioning any aspects of their killing spree. For me, these girls are the real ""bad guys"". Not only do they kill violently, they don't even have a real reason. They could have left Alien just like their two friends did, but they seemed to be much more ready to commit murder that Alien ever was. Actually, they seemed to be looking forward to it, enjoying the feeling of power that comes with loaded weapons.So I think this is one point of the film: Who seems tough and plain evil may still have a very human and vulnerable side, and individuals with a sexy body, pretty face and caring parents still may have a soul so dark they are ready for everything, just to get what they want.Also interesting was that many reviewers find the nudity and sexual innuendo really offensive. I didn't, because no one was forced into any kinds of sexual acts or harmed, and there weren't minors present. So I didn't consider it as morally wrong, but it sure was much more wild and exhibitionistic that what most people would be comfortable doing.Just one of the ""Ersatzbefriedigungen"" that the girls try out. They feel such boredom and dullness in their daily lives that they need all the sex, drugs and booze that they can get just to feel a bit less bored and monotonous. If one goes to such lengths, risking health and control over oneself for extended periods of time, wasting lots of money and risking jail time, just to feel less bored and somewhat happy, that's a fat alarm sign.I think that the choreography is being done in a very subtle but effective way. Watching scenes of nudity and excess, you just feel that the characters are not in for a _little_ fun, they need the most extreme dose of everything just to feel ... anything. At the surface, you see a lot of naked skin, and may like it in some way. But the feeling that something's not right, that the fun is more illusion than reality is so strong that you just know it can't end well. This (intentionally) makes these scenes somewhat uncomfortable to watch: You'd like to enjoy them just like the characters try to enjoy their holiday, but that's overshadowed by the overwhelming feeling of sadness and despair at the core of the superficial fun.But if one is more offended by the nudity than by the cruelty of the girls, this should make one question their own morals. Mine tell me that I condemn every act where individuals are unnecessarily hurt, killed, robbed, or forced into something. Consensual sexual acts between grown ups are IHMO not immoral as long as no one is forced or tricked into anything. But that is probably one of the many points of the flick: It makes you think about what you regard as moral, immoral or downright evil, and for whom you feel sympathy or pity. Or how far you would go for a little fun.It's on the surface a film with superficial feel to it, 'music video vs. video game vs. softcore erotic vs. situation comedy'. But beneath, it can make you think deeply, raising questions, but without giving definitive answers. Everyone has to think for oneself.",Spring Breakers

245,mbyrne_1664,Very Poor Movie,3,24 March 2014,"The idea of a movie about the trouble you can get in on Spring Break peaked my interest. The movie has a few big names in it with Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens and James Franco all playing main roles. The positives i can muster up for this film are that it is artistically shot using some good camera angles, sadly that is where the positivity ends. The first 15 minutes consist of 4 girls screaming and doing handstands in a hallway.The girls pull of a crime which gives them enough funds to go on Spring Break. Three of the girls are party animals, one is religious but likes to have fun with friends (Selina Gomez).The girls get arrested during a party which keeps cutting to people partying on the beach topless and flipping the bird and get brought in front of a judge. It is there Alien (James Franco) bails them out. The film takes a darker turn in which we see how the girls react to being part of Aliens gang. It is dark yes but also very boring and seems to go no place fast. The story is minimalistic and bogged down with flashback's and flashforward. The acting isn't bad as Franco does play a villain well but the directing seems well off. It seems this piece should be on stage educating kids about the dangers of partying to hard rather than on screen.To sum it all up it is a very poor movie that looked good in the trailer. The only reason I haven't given it a 1 star is because some of acting is good. Don't waste the hour and a half of your life I did.",Spring Breakers
246,pkrayden,Spring Break Forever....,7,1 July 2013,"Let me just begin by saying this movie is trash. Upon first viewing I was like oh so this is unconventional, artsy, and preachy but weak in standard storytelling markers. Its like a long music video or an extended trailer. Then I let it marinate. This film is only genius, BECAUSE its trash. If you hate this movie, like I was about to- then guess what, you're supposed to. The movie begins with 4 girls. Faith and three other nameless bimbos try to escape the commonality of college life and for faith her overbearing religious surroundings for some time of fun on spring break. And right from the jump the movie asks, what would you do to escape. Three of the girls rob this place for ""a good cause"" and at first you the audience are supposed to think and sympathize with their thinking but hope they get set on the straight and narrow. However this movie employs a different tactic, Harmony Korrine (KIDS) takes the anarchy of youth and cranks it to Sodom and Gomorrah-like levels to make not only the characters but you ask: When do we say when its enough, when should we walk away, when should we turn this off? The characters kept this psychotic high regard for spring break and told themselves that they can do anything they want with no consequences cause ""its like a video game"" so nothing matters. It should be said that the intention behind the film is to make us question what that limit is, though seeing that the film is rated R; Harmony's target audience can't see the film. Genius as it may be, They casted former well known Disney actresses in these dark roles to try to get kids to see the film, how ever illegal it may be. All in all its an extremely flawed movie even if some of its flaws are on purpose. Its dark, independent, its preachy, exploitative (Harmony probably wanted to put more porn in it) its 80% visual torture to your morals and beliefs.

All you hear is ""Spring break forever bitches"", you see a bunch of people dancing in a beach, shaking booties and drinking alcohol. The characters? Non existent. They had no substance, no development, nothing to keep you interested or care about them. Just stupid girls who knew only how to snort powder and grind their bodies. James Franco was good but hell, the repetition in this movie was so annoying i couldn't pay attention to what he was saying. The ending was just as dumb as the rest of the movie, no surprise there. What a waste of time.",Spring Breakers
249,clare-karu,in a word: depressing,5,13 August 2013,"This movie is like Beckett without as much humour and with guns, sex, drugs and Britney Spears instead.I can't say its completely awful, as much as I'd like to.There are some amazing and horrifying images.His take on the extreme superficiality of youth culture (in all its guises from Christian youth group to hip hop debauchery) and the zombies it leaves in its wake is severe, but convincing.There are complaints about Alien's voice-over of 'Spring Break... Spring Break' as being pointless and annoying. That's the point of it. To be pointless and annoying. His life is pointless and annoying. He is trying to capture something of greater meaning at times. But doesn't get there and is seemingly satisfied by superficialities.The movie is deliberately repetitive and slow paced. That is to annoy you. That is to make you confront your own need for distraction and comfort.Possibly the most cutting moment is when one of the female leads is speaking on the phone to her mother that she thinks that the meaning of life is to be a good person. Just before going on a shooting rampage. I think that just about says it all for this film. These people just don't have souls. Their lack of soul has got something to do with pop culture and hedonism. Whether soullessness is the product of the culture or the producer of it is a bit unclear.It doesn't really get beyond that.",Spring Breakers
250,Babydollgirl,It's worth watching!,9,15 March 2013,"You have to watch this movie at least once in your life. I think it has a ""cult"" status. BUT if you are actually into this spring break sh*t and you enjoy partying to skrillex then you will obviously not get the huge ironic in this movie and you'll think of it as this "" totally awesome"" movie that reminds of project X. Knowing any other Harmony movie would make it clearer what the movie is actually all about. But if you can't get it, then you're just a part of the sh*tty society who watches reality TV shows like jersey shore. This movie shows the tragedy of life involving "" the American dream "" as it's motto, it's drama and comedy in one. Just take a look at the cast, and you'll see how brilliant Harmony is. Pink Unicorn Ski masks, Britney Spears songs, Praying before Spring Break... all them Disney girls, Franco ( who is phenomenal btw ) acting real thug life, Gucci Mane with his ghetto ice cream tattoo, the Atlanta twins who just play themselves.. ( The only thing that sort of annoyed me was Rachel Korine, his wife, who plays one of the girls. I don't think she is really good at acting but maybe it was all on purpose, to make her look stupid. ) All I can say is. This is a cool movie with an unexpected ending.",Spring Breakers
251,puruagarwal96,a nice movie. Starting is a bit slow but later on the movie catches up. a nice go! Must watch for teens.,7,1 July 2013,"This movie is very good. Adults and teen +17 will surely love it. Children below 16 should not go for it. Its not made for you. Moreover, a complete package. you will enjoy. Well you all know the story so i think i don't need you to tell that. All the actors have done well in this movie. Well the movie contains lots of spoilers and profanity words but without this the movie was incomplete. At the end you will be completely thrilled. But i think that the movie should have been 15 to 20 minutes longer. The story was folded up very early and no re appearing of Selena saddened me. She should have had some more role and movie didn't have so much of twist so the twists and thrills are also lacking but overall this movie is great a must go for 15+ teens and young adults. You all will surely love it!",Spring Breakers

Unfortunately it is and i am deeply sorry for the unlucky individuals who decided to watch this in cinemas. I only started to watch this because critics gave it a good score. I only watched half an hour of this film and bailed. This movie has an unnecessary amount of nudity. You cannot go through fifteen minutes of this film without seeing nudity. The music is just remixed mainstream music which is alright. You might as well just get the soundtrack. The Casting is unforgivable. I couldn't get over the fact that a star who is most famous for her Disney roles is smoking and drinking and doing bad stuff. That's something for her private life, not the silver screen. James Franco's career would have been over after this movie if it wasn't for his alternate movie This Is The End.

253,rodstohogs,Filmed like some dark and depressing dream with constant flashes all over the place,3,11 July 2013,"In some ways I was tempted to give this movie less stars and some more. The acting was very good! The plot was OK and had potential.I think it was lost in the directing and Artsy camera filming. Not Just the modern shaky camera tricks, but the whole movie was filmed in some sort of dream sequence with flashes to the beach parties every two minutes and random flash backs, flash sideways, flash forwards constantly through out. Yes there was a lot of implied sex and plenty of naked women flashes. But the constant flashes of sex, nudity, drugs was a bit like watching some psychedelic MTV video that are nothing but random flashes of random body parts bouncing,drug use,implied sex, guns, violence. They also managed to make all the sexy flashes dark and depressing. Defiantly not something kids should see. Those of you adults that just plan to watch it for the sexy girls and nudity flashes. You might even find yourself board and tired of all the random flashes very quickly.Even the constant music through the movie got annoying. Was like some hypnotizing whale calls or something. Not a pleasant sound and it did not stop at all. I really wanted to like this movie, All the way to the end I wanted to like it. It was just dark, weird and depressing.",Spring Breakers
254,rondo898,The World Methodist Council Presents . . .,2,27 March 2013,"When I purchased my ticket to see Spring Breakers, the girl at the counter issued a verbal warning that the movie contained ""Much nudity, sex and violence."" ""Keep going,"" I replied. ""You got my attention."" She should've instead warned that this movie is a bring-down. At first, it's like a high-quality version of the Girls Gone Wild videos. Stunningly-beautiful examples of young American womanhood getting it on, and it's superbly filmed. That's the best idea for a movie since . . . since . . . Girls Gone Wild! How could anything go wrong? Primarily, there's the script. It may have been written on the back on an envelope or a cocktail napkin. Or they may have taken it from one of those dreadful 99¢ amateur Kindle novels. A movie consisting solely of scenes showing Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens . . . uhm . . . ""showing affection"" would've made me happy, but after the scenes of drug and alcohol use, the girls meet up with a local gangsta who wears gold prosthetics on his teeth. James Franco is deliberately made-up to irritate one's retinas.At this point, if only they had concentrated on the girls, the movie could morph into a Floridian version of the X-rated 1999 French film *Baise Moi* (banned in Awstralier), but the pace is more like *My Dinner With André* -- without the dialog.It's suddenly a chix-with-guns movie, and I'm down with that, but for a violent shoot-'em-up flic, it moves painfully slow. A slow action-movie? That's like 3-D in black-and-white or a horror movie with cute, cuddly bats. How can it be that scenes of the girls fondling firearms make you wonder when the movie will end? The crippled dialogue becomes more-and-more annoying, and the apologetic ending induces dismay.It would be silly to complain that such a movie is unrealistic and not even plausible, but the scenes of the holdup and then the girls wearing bikinis to court are absurd. Each quarter-hour becomes progressively worse, and I began to suspect that the the movie was covertly funded by the clergy in an effort to turn youth away from sin.Leaving the theater, a kid in the group of youngsters ahead of me exclaimed, ""That's the worst movie I've ever seen!"" Spring Breakers may thus induce young men to join the priesthood. *See?* it says, *Give into temptation, and this is what will happen.* The wages of sin are tedious to watch.Anyone can make a bad movie, but it takes a perverse genius to ruin fine T&A.",Spring Breakers

256,Tyler_Seymour_Wallach,"What are you, scared? Scaredy cat.",9,3 April 2013,"I just came out of this one and I think I'm in love. Before I write about the film, let me say that I went into this film with no expectations. I didn't know if it'd be funny or weird or mainstream or uncomfortable. As a fan of Harmony Korine, I know what he is and is capable of, I know he's a joker, but I know he's also a unique person who follows his vision to its end, whatever it may be, but you can never tell if you're going to get something you'll like. He gives you images and leaves you with thoughts. You don't have to think too much during his movies — he doesn't much either, so I doubt it having much subtext — but that doesn't mean there isn't something worth talking about when they're over. You may feel it's a little, or it may feel like a little, but if you can appreciate what he's trying to depict, there will always be life to talk about once a film of his concludes.When I said you don't have to think much during the films of Harmony Korine, that is not to say you should not think about them afterward. If you've shown given him your time and patience and watch the film to its ultimate conclusion, I doubt anyone can say they didn't like or take something away from it. James Franco's performance seems pretty revered – I would call it amazing. Some sequences will stick with you — Korine himself says he doesn't really remember the plots of all the movies he's loved, instead sequences or scenes — like Britney Spears' ""Everytime"". Okay, I was in a theater of five — three of them left, one of them during that segment. But if you sit through it all you're certainly not going to forget it! And if you leave, well, you're certainly not going to forget it, but you will resent it for the time and money it took, but that's silly, don't resent that stuff. Just enjoy the movie you see.The film could be divided into halves – the first being the prelude to Spring Break and Spring Break and the second with James Franco. During the film, and it's awful to think like this during movies because it only distracts you from the movie, I thought to myself ""The direction is kind of shapeless, the juxtapositions could be sharper, but it does have edge and the repetition is effective, it's vivid and it's making me sick,"" in a good way. That could be how I could summarize the film for someone, if they wanted, but the direction finds itself in the end. Otherwise those words can be my basis of thought for this movie, which is an otherwise unique movie-going experience.As I write and think more about the film (I just got back) its nonstop audio/visual indulgence is so effective. Spring Breakers is a film that is very telling for this generation, if a little insane with its concept. ""Just do it like a video game :: This is paradise :: Spring break forever ya'll"" things people today feel like. And of course, the repetition is done to unforgettable effect, but especially the line ""You're scared, aren't ya? Scaredy cat"" toward the end. Mmm this is good cinema.I guess what I wrote was too long to be put here, but I thought James Franco was simply amazing in his role and go into further detail about that here: https://forizzer69.wordpress.com/Boy was he amazing.",Spring Breakers

259,DMan_76,Not a family movie.,4,29 June 2013,"This movie is mostly for teens, party goers, and perverts. If your not into T&A and drugs then this film is probably not for you. There is quite a bit of T&A and the main three girls look quite nice in this film. I didn't like that the director tried to make this a artistic film. For me the concept didn't quite fit. What annoyed me most about this movie is that it had very little dialog and most of the lines were repeated over and over again like a broken record. Some of the stunt the girls pulled were not very realist either and would have got them put in prison or dead in the real world. If Selena, Vanessa, or Ashley is your favorite actress or you just like the T&A then you might be able to tolerate all the artsy crap and stupidity. Out of the hour and twenty-seven minute of this movie there is only about fifteen minutes of somewhat decent dialog. So rent it for the T&A but don't expect much from the lines, acting, plot, etc.",Spring Breakers
260,samgeaney,"A Trippy, Dreamy, Misunderstood Masterpiece",10,7 October 2014,I would usually look at a title of a review on IMDb like this and think pretentious w**ker but for Spring Breakers I found myself being the pretentious one. I couldn't exactly put my finger on what it is that made me adore this film so much but I definitely only have feelings of love for it. In my eyes it a masterpiece that plays out like a dream with solid performances throughout and wonderful editing to involve the audience in the trip. The florescent colours and soundtrack add to the trippy quality of the film making for very entertaining viewing. Yes the film does not have a very linear story line but nor does it lack a story unlike some other Art-house films. The film chronicles a group of young girls decent from innocence into hellish chaos. Korine's selection of females to play the role included the former teen idol Vanessa Hudgens and her replacement in the form of Selena Gomez to play with our emotions and tarnish their good name thus strengthening the destruction of innocence. I originally felt James Franco was an idiotic choice to play a gangster rapper but he embodies the character so well that I could scarcely even begin to think of an alternative.Korine's best film and one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in a good while.,Spring Breakers
261,toinou328,Such a wonderful nightmare!,9,4 July 2013,"I don't even know where to begin...Harmony Korine is a true artist. That might be where to start, because everyone seems to diss this film and its director, and I'm here to disagree. He kept his style, and that's why I loved it! Most people who went to see this probably didn't know anything about him and also probably didn't care about who he was or what he had done before... The guy wrote the 1995 drama ""Kids"" directed by Larry Clark, which was the most controversial film of that year, dealing with hard and difficult themes to portrait on film (such as teenage, sex, drugs, street life etc...) and treating of problems people didn't want to face. But Larry Clark's documentary and realistic style made the movie look like an open critic of this generation to the world, and was therefore more accepted by critics. In 1997 Korine then directed the very strange independent film ""Gummo"", which didn't really have any scenario, just a presentation of a little town in Ohio and its very bizarre set of characters... But the movie was still pretty good because of its weird and sentimental atmosphere mixed with documentary-style filming. He also made other independent films, but all of them always stayed in the ""weird"" and ""unknown"" section of DVD libraries.Here Korine has grown up and gained more experience with the years. This is by far his most accomplished work, but unfortunately by distributing this movie to a bigger audience, he encountered a lot of criticism and hate, just because more people saw and discovered his style. I am afraid that most people today just watch films to have something to watch. Movies nowadays are being more consumed and less actually watched and thought-over. The poster and the trailer for this film were a parody of these easy-selling films that the Hollywood industry makes every year, who don't have anything particularly original (and that's on ALL levels : directing, script, acting, score are all very similar to any other film made by the studio), but instead of seeing the parody of these posters with those good-looking girls, people took it seriously and thought this was just going to be another teen movie about spring break with some fancy action scenes and a seen-before plot. But no, this was something NOBODY could've see coming... or at last not general, ordinary, image-dose seeking spectator.Now lets actually talk about the film, I kind of got lost here! First things first : the cinematography and the look of this film are amazing. Even if you didn't like it, you can't say that this wasn't beautifully shot and crafted. The camera work is probably the best I've seen in a long time, and the neon colors add a really good look, which contributes to the atmosphere the film is trying to have. Then, the acting is great. James Franco totally takes his character to another level, even thought Korine has done an amazing job with this one, as he often never disappoints when it comes to characters. The girls are good too, and I was really surprised by Selena Gomez. Now comes the score and music : noting to say, absolutely brilliant! All songs fit perfectly to the scenery of spring break, blending Skrillex with hardcore hip-hop but also getting on the sensitive and emotional side sometimes with a Britney Spears cover (seems like she actually made some good songs) an awesome atmospheric score by Cliff Martinez, as always (he did the score for Drive and Only God Forgives) and of course putting Ellie Goulding's Lights in there, just brilliant! Now, some parts of this films aren't perfect, this isn't the best movie ever made or anything, but it is true work of art and not just a mix of drugs, sex, profanity and violence made by a crazy director in order to sell it. No, this is a very well-thought film, made by a director who actually has the balls to keep his own style no matter the audience is, and who uses sarcasm and reversed psychology in its storytelling in order to transmit its message, which (lets be honest) isn't the most common way to do things in modern American cinematographic industry...To sum it up, this was an extremely underrated movie, mostly watched by a lot of dumb teens and young adults who thought it was just going to be another Hollywood style flick starring old Disney actresses who want to break their image, but instead of that they got a weird art-house film that didn't follow the ""rules"" of the filmmaking industry and therefore disappointed them because it wasn't particularly funny in the way that most films are, and it showed sex, drugs and violence in a real, strange, and (too) explicit way for them to enjoy. Hopefully there are still some real cinema lovers out there who recognize the true value of this film. To them I say keep good and interesting movies alive but watching them, and to Harmony Korine, I just want to say thank you and bravo, for having the guts to put out on screen such a wonderful nightmare!",Spring Breakers

Korine tries and fails to make an epic ""spraang breaaaak"" movie...",1,19 October 2018,"Ever see a movie and you suddenly realize your IQ is dropping? That's this movie. I seriously cannot believe this movie got made, or that anyone in charge of the budget signed off on it. It's horribly dull, just scene after scene of people dancing and partying. These four ""ladies"" go on ""spraang braaaake"" and bad stuff happens. I kept waiting for the point, but really, the movie has nothing to say other than ""look at these ladies in their bikinis."" I guess the ""moral"" is that you shouldn't do bad things or bad things might happen to you? Maybe?My least favorite part was the constant repetition of lines. I feel like the ""writers"" couldn't come up with good dialogue, so when they found something they liked, they repeated it. At one point, the girls get arrested, and they keep saying ""it wasn't supposed to be like this"" over and over. I'm not kidding, I think they said it six or seven times. The film is visually stunning, if I'm being positive. They spent a LOT of money on neon lights and fake guns...and swimsuits. SO MANY swimsuits, and so many closeups of women in swimsuits. I kinda feel like the director graduated from ""Girls Gone Wild"" to artsy films, but this need more plot, character arcs, and less of James Franco's teeth.

Basically it's a movie filled with super cool montages which you cannot take to seriously. Just sit back listen to the bumping soundtrack filled with slow motion art. James Franco is a genius. He commits 100% to this role and dominates it. The rest of the cast are rock solid.Some times whilst watching it, I was wondering if I was watching soft porn, then I was wondering if I was watching the next cult classic and then I stopped wondering and was simply entertained.Open your mind, switch off and simply be entertained by this little piece of art.",Spring Breakers
265,campb234,"I can see why people think this movie is bad, but...",7,24 July 2013,"I would rather watch something like this than Transformers 2 which is seriously one of my most hated movies in the last ten years. I was drawn to this movie because James Franco somehow decided to be a part of it. Let me say as I disclaimer that I have not seen any other Korine films. From the good speak about ""Kids"" I will definitely have to look into it.I don't know how I feel about all the random breasts in throughout the movie (it was nice to see) but it sort of made sense to me. Spring Break in Florida (Or wherever they were) is meant to be a paradise and a non-stop party. The girls learn that soon enough when they have been their for some time. This is definitely a film I will have to watch more than once to understand it, but what I liked about it I really liked.Let me first start off by talking about the visuals/shots, etc. I'm not in film school, never have been, probably never will, but I have always loved it and have been ""hardcore"" about it for the better part of 6 years. I found it interesting how some shots seemed intentionally low budget yet others were very clear and crisp. I don't know if this was his intention or if it was due to the budget, but the overall effect was positive.There seems to be a lot of repetition in this movie. Like, the girls are going to school, that repeats as if to drone on and on and on. And the same thing happens while they're partying on break, and before the last two help Alien with what he has to take care of. As I was watching the movie I remember making a comment to my friend like ""Okay, we get it. Let's move the story along now."" When it ended, though, and I thought about it more I realized what Korine might have been trying to do. This isn't literature, so repeating something isn't necessarily bad. What it does for Spring Breakers is add to the intensity or the stress that the characters are feeling. It happens so much in this film that you begin to question what's actually happening, and then when the climax comes it's much more powerful than if it had not been present.This was an interesting movie, and if you like movies that are original, give this a shot.EDITSo, since I have written this review which was an hour or so ago, I came across an article that bashed Korine's writing pretty heavily. I have to agree that some of the things in the movie didn't make sense.1. The fact that they are arrested for partying. I feel like the cops would break it up and let most of the people go, and maybe just detain the people who booked the room. 2. They wouldn't be left in their bikinis in the cell with no way to cover up or keep warm, and they certainly wouldn't appear in court like that.Those are the only two gripes that I have besides the two scenes where the girls reenact what they did in the robbery and where Franco blows the pistols. Honestly, this is a movie, and when engaged in a movie you are supposed to suspend your disbelief. If you are so full of yourself or so bent on destroying Harmony Korine's career, then by all means pick this one apart.",Spring Breakers
266,bikenavy,Perfect for poster and trailer. Not so much for a movie?,6,27 June 2013,"I thought I was gonna get something more provoking, more challenging from Harmony Korine, instead what I got was a film that is pretty conventional and preachy in its spirit.With all those voice-overs floating around with random sort-of floating and sort-of beautiful images, It's pretty much like watching a Malick's film with less substance and with pseudo-spiritual awakening. I feel like I know what the filmmaker is trying to do, from the style, the cast, the story (or lack of). And I like what I think he has in mind. It's just that the actual film doesn't deliver. It doesn't take me to that special place.James Franco is a nice plus and he kind-of brings the film together somehow. But still I cannot help but wanting to laugh because I don't trust him as an actor anymore. I'm not sure if he's actually making fun of his role or not. His own real life persona makes him too meta to be believable in any movie roles, especially in a 'fantasy' film like this, which maybe is the whole point of the film.I feel like this movie was conceived out of images in the director's mind; young beautiful women in colorful bikinis with guns and gangsters.

I barely watched 10-15 minutes of the movie and was incredibly disturbed!!!!! I should've turned off the movie within the first 2 or so minutes! If many people have seen the movie, they know that the first 2 or 3 minutes, you see BOOBS BOOBS BOOBS!! I have boobs and I get tired of seeing mine when I get in the shower!

I don't want to see a boner, even just a drawing!! It's so disturbing and useless!! Another thing, when the girls are in the hallway and their almost doing handstands or something, which is weird, but in their PANTIES!! Such a waste!! I can understand making a movie about spring break and what would happen if teenagers took their spring break and went crazy but the NUDITY WAS UNNECESSARY!!

268,soerenbruns,Embracing the Chaos,9,9 March 2017,"Thrilling. Challenging. Bold. Beautiful.Obscene. Exploitative. Hollow. Cheap.These two series of adjectives represent the range of reactions Spring Breakers is likely to trigger. Indeed, it is full of explicit renditions of hardcore partying which should not be a surprise to anyone, given the title. But under the surface of the flashy overdose of drug abuse, nudity and violence is a chilling tale of four girls' descent into the void this environment creates.Bored by their mundane life at home with the ever same school, same people and same activities, the four protagonists (Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, Vanessa Hudgens and Rachel Korine) long for the excitement of Spring Break. As a first hint that they are absolutely determined to overcome all obstacles on their way there, they rob a diner to get the money (with water guns). Once in Florida and after a party marathon they end up in jail for when the police busts a whole crowd in a hotel room full of drugs. Out of nowhere the local gangster figure ""Alien"" (James Franco) bails them out. The question is whether he does this out of sympathy or if he has other motives in mind. The other question is if the girls will fully adapt to his lifestyle or if they will regret their decision to trust him.The reason why Spring Breakers allows for such diverse reactions as depicted above is because it is a film that thrives on contrasts. The chaos of the uncontrolled party excesses are shot in a distinctive MTV video-clip aesthetic underlined with blaring dubstep beats which is constantly contrasted with calm, serene sequences of the girls fooling around by themselves, relaxing on the beach or just plain captures of the city at night that are accompanied by a string-based soundtrack and a poetic, repetitive voice-over narration by different characters. In this manner of juxtaposing raw action with peaceful shots of the surroundings where it takes place, it evokes associations with Thin Red Line and in a way the whole films seems like Terrence Malick directing something like 24 Hour Party People. Through those calm scenes the overkill of stimuli in the party scenes becomes painfully shallow and nihilistic and therefore serves as a powerful comment on the particular mindless hedonism that is Spring Break. Therefore, it is not handled in an exploitative manner. It is not a satire, but it does what the best satire does, which is present the object of criticism in a pure, untouched way to let it unmask its lunacy itself without any extra commentary. Often the same exact scenes of random people freaking out on the beach are repeated which gets really exhausting which is exactly the point. The danger of this approach to subtle commentary is of course that the criticism then bypasses the audience.It should however become more than obvious when the group is divided between two girls who refuse to go down the road with ""Alien"" (and therefore go home) and two who are willing to follow him in all sorts of quests culminating in an armed assault on his main rival. In the last third of the film, the actual Spring Break seems very far behind, but what stands out is how it shaped the girls in different ways. The two that remain in Florida develop an obsessive relationship with Alien which is reminiscent of a Manson Family-like cult or a coked up deadly vipers version of Charlie's Angels. The red thread of extreme contrasts is kept up when scenes of brutal violence are shot with the most beautiful colour scheme. It is glowing with a neon buzz that creates a very dreamlike atmosphere that can be compared to the effect of the soft pastel colours of The Virgin Suicides. Indeed, it also shares some central themes with Sofia Coppola's classic, as in both films a group of young girls is driven to extreme behaviour by a rigid, norm-based social context. Incidentally, Tarantino named Spring Breakers his favourite film of 2013 and if he were to remake The Virgin Suicides the result could be quite similar to this.A final music cue sums up the contradictory elements that Harmony Korine lets crash into one another. On top of the scenes of brutal murders during the final assault the brilliant composer Cliff Martinez (""Drive"") picks up a motif from the initial Skrillex track we hear at the beginning of the film. This weird mixture of a string quartet playing a dubstep tune encapsulates the clashes this film is willing to embrace. In a way, both parties of movie goers reacting to this film are right. It is thrillingly unsettling and confusingly beautiful.",Spring Breakers
269,reisnersteven,One of the worst films I've ever seen,1,14 January 2016,"If I could give it a 0 I would. No point in summarizing a plot because there is none. I thought Franco could save it but without an actual story and a shitty script he can't do much. Hell i am not even sure there is a script. I read a summary that says the four girls it centers around get caught in a ""bloody turf war"". Sounds cool but there's no turf war, there's no blood there's not even a hint of violence. Somehow the people who made this thought movies were considered action packed and cool show guns and girls. There's a lot of guns in this movie but they don't get used, just kinda there for show. I'm not sure why I kept watching I guess I did in hopes that at some point something would happen, finally it looked like something would and they cut to the aftermath of it, it's just one long drawn out movie of horrible dialogue. The 2 girls left at the end that I think we're supposed to root for are sociopaths who belong in prison. Spoiler alert...this movie sucks really bad.",Spring Breakers
270,kelv-2,Truly Awful,2,5 April 2013,"I go to the movies a lot and this is the worst film i've seen since Skyline. In fact I'll say it was worse.There is no character development, no drama and you feel zero pity for any of them. While watching Alien on screen all I could think was Idiocracy. What a completely awful stereotypical Gangsta.They also have a lovely habit of repeating the same line about 5 times.Also the film fills itself with a lot of reflective scenes that add nothing to the film and help to make the film longer than the less than 60 minute television short movie it should be. I spent most of the film looking at my friends wondering why they hadn't walked out. Unfortunately when I turned my head back to the screen they were checking to see if I was ready to walk out too.

There is about 10 to 15 minutes of actual story, the rest of the film being poorly directed flash, nekkidness, and insubstantial nonsense...and not a single, likable character in the entire film. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a bunch of ""actors"" acting the fool, then this is your film. My suggestion if you are hellbent on watching this for the greasy and generally unappealing nekkid bits is to turn the volume all the way down so at least you won't be assaulted by the moronic dialog and insipid acting.My suggestion, go see ""Kids"", which was written by the same person who wrote and directed this film.

272,Henbaine,I really hoped it was being ironic. This movie is a car crash.,4,28 June 2013,"***SPOILERS**** I saw previews after believing it would be some tacky chick flick and though hey this actually may be a bit edgy and maybe pretty good so gave it a watch..I remain on the fence. I am still unsure as to whether the girls are supposed to just be such deluded kids going on about how magical it all is and how they fit in blah blah blah is meant to reflect how vapid, shallow and clueless and easily led some kids can be now. How we live in a world where people want wealthy music video-esque lives,kids imitate violence,gang culture and sexuality shown on TV and video games without thought- or whether the director was trying to make the audience believe that it was magical and special too and therefore ultimately get their point. I really hope it was not the latter..The movie is pretty well shot and although not a skrillex fan the music worked very well, (apart from the rendition of Britney spears by a ""gangster"" on a white piano- played over slow motion graphic violence and girls dancing with guns,which I believe was supposed to have serious credibility and pose some level of depth,dear god.) But overall, if it is meant to be taken seriously and not as some ironic, farcical teenage fantasy this movie fails at every turn. The whole concept fell flat for me,the girls robbing a restaurant seems plausible when you see the actual execution but they wouldn't get caught after handling guns & grabbing till cash with no gloves? burning a car? sure. Then the ""good"" girl, (why did she even go?) gets all freaked after they get arrested in Florida and meet ""Alien"" the gangster and goes home crying on a bus. ( I had to laugh after remembering Selena saying she loved playing an edgy film role, sure you played the good kid who freaked..) Alien is ridiculous. Some slimy, perverse and overtly stereotyped gangster trying to show depth while being like ""look at all my s***"" constantly.doesn't work. He comes across as a creep. So stone cold gangster, self confessed dangerous man- hanging with silly little teenagers who are so tough, till one gets shot in the arm, whales like a baby for 10 minutes and- yep, goes home crying on a bus as her increasingly off the rails friends remain with Alien.What really got me was the ending. There was a spat between Alien and some other dude over who runs the area. We know there is bad blood but it escalates pretty fast after pink hair girl gets shot. Suddenly the two teenage girls are somehow ultra calm super killers- they manage to hold powerful guns in the air, one handed - AND take out like ten gangsters at once in cold blood, while super ultra dangerous killer man Alien,is taken out by one guy after 3 seconds. They then kill the opposing guy in his hot tub while he makes no attempt to do anything but shrug.There is then the whole let's call out parents to tell them what a magical time we are having and how we will be home soon, after committing mass murder and stealing a car.The only thing that makes the whole scene even barely feasible is the fact that in the beginning of the movie before casing a cafe they made references to pretending they were ""In a video game"" while seriously hyped on cocaine. The lines between reality seem to have been seriously blurred for these girls, who have gone from being bratty,squeaky girly teens with an bit too much attitude dancing around singing and drinking to stone cold, hardcore killers (in pink unicorn balaclavas and bikinis)less afraid than a gangster and able to shoot guns like pros in seemingly zero time frame.And lastly, the massively grating over use of the term ""Spring Break"" often followed as gratingly by the words ""forever"" and ""bitches"" wow. yes we get it,they are on spring break.And are trying to be such badass bitches,like, you know,forever.Okay now that's established- are we done yet? Or maybe that's the point. you can take two views on this movie:1. It is actually deep and satirical showing the flaws and over ideas of kids and adults who go to any lengths to replicate the media ideas they see to the point where they are living false and dangerous lives like many people of fame. People who cannot live up to the hype of their self created persona in the end. 2. It is supposed to be some drug hyped violence fest for horny guys and teenage girls with too much attitude who love the idea of being crazy harlets in the sun fueled by booze coke but then it goes too far so they become serious robbers & killers for the kicks while still believing what they are doing is magic & special.",Spring Breakers

Four girls rob a restaurant so that they can afford to go to Spring break, they end up being arrested for Narcotic use. They are bailed out by a local drug dealer. I particularly like the editing of this film. Certain lines are repeated over montages, of nostalgic images or of the night before. The cast is relatively good, the drug dealer (James Franco) is cast very well though, I find his image genuinely mortifying.Don't mistake this for a 'high school kids get drunk and have a lot of sex', it's a lot deeper than that. There's murder and tears (and it's not over guys), and threats, it gets quite violent actually.",Spring Breakers
274,giorgiagray321,"Harmony Korine seemed to be blinded by the lights, as was I.",5,5 April 2013,"With a trailer aimed exclusively for the 18-25 age range, Spring Breakers is one of the most anticipated films of the year. However, my expectations were a bit too high, and was quite disappointed with what I got. Neon, guns, boobs and butts were all great to look at, especially when accompanied by great cinematography and spectacular lighting, but this was all we were witness to. The screenplay was weak, we weren't given enough of the characters to feel even a bit of sympathy, even after the deaths of a few (I wont say who because it's probably quite predictable as you go through the film). We were subject to brain jamming repetition; dialogue, party scenes, even camera work. Harmony Korine seemed to be blinded by all the neon lights the film offered. As was I. But he did try his hardest with the acting and the 'arthouse effect'. It was the mediocre screenplay and lack of build up to a climax I should've been shocked about. Spring Breakers seems to idolize the American spring break scene, with nothing but booze, sex and drugs, but this completely shadows the feelings and thoughts of the characters, which confused me as the film drew to a close. I am not saying the film is bad, because it isn't. It's simply unfinished in terms of development and story. Not a bad attempt, Korine!",Spring Breakers

I love arty, Indy films and this film tried to achieve that sort of status (with limited dialogue and intense scenes focusing on one object) but it just did not work. The result was a mess. The acting was horrendous, the script a joke but more importantly the end result was just bizarre! We all actually burst out laughing at the ""deep throat gun"" and the ""Britney Spears Tribute"" scenes.

Imagine a skinemax exploitation flick mated with a dark comedy and then mated with a morality tale with no morals and no point of view and directed by a drunk Fellini at gunpoint and you have an idea of what to expect. This is a trashy film that seems to only exist because Harmony Korine the writer and director is a pervert appealing to the perverts that make a market for trash like this. With that said, the film does provide a few laughs that may or may not be intentional and the performances are not all bad. I am just a bit disturbed that these actors would agree to be in this film and that no one stopped it from being made. I have a feeling when the decline of the empire that is the United States is dissected by history this film will be a small artifact of evidence.",Spring Breakers
277,jackeugenebarry,Boring Turd from Former Film-maker Harmony Korine,1,29 March 2013,"Just got home from seeing this in the theater... Double-yoo. Tee. Eff!!! Do you smell that? It's the hugely offensive odor of a condescending piece from somebody who has NO respect for his audience. And he's actually a former artist. Go figure.Let me share why I found this thing so offensive. Or maybe first, the opposite. No, I was Not offended by seeing the young Disney dolls all stripped down, dumbed down, and wildin' out. All 4 of these girls are eye-candy enough to raise Woodrow Wilson from the grave, and I was happy to see them in bikinis and less, getting their spring-break slut on. There's a time and place for everything, and that's what spring break is for, after all. Sun and sand and swimming pool bars. Super-squirters and wet t-shirts. Dancing and dares and strip-games and laughs. Hook-ups with beautiful strangers. Shots and beers and bongs and blunts and rails and funnels. Naughty wish-fulfillment. Silliness and sex and boundary-hopping thrills. This is no surprise to all but the most sheltered college kids or parents in denial.Of course, for simple (or intricate) on-screen nudity and debauchery, we all can choose from a million different porno's. (That's right. When you're so inclined, let your perv flag fly.)If it's vicarious spring-breakness and partying we're seeking, there's a whole film genre to watch, going back to ""Where the Boys Are"" and ""Gidget"" and whatnot. Even as far back as the flapper films of the silent era, or flicks from Clara Bow and Mae West and the like. And up through now, with ""Project X""/""Hangover""-type stuff.If insightful social commentary (with or without the satire) is your thing, there are So Many flicks to check out, from classics like ""Lost Weekend"", ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", or ""Days of Wine & Roses"", up through ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Trainspotting"", or ""Boogie Nights"" modern stuff.If it's an exciting electric neon candy-color-palette to feast your eyes on, there's the ""Tron"" flicks, ""Pleasantville"", ""Speedracer"", any number of sci-fi's, or a must-see that was shot by the same cinematographer as this one, ""Enter the Void"".If its non-traditional (or even non-narrative) story-telling you want, there's Welles, Brackhage, Deren, Antonioni, Bertolucci, Renais, Godard, Truffaut, Tarantino, Aronofsky, Gilliam, Noe, Boyle, Nolan, Soderbergh, (even Korine), and the list goes on and on.I would not have a problem with this piece if it was honestly going for any or all of the above things, but I do have a problem with it. Because it's really not going for anything. This thing was beyond phoned-in. It's the 2nd one in a row from Harmony Korine (after ""Trash humpers"") that treats the audience like clueless pigs that will just guzzle down anything thrown into our pen. Movies are open for interpretation, but there has to be something to interpret.Mind you, this is the same guy whose first three directorial efforts - ""Gummo"", ""julien-donkey boy"" & ""Mister Lonely"" - were really challenging but rewarding works. Films to make you squirm & think & feel & reel & flinch from & maybe even delight in. When I saw his name at the end of the trailer, I was All In. But just like with ""Trash humpers"", he took what was no more than a 1-trick pony, 1-note idea, and tried to pass it off to the world as a feature- length film, something to dig into. With his 2 latest, he's really pushed the envelope of ""No There There.""""Spring Breakers"" is just the most cynical substitution for actual film-making you could think of. Korine takes 4 mousketeer bunnies, throws them into spring-break wish-fulfillment land, spices the dish with a robbery, and then tries to sizzle it with the menace and coolness of gun-toting drug-dealers horn-dogging on them and beefing on each other. It's not enough to say that this thing didn't work. It's not a misfire, just a total dishonest cop-out. There is not one minute of this non-movie, besides the standard spring-break partying, that is even remotely believable. Not Even. Though Franco does actually dig in and commit to his role with real intensity and relish, the interactions between him and the girls and his drug rival are ridiculous. (The only exception is Selena Gomez, and, I take it back, the one moment that feels real in the whole thing is her fearful crying when she begs to go home.)The way the violence is handled is just stupid. The girls' arrest and court hearing ring totally false. And I've never heard Gucci Mane as a rapper, but Homey couldn't act his way out of a burger wrapper. The random way it's shot and edited, along with the redundant sound-design and dialogue, are probably things Korine and his defenders would try to pass off as ""artful"", but they're just tedious and, saddest of all for a flick with this much buns & guns & ammo, Boring. Yes, it's... So... Boring. The best thing I can think to say about the film's ""different"" use of these devices is that it might be some feeble attempt at a teenybopper's ""Last Year at Marienbad"". But that's probably way too generous.That about sums it up. So sucky yucky because I really wanted to like this thing, even though after ""Trash-humpers"" I had my fingers crossed. It didn't help. You know, lipstick on a pig and all that jazz. But alas... There was a time when Harmony Korine made films. Lately he just seems to be making what any A-hole can make: Turds.",Spring Breakers

Then you have seen all that the movie has to offer...with less nudity. No? Then watch it and you will have gotten all the movie has to offer.There is no semblance of a plot line, zero character development, no real protagonist and no story arch. The move is flat, painful and pointless. Characters come and go with little explanation and when they are gone you just don't care.Selena Gomez is horrendous and annoying, the other three become ultra-violent criminals with little explanation other than they want to go on spring break. Two of them actually manage to become trained assassins through what I can only assume is learned through osmosis. The movie consists of Girls Gone Wild cut ins and pointless narration and the strange repetition of words and phrases that become as annoying as anything else in this movie. James Franco will literally take on any role these days. I used to ""trust"" that a good actor would not take on such a bad role, but now I question any movie he is in, because this does not seem to be an isolated mistake.Again, I have never reviewed a movie.

281,Jayowend,You either like it or you don't,6,2 July 2013,"An interesting film.Straight off the bat you can tell it has a huge appeal to the male demographic lol, but if you just want to see this for the partying, boobs, bikinis, and women.. well that stuff is definitely there but you'll probably be bored by the 30-minute mark and want to stop watching (unless you're into watching all that alcohol-drenched grinding chugfest). I have to say it started off pretty slow and boring, and the story only really starts to pick up after you've watched halfway through. Spring Breakers is labeled as a comedy/drama, and even though I kinda smiled at a few parts, it really wasn't a comedy. It was more of a dark/artistic drama. So if you're thinking of watching it for the laughs, I'd reconsider if I were you!For those of you who haven't seen it, all I have to say is that it's a bizarre movie which, if you can make yourself look past the 'shallow' part of the film and accept that yes, it does seem to glorify a bunch of skin-clad women, drugs, guns, gangsters, the 'American Dream' (which is essentially what its whole premise is built around), then you'll be able to see a lot more in the story in terms of a message or even a subtle 'reality check' of the kind of mentality some teenagers face in a generation like this. Now if you're watching the trailer and you're thinking this is just another one of those films that sells sex appeal, well, you are partly right. But nevertheless there are still a few surprisingly beautiful moments/scenes in between all the hardcore partying (that pretty much only happens in the first half of the film): like the majestic, almost bonfire-like dance done by the spring breakers wearing pink balaclavas and holding semi-automatic rifles to the tune of James Franco playing Britney Spears' ""Everytime"" on a white piano in his sea-side estate backyard. It was definitely bizarre, and it was beautiful. I also want to point out that there is a lot of music in this, and I can see why many people think this movie is just an over-lengthy music video haha. I really liked the 'dark' parts of the film though, when the party-vibe dies down, when the music becomes a little gloomier, the characters; a little more confused.. it brings out that contrast between the oh-so-lively, crazy, fun, wild party scenes and that back-to-reality/'what-do-we-do-now' feeling.I feel like I can understand why a lot of people absolutely hated watching this. I mean yeah, if you look at it from the start and from all angles in an objective way, this film is a real mess. It really has no strong plot, tries to be realistic (documenting the exposures of teens today) and at the same time surrealistic (bikini's in court rooms?), touches on some of the most dangerous and controversial topics to bring into a film (some people automatically flip the 'no' switch when they see an insane amount of taboos in a film), and is in general a turn off to a lot of people who like to see strong, clever plots in a film. But if you can see past all that and accept it like those things were used as an art-form (even if you know they were not), then Spring Breakers becomes an experience into the lives of four young girls and their 'trip' of a lifetime. I do believe that things like what is depicted in the film (although not as extreme, but maybe?) happen in our world today so I think that it's definitely a good idea to gain some insight into the way some of today's generation think and act. I mean if you watch it and hate it, that's okay too. But I don't think it's a waste of anyone's time to find out more about where they're currently standing and how comfortable they are with regards to the topics in this film.7/10+1 for James Franco's convincing transformation.

I really like James Franco and his starring in a movie is usually something that will make me give a movie a shot, even if others hated it (Oz the Great & Powerful, for instance). However in this one, I felt his performance was one- note as the goofy, gold-toothed white rapper & drug dealer. Not horrible per se, but just lacking in nuance, which actually might be the fault of the director in the editing room. I've seen Harmony Korine's other movies ""Kids"" and ""Gummo"", so those are his only other two movies I can compare it to- IMO it's on the same level as Kids and WAY better than Gummo, both in story composition, scene construction, and performances by the main actresses. The girls all played their characters well, especially Selena Gomez as the appropriately named Faith who just can't reconcile her morals with her friends' concept of ""fun"".

285,AukeBriek,"Spring Breakers is more an experience to undergo, than a film to watch.",10,26 May 2013,"When the intro credits of Harmony Korine's crazy candy-coated ""pop poem"" popped up in the weirdest font you have ever seen, this was enough for some guys in the audience to mention the option of leaving, for at this point they must have felt cheated out of their boobies. But then the film started teasing precisely those guys, by showing one of the most gorgeous pair of boobies ever to grace the earth totally soaked in beer, filling the entire cinema screen, rotating in slow-motion, in perfect sync with Skrillex's Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, for what were only a few seconds, yet felt like an eternity! It seems they got what they wanted, and in a way they did... and yet I bet they must have been freaked out in the wrong way. They would rather not have been woken up by boobies, by putting them so close by, but they would rather have wanted to enjoy them comfortably, normally. Spring Breakers is indeed not normal. It is more an experience to undergo, than a film to watch. It is a radical work of audio-visual poetry that is extremely immersive and dream-like. At first, the film may appear to be either completely lacking in meaning or to be completely obvious and one-dimensional in that regard, but on repeating viewings it becomes clear that it is in fact extremely layered, diffuse and inscrutable. On the one hand it ironically contrasts the caricatured spring break 'authenticity' spoken mostly through mobile phones, by its opposite reality, yet on the other hand explores the spring break lifestyle from within, by letting us inhale its vibe as if it were some strange religious drug experience. There are many layers of meaning, and the most obvious ones (the relation between spring break and violence) are so over the top that they ultimately seem to be the least important ones. After the first scene is finished we hear a gun-cock and we are transported to quieter settings. Two girls, Brit (Ashley Benson) and Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) tease each other with highly sexualized gestures, but the background tone is different here. This is mostly because we hear Cliff Martinez on the score, who does what Thomas Newman did for American beauty: to create a deliciously delicate atmosphere that you can almost breathe in. When the four Disney girls decide to collect all their money to go on spring break, they celebrate this plan by ""experimenting"" a bit in their dormitory: Cliff Martinez makes it sound like poetry, while Benoît Debie (the cinematographer) makes it look like a bunch of spring flowers blossoming. Legs are thrown in the air with Kubrick-like precision, but then more dynamic and with a more Lynchian Mulholland Drive type of atmosphere. When the girls arrive at spring break we see a bunch of people partying wildly and loudly, contrasted by a more quiet, poetic display of after-party relaxation. The beautiful movements of the scooter-lights somehow make it believable that Faith calls Spring Break the most religious place she has ever been in. At the same time we see Cotty (Rachel Korine) representing the wilder, raunchier side of spring break, in a very brave and respectable, possibly career-damaging performance. Sometimes, the religious/nostalgic feelings seem to turn into a funny social critique: ""Yeah, we saw some beautiful things out here"", while we see the Disney girls peeing on the side of the road. And yet the flow, the mood and the utter horniness of the film are so strong that it is hard to see this as a simple generation critique by a grumpy old guy. There is more than enough to enjoy here. Sometimes even so much, that the viewer may feel guilty and besmirched and feel like he or she is watching a stupid exploitation flick. This way, Korine confronts us with the fact that to one-dimensionally condemn the spring breakers for their sex-craziness and superficiality would be deeply hypocritical, as we are all equally guilty as charged when enjoying the film. Certain events lead to the introduction of the Alien character (James Franco). When this silver-toothed gangster-rapper said ""look at my sh$$tt"" with two machine guns in both hands for the tenth time, I couldn't help laughing. ;) The performance and transformation that this guy managed to pull off has to be seen to believed! This is where the film introduces more conventional (i.e. comedy) story elements, but certainly does not give up its Malickish liquid narrative. But unlike Malick, Korine combines poetry with dirt, high-art with low-art, beauty with raunchiness, light with darkness. This makes it all so much more palatable. When we hear this creepy Alien's thoughts, we learn that poetry is on his mind, and even though this ought to be preposterous it somehow manages to be deeply touching. Brit and Candy slowly unveil the true extent of their psychopathic side and it seems that Benson and Hudgens are a perfect match for Franco, who are all giving the definitive performances of their careers. This compromised poetry culminates in the scene with Britney Spear's Every time, with the pink balaclavas, baggy black trousers and colorful sneakers, making those girls look like strangely cute yet dangerous little bunnies, while the music calmly soared, and my God, how beautiful this was! This would have been my favorite scene of all time, if it were not surpassed by the final scene by a nose length. This final scene is a truly gorgeous audio-visual spectacle in slow-motion, not unlike the finale of 2001, although within the framework of the story, and with a washed-out score underneath. The balaclavas in that scene were fluorescent, neon-colored this time, varying from pink, to blue, to white depending on the lighting.

It had good elements (like the robbery scene seen from the truck) and some potential but just because you repeat ""spring break last forever"" in a faded voice every 20 minutes doesn't make it deep.

The girls' faces are rarely shown in normal light, making it difficult to identify their faces. There is little actual acting by the girls, except for Selena Gomez, and her real acting doesn't quite add up to five minutes of the film.There is little character motivation or character building. We know that the girls are bored with their lives at the beginning of the film. But we don't know why one of the girls keeps shooting her fingers like an imaginary gun.James Franco's performance is laughable. He probably does an okay job with the dialog and the scenes he is given. I'd hung in with the movie, waiting for him to appear but the grid on his teeth showed me immediately that his role was going to be over the top and silly. He's an exaggeration of Al Pacino's ""Scarface"" with a goofy ghetto dialect.This movie has characters behaving in grotesque, obscene ways. Believe it or not, the various shots--and there is a lot of them--of girls at Spring Break dancing with their arms up in the air, many of them topless and many of them drinking out of a long tube, are the least troubling shots.This movie is nasty, grotesque, and over-simplified, with characters that are nothing but clichés. I don't know what audience should watch this movie, or for whom this movie was meant. HIgh school and college boys may be entertained by this hour-and-a-half long tacky video.",Spring Breakers
288,roaringelbow,Too Cool For School....HYPE!,3,31 July 2013,"This was a very hyped-up movie on the internet, yet the TV promotion was very low key, at least from what I've seen. Guess there was a reason for that now...Let me just start off by saying that all 4 female leads looked great....That's about all I could say about them. The acting was terrible. The playfulness between the 4 of them was rather annoying (LET'S ALL DO HEADSTANDS FOR NO REASON). The whole ""Gangsta Wannabe"" vibe was just sickening and overdone in my opinion. The repetition of lines was just way, way too much. Seriously the only 2 people who seemed to actually have dialog in this movie were James Franco and Selena Gomez. To me this seems like it could have been cut down to 3 minutes and made into a music video. To the people who have griped about the editing in this movie, after seeing it I absolutely agree with all of you. It's just a mess. I got pretty sick of seeing things out of order, or seeing James Franco smiling at the girls while you hear him speaking to them all out of time-frame. One more thing I have noticed is that if you don't like this movie and let it be known on the internet, that you will be pegged as an ""MTV Generation Lover"" and that you ""Just Don't Get It."" I for one am not an MTV head, and I DO get what they were trying to say in this movie. Instant gratification and living the wild life will send you into a downward spiral. To me it just seems that Harmony Korine could have actually written more than a 3 to 4 page script and not have done this movie in such an MTV type of style.",Spring Breakers

You have to get over the fact that there is plenty of nudity (by US standards) but it is not the point. The movie is not erotic, not a teen flick, not a thriller, nor a crime drama (ok, maybe little of the last one).I am not going to go in the plot much; as there is not much of it. You could summarize the whole thing in a paragraph. However it is the presentation, the microscopic look in the lives of main characters, their faults (mostly) and strength that it is engaging and rewarding.As I said at the beginning, keep an open mind, don't have any preconceived notions, and prepare to be taken through a visual (and somewhat surreal) journey.",Spring Breakers

So, that said, despite the nudity and the former Disney stars that do brighten up the film, Spring Breakers is one of the most ridiculously I'll-planned and executed movies of all time and creation. Don't expect this to be fun. It's crude, one terrible scene after another, even a three way in the pool looks ridiculous. There is no reason for this movie to live. There are four girls led by Selena Gomez as the ""good girl"" who keeps being good as she does cocaine, drinks to extremes and gets arrested with the other three hotties, including Vanessa Hudgens, for their debauchery. They are bailed out by James Franco who plays a scum bag drug dealer who leads the girls to join his gang and basically have sex with. He would have never appealed to this group. Never. Best thing is they wear bikinis throughout, worst thing, it doesn't matter. The story is not really a story, lines are repeated, the action is tidiculous. This is not a movie meant for laughs. I don't know what it's meant for, nor do I care. It's a scumbag movie that fails to entertain on any level. Too bad to be enjoyed as a bad movie. I won't even go over the plot or any details. You can NOT watch it on your own. If I could give minus stars I would go -5. Interesting film techniques keep it from being even lower. Rent or buy something better.

And I fall in the category who considers this film great.It does have some cons, the last 30-40 minutes were boring and the film lost its satirical tone, but it still kept its style and featured one of the coolest scenes of the movie with a Britney Spears song. I hated Gucci Mane in this, I hated his performance and character and made the film boring and lose its focus.Now the pros: James Franco was hilarious in the role, he was scary, funny, over the top and very likable. The girls specially Selena Gomez were great, they played the roles of dumb wild girls really well.

The amount of useless screaming was seriously annoying and the fact that they only wore bikinis 24/7 even at night didn't help.

294,yuppie-flu,Chrystallized time through stunning montage,8,12 April 2013,"Not many films split the audience in enthusiasts and haters like ""Spring Breakers"" does. And you may of course ask, why this movie provokes extreme reactions on both ends. Is it a mirror to the ambiguity of American morale or the explicit display of sex and violence? In the end, there are people who see beneath the loud and flashy surface and people who don't. In order to close this discussion and go on to something really remarkable about Korine's work, I just want to point out that it is a movie worth watching in many ways, because it is entertaining, ambitious and brave.The story of Spring Breakers is simple and a one dimensional tour to excess. But the way Korine narrates the story with a unique montage concept is remarkable. Looking closer at the plot, we see various fermatas interrupting the plot, e.g. Alien playing the white grand piano, his bloody finger tipping the key, the threesome in the pool and so on. These scenes work like interruptions changing the course of the story like joints. And for the montage these scenes work like a prism, projecting the following events in achronological inserts. In this way, Spring Breakers works brilliantly as a composition of music, sound and light. And in the end, it leaves the audience dazzled and thinking.",Spring Breakers
295,smellyville90,Are you not entertained?,8,10 July 2013,"I have to say, that watching this movie was a total spur of the moment decision on my part and I walked into this completely unaware of what I was getting into. While watching it, I felt my senses were assaulted, but there was more to it than what I was able to discern viscerally. Therein lies the greatness of this movie. It makes you think about what images are being thrown at you and why. The image is obviously that of what the youth of our age are sold as 'the good life': money, drugs, sex and partying. This is the American Dream. This movie follows 4 girls who do despicable acts, who behave with such depravity and who are shallow to the core, that watching this can be painful at times. But that is the whole point and people who walk out of this feeling as though they have had their time robbed of them or are too disgusted by what they see are missing the point. I am not an elitist movie critic in no sense of the word either, but I know a shock movie when I see one.I have to say that visually this movie is beautiful (and no, I am not referencing the nudity here, ha-ha). It is a dark, dreamy, neon- nightmare. I give credit to the movie for this because it is candy for the eyes. Production wise this movie is solid, as is the direction. You feel as if you are in a dream, with it's poignant use of slow motion, and I suppose that is the effect they were looking to achieve. In this aspect they succeeded with flying colours - literally. There's also a beautifully crafted scene during their robbery of a restaurant that features one of the girls rolling the car around the building, catching glimpses of what they were doing inside. A very good piece of cinematography. The cast were great too. I can't really say too much for the female cast as they did all act well in their respective roles. James Franco on the other hand really stood out and delivered a superb performance in what I would say is one of his more challenging roles, because the character himself is just so unlikable and unlike anyone he has portrayed before. He definitely made this movie, and without him in it it would seem to be missing a magic ingredient. Time and again Franco proves his worth as one of the great actors of his generation. He obviously knew that this movie's worth exceeded the majority of our expectations.It seems the point of this film is lost upon most, which is a shame, though I can understand why. On the surface this appears to be a shallow and uninspiring piece of crap theatre with no motive beyond showing us some tits and ass. It is so much more. I love movies that make me think, even if they are at the time disturbing to watch. Well, this is what we are supposed to enjoy watching, after all. This is what our media, our 'culture', our idols depict as the epitome of what constitutes the good life. We are told to live our youth to the full. Is this not what they do throughout the movie? Are you not entertained? No?Isn't that just it though? The truth hurts. This is the truth of what our youth aspire to. Sad, ain't it. Maybe I should give this a 1 star rating. I'm sure that's what the director would want me to do.",Spring Breakers
296,ulysses-th20,It was simply Wow and WOW! Superb!!!,10,26 March 2013,"I will leave the parts of the movie which most people liked or loved out of this (or until the end). I will then focus on a couple or few which were the ""flaws"" or reason to ""skip"" the movie. 1) The calls the girls made to their moms were a bit cheesy, too unreal--most if not all spring breakers I know of never spoke like that:as if some fantasy event was taking place. Minus One Star. 2) Why did Harmony wait for Selena to be in a group with black men for her to decide she'd had enough of the whole mess? A feeble person will bash that scene. Well, most white girls from across the nation who go on spring break are usually NOT put in the scenario surrounded by black guys in some remote shack, let alone black ""gansta's."" She, and we, knew they were because of Jame's connections or environs. IT. WAS. REAL. Harmony nailed this. It was ART. 3) The redundant dialog and imagery. Again:it's REAL, and it is ART. As humans, we think the same matters over and over in our minds. Regardless of our situations in life, we judge, doubt and question, the same things repeatedly. ITS REAL and it's FINE art. When it's done just right--as Harmony did, we get amazing results. Redundancy IS art, just as the repetitive music from Star Wars IS Amazing (thank you John Williams) and so is Les Miserables (thank you Boubil, Schonberg, Kretzmer, and Natel) and some others, including AMAZING and brilliant popular songs by Zeppelin, Metallica, Earth Wind and Fire, Sade, Beatles, Stevie Wonder, and many more, and ALL THOSE masterpieces we know as Classical Music.All the actors fulfilled their roles without a hair-thin flaw.

This garbage HAS NO FREAKING PLOT. Nothing is happening in the whole damn movie. I was bored out of my mind all throughout. I cannot believe that 4000 people gave this thing a 10. A 10! What a joke! Those people are putting too much thought into this and I can understand their point of view but that doesn't change the fact that this movie is BAD.

The editing is too pretentious and lazy with dragged out stock footage of people partying, the actors laying around or puffing smoke slowly for 10 seconds. The director and editors looped the SAME cheesy dialogue thinking that the audience would find its messages profound or act as a foreshadow - but that fails too because it was so poorly executed. The final straw was when James Franco was at the piano, his hands weren't even on the keys (or even plausibly moving) while supposed playing and singing! This is such a small point but no matter how bad the movie is, it is 100x worse when the production team and director ARE LAZY. It's extremely insulting to the audience.The very unrealistic plot line has been addressed but the script must have been only 2 pages long due to the lack of dialogue and unnecessarily dragged out scenes.

What the hell were you thinking?I fast forwarded many scenes because they were silly, and they kept on repeating lines, the director should be hanged to death, what the hell was he thinking?

300,damjanraknic,"Let's have mindless fun, but under the guise of ""being free"" & ""finding yourself""",2,29 June 2013,"The story is a complete wash, as it's really a nuts and bolts version of something that could have been deeper and more profound. The thing is, and I imagine most people who liked the film will say, what kind of film does the Spring Break ""phenomenon"" deserve but an empty shallow decadent one with lots of T&A, drugs and booze? I say, make it count or don't make it at all.This film comes from the well, curious mind of Harmony Korine, not known to be a particularly talented filmmaker, but known for his odd persona and off beat taste in storytelling. This film features very little story time and more of a ""mood"" and ""visual"", and should he be faulted for not knowing how to write good story? I say yes, but if he is content on delivering duds like this then he should be prepared to discuss real questions.Another thing that irks me is the cynical nature of this film's conception. We have a story calling for young actresses to act in a film that affords them the luxury of doing what I imagine most of Hollywood likes best, and that is have fun in a scandalous way while getting paid for it. They get to act tough, fire guns, do drugs, have sex with each other and with others, basically anything that would get them in trouble in real life. Then who do you cast? Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine; 20-something actresses who for the most part have made their careers playing nice wholesome girls, but often state they wish to break out of that industry imposed mold. Seems like the perfect vehicle right? Wrong.The acting in this is pathetic at best, even James Franco can't save this train-wreck with his over the top antics. The story, if it can be called even that, is conveniently arranged so that everything that needs to happen happens at the right time, and features some really obvious stupidity being enacted by the main characters. But wait, isn't that the point, to show the stupidity of it all? It would be if the film didn't communicate a glamorous and self-aggrandizing smugness which really got on my nerves.A film likes this needs subtlety and a different visual aesthetic because the way this feels is in contrast to the way they wanted it to feel because some of the sparse dialogue that is spoken in the film alludes to a sort of underlining theme they wished to bestow on the film.

The movie shows us gangsters, but fails to say something about sexual abuse, violence, drugs and the illusions of the adolescent. Instead it shows us naked bodies writhing under techno music thus appealing to the wrong public - the ones who want to see the actresses naked, and not the ones who have the wrong idea for the ""gangstas"".

302,lloydhammett715,"The exploration of sex, drugs and notoriety follow four girls to Spring Break",5,20 November 2013,"""This is the f*ckin' American dream. This is my f*ckin' dream, y'all!"" – AlienThere is a grand tradition of spring break in America and the way that young students can finally break away from their regular routine. It is a privilege that most cannot live without, and the four girls in Spring Breakers will do anything to go. The exploration of sex, drugs and notoriety follow the girls into Florida, as the lack of boundaries spins out of control. What really stands out is the technical brilliance of the film with the exotic lighting to show the seduction of spring break. The aura that director Harmony Korine creates is something special as the dream like sequences intoxicate you in a very real way. It is clear to see that Korine's vision for the film is in developing this haze across what could happen in this outside world of spring break when willing to push everything to the limit. The booming soundtrack that rackets along with the film is also a large part of creating the dizziness you feel.It is a shame that a film that holds such technical quality is also let down by this some trait. The fixation on creating the notorious aura leads to a lack of any form of narrative with the dream like sequences dominating and losing control. This narrative jumps rather than floats as the escalation and radicalisation lack any real control. The constant slow-mos employed to show the orgasmic trance of spring break create an atmosphere but become too familiar by the end and eventually nauseating rather than enjoyable.Much has been put on the 'Disney' girls to break away from what they are known for in a blitz of suspicious actions and sexual fronts. It is Rachel Korine's character Cotty that really engages with the most believable of performances not completely losing her religious background. The other girls annoy rather than trance as their radicalisation in Florida seems loose to say the least. James Franco's gangster Alien is spectacular matching what Korine has created in atmosphere perfectly. The film will drag you in and leave you dizzy through the electrical lightning and brilliant thumping soundtrack. It leaves you in a daze, as Harmony Korine aims, with a bad taste in your mouth through the dark and noir like themes. Ultimately, however it is the lack of depth and hollowness of the film that really lingers.",Spring Breakers

Three of them decide to rob a chicken place for money so they can have money to go to a spring break party for all four of them. While there, they get arrested, but when their bail is payed by a mysterious man named Alien, they get into dark situations.Story: I was very interested in the story. I must say that the first half of the film was a 10/10. I was enjoying it so much. But in the second half it does slow down and had some boring moments in it. Great story though.Acting: Faith(Selena Gomez)- I liked her character a lot. Whenever she was in a bad situation, she did great acting. So, round of applause for Selena for being in these Disney shows to being in this movie. Really impressive. Alien(James Franco)- Wow. He was great. James Franco brought life to this character by making him such a crazy, mean drug dealer that I was interested in where this character was going. Franco's role reminded me of Tom Cruise when he played Stacee Jaxx in Rock Of Ages. Just such a different, but impressive role. Candy(Vanessa Hudgens)- I thought she was good. She doesn't have a lot to do in this film, but for the scenes that she was in, it felt like she was trying and she did just fine. Brit(Ashley Benson)- Again, she doesn't have a whole lot to do, but she did great whenever her, Hudgens, and Franco were in a scene together. Those three were incredible. Cotty(Rachel Korine)- For the first half of the movie, I didn't hate the acting, I just hated the character for doing just irresponsible acts. However something happens to her character in the last half of the movie that made me feel bad for her and I actually cared for her. So great transition from I don't like this character to I like and care for this character. Good job.Directing: Very good job from Harmony Korine.

Selena has been receiving a lot of hate for being in the movie. Which she wasn't fully even in her character Faith left before getting down and dirty. I saw nothing wrong with any of the actresses. There characters are in college, going some where for Spring Break,which there characters never got to do. Of course there gonna go crazy. But thats just the first half, the second half gets more violent and sexual, which worked. Ashely and Vanessa had great chemistry together. They were professional the entire time.

The good girl leaves the party to go back home. The other three are then threatened by Alien's rival and one is shot in the arm. She leaves. The other two along with Alien vow revenge. We hear phone conversations between the girls and their parents where they say they had an ""amazing"" time and how ""this had made them want to be the best person they can be"" The two remaining girls and Alien board a cigarette boat, go to the gangster's home wearing bikinis and ski masks, Alien is killed immediately, and the two college girl/spring breakers armed only with handguns (and no place to keep a spare clip), kill an entire house full of armed criminals including Alien's main rival in a surreal scene shown to a soundtrack full of black light effects. That one scene is actually kind of a cool scene, as improbable as it is, but still highly ridiculous.The final scene shows them driving off in the rival drug dealer's Lamborghini.That's the plot.

I can't believe people can get away with putting crap like this out.. This is beyond horrible.It start off with teen T & A and wild belligerent drunkenness for about 30 minutes. Hard to sit through. These female actors are amazingly annoying with their screaming laughing like hyena's and humping each other and everything for most the movie.I can't believe the actors took these scripts. You wait for J. Franco to turn things around but then he starts deep throating hand guns that these girls are holding.They rob people they shoot and kill people, they bang each other, take bong rips, do coke, get hammered drunk all through the movie for absolutely no reason. They also do all this while in bikinis. The only reason that 99% of the people watched the whole movie was just too see these girls get brutally killed as they love to kill and glamorize it. I thought the nonsense of the whole movie would make sense in the end but it doesn't.There's no point to this movie, if there is then its""girls are allowed to get away with murder, robbery, home invasion, public nudity, assault... pretty much anything and without consequence or responsibility, because girls kick ass yeeeaah!""

The tiny story (besides loads of partying) is not believable & it is hard to care about any of the characters.

James Franco, terrible. Selena Gomez, smart enough to duck out half way through the movie. Vanessa Hudgens, smart enough to wear a wig, Plus side, decent soundtrack and James Franco singing Brittney Spears. The girls are kinda cute, so that's good.

It's as if the entire film was improvised and shot on someone's phone. The scarce, rambling dialogue is nothing but clunky exposition that barely manages to drag the story forward, while doing nothing to build the loathsome one dimensional characters. Poor James Franco is the only redeemable feature about this film, and does his best with what little script he's given. But the filmmakers lame excuse for social commentary on contemporary American youth falls short of the artistic merit they were reaching for. It's basically a vehicle for ex Disney girls attempting to transition their careers to an adult demographic by exploiting every trick in the book -pointless glorification of drugs, violence, and nudity. Not that there's anything wrong with that.I can't in good conscience recommend this film to anyone.

320,hddixon3,"Korine bait-and-switches the audience; worth seeing, but not worth going to see.",6,25 March 2013,"I viewed this film with some friends last night. At the end, my knee-jerk reaction was to yell, ""What the f**ck was that?!"" I was embarrassed by my own rudeness, but I feel compelled to write why that happened.Let me first start by saying this is my first Harmony Korine film. Because his influences include Terence Malick and Jean-Luc Godard, I had hoped this film would be an unforgettable experience and have some things that, going in, I would enjoy. I can now say that it was unforgettable, albeit for the wrong reasons. While the cinematography is gorgeous, and James Franco does what he can, the overall plot and message of the film (if there is one) fall so flat that it's amazing no one walked out last evening in disgust.First of all, the cinematography is really impressive. There's a neon pop to almost every shot, and the focus changes from crisp to a blurry, iPhone quality, to a shape-shifting, David Lynch style surrealism. There was probably too much slow-motion in a film that runs roughly ninety minutes, but it lends itself to the slowed-down, blurred-senses feel that might necessarily accompany any film about spring break and its complete blurring of the senses.James Franco's character is stunning, and had every character been fleshed out as much as his, this would be an early contender for next year's Academy Awards. Sadly, that is not the case: Gucci Mane is laughably bad, and save for Selena Gomez, there is never any indication that the other female leads have depth, back-story, or motivations that cause them to act the way they do. Some might say, ""Well, that's the point, they're not motivated by anything"" but that seems too easy on Korine. It was his responsibility to provide motivation to these women to bring life to their characters, and while there are glimmers of hope - particularly with Vanessa Hudgens - overall they seem one-note and completely neutral. It's hard to root for them, and it's hard to root against them, because we never learn enough about them to form some sort of opinion or bond. That might make sense with secondary characters like the ATL Twins, who are given fleeting cameos in the movies as drug dealers, but for main characters that seems like a lethal mistake.The first two-thirds of the film are interesting enough, though a bit formulaic. The final third of the film is where the wheels come off and I considered leaving (SPOILER ALERT AHEAD). It is utterly implausible that two girls, whose firearms training is never addressed in negative or positive terms throughout the movie, are suddenly able to take down at least three gangsters who are presumably well-trained with firearms during a multi-person shootout where neither girl takes any kind of cover or defensive maneuver. While the girls do appear to have semi-automatic or automatic weapons, which lends to a ""spray and pray"" advantage, the fact that they can miss point-blank gunshots, including some that immediately take down James Franco, is borderline impossible. They don't even seem to have a scratch after everything is said and done, and they speed away in Gucci Mane's Lamborghini.This frustrating impossibility leads me to what is, overall, the most frustrating part of the movie: the lack of a message. After the film, there is no payoff, no satisfying conclusion that logically or emotionally flows from the previous things we have seen. Selena Gomez and Rachel Korine could just as easily have stayed with the other two girls and suffered nary a scratch, save for Korine's gunshot wound. There's not even any indication that the two remaining girls underwent any sort of change. They call their parents to profess their determination to change when they return to school, but how do we know they're not lying? The overwhelming evidence is that both are psychopaths, who lie, cheat, steal, and kill their way through spring break with seemingly no consequences.Overall, the film is like the spring breakers themselves: a gorgeous, somewhat entertaining treat for the eyes, but don't be fooled. It's a completely hollow, contradictory shell of a film, with nothing for the viewer to contemplate after watching except that he's been taken ten dollars back.",Spring Breakers
321,FearNtremblng,Sprraaang Brreeeeaaakkk Yaaaa'lll,5,30 March 2013,"What on earth can be said of this movie? Well, it was easily one of the worst, most hilarious movies I've seen - and to explain how that can be, I'll have to adopt the discontinuous narrative of the movie's storyline to get it straight. Oh boy!The beginning begun without beginning. No character development / satire of the mindless orgy that is spring break. Suddenly we find ourselves in Florida and before a storyline even begins we hit a strange climax: 4 jailbirds taken off with the milieu of an ending rather than a beginning. People in the theatre looked around at each other, curious.This was a mosaic, a mesh of different movies, or so it felt. Everything was an interlude - loud and fast or slow and repetitive - nothing accomplished: the party life is always just about to start living, always in the process, hung up in an intermission. It never begins. Brilliant.But Gomez's inexperience shone through, her sudden departure was a relief. It seemed the director/writer instantly forgot about her from then on, but don't worry, the audience does too - whatever happened / whoever cares? The other three? Poor acting all around, culminating in the tragedy of a hit me baby one more time. We were embarrassed for each of them, deeply. Franco did what he could, sometimes successful, most often not. The cringeworthy dialogue, which permeated the entire movie almost unbearably, was simply a feat he couldn't master. Could anyone?The highest point of satire throughout was the caricature of the woman's mouth as toilet - a potent enough image, but it shouldn't be the highest. The satire failed because it was poorly handled. It was never distinguished from any other aspect of the film - if we took only portions of it to be satirical we were never sure which ones were and weren't, if we took it all to be then we're severely disappointed at its shortcomings. Without the sharp edge the satire flew in its own face, ending up in the deepthroat piano sequences which, so ridiculously handled, made us feel that this was trying to be pulled off seriously, resulting in the funniest 15 minutes I've ever seen on film: funny for all the wrong reasons. That is, not for the reasons Korine intended. I was crying, convulsing. It ended up satirizing itself.And all but a hazy drunken memory, nothing more. The film mimicked the experience of the dazed and confused lifestyle so well it imposed it on the audience: several times throughout, and especially at the ending, I noticed it was very difficult to remember what had previously occurred. The movie itself was a drunken binge; one escapes it murky, hungover. Bravo, well done. The writing? Terrible. Trash. Almost every phrase was repeated over and over and over and ... OVER. 'Spring break' had to have been said 80 times or more: might dethrone Roxanne as the mother of drinking games. No plot, no cohesiveness, we don't even have a movie here. What was it? I still don't know. A pasteboard of inspiration buried in trash. But a cult classic in the making, give it some years, the 15 minutes parenthesis will kill you - watch it just for that. That scene should go down in history as the most hilarious mistake put on film. I recommend it just for that, and that's what deserves all the cult status. James Franco will need a few movies to recover from this one. If I were him I'd be embarrassed to venture outside. Painful...just painful.",Spring Breakers
322,hawkeye-mail,Perhaps the worst movie you will ever see,1,1 December 2013,"I don't like using the word ""literally"", but this is literally the worst movie I've ever seen. OK, I've seen some really, really bad movies so lets just say it's the worst movie that I can remember watching - and I watch a lot of movies. Unless you're an adolescent between the ages of 12-16, you're not going to get any enjoyment what so ever out of this movie. If you happen to be in the aforementioned age, then trust me, they'll be plenty of scenes for you to pause just at the right time and do your business.Anyways, fap fest aside, this really is an awful movie. One of the things you may find most annoying is when scenes and dialog get repetitive. Like you'll hear the same line repeated over and over. For example, (spoiler alert) when the girls and James Franco were plotting to kill the black dude for shooting their friend, they repeated the same dialog at least 6 times (no joke). I guess this is the directors style, I don't know, but it's horrible. Perhaps if it had been a better movie it would work but given how bad the movie is, it just compounds it.Given that this review is being written now that the movie is out on DVD, you're probably only going to be considering watching this if you stumbled across it somewhere and saw the 4 cute girls in bikinis on the cover. If you think 2 hours of seeing Vanessa Hudgens in a bikini is worth watching this train wreck for, then knock yourself out.",Spring Breakers

James Franco amazingly plays this part very very well, I'm surprised because Mr. Franco was not good at all in OZ. The 4 girl were amazing! So acting is good but the director goes out there really far in trying to make this film artsy and it doesn't need it. The film is fine on its own. With the exception of picking a different director I would say I like the acting a lot, the wow, shock and aw value is there for sure! I was surprised and shocked by the amount of nude, dirty, raunchy, gun violence, drugs and just everything crazy they did. Lets face it. If you going to sit in this movie then your expecting to see this raunchiness then your going to love it but I think everyone will be surprised in how low and crazy they go. It's no holds barred.

It would have worked far better as a straight narrative rather than using multiple and tiresome flashbacks and flashforwards. The scenes of people dancing and 'spring breaking' become dull--over and over again we see young kids dancing, drinking, partying, etc. I think we all know what spring break looks like? Do we need 20 minutes of the same footage? Writer/director doesn't seem to know if this is a morality play, coming of age story, fantasy, story of redemption or what. whenever the movie gains narrative momentum, we are shown a flashback or, worse, a flashforward. Often the girls are as stupid as those in a horror flick and nothing is quite believable. What's the great morale of this story? Don't go on spring break? Don't get drunk? An 'indictement of America.'? Please. Writer/director working with material he doesn't quite 'own' or understand. There are a couple of OK moments (the first robbery is shot in a rather clever way-- no spoilers), but why does it feel to me like the writer/director is little more than an immature male who likes to look at girls in bikinis, builds a movie around those images, and then fails to tell us a believable or interesting story.

If there is one (and only one) saving grace of this film it would be James Franco as he once again turns in a performance unlike any he has done before. The girls are completely stiff and unrelatable (unless I am so far removed from the average teen age girl these days). I cannot imagine any girl with half a brain (certainly enough to go to college) participating in a ""romp"" such as this let alone four of them.

The relatively unknown Rachel Korine was cute in the movie, Selena Gomez delivered a good performance, nothing too crazy like the others. I enjoyed seeing Ashley Benson in a different role other than Hanna Marin from Pretty Little Liars, Vanessa Hudgens in my opinion was absolutely perfect.

I get that the main characters are probably trying to step out of their good girl image but I don't think this was the right movie. Selena Gomez was hardly in the movie at all anyways.

One leaves right at the beginning, the other after being shot, and the last two after killing a number of people and kissing a dead James Franco.

The reason for its controversy stems from the fact that its target audience found its plot to be pointless, even though that was the point. This film depicts the shallowness of the modern definition of what is 'cool', like idolizing people that suck, those that contribute nothing to society but cheap entertainment. This sort of fascination blindly controls youth, the main reason so many did not understand the meaning behind this movie: they are blind to its influences. They think week long drinking binges, whoring themselves out, and having no goals is cool, because YOLO. However, this film is based off of these components and its audience deems the plot as pointless. Funny. Spring Breakers is like this generation looking itself directly in the mirror.

334,mikelovellslaptop,All Monsters Are Human,8,14 March 2017,"Multi-layered and multifaceted, Spring Breakers has achieved exactly what it set out to do - divide viewers into two teams; those who want to see through it, and those who can't - but for reasons that neither side would openly admit.Harmony Korine has presented not only his best work in this movie, but has also managed to create imagery that takes faith, nihilism, mysticism, illusion, delusion and insecurity; blending them all together to deliberately create a 'magic-eye' picture that perfectly summarises the social deadly sins, if there are such things.At face value this is a hyper-real, glossy extended MTV video; seemingly taking a dig at music video directors for their formulaic approach and generic use of hackneyed images - girls, guns, cars, money; suggesting that as a director, he could put them to shame not just over 4 minutes, but over 90; essentially a job application. But this is merely a ruse.Make no mistake, despite being listed as Crime/Drama, this is a monster movie - but it's so well concealed beneath the gloss and social stereotypes portrayed that it easily confuses and frustrates the viewer, and this is a deliberate effort on the part of Korine: he literally flatters to deceive.One level down from the surface, he suggests that all viewers of movies, soap operas or music videos either consciously or otherwise, aspire to the fantastical lifestyles and characters portrayed therein - and as such, are attracted to Spring Breakers for that very reason. Some, such as the characters in the movie itself go to extreme lengths to make it become reality. This is the mirror image and paradox that oft offends the viewer to the point that they simply refuse to search any further, sensing almost personal insult and questions about their own morality - as if they were watching themselves on the screen.Scratch below that, and what's revealed is something terrifying, cynical, tragic and deeply religious in nature. It holds a mirror up to modern life (and the viewer) through traditional religious imagery; good and bad, right and wrong. Slowly and deliberately, it's suggested that the 'angels' are in fact 'demons' and vice versa - or at least some of them. Part of the puzzle presented by Spring Breakers, is working out who's who - or what is what - beneath their seemingly beautiful facades.But much like an episode of The Simpsons, there is real duality here. You can view the 'kids' version without much effort or reward - or you can blur your vision, concentrate, look through the screen and watch as the 'adult' version slowly takes shape. It's all there to see: dark, light, good, evil, simple, complex - but it's up to you to decipher the puzzle, or equally, decide that there isn't one at all.For my money, this is by far his best work to date and one of the best psychological horror movies of recent times. That's right. Horror. 8/10.",Spring Breakers

Besides that the movie has many experienced actors such as, James Franco, Vannesa Hudges, and Selena Gomez. The movie starts off as just these girls trying to come up with some money to enjoy their spring break . One girl who's which a Christian, she doesn't agree with the rest of the girls' decision on how they get the money, but still goes on the break anyhow . Once they see the ' good life ' on break , they realize reality has hit and end up choosing a different lifestyle that tests their own friendship .

Firstly, I would temper your expectations. If you are expecting a fun film like American Pie or Van Wilder you will be seriously disappointed.The director clearly has a penchant for nudity and close ups of girls in bikinis, because that's about all you see for a good proportion of the film. A description of the film would be a soft core porn movie with a gangster sub-plot in an attempt to give it some substance.James Franco gives an outstanding performance which has raised my rating from 1 to 4. He is the glue to this otherwise silly, scatterbrain idea of spring break. Without him, the film would be utterly pointless. There is some character building at the start of the movie, but any of the obvious exploits of these characters are never realised and ignored throughout the movie.I could go on forever about the flaws or plot holes. In summary, there were several avenues they could have gone down to explore characters and build a plot but they've ignored them all and leave a feeling a little bit like the lost series did - a bit of a mess and no real idea of how to develop it. To the people who claim the movie is good ""artistically"" and visions of excellent direction. It's like assuming a fine wine tastes nice, it doesn't, it's an acquired taste and you have to learn to like it. Artistry in a movie is just a small part of what you pay to see. A movie first and foremost should be a story about something. The whole point of a movie is to be entertaining...by definition of the industry... so why would the director make parts of the movie boring deliberately? - see thejoshl comment for clarification. There are several scenes where the repetition and silliness make you wonder what time it is. Any movie that makes you check your watch half way through to see when it's over has failed as entertainment.If you want to go and see a fast paced soft porn teen party movie that slams the brakes on half way through and transforms itself into a silly gangster style satirical movie - spring breakers is for you! Otherwise don't waste your hard earned cash on this one.",Spring Breakers
338,artalways,Brief review about the meaning of Spring Breakers,3,12 October 2012,"I don't want to talk about the storyline much (you can read that in other reviews), I just want to point out the things that need more attention to my opinion. Why? Because all this fun that is really 'in your face' may distract from the underlying, perhaps much more interesting, message.Spring Breakers shows the extreme party many young people dream of. Dancing, naked bodies, beach, money, music, beautiful young people, lots of liquor and drugs, the ultimate high all day and all night long. I wonder if the same version will be released in the States (because it contains quite some full frontal nudity)The shady side to all of this 'joy' starts already at the beginning of the story when three of the four girls violently rob a diner for the cash needed to pay for this vacation. The last girl tags along for the trip, but is the most innocent of them all. She is the one that is religious, and she obviously leaves the party madness first, before it gets really bad. The film is well edited, and the music really adds to the experience. Though the, first original, way of repeating sequences does soon get tiring towards the end. The film tries to convey you trough humor and the sexy appeal of it all, the same way the characters are swept along in their urge for limitless excitement and pleasure. The character of James Franco is most funny in his role, I especially recall the sentence ""look at all my sh*t"" next to his absurd piano scene, to be hilarious. One almost forgets he is a full blown criminal, all his guns an money and clothes are gathered by killing, distributing drugs and so on. As eventually two girls remain, they are getting more and more entangled in criminal activities.This is what makes Spring Breakers actually a good movie: it shows how close this partying and fun really is to crime. Because booze, sex, drugs and all related lean very close to, or are directly connected to, the underworld. It's good that the film doesn't condemn fun or partying in general (although the religious girl getting out first got me suspicious).It was a shame that the cast or director didn't mention this deeper meaning at the press conference, and the actresses only spoke about how they had 'such a great time' during the shooting.",Spring Breakers

340,DavidCSjoberg,Radical Poetic Hyper-Cinema,10,3 February 2013,"OK, so I saw ""Spring Breakers"" last night at the Gothenburg Film Festival and it's still fresh in my mind. My first reaction was one of absolute elation after witnessing an extraordinary piece of transcendental art. The film feels somehow beyond the postmodern dichotomy of good/bad or high/low - rather - it reads like some sort of hyper-simulacrum that reflects contemporary culture in an extremely complex manner. The themes of the film are similar to what Korine has touched upon before: mundane reality vs. an intense ""heightened"" or elevated existence beyond good or evil, where reality is replaced by a (or the) dream that goes on forever and ever. But in ""Spring Breakers"" those themes are presented in more dimensions than in for example ""Mister Lonely"" or ""Trash Humpers"".The liquid colorful cinematography is spectacular throughout, though some scenes especially stand out, for example the robbery and the montage that goes along with Britney Spears ""Everytime"", spectacular examples of great art. There is a method of repetition that runs through the film (which I'm sure will annoy quite a few people), dialogue is repeated, scenes are repeated, images are repeated, the sound of a gun being loaded (used brilliantly as poetic punctuation) is repeated - every time eschewing the original meaning of said occurrence - thereby adding another level of analytical value and another point to the already complex sentiments. It really speaks volumes of contemporary culture where the ""dreams"" of the populace is nothing but representation and spectacle in its purest form. With ""Spring Breakers"" Korine has really managed to reflect, deconstruct and subvert (the way the great fun of it also becomes the grim menace of it, I find genuinely subversive) what some might see as banal popular culture and escapism and turn it into radical poetic hyper-cinema, and I truly found that masterful.I look forward to the general reaction to the film once it gets a wide release, but I doubt it will be a hit with either mainstream audiences or bourgeoisie film critics. I think it will appeal mainly to fans of art-house exploitation or experimental genre-cinema.",Spring Breakers
341,ernesto-pepe,"Excellent plot and better direction, a must see",8,6 July 2013,"Not really often I see movies where you don't really know who is the movie about but until the very end. This is that kind of movies. Art and camera direction are brilliant, colours are fluoride-shiny as visual experiences with LSD must be. This movie both honours and despises the current ""reality show"" culture, because as it goes, characters turn to be dismissed one by one, whilst the MTV-style party goes ruthlessly on. Girls and nude-sex scenes are both sexy and sometimes abhorrent. Pure dialectics. The scene of the first assault (the camera going around the house in one shot) is one of the most original travellings I've seen since Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. Probably a classic must-see in a couple of decades.",Spring Breakers

But let me tell you this, it is way more then that. It is filled with twists and action, suspense, drama, emotions flow throughout this film. The Disney characters definitely have changed and for the best. This movie is exactly what I like and I am so glad they pulled it off, all the way until the end. This movie is not for everyone. This movie is for those who do not like the basic generic mainstream junk. This movie is for the open minded free thinkers.

343,martinelanthier,Lack of content,4,10 November 2013,"I just finished watching ""Spring Breakers"" and right now I feel disappointed, because I was expecting so much more from this movie.Luckily, James Franco was hired to play ""Alien"", who is the leader of his own little gang. Franco is a brilliant actor and without him, this movie would have been an utter disaster (or simply one more movie about young rebel girls who are shown partially naked and partying).The female characters, four young adult spring breakers, are boring and contradictory on many levels. The young actresses who portrait them are not very skilled at acting (two of them in particular who should stick to singing) and they do not come across as authentic characters.The time frame for this movie is about two weeks, and we have no information at all on the characters' backgrounds. Except a couple of minutes about Alien's relationship with his ex best friend. I believe that this created part of my disappointment, because I could not understand the dynamics between the four girls, who are very different from one another on specific levels.This movie was definitely not the type of movie that I enjoy watching. This said, if you are into movies with partial nudity, partying, lots of drugs and tragic endings, you will enjoy Spring Breakers.",Spring Breakers
344,vic_j,"The rating must be a joke, one of the worst films in years",2,26 June 2013,"I rarely write reviews it's been ages since the last one but am writing this to vent out some frustration. To think this film currently has a 6.3 rating and generally favourable reviews elsewhere is really strange. There is booze, sex and drugs but you need something of substance to make even a half decent film, this doesn't even come close.Acting is poor, girls are largely annoying and there is nothing happening whatsoever, it makes no sense, it just dwells on the over importance of spring break, there is no character development and it's a total waste of time, I was bored. It plods along pointlessly for an hour gets decent for 10 minutes and finishes off with a meaningless ending.I haven't seen After Earth and yes it may be disappointing but it will never be this bad, it's a shame a film like that would get such bad reviews, I mean at least they have tried something, Spring Breakers doesn't even do that, the plot has more holes than a string vest.If I was to think about a top 10 worst films list this would most likely be on it, it is definitely one of the worst I have seen in years I would have gave it a 1 but it does have a catchy soundtrack for the younger crowd, some scenes are well shot and James Franco does pretty well for his part which does however start becoming repetitive like everything else due to the poor script.

And guess what I wanted to relax and did this mistake.Overall you will try to find something in this movie, but till the end, it won't give you anything. You will end up in frustration by keep listening one word again and again ""Spring break"". Okay, we got that this movie is focused on spring break, but how much time we have to listen to just one thing again and again. Not only this, there are many scenes which keep repeating and you won't have any clue why this is happening.NO plot, NO objective, NO story, NO script writing and they were literally out of good dialogues also. This could be one of the reasons why they just kept repeating few lines. God knows why Selena Gomez was in this movie! She hardly gets a chance to appear on the screen. 4 girls bored with their routine and want to enjoy. They rob a restaurant to get money and go to spring break. For what? For drink? Drugs? Fun? Sex? Bullshit? really? they can do all these at their college!! Why go and waste money? At the end they got nothing and we get a headache with a mixture of frustration! Overall in this movie, there is no objective getting clear, because of poor story-line and plot. There is not a single moment which you can enjoy in this movie.

346,xelagbs,A simplistic dream fantasy about sexuality and surrender,8,4 April 2013,"I've experienced Spring Breakers as Saturday morning dream that keeps you in bed. While your half awake enjoying it, it becomes more and more bizarre until you finish it with an abrupt ending and get up. The thing I liked most about this movie is that the girls form a classical femme fatale. Separately they are just normal ""Spring Break"" girls but combined they transfer into mysterious and seductive women. I felt a great attraction to their superiority. Together they formed a woman that only exists in a men's fantasy. I love it when they took control of Alien. At first he looks like a stereotype American wannabee gangster, but his surrender to the girls changes him into a character which is capable of love in an unlikely shallow situation. Of all the sex, porn, drugs, guns and violence the love between Alien and the girls was the most powerful and destructive force in the movie. I also loved the way Harmony Korine used recurring sentences like ""Sping Break"" to tone up the almost psychedelic undergoing of watching this movie. The repetitions in this movie enhanced the feeling as if I was experiencing a dream. Besides the above points I also loved the colors, compositions, grainy arty shots, humor (the Britney Spears cover which is probably the best movie scene this year), the numerous twists and lack of Hollywood clichés.The only thing I didn't like were the female actors. Korine should have picked up some real girls from the streets. But I can understand the whole marketing purpose to use ex-Disney actors... money. This movie is anything but ordinary. If you are looking for a interesting story or good acting you shouldn't waste your time. If your open for a trip into a sexy love fantasy of Harmony Korine you'll love it!It's a simplistic peace of art with great depths. Not bad for a non- European production.",Spring Breakers

With this story-line and these acting performances you don't need the kind of editing used in here. Every scene goes like A running dialogue/monologue with glimpse of past present and future moments.

And yes, the slang spelling of gangster is totally mandatory in this situation.If you haven't heard of Spring Breakers, I'm sure you will soon largely due to the hype it's generating because of its cast. Spring Breakers follows Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, and Rachel Korine on their spring break in sunny Florida. In order to get there, the girls rob a local restaurant and the trip that follows is a bit more outrageous than the girls expect. Yes, it contains your typical 'spring break' parties, but along with the drugs and alcohol, the girls find themselves in the company of a local arms dealer (James Franco). The path that follows isn't what the girls had planned, and may be a little too much for some of them.Now, I wanted to like this movie. Honestly, I really did. But there were too many things I couldn't quite handle, like a strange musical moment where Franco serenades the girls with an oh too popular Britney Spears song. Yes, that did happen, and no I will not get back those 3 minutes of my life.I will give the film credit in a lot of areas. Personally, I found Director/Writer Harmony Korine unique and the film pushes most of the cast members (Hudgens, Gomez and Benson in particular) out of their stereotypes, and in a strange way, that worked. The problem was I wasn't sold on the plot. As the girl's 'adventure' with Franco continues, I lost interest. Yeah, I could buy the coming of age bits, but the whole 'party girls turning into James Franco's hardcore gangsta b*****s' bit was too ridiculous for me. I understand that there are probably a lot of 'deep' factors in this film that a lot of critics are going to obsess over, but personally, I couldn't overlook the ridiculousness of some moments enough to appreciate that other side of the film.Basically, if you want my advice, this movie isn't for your average film goer. If you want something you can sit and enjoy, skip this in theaters, and ignore it by the time it pops up on Netflix. And if you were curious about it because your buddy told you Vanessa Hudgens boobs are in it, you were lied to my friend.

354,LeCadavreExquis,Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers is a fascinating and elusive tale of perverse female emancipation.,8,14 June 2014,"In the beginning of the film there's a scene in a lecture hall which - besides being aesthetically pleasing, all those kids gently lit by their notebook screens, like a counterweight to the neon saturated fever dream that will follow - serves a thematic purpose: the class is on the African Americans's equal rights movement, and it's the narrative of emancipatory movements that Korine subverts in Spring Breakers.The film boasts four leading female characters; two of them are shown to be drawn to violence and they go from mimicking guns with their hands and filling up squirt guns with booze - consider the significance of firing those phallic instruments into your own mouth - to robbing a diner, also with a play gun, but with very real results. Ultimately it enables the girls to go to Miami - which, not by coincidence, is Tony Montana's stomping ground in Scarface.So let's analyse this some more. There's a party scene in the beginning of the film, that shows one of the lead females playing craps and taking the money. Playing craps is a trope in roughly 90's hip hop culture - more on that later - and a typically masculine pass time. The robbery too sees - although we initially don't get to see more than the occasional glance through the window - the females adopting a souped up masculine, criminal machismo. We see them acting out an a-moral fantasy of masculinity, all the while physically stressing their femininity.Fast forward to Miami. We're introduced to Alien, a white rapper/criminal - another trope in 90's hip hop culture: the 'gangsta' rapper, the hustler, the pimp - sporting corn rows and a grill, who was raised in a black neighborhood and who's turned the cartoonish gangsta tales Dr Dre raps about into a lifestyle. 'look at all my s_hit,' is Alien's materialistic mantra, 's_hit' signifying his dope, guns and money - and apparently his, continuously played, Scarface (!) DVD. He's basically a white caricature of an of itself caricatural branch of hip hop culture.And what does Alien do: he buys the women. Then there's a key scene. When Alien's about to subject the ladies, who are at this point essentially his slaves, to his male dominance, the roles are reversed and the girls 'pimp' the pimp, penetrating him with his own (!) guns – no need for an extensive knowledge of Freudian symbolism to interpret this . The male character is subjugated via phallic penetration – BTW sexuality and violence/guns are linked from the beginning not only visually, but also acoustically, i.e. the recurring sound of a single gunshot - and the typical 'gangsta' scenario of hyper-masculinity, of male superiority, is inverted, turned inside out, in other words: the gender roles are reversed.What, I think, Korine is doing here, is dismantling the misogynistic mythology that dominated a significant part of 90's hip hop culture, and assembling it again in the context of female emancipation. In other words: the narrative that was used to objectify and subjugate women, is now used by women to quite the opposite end.It's no big surprise then, that the film that's so overly present in rap music, is quoted in the surrealistic ending of the film; Scarface's ending is basically turned on its head. I don't think this scene, in which the females are shown to definitively put an end to the perverted amoral dream of male dominance, literally gunning it down, should be interpreted metaphorically per se, but there's surely something to be said for not reading it exclusively literally. The ending symbolically completes this tale of emancipation: the two female leads penetrate the bastion of male superiority and tear it down by using the exact same myths, symbols, or weapons that were used to establish it in the first place.",Spring Breakers

It is not. These people are pretentious wannabe film critics who seem to think they have some god-given gift of understanding things to a deeper level than everyone else. This is the worst film I have watched in... Well, ever. As a cinematographer myself I have to admit this is one wonderfully shot film but it's unfortunate Harmony Korine couldn't match that with his script or direction. The cast are, quite frankly, annoying from the outset and I find it hard to believe they are there other than to convince themselves they are not just had-beens from the Disney Channel. The script is repetitive and dull and it would seem character development packed a bag and left long before Pre-production began. This film is 94 minutes of monotonous build-up to absolutely nothing, punctuated by bare breasts, ass shaking and excessive, artsy slow-motion party scenes that look cool but carry no substance whatsoever. I spent a good 5 minutes in a stunned silence as this film finished and the credits rolled; stunned that such a pile of rubbish even managed to get made, let alone put into theatres; stunned that anyone with some pretty girls and a seemingly unlimited lighting budget can brainwash people into thinking Spring Breakers was a good film. 1/10",Spring Breakers
357,msnow63,James Franco cant save this one,3,12 July 2013,"I just finished viewing Spring Breakers at a friends house and I'm not quite sure what to think. On one hand I'm a fan of James Franco and I like the idea of four teenagers doing anything it takes to party and getting sucked into the dark underbelly of the partying lifestyle.. on the other hand this movie did that in the worst way possible. I just finished seeing it and I have no clue what even one of the four main characters names were, If not for the inclusion of James Franco I probably would've given this movie a 2 or even a 1. All this movie amounted too was a lot of project x style party shots mixed in with the four incidental female leads getting wasted, having sex and committing crimes. Selena Gomez is in the movie a whole 30 minutes before heading home due to her friends erratic behavior and her character was the only one that had any sort of background or character development. After she leaves the movie turns into a weird collage of guns money and James Franco saying ""look at my s%!t!"" the movie was just weird and annoying to an extent. No sub-plots or underlying messages just extremely unlikable characters and a lot of slow mow shots of the cast looking at money and admiring Alien's (James Franco's) self proclaimed ""gangsta"" life-style.

359,wrgavin,Intriguing,6,7 April 2013,"If you're a fan of the work this great director has produced then you will take something away from this film. I feel this film just didn't quite hit the mark. That's not to say it didn't hold an interesting narrative at times, or that it lacked substance. It seems to poke fun at the fakeness and inauthenticity that traveling can bring in terms of ""finding yourself"" as a person, when really you're just a young person who wants to drink, smoke and f*ck. Unfortunately, it felt just a little bit too fake in itself.I think it struggles a bit with tone. At moments it rivals a legitimate coming of age story, however at other moments it seems almost more in the style of a Dicaprio Romeo and Juliet styled crime story where drug dealers and little girls become assassins with dead shot aim, seemingly overnight. Meanwhile the thuggin black dudes who no doubt have thugged it up and shot guns for years, have such bad aim they probably couldn't commit suicide successfully with less then a full clip.A good comparison for me would be to say Spring Breakers is to Kids what Public Enemies is to Heat. An interesting little snippet with potential, but it just doesn't work as well as the originals that defined this director's style. The shoe just didn't quite fit and it smelled a little funky.One thing this film accomplishes in strides, like many of the works from this director, is that it makes you feel uncomfortable in many instances. A true artist and a creator, the director's influence is present, though seemingly a little more commercialized. I think there is a meaningful story in here, but it's drowned out by too much partying and a lackluster story.",Spring Breakers
360,amira_badawey,My Take on Spring Breakers,5,28 March 2013,"Spring Breakers is being marketed as an Art House film, something I like to call Artsy Fartsy because it either portrays art or artistic farts. I find it helpful to approach such movies with little to no expectations. That way you're either pleasantly surprised or not disappointed. On both accounts I found Spring Breakers belonging to the later categories. Despite my skepticism, I tried to keep an open mind. The movie has the elements of good to interesting stories, extreme religion vs. overindulgence, yet the movie never follows through. The film's creator, Harmony Korine, repeatedly denies that the movie is an F-you to Disney despite that all the leads, including Franco, are Disney/ABC stars, with the exception of Korine's own wife. The girls even give a rendition of Brittany Spears ""Baby One More Time"", another Disney Alumni. Why would college kids know the lyrics to a song release in 1999 - do they even know who Brittany Spears is (I can hear the reply of a co-ed: ""Oh yeah. Isn't she that old chick who like shaved her head and went like totally crazy."") Again, I approached Spring Breakers with no expectation what so ever, just curiosity. So I'm not surprised by the weak female roles developed by a middle aged man. I can understand why such young actresses might see this movie as an opportunity to break their Disney mold, but what kind of statement are they trying to make? Do they want to position themselves as serious grownup actors? In that case, might I suggest a film that requires them to act. Spring Breakers is void of any meaningful dialog to a point that I feel like the writers were too lazy to even eavesdrop on actual college kids and steal their interactions. Even the metaphors are blatantly spelled out - Franco warning the girls to be careful in the water because there are sharks waiting to prance on them - how very subtle.When all is said and done about Spring Breakers the one thing that remains with viewers is the image of gyrating bodies, an image so intense it is nauseating. Maybe that was Mr. Korine's intentions all along. Anything in excess is sickening, whether be it religion, partying, schooling, drugs, or naked bodies. I don't know, maybe I'm not sophisticated enough to digest an Art House movie, God knows I'm not among its target audience.

361,browney321-666-707492,Not what i was expecting,5,22 April 2013,"This film was quite simply not what i was expecting. it had so much potential but did not take it. the cast looked very good on paper, and the inclusion of sex certainly did not go against this film for me, but apart from a few scenes, the nudity was not of the main cast but of random people on the beach. don't get me wrong i still liked the nudity but as it wasn't of the main cast it wasn't really needed.The story was very unrealistic but i can handle that, but the story never really came together, nor did it start until about 30 minutes in to the movie, by then i had pretty much lost interest, even though i really liked the cast they just couldn't draw me in emotionally. we are supposed to feel sorry for these girls but i just don't.The ending wasn't right, it just didn't feel like a proper ending, and one of the worst endings i have seen in a while.Don't get me wrong though, it wasn't a terrible film, the voice over, although done many times already, was good. it brought a darker tone to the movie and actually kept me interested, without that i probably would have walked out.Overall, if you want to see a film with loads of tits, loads of ass, drugs and violence then you probably won't be disappointed. if you are big fans of the cast and hope to enjoy the movie you may be a little let down.",Spring Breakers
362,Jmsmanochio,5 problems that make this movie horrible,1,30 May 2013,"This movie is just... crazy. I've seen movies that are shot through hand held cameras that are so jumpy that they give you a headache, but this one... my head almost exploded from how bad the editing was. I don't know what the idea was behind this editing, I can only assume the director wanted to try something knew, and I can honestly say it was original editing, but it was god awful and I could not follow the film because of it... Now onto the other big problems. Problem one: No Selena Gomez. Selena Gomez was billed as the top actress but she's only in the movie for twenty minutes and leaves not even halfway through the movie and is never mentioned again, her character serves absolutely no purpose other then to say ""Hey! Selena Gomez is in this movie!"" She's also the only one of the four girls who had her own general character, so that made the movie go down-hill fast after she left. Problem two: Lazy Editing. Another big problem with this editing is they show the same clips over and over at least 10 times... I guarantee if you re-edited this, and cut out ALL extra shots, the movie wouldn't even make it to an hour long, it actually uses extra shots to get a longer run-time, LAZY! Problem three: No defining characteristics of the other three girls. There's no denying it, they are all the same bimbo. They act the same, talk the same, dress the same, whore around the same, there is nothing that defines one from the other and it's almost impossible to tell who's who, I could only tell the difference because one was the director's wife, one was Vanessa Hudgens, and one was some other lady. It was a mess! There's no character developments for the three main girls. Hell, these three girls are total morons too, they join up with James Franco's character all because he kept them from spending two days in jail, and the three fall for him faster then fairy tale princesses fall for their princes. He has nothing but money, guns, and ""power"" and they fall for it like complete whore stereotypes. Problem Four: James Franco's character is poorly done. First off, I love James Franco, he's in my top 5 favorite actors and him being in this movie was the only reason I was willing to check it out. His character was my least favorite... this was most underdeveloped, unexplained, unneeded character I've ever seen... All you know about him is that he's a big gang lord with weird dreadlocks... This man is built up as the cream of the crop and the best gang lord in the world, and there's no explanation how he got there, the closest I heard to an explanation was he stabbed his best friend (the ""main antagonist"") in the back... basically the main antagonist is the victim. There's just so much wrong with this guy's character, and I will say James Franco's acting was good, but the character was horribly written. Problem five: the worst ending they could possibly make. This is the last 20 minutes of the film. James Franco plans to storm his former best friends house and off the whole gang because one of the girls got grazed in the arm in a drive by after James Franco and the three sluts robbed his best friend and basically asked for it... wow what a reason... so he and the two remaining girls (both of the girls are dressed in pink masks and yellow bikini's... clearly so they can blend into the night) and the second they step off the boat... James Franco, the most powerful gang leader in the city... gets offed by a bullet shot from 200 yards away by some random gang member... then the girls, who stick out like a sore thumb, annihilate the rest of the gang, and off the ""main antagonist"" then drive home as James Franoc keeps saying ""spring break, spring break"" over and over... That's... all I need to say about this... it was a mess...",Spring Breakers
363,daisy_chocolate37,Don't understand what I just watched...,3,30 July 2013,"I watched this with three of my friends and we are all teenage girls, so surely we are the sort of people this film is supposed to be aimed at? Right? Apparently not. I think that the only way you enjoy watching this is if 1. you want to see four, admittedly hot, girls run around in bikinis for what seems to be the whole film holding guns and robbing people 2. you enjoy being bored out of your mind for 92 minutes of your life or 3. you just like all the flashing lights.None of the three apply to me and so therefore I must say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I still don't really understand what the exact storyline is. Me and my friends watched the whole thing just making comments on how stupid this film actually is. The thing that amused us the most is that Alien (James Franco) seems to be completely obsessed with spring break, he must have said the line 'spring break b*****s' about a million times, and yet it isn't actually his spring break.Selena Gomez actually did quite well considering the weird script, but she had gone before the film had even hit the half way mark, and then the other girl left, which just left you with Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson attempting act hot and all bad ass when actually they just looked like half naked psychos. I also have to admit that even though I didn't get Alien, there was something about him that was likable. Whether that was because I knew it was James Franco under the hundreds of layers of ugly make up, or the fact that he was, in a weird way, nice to the four girls.All in all, I would not recommend you see this film unless you desperately want to lose 92 minutes of your life to complete and utter boredom.",Spring Breakers
364,philms-729-737521,Absolutely terrible,1,25 March 2020,"Nothing make sense here. This movie only last for 90 min because half of it is in slow motion. The characters don't evolve or change. SPOILER: In the beginning the girls rob a restaurant. so they start as criminals and end as criminals.
James Francos character is supposed to be a drug dealer, but they go rob people at a party for a couple of thound dollars I guess. Don't you think, that, as a drug dealer, you would like to stay low profile?
One of the worst movies I ever saw. Mostly because it is boring as hell. You could show that Fancos character slowly easing innocent spring break girls into becoming criminals until its too late to quit. That could have been interesting. But the only good thing here is Jes Franco as an actor.",Spring Breakers
365,ampbr,One good word: Crap!,4,2 August 2013,"I wasn't going to bother writing a review, but then when I read the one posted at the moment I checked the site, I thought it would be unfair for the people who haven't seen the movie, to not post a review with my opinion. The review I read was really positive and gave the movie 8/10. I couldn't disagree more about it, I gave 4/10 to be nice. Yes the movie is another typical style of Mr. Korine, and I do enjoy some of his movies, but this one won't make that list. If you enjoy seeing a bunch of drunk and drugged teens showing their boobs, a few really crappy sex scenes, Selena Gomez in her grandma panties and lots of repetitive sentences, this is your movie. If you want something more than a poor attempt at portraying a decadent youth, go watch something else.",Spring Breakers
366,anasarcarecords,Spoiler alert! Breast city!,6,10 July 2013,"Spring Breakers, while being almost too over the top in a few ways, still managed to be an interesting work. I'd really like to give it a 6.5, but i can't. I think this movie does a good job at maintaining artistic integrity; even though it is almost like a soft porn. But if you have ever been to spring break or a rowdy college party you probably know that this isn't far off. So if you are appalled at this kind of stuff, you should never let your children leave home. I think this movie is a metaphor for people going to spring break and unleashing the most disturbing part of their life. Soundtrack is pretty alright and the cinematography is well done. Franco is the highlight of the film. He's one of the most inconsistent and bizarre actors ever, but, I still kind of like him.",Spring Breakers
367,jebarreras,Painful to watch,2,25 August 2013,"I watched this movie hoping that it would get better at some point and it spit on those hopes. It is now in my top 3 worst movies I've seen along with Movie 43 and Rubber. I had hoped that because the movie was shot in such a good resolution and had actors like James Franco and Selena Gomez, that it would actually turn out to be a good movie, but I was not only disappointed, but enraged by this movie. Mr. Korine attempts to criticize society and the modern youth in this film but is sorely mistaken. His bitterness towards the ""MTV-inspired youth"" shows in this bias portrayal of college kids.The movie portrays 4 friends (who play white-trash convicts) as they seek adventure in Florida during spring break. Along with augmented criticism towards fraternities, the movie portrays young, college kids doing drugs, binge drinking, and engaging in explicit behavior both publicly and in private. Though a lot of these behaviors are true in real life, Mr. Korine shows his bias nature by exaggerating all of these behaviors and throwing them all into the mix at once. Other than his uneducated criticism of today's college students Mr. Korine seems to lack basic direction skills. The movie is full of inappropriate mood changes, distasteful placement of dubstep music (keep in mind, I love dubstep) and 94 minutes of irritating and confusing camera angles and frames (from awkward close-ups to camera wobble).All in all, this movie is god awful. I love boobs n beer as much as the next guy but this movie was just sad and ultimately painful to the eye.",Spring Breakers
368,jorisf-826-743977,You Only Live Once - so don't waste your time with this!,1,5 November 2013,"This movie is like watching Miley Cyrus twerk for an hour and a half.You could see that as social commentary: the YOLO lifestyle embraced by pop culture is stupid, meaningless, self-indulgent, lazy and boring. But am I supposed to believe that this is the reason a director deliberately set out to fill 94 minutes with lazy, stupid, meaningless self-indulgent crap? Here is another explanation: the director was in a YOLO state of mind himself - he was up for some meaningless fun in the Florida sun. He then just threw some ""artistic"" pretense over the resulting turd of a movie before pooping it out, not caring whether the audience would still be stupid enough to gobble it up anyway or flush it down in disgust.To be fair there was one scene I could identify with: Selena Gomez crying and saying she wants to go home. I would also feel like that if I was involved with this movie.",Spring Breakers
369,JDZander,Incoherent mess,2,3 July 2013,"The biggest problem with this movie is how the story (if you wanna call it a story) was told. It's like watching a 94 min recap of a TV show or possibly a music video.Too many cuts. At one time they're sitting down talking, then they cut to a party, then they're riding a scooter, then they're sitting in a pool. And the whole movie goes on like this. You can simply NOT get into this movie. I don't know why the edited the movie like this, maybe they realized that the story was thinner than air and needed something to make it more interesting? Well they failed!There's basically no story and definitely NO character development.You never get to know or care for the characters. You have no idea who they really are. One can barely tell them apart, except for the brunette. All you know is that they wanna party and get away from their hometown.I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but this was way worse than I thought. The only good thing was some of the visuals. That's why I gave i 2 of 10. You could possibly watch this movie with some friends and have it on in the background while you're drinking beer and talking. No need to pay attention to the plot because there is NONE!",Spring Breakers
370,cosmerk,"Bored girls seek change - embrace crime, sleaze, and drugs",1,24 September 2013,"This movie is as close to porn as it can get without being it. The photography, dialog, story, acting, ... were all of low quality. Dialogue was repeated over and over on a number of occasions, like ""Look at my !@#$!"" while three young girls rolled around on a bed looking captivated by all the belongings. The only message that I could discern was that nudity and swearing fill in time in a movie with nothing to say. How actors like Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, and Ashley Benson were enticed into this cesspit is beyond reason. If they had guidance in selecting the roles they should find new guides. This movie needs another classification other than ""rotten tomatoes"". How about rancid offal. What a shame for parents who purchased the movie or took their children to the cinema because Disney girl the sweet, pretty Selena was in it.

You can see similar content (hypnotic porn) on the actual porn movie pages all over the internet. it is incredible that the producers of this movie doesn't even try to hide the real intention of this film its almost ridiculous. its sad to see what an actor like james franco can do for money. the audience for this movie will be teenager and people on ther 30s maximum 40s, but a teenager is not prepared to see content like this it could be really harmful and destructive.",Spring Breakers

The first 45 minutes is just endless partying! There's no real story line and so the end just makes me confused.Spring Breakers has obviously been made to shock people, and that it definitely does! I was lost for words just sitting in front of the end credits, trying to make sense of what had just happened and failing.I feel like this is just a jumbled up dream that makes no sense!But, I do feel like this has been beautifully filmed! Throughout, I really enjoyed the ""phone calls to grandma"" which gave at least some sense of meaning to this film. The ending I feel is particularly well filmed as they head off on their killing spree and we hear Selena's voice in the background.Over all this film is just shocking without a real story line but still somehow they get away with it and it's a good film.

Rather it captures a kind of youthful desperation to have fun and ecstasy and euphoria. Will the drug fuelled break come to an end? Return to boring reality? Or stay and plunge further into this hyper reality - treat life like a video game as one of the characters says. But it's not a video game. The characters are imbued with a rather sweet if out of control and ultimately self destructive likability and vulnerability. A much better film than it looks like it's going to be, with outstanding performances by all the actors, especially Selena Gomez and James Franco.",Spring Breakers

376,sxs_145,I am very confused,6,9 July 2013,"I was debating if I should give it a 6 or 7.Please someone help me understand.First, my credentials. Film student. Very much into art house films. I love when films go to extremes. There is not one theme which I find disturbing. My mind works (nicely I would add). I appreciate the visual nature of films, but my main area of interest belongs to the insights and thoughts behind a movie.So now... This are my takes for Mr. Korine:1. Mr. Korine is nihilistic in nature, and wanted to say that anyone can and should do whatever they want if it fulfills their needs, and brings happiness. Spring break being completely hedonistic, selfish, and irrational.2. Mr. Korine is an intellectual outcast, that wanted to point out, with a satire, that the people that are involved in this kind of behaviour do not belong to the smart and prosperous society that we have envisioned. They are animalistic, without depth and awareness of existence; and they should be laughed at.3. Mr. Korine is a simple moral thinker, that wanted to make a film that will entice people to see it (look at the marketing strategy for the film) and then reveal a dramatic story, where we witness the corruption of youth and the sad extremes they can reach.4. Mr. Korine is childish with his filmmaking. Thought about a very simple story about slutty girls that transform into bad ass bitches. Carried it through and never gave it much thought.I could think about more conclusions for Korine, but I am tired. I got interested in the film because watching the actresses, and watching that Korine was directing, I thought this was going to be an over the top satire (which I would have loved.) Korine doesn't seem like the moral kind either, and this message was not well given, if it was his original intention. I know there are plenty reasons why a film turns out the way it does. It isn't always in a directors reach; so all my opinions are based on the idea that he had a purpose and accomplished it.My best bet is between points 1 and 4. No.1 is the one that works best, but also seem unlikely. If this was his message, it was not carried through appropriately, and not understandable. Most likely is point no. 4. Nice visuals. I'll give them that. Poor execution. I don't understand why directors refuse to give insight on the purpose/message of the film. It would be much more easier to evaluate them that way. Without real content a film is empty/unnecessary, like this one.My question in the beginning was honest, please tell me which one you believe it was. If you have another idea, tell me. Send me a message. Have a nice one everybody.",Spring Breakers

380,dhgunit,A reflection on those that hate it.......,10,31 July 2013,"How many people are going to hate this movie? Lots. Lot and lots and lots. Lots of girls will hate it, especially if their favorite show is ""Teen Mom 2"". And they probably won't even understand that it is making fun of them. Anyone who wants a story set up, a good guy, a bad guy, some action in between, and a happy ending. You aren't going to see the ""Lone Ranger"" here.What you will see is an examination of our country and how terrible it has become. Our morals and values have become corrupted. Degeneracy is celebrated in our culture now, it is glamorous to waste your body and your soul in the pursuit of nothingness. However, Korine doesn't lecture this message like so many director's of the Hollywood persuasion would......as they would think it is their duty.I thoroughly hated 3 of the girls and Alien throughout the entire movie. Their ""gangsta"" behavior is disgusting in the movie, as it would be in real life. Hurting other people is not glamorous. You don't get to see that in many movies. Selena Gomez's character finally sees the light on this and understands how terrible they are being. Alien worships possessions. He is stupid and violent and has profited off of the pain of others. James Franco as Alien is one of the best performances of his career, and he has had a bright one.The cinematography cannot be denied here. This film is just beautiful. No matter how much you don't ""get"" this movie or how much you hate the vulgarity, you can't deny how beautiful it came out.In the end, you will either complain about too much boobs and butts, no story, the pointlessness of this movie, and emptiness of the female characters or.........you will understand why Korine made them this way. The idols of these girls are pointless, their goals in life are pointless, and unfortunately it reflects a large portion of our American culture.",Spring Breakers
381,jimdibella8,No just no,1,30 March 2013,"This was with out a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen... and I watch the syfy channel. I wish I knew how they were able to convince the big name actors to attach their name to this piece of trash. I think they were trying to make a gritty spring break movie to get away from the same old same old but all they were able to accomplish was a terribly awkward compilation of boobs and bongs. There were so many things wrong with this movie I'm not quite sure where to begin. First of all I'm not sure what the director was thinking there was absolutely no character development through out this movie honestly I didn't know 3 of the 4 main characters names until I looked it up on this website after the movie. Another problem with this movie was that it felt like it was at least an hour longer than it was. I attribute that again to the directing. I think he was trying to be artistic but it ended up feeling like I was watching the movie on repeat. The movie set up is such that you continually hear the same monologues played over the exact same party scenes at least 3 times each in what seems like an endless cycle of deja vue. I could go on and on about the problems in this movie but I'm going to quit here, there are plenty of other reviews that go into more of the almost comical problems that exist in this movie.Oh yeah WTF was going on when they were synchronize dancing with guns, sweat pants, one piece bathing suits and ski masks on??

I found myself bored for most of it and wondering how much time was left in the movie.The shooting style of the movie was different but felt clunky. I think some more editing upon completion of what turned out to be the finished product would have helped.The story itself I found interesting and would be the only reason I could give for seeing this. While the acting by the girls wasn't the greatest, I felt like the effort was there to be a good launching pad for them. Specifically, Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens played different roles from what I expected this soon in their careers.I also went into this movie expecting a comedy and was meant with more of a drama. Keep that in mind if you plan on seeing this.",Spring Breakers
383,simpson8,A Great Dark Comedy With A Great Young Cast,8,23 March 2013,"This is my first review after being an avid IMDb user for several years...and that is because I have a strange need to defend this film against criticism I'm sure it's susceptible to.First, I think it makes the most sense to tell you the type of TV/film I tend to enjoy. I am a 25-year-old female that will very readily admit that I enjoy entertainment directed at younger audiences. I have never missed an episode of Pretty Little Liars, I will buy any magazine with Selena Gomez on the cover (and have all of her CDs downloaded), and I absolutely have looked up those leaked pictures of Vanessa Hudgens online once or twice. Before you start to question my taste...no, this isn't the type of stuff I tend to *identify* with, but yes, I am plugged in to the youthful side of pop culture.The type of movies I'm usually attracted to are always indie films. I like things that leave me feeling like I learned something ""bigger"" about life. I like to feel like I'm unraveling tiny bits of a person's character in every 90-minute-journey and I like to take what I've discovered and apply it to things I encounter every day. I have seen a couple of Harmony Korine's other films in the past and can say with confidence that his style is something I appreciate.So this collision of teen pop culture and indie comedy was basically a wet dream to me. I have been anxiously awaiting the release since it was announced and I even got several friends on board, creating a whole evening around going to Opening Night at the only theater showing it in Milwaukee last night.The verdict? I absolutely loved this film. Though the beginning left you wondering if the writer/director really had a good insight into what college girls say and do when males aren't around (I don't think I've ever randomly done handstands in the middle of my dorm hallway in my underwear at 8 am...or exclaimed ""---- makes my pussy wet!"" to a group of girlfriends...), he quickly redeems himself once the girls actually make it to St. Petersburg. The dynamics between the female leads seemed a perfect mix of realism and campiness that helped to advance the plot over the next 30-45 minutes in a somewhat predictable ,but still exciting to watch, type of way.Faith (Selena Gomez) is probably the most relatable character to any ""normal"" girl this age. She's a Christian, she's not a complete degenerate...but she's also not a saint. She smokes cigarettes, takes hits out of bongs, does lines of coke off of tables, and drinks liquor from paper bags with the rest of them...all the while calling home to tell Grandma how everything is fine. But she still struggles with some of the wild things the other girls are okay with doing, and it makes her seem real. There is a scene sequence when Alien (James Franco) takes the girls to the pool hall filled with ""people from the hood"" and it was one of my favorite parts of the whole movie because of Selena's convincing performance. I think most girls that age could probably relate to a situation where they had set out in search of fun and freedom and what they ended up with was not what they bargained for. I also think most girls could relate to the uncomfortable feeling of being around a bunch of men that you know are viewing you as a piece of meat, and dreading what will happen if you don't find a way to escape. Her pleas to go home and her direct yet nervous conversation with Alien were spot-on and made me feel for her and genuinely hope she made it out.Ashley Benson and Vanessa Hudgens also impressed with their ability to truly act like that pair of best friends that seem just a little bit closer and a little bit crazier than all the other girls you know. Of course, they take it to a whole new level, but I was glad to see them in more adult roles as well.The only part of this movie that prevented me from giving it a 9 or 10 was the repetitiveness. Several times throughout the movie, there would be a piece of dialogue said, and then that piece of dialogue would get repeated over and over for the next few minutes as a montage of plot-advancing scenes played through it. I understand that it was being done for effect, and I could handle it in small doses...but there were a couple of parts where it was less effect, and more broken record.All in all, I was not disappointed. I would warn that if you are expecting to just see a grown up version of the characters you are used to these girls playing, you are going to be disappointed. If you don't like indie movies and can't grasp dark comedy, you also probably will not like this movie. But if you are interested in seeing some rising stars in controversial roles, with a strong plot and a great sense of humor...then you can't lose on sprannnnng breaaaaaak.",Spring Breakers

I was literally face palming, pulling at clumps of my hair and needing a vast amount of tea to deal with it by the time the credits were rolling... The annoying thing is that this film COULD have had potential. The story itself is interesting, focusing on a group of friends who just want to enjoy their late teen/early 20s life style, with the pleasures of alcohol, drugs and sex but they get roped into it all too deep and they struggle to hold on to their morals and worst comes to worst, they become part of some weird gangster life style. I thought the acting and the script was pretty dull and the only excitement was the buzzing soundtrack and constant display of ass and tits, but I decided to stick with it so I could see what happens to the girls in the end. Things got promising when one of them gets shot in the arm and suddenly, the whole party life style doesn't seem so perfect anymore. I was hoping that the seriousness of what was actually happening around them would become apparent to them at this point and that they'd regress into children again (because that's what they are at the end of the day) and be more frightened of their situation than the weird repetitive drug fuelled haze they were in. But nooooo, somehow, instead the ending consisted of realising that Franco's character was a total waste of time through out the whole film and the two remaining girls are actually born gangsters because of their bullet proof bikinis. To be honest, what's the point in them going back to school and being ""good""?

All this movie is is repetition of phrases in annoying acting voices, and dumb female stereotyping. This movie needs to burn! I knew this movie was going to be terrible going in, but I figured I would give it a try since Ashley Benson is in it (yes, I'm a male), and I figured I could sit through an entire movie of her being on screen. Was I dead wrong or what?",Spring Breakers
387,Foley_67,"""Spring Break Forever"". Three words I never want to hear together again.",3,11 April 2013,"Spring Breakers is the latest effort from ""avant-garde"", ""edgy"" and polarising (I can agree on this one) director Harmony Korine. This is my first experience with any of Korine's films and although before viewing this one I was intrigued to check out his other films due to the massive buzz surrounding his work, this will probably be my last experience too.Spring Breakers follows the story of four college girls, some played by ex-Disney stars, as they go on the trip all American college kids dream about; The beach spring break. After discovering they have no way to fund this trip, the girls decide to commit robbery for the cash before embarking on the spring break and partying with mass amounts of alcohol and drugs for a few days before things turn sour and they are arrested, with no money to pay the fine and nowhere to go even if they did. Luckily, James Franco, playing an OTT ""gangsta"" (Who is unbelievably based on a real person) is there to bail them out and take them under his care or just use them as his new lovers. Before long, one of the girls leaves the trip abruptly, citing the reason that she was scared and uncomfortable in the new atmosphere, despite the only difference between the old party atmosphere and the new one being that there were more black people this time around. The remaining girls follow Franco's character around in his gangsta lifestyle before one is shot and the final scene, a shootout scene somehow, plays out with two girls in fluorescent bikinis shooting up at least 10 people in Franco's nemesis' mansion as Franco lies dead from the first enemies shot. I'd like to say there are many other intricacies to the plot but that is the entire story right there. To make matters worse, the short running time of the film (around 93 minutes) is still filled with padding, as the first beach party scene is played throughout the film a number of times and certain lines are re-spoken as different camera angles from the same scene play under them.My view on Spring Breakers has went through three stages. Immediately after viewing, I hated it. Next to no plot, terrible acting, shaky camera to make the film seem more ""arty"" and terrible unbelievable dialogue made this a low score for me. Character development was reduced to one girl having a religious background and of course named Faith, where as the rest of the characters didn't even have names as far as I remember. Franco had perhaps one good scene where he did seem intimidating, manipulative and dangerous but the rest of the performance was ruined by the terrible dialogue and all round bad, honestly just silly writing (see the Britney Spears cover scene). Stage two was after reading other opinions, that view the movie as deeper than what it first seems, and the film being a massive satire on the youth of today. The youth that only think about fun, living in the moment. The YOLO lifestyle. That today's youth would without second thought rob a bank to go on a drug filled holiday, before hanging around with a gangster and killing people. I wondered if maybe this film was trying to show that. Maybe the endless repetition was to hammer the point home. ""Just think of it as a video game"" to show they didn't care about real human lives, that life and lives of others is more like a fictional game to them. ""It's just like a dream"" in that it's not like real life but ""Spring break Forever"" showing they still wanted to live in that one moment forever knowing this. And well, these points come across when these lines are mentioned the first time, even twice. But then stage three appeared, when my view returned to hating the film. The repetition becomes tedious and boring as it's repeated the fifth time. The dangers of living a lifestyle like this could be shown in 5 minutes instead of stretching it to fit a feature length film. There isn't enough deeper meaning to consider this a great, or even good film. I believe that it really is what it seems to be on the surface. A sensory overload of a film that tries to be as edgy as possible for the sake of it, without any intentions by the director at a deeper meaning, and with the real intention being he wanted to make an over the top party film that also featured some gangsters and shooting. To reference a highly reputable source in the form of a Reddit AMA, the director himself said the film was a pop poem. Nothing more. Nothing less. It was like a 93 minute music video. A film about the way some kids live. Ridiculously, stupidly and unbelievably. Franco's one or two decent scenes and the cinematography making everything looking extremely neon and bright, fitting the party feel of the film does bring up the rating slightly, giving the final score a 3/10.",Spring Breakers

389,cinemafilm,Another fascinating outing for Harmony Korine,9,31 March 2013,"***Spoilers Follow—Consider watching the movie before reading.Holy wow! I loved Spring Breakers. What a stylish, colorful, funny, scary, crazy, strange, and thought provoking creation from the guy who brought us Gummo and Trash Humpers. If you go in expecting some kind of spring break comedy, you will be sorely disappointed though. This is art film territory with a narrative style director Harmony Korine dubbed ""liquid."" It flows anywhere and everywhere it can at any and every moment. And the performances are amazing. The four girls are so spontaneous and fun to watch—of course it doesn't hurt that they are gorgeous and in bikinis almost the entire movie—and James Franco is wicked cool as a gangsta rapper, drug dealer, creature of the Id raised from the depths. Oh, and it also makes great use of two songs by Britney Spears.I always know that a movie has worked and is something interesting and exciting and maybe even innovative when I come out of watching it saying things like ""it was such a weird and strange and almost random experiment in 'liquid' narrative with everything flowing wherever it can"" but after thinking about it for a day clearly seeing how well- realized a work of psychology/mythology it was. This is how a modern screenwriter/director should make use of mythological storytelling. Another movie that had the same effect on me was the, I think brilliant, I'm Still Here.One of the true insights I gleaned from this movie is how the hero undergoing the journey can be split out into multiple characters each being a different aspect of the psyche—four characters in this case. That only three of them are present at the robbery and only two of them make it all the way to the end with the other two hopping on the bus at different stages speaks volumes.I wouldn't say the girls pay the price for being bad. What's startling is how they are left to run wild forever at film's end. When you have four characters so closely bonded together as a group in a story, expect them to function as a composite character, in this case composite hero. The religious girl functions as the hero's Super Ego, morality, rules of society, etc. She isn't part of the robbery and when spring break isn't following the rules of what it should be, she hops aboard a bus. The three remaining are then cut loose from their internal police officer. The girl shot in the arm is the Ego: reason, common sense. She goes along until things get too real, too personal. Nothing makes things about YOU quite like the pain of being shot. She too hops aboard a bus. The hero (two remaining girls) is then pure Id and is free to consummate the relationship with the leader of the Id (Alien). They absorb his energy, through sex in the hot tub. He is the one from that point onward who lacks energy and confidence while the girls become faceless new super-Id creatures. Alien is then expendable and is immediately shot and killed. The girls then effortlessly kill everyone in their way, thank Alien for his energy with a kiss, and disappear into the night and the future as spring breakers forever.Something else just occurred to me. In sci-fi movies from the 1950s to Alien and beyond, the aliens are commonly associated with the Id. So the character name Alien could be alluding to this idea. Also, Trash Humpers, Korine's prior outing is an entire movie where the characters exist purely within the Pleasure Principle and the characters wear masks for the entire movie. The points where the girls put on masks in Spring Breakers are the very same instances where the Id is guiding them.And, of course, nothing is a more iconic expression of pure pursuit of pleasure, at least for the college aged, in our society than spring break in Florida.",Spring Breakers
390,angelinaa-148-559535,Things Go Deep Beneath the Boobs,8,27 November 2013,"(Excuse the rude pun). I'm really glad I gave this movie a chance. It's enormously underrated and there is reason for that. Superficially, this film looks like a useless product catered to sensationalise drugs, sex and boobs. The people who hate this film, have misunderstood it's meaning. I went into this film expecting another teen flick but was pleasantly surprised by it's artistry.This film aims to depict the ridiculous American Teen Dream that is Spring Break. It satirises this very idea, sending an important message to the youth of our generation. It explores notions of escape and change - something every single person can relate to. The repeated dialogue is clever, the characters are complex and the film aims to provoke thought within its viewers.The one thing this movie accomplishes is the use of visual imagery, distortion and an artistic gem. The eclectic visuals, neon colours and interesting soundtrack provide a sensual experience that attacks every sense. Your eyes are pounded by modern dance music, your eyes are outraged by acts of depravity but in the end you understand why.The performance by the various actors are extremely commendable. Franco shines and completely disappears into his creepy yet lovable character which is incredible to watch. The girls each play their part wonderfully and paint the complex and awfully depressed characters that we hope will reach a turning point in their lives.Overall, this film has moments of absurdity, humour, disgust and represents everything that media aims directly at the youth of modern times. I suggest you take this film for what it is and what it tries to achieve. For me, it ticks all the boxes of what film making a message should be. It establishes setting, character and plot.",Spring Breakers

The movie starts with a lot of people partying, a lot of boobs, music, like any teen movie. I thought that was only the beginning and that eventually it would have some sort of a plot but the movie just continues to be stupid, pointless, plot-less and just annoying. I fully understand that the actors/producer tried to show us the life of 4 teen girls going wild on spring break, but this looked more as a porn than a movie. It has no meaning, no theme, like a 16 year old wrote it and made it. Just loud music and boobs. It shouldn't even be shown in cinemas, since it's such a waste of time. No scene leaves you breathless, or surprised or curious what will happen next. It just continues to show a gangsters house, his clothes, and gold teeth and it never ends.

394,attractthemall,All the repetition of dialogue,3,17 April 2013,"I think many people will see this film, as this arty, alternative movie and praise its visuals and soundtrack. I see where you're coming from and completely appreciate different peoples interpretations of what's in front of them. However, rather than get taken in by these ""positives"" I simply saw a lot of negatives.The leads had no depth of character and no appeal what so ever and side characters were thrown in for no reason, did we really need ""the twins""? After 10 mins we get the ""Spring break"" idea, we know it's sun, sea, sex, booze and drugs. We don't need a 50 minute montage of half naked people, beer funnels and lines of powder to get that and we don't need reminding every 5 mins throughout the rest of the film! All the repetition of dialogue and scenes didn't work for me, it just got annoying. I thought Franco was good but even he got annoying through no fault of his own, but i will say the Britney Spears scene with Franco at the piano, i loved. If only Harmony used each shot once and never repeated a line of dialogue the film would be half as long and Harmony Korine would have been screwed, Like we was watching it.",Spring Breakers

The cinematography itself in Spring Breakers makes it worth to watch, the way neon colors and sunlight are used to light scenes is just amazing. It felt like Harmony Korine (or his Cinematographer) had just mastered how to light scenes exactly the way they wanted. This visual element adds a lot to the feel and themes of the film as well, it's like spring break is this magical wonderland where everything plays out like some college kid's fantasy. But as soon as someone leaves this dream world all the colors and lights of life return to normal. I was also impressed by the performances of Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson. It has a few problems like its fairly ridiculous ending, which somehow works in the context of the film, and certain scenes seemed pointless or excessive but overall I found Spring Breakers to be a great movie.",Spring Breakers

I suppose it was entertaining enough for me to keep watching but that could have just been the TnA. It may only be my opinion but James Franco's acting abilities are leagues beyond this film, which leads me to assume he only did it to have a little fun with the role. If you've got some time to kill, and there is absolutely nothing else to watch, then sure check this movie out. But if your looking for a movie with substance, reason, or a strong storyline, I would skip this one.

I felt like the film was what it was supposed to be, it was a visual experience, bright colours and loud music. The movie really did feel like a trip to me. I felt the movie was very real, yet it was fantasy at the same time. It took characters you might know, people you can relate to, and stuck them in this world of florescent lights and extravagant beach houses. If you want to see a deeper meaning of the movie, it is there, but I feel that you kinda have to find it on your own.

Everything from the acting to the dark shadowy scenes to the dialogue are poorly done and even painful to sit through. The opening scene was bright and exciting and gave the rest of the movie a little hope seeing as most people who go to a movie named ""Spring Breakers"" are expecting spring break. After that the movie takes a dark turn into this film noir looking scenes where we see these corrupt girls smoke pot, make sex jokes and eventually rob a store (with squirt guns). The voice overs are painful to listen to as they repeat over and over and then over again. Once they get to their destination they get into trouble and it turns out that this spring break isn't exactly what they bargained for. The girls turn rogue and join a hipped up James Franco in an all out gangster drug lord war where everyone snorts cocaine and carries a gun.

Making the trailer for this a quick, flashy video of girls in bikinis with Skrillex dubbed over it was a huge mistake. Not because the film would have been better if that was the kind of movie it was but because I think a lot of people were put off by the fact that they went in expecting a shallow, easy-to-watch action drama and ended up seeing the real movie Spring Breakers turned out to be.I didn't like this movie. The complete lack of any character development alone pretty much ruined any chance it may have had but if that wasn't enough the film relies way too much on the cinematography to keep us engaged. There were some absolutely gorgeous shots and tones used and it'll remain one of my favourites in terms of camera work, but cinematography, dialogue and setting should all compliment each other. One shouldn't stand out more than the others and that's where I think this film went wrong. They didn't use everything together to even out the aspects of the movie, they found what their strong point was, painted it fluorescent yellow and stuck it on a flagpole while the rest lay on the ground.Despite all of its flaws, it is still worth watching and I would recommend anybody interested in film photography to take some notes from Benoît Debie's work here.",Spring Breakers

It hits a lot of different emotions, and makes you laugh. I grew up in Daytona Beach, Florida, and to be quite honest, the portrayed characters are very relatable to the ideas put forth. I appreciate a director that doesn't mind being overly dramatic in the character development and entertainment factor.

The plot for is everywhere, first it is kinda about Selena Gomez then about James Franco. The music could have been better, but it is a new generation of kids who might relate to this or feel that this is what they want.

405,cpolito-617-409504,A Poetic Party of a Film,9,28 June 2013,"I enjoyed this film so much that when I think about it, I get chills. Although it is slightly comparable to Harmony Korine's first film ""Kids"", it is extremely different in style and pacing. This looks on paper like a ""Project X"" meets ""Pulp Fiction"" (and in some ways, it truly is), but it is really poetic. I loved all the dialogue delivered by the young actresses and even some that's delivered by James Franco's Riff-Raff-esque. James Franco performance is good, but simply because it's different and just goes to show how versatile he is. Selena Gomez plays herself if she were in this situation, leaving after about thirty to forty minutes into the film. Vanessa Hudgens is surprisingly good, giving us hope for a strong acting career ahead of her. Ashley Benson delivers the performance with just slight hints of her popular ""Pretty Little Liars"" character Hannah, but mostly is an original character. The strongest performance of the film comes from the director's wife, Rachel Korine, who holds nothing back and looks intriguing and fitting of the film while doing so. She obviously didn't just get the job because she's his wife. Harmony's direction is fantastical with bright neon colors every which way and a perfect mixture of fast and slow camera movement. His writing, however, is what makes this film what it is. The poetic dialogue in a film of guns, parties, drugs and sex at first feels out of place, but in the end, is just what the film needed. This film will leave you obsessed. I can't guarantee in a good way, but I do guarantee obsession.",Spring Breakers

407,lizithekitty,"""Natural Born Killers"" wannabe",1,22 March 2013,"Spring Breakers tries so hard to be like Natural Born Killers. It tries the hyper-violent fantastical approach. It tries the over-the-top approach. It tries the fever-dream visuals. It tries to have characters worth caring about but it fails in so many ways.Harmoney Korine is as much of a hack as Darron Arnofsky whose films have a small, but strong cult status. The script is so childish that it seems like a 13-year old wrote it. There is nothing smart or witty about it. There is no plausibility to the characters motivations or redemption.The acting is horrible. Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgins are atrocious. There is a reason they have not done any major Hollywood films since being Disney stars. Most Disney stars are not cut out for true acting, and it rings true here. James Franco... god what happened to him? It seems ever since he gained major popularity in the Spider-Man trilogy he has been phoning in his performances. His character is a cheap ripoff of Gary Oldman's jaw dropping Drexel in True Romance and what's sad is, Drexel isn't a pretender.The visual style of the film is numbing. It tries to go the route of Natural Born Killers but fails. Oliver Stone's film was smart as it was a satire on media sensationalizing violence, whereas this film tries to glorify it with neon bikinis and black lights. A theme in NBK that was smartly used was the green lighting. Oliver Stone said the green lights signify the sickness that lives within Mickey and Mallory. What does the neon and black-lights in Spring Breakers represent? Nothing.This movie is a major reason why Hollywoodnis considered a joke.",Spring Breakers
408,Danieljheffnerproduction,Peculiar duality -- realism vs hyper-realism,7,6 September 2013,"Spring Breakers was hard to stomach (at first) because I had incredibly high expectations after seeing the trailer. Myself now apart of the new generation of independent filmmakers, I'm hugely influenced by the dogma-era, and many other geniuses of the good ol' cine-days. Don't get me wrong, harmony still totally rocks this picture. But -- you have to give it a chance. My review would be a soaring 8 or 9, if it weren't for the cut itself. I just can't stand this:Story and plot are far too often regurgitated excruciatingly too many times. As is the dialogue: 'Spring break for life bit*C8es)' or at the beginning, they continuously whine about their boring lives. We get it. We're insecure. We're indecisive, naive, foolish. We should be humiliated for our actions. Certain things could've been dialed back, and it would've been a solid piece, in the bag. Sorry Harmony --- :/ The beginning is reminiscent of my college years, my tripped out, grungy, naive, displaced self, starving for adventure, ...and well, sex and money. :) Accurately depicted, again overdone at times, but for what Harmony's motives were, (everything) in this film hits his goals head on. Visually, Spring Breakers delivers -- unique party gels and vibrant post color litters and pollutes (its a good thing, I swear) the displaced coke infested mindless trashy teens as they travel throughout the story in all of its blacklights, flourescents, and sodium vapor lights :) The lighting / color work was just awesome. Camera work as well compliments the trippy, grungy, hyper-real personality of the film. thank you for always being so visually true to your story Harmony. In closing, I almost took the girlfriend out, but thought --- well, it's a Korinne flick, I should probably play it safe. (which i'm soooooo glad I did) There's more boobs, sex, coke, and spraying bullets, than ... well, any other movie I've seen this year.

409,grounden1985,"A sometimes thrilling, very hypnotic, poignant piece of filmmaking.",10,28 March 2013,"I can't describe the elation I felt leaving Spring Breakers--truly one of the best films to hit mainstream cinemas in a long time. It was a breath of fresh air amidst all the cookie cutter romantic comedies, dramas, action films, and horror movies that plague modern cinema. The stamp of a good film is the impact factor--how long it stays with you when it's over. Spring Breakers was a film that stayed with me long after leaving the theater. It didn't evaporate from my mind as soon as I hit the parking lot. This film affects you and leaves you in a mood long after the credits appear.Those seeking a fun ""party film"" will be disappointed. The TV ads, poster, and cast have probably misled some viewers into thinking this is a cross between The Hangover and Project X. Don't let the cast or the marketing fool you--this is not a ""feel good"" movie. It's a dark, exciting, tragic look at modern youth culture that doesn't so much as revel in the pop culture sensory overload as hold up a mirror to the audience so we can see some of ourselves in these kids. And if you're like me, you'll find this kind of self-reflection very disturbing. More than once, I was disgusted and enthralled with these characters, not knowing whether I should feel amused, angry, or sad. This is truly the best deconstruction of modern culture I've seen.The movie starts with our main quartet of female characters struggling to find a way around the fact they don't have enough money to travel to Florida for that much-hyped, almost mythical annual rite of passage nearly every college kid in the country has to face at some point: spring break. Selena Gomez is easily the most likable member of the cast--a young girl struggling to balance her Christian faith and values in the moral wasteland that is college life. One moment we see her praying in church, and the next she's passively condoning the fact that her friends have just robbed a restaurant in order to obtain the rest of the money they need to make it to Florida. In one poignant monologue, she speaks of the monotony of life and how everyone is depressed because they wake up and see the same things every day. Her desire to go on spring break is almost spiritual in nature--a soul-searching journey in which she just wants to be someone new and be free.The spring break party scenes are manic--loud music, hypnotic imagery, and disorienting colors all come together like some kind of dream. The fun soon ends once the girls are arrested for using narcotics at a wild party. They have two options: pay a fine, or remain in jail for another two days. Out of money and unwilling to call their parents, the girls languish in jail until a mysterious visitor posts their bail. Enter James Franco as Alien, a white gangster with gold teeth, dreadlocks, and a ton of money and guns to go along with his criminal tendencies. Franco truly breaks out in this performance, becoming someone I never could have imagined he'd be able to pull off back in his Spider-Man days. His intentions are murky and the film never misses an opportunity to make us feel uncomfortable witnessing his interactions with the girls. It's at this point that the film takes a drastic turn into even darker territory, the trip slowly proving itself to be more than a few of them bargained for. Thus begins the tragic slide into the dark nature of these characters, as they find themselves participating in and doing things bound to seduce the audience into an awe-struck state more than once.Not that any of this is told through a conventional narrative. The whole film feels like one crazy, hypnotic dream, from its use of colors to its loud, insane score that ranges from romping party fun to atmospheric, moody pieces that underline the darker moments in the film. The narrative jumps around in time and space, pasted together through flashbacks, flash forwards, and repetitive lines that linger in the back of the viewer's mind like a broken record. The cinematography is flat out excellent and the filmmakers make perfect use of the beautiful Florida scenery amidst all the sheer depravity we witness on screen, with more than a few shots of the beautiful Florida sky and sunset to remind us of our humanity.By the time the film reaches a delirious montage of violence set to the unlikely tune of Britney Spears' song Every time, Korine has us hook, line, and sinker feeling a sense of revulsion and pity for ourselves and the world at large. Any film that can provoke this type of uncomfortable self-contemplation deserves to be praised.In the end, I left the theater feeling like I'd just come off an intense acid trip into the darker recesses of modern culture, emotionally exhausted and ready to get in my car and drive home in silence, reflecting on what I'd just seen.If you're not expecting to have fun and aren't afraid to look inside yourself to that aspect of your personality that craves materialism and vapid entertainment at the expense of losing some of your humanity, go and see Spring Breakers. It's truly one of the best films of 2013 (so far) and will no doubt be a cult classic in years to come. Just don't blame me if the film haunts you long after it's over.",Spring Breakers

And you just sit there in your little train car for like, 2 hours...in trash and filth. Then the ride pulls out of the trash pile and you have to get out with that stench stuck to your body. So you go home and you try to wash all that stank off, but it lingers... After a few days you're able to force yourself to forget about that ride, and where it took you. You move on with your life. But forever, any time you see or hear about that ride, a fire is lit inside of you, and you break down and ask god, ""WHY ME!?""..

411,lennycl,Shocking - Violent - Beautiful,8,27 March 2013,"This film was visually breathtaking. The story tells us of four young naïve college girls chasing the American Dream: freedom. Spring Break is approaching, and they are short of money for a trip down south. Korine takes an otherwise dull, predictable, and traditional topic, and makes it anything but.There is the enormously excessive nudity, drinking, and raving- which is all sort of to be expected in a way. Korine gets it out of the way fast, assembling the pieces together like a puzzle, to let you decide if it is beautiful or not.The setting of this film is brilliant. Florida is initially presented to us as a dreamy, bright, gaudy, tropical, neon-tinted and lively world of its own. Florida represents a dream for the four girls, where they can do anything and everything; it is their immunity. Korine glides you through fast days and faster nights on the gulf coast of St. Petersburg - all until some trouble is to be had. In the end, the remaining girls are left devastated, alone, changed. What they had sought after was everything they experienced. They had to become different people. It is only as the girls turn back from Florida to their old lives that they realize what horrendous people they had become.",Spring Breakers
412,gabiieex33,It wasn't OMG but it wasn't as terrible as the haunted house,5,31 March 2013,"I wouldn't say this movie is amazing and I wouldn't say it was completely horrible, but what this movie lacked was a plot.Candy, Brit, Faith,Cotty all wanted to have an amazing time for spring break because they are bored in their dorm room and everyone else has left and they want to leave too but they don't have enough money even though they have been saving up. So the 3 main lack for a better word, dirty girls (Selena excluded) went too rob a chicken spot with toy alcohol guns and a hammer. They succeed!!This movie is bad because it doesn't have any plot, they rob a chicken spot and they never get caught, okay maybe that could be true because they had masks on, but when they go to jail for drug possession and Franco bails them out, they all of a sudden act hard together. I can see what Harmony Karine was trying too say with making this movie, because in the beginning, since Selenas character is the good girl, and she goes to a religious class, the teacher kept saying, you can beat temptation! You can always find your way out of temptation. And with the 4 girls with Franco, Selena didn't want to be there because it was uncomfortable for her etc, so she ended up leaving. She ""beat"" temptation cause she could've had everything with Franco... Cotty eventually beat temptation because she got shot so now she came to ""realization"".. But being left with Candy and Brit, they turn badass and ends up shooting up the place of Francos enemy. Which is RETARDED!! Because they got away with it, AGAIN, and they somehow killed EVERYONE that was there!!! I understand how they caught one or two because it was unexpected but bullets are loud and everyone should've heard. But basically the story stopped there. But whatever happened too the plot???? Brit and candy randomly begin killing everyone and actually kills Franco and yet it doesn't show temptation for them...I will say, Franco was the ONLY ONE who did amazing with his character, he mustve laughed throughout the entire time while trying to play his character but he was the only awesome one, and in general Franco is brilliant.This movie has boobs everywhere and crotch shown through panties, I mean might as well watch project x which is 100000x better than this movie. Wait til netflix",Spring Breakers
413,cjs343,A Fantastic Commentary Above the Understanding of Many,10,19 August 2013,"This film is not a normal movie. It is an acid trip work of art. Korine is truly brilliant, somehow creating a work that is both luscious and devoid. Fantastic acting throughout the lead roles, highlighted by Franco's truly amazing performance as Alien, extends the movie further, and the portrayal of the characters is definitely more important than the actions. The movie not about Spring Break. It isn't about robbery. It is about emotion, change, and the beauty that comes from apathetic destruction. It truly is more of a psychotic documentary than the drama that it is made out to be, and the result is beautiful.However, there is a significant divide in the perception of this film. It caters intentionally to those who see film as an art form, but it is also unintentionally perfect for the inevitably simple masses who just want to see hot women and violence. The problem is the middle: people who are somewhat informed, who aren't controlled by their baser instincts, but also aren't as experienced in critiquing or understanding movies or art. Those people will inevitably hate this movie, seeing it as just another wasted, trashy, teenage movie, instead of noticing the painful beauty that echoes throughout.This movie is one of the finest films produced in the last decade.",Spring Breakers
414,umariqbal1994,Still deciding if I liked it or not...,6,1 May 2013,"Oh my...this film needed to be reviewed. It has literally been weeks since I saw it with my sister (awkward) and I still have not come to a conclusion of if I liked it or not.I have never (and would never) want to watch a previous Harmony Korine film because of the creepy and uncomfortable movie plots! (Trash Humpers trailer gave me nightmares) and to be truly honest this filmed did appeal to me because of the controversy of Disney Princesses gone bad and that the cast was actually interesting! I read so many reviews before I watched this because it was seen as shocking but also a social commentary on society. First of all, this film should not be watched if your aim (like myself) was to see your fave star do bad things because it will scar you in never seeing them in the same way. The acting was a bit cheesy from Ashley & Vanessa who I thought were the worst ones in the movie. I'm not even gonna bother with Rachel Korine because she's a dry, not interesting character. I really liked Selena Gomez in this! Probably because I felt her worries when she wants to go home! Her acting was most convincing and I'm glad she stayed clean throughout! James Franco is the biggest chameleon ever! This guy can play anything he wants! He was brilliant In this that I forgot that was him as Alien! His character did creep me out though!I'm very into visuals and experimenting with camera angles and lights etc... Which is one reason I liked this film! They did false advertise making it look like a fun and reckless comedy in the trailer, but it's a dark indie drama so don't go for pop and sugar! One thing I absolutely loved was the scoring and soundtrack by Skrillex & Clint Mansell! If this soundtrack was not in the movie I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much! The beats and sounds were just on point, making you feel like you're in a drug filled hypnotic party! I definitely understand why people would call this film on a similar level to porn, simply because of the un-needed amount of nudity. They'd show breasts a few times, then they'd repeat the same clip about 10 times more for no reason. The repetitive words and lines was odd, but it was meant to be like that I guess. The story with Gucci Mane was just put in there for no reason...and *SPOILER* the part where Alien is shot is so anti-climactic and a dud comparing to the build up of exciting and tense scene. Somebody please tell me how those two teenage girls in bikinis and ski- masks did not get shot once by huge gangsters? The sex scenes were not needed as well, to be honest. I did love the use of neon colours because it created a candy colour drug style visual! I'm still deciding after I write this review If I liked it or not...I do believe it'll be a cult classic but if we take the sex and nudity out, what's left but violence and a thin plot line (which was interesting but thin). The 'Britney Spears - Every time' montage had to be one of the greatest cinematic montages in a long long time! You can say this movie is a dig at pop culture and today's society, but surely teens of my generation aren't that messed up? Whatever it may be, sexploitation? Soft-porn? Gangsta- Disney girls? It's so intriguing that you'll have some sort of temptation to see this movie...I guess you truly have to make the decision when you see it. But I'm so confused of how I should feel after seeing that. Also: please don't watch this with your parents or siblings, I did with my sister and it was truly awkward but check it out and decide! SPRING BREAK FOREVER...(repeats 1000 times!!!! Lol)!",Spring Breakers

This movie his a bigger underlying message its easy to say this movie sucked unless you really get what its about. 99% of these reviews are biased. ""Disney stars in a movie all girl cast how lame"". Watch the movie decide for yourself. I really liked it and I myself personally don't like teeny boper movies.

416,chinoytan,Unlimited Ammo,6,3 July 2013,"My review contains some spoilers, so please don't continue reading if you have not watched this movie yet. Let me start by telling you that I am from a third world country so I don't get the hype of Spring breaks in America. The only school break I have known through out my student years is summer break.The movie for me is like a deep dark gelatin sprinkled with a touch of rainbow candy sprinklers experimented by a strange director. James Franco was good though in portraying his character and in delivering his lines with a unique gangster style. I have qualms with the way the story is being told, you have to give the movie your utmost attention in order to understand what is going on. I give this movie a 6 out of 10. A point deducted for the way Vanessa Hudgens portrayed his role, I think it was kinda weird watching her especially when she delivered her lines. Another point for the way James Franco died in this movie. I mean your a Gangster with a lot of weapons and ammunition, and you only brought a Glock customized semi-automatic Uzi without reload to an enemy guarded mansion? Not to mention that he did not kill any enemy goons nor fired a single shot. Another point is deducted for the unrealistic siege of Archie's Mansion. Archie's henchmen must be all blind for not being able to hit the girls in point blank range. The last point is deducted for the unlimited ammo of the Uzi Brit and Candy is using. I mean the automatic weapon spurts at least 3 to 5 bullets per second and the magazine can hold about 25 to 30 shots but they manage to kill all the goons including Archie with that very same weapon without reloading.",Spring Breakers
417,crack_biggums,"If you like to laugh at serious movies, watch this.",4,31 July 2013,"I love Harmony Korine's work and I thought going in this movie was going to be strange, slow, and messed up. However, it wasn't, instead it was just slow. It was too high budget and mainstream and not what I was expecting from Harmony Korine. On paper it should have been genius. James Franco takes some crazy hot girls who performed an armed robbery just so they could go to spring break, AND Gucci Mane is the bad guy. But instead it repeats dialogue throughout to the point where it goes from annoying to just plain funny. This movie can essentially be summed up as follows. ""I wanna go home,"" ""Spring break, spring break forever,"" ""It feels like a dream."" ESPECIALLY James Franco whispering ""spring break, spring break forever"" which is repeated at least 15-20 times throughout during various scene transitions and sometimes repeated 3 times in a row. The entire first 40 minutes could have been totally cut out, I would have thought it cooler if it just opened with them robbing the diner and going to spring break. I think it missed the mark it was going for trying to show the dark side of youth (as with most Harmony Korine movies) and it ends up being a bunch of close-up shots of boobs, butts and straight up vagina while everyone seems to be having a great time except whiny little Selena Gomez and then her gold digging friends ditch her to hangout with the equally annoying James Franco as Alien. James Franco dies so quickly and in such a lame unexpected way after he's all pumped up for revenge it kind of spoke to the necessity of his character in general. And then the 2 girls are all of a sudden expert marksmen and kill 20 dudes without missing or having to reload. Then they drive back home probably to go back to their boring college lives. I would say that I hated this movie but because of the excellent cinematography work and the fact that I laughed hard at the repetitive dialogue and pointless structure I would still recommend it to people just so I can talk to them about it and they would get it when i creepily whisper ""spriiing breeeaaak, spriiinnngg breeeakk foreeeevveerrr.""",Spring Breakers

The acting was terrible and all you see is boobs and naked butt. There is no plot and no reason to watch it. If you want to waste time you could do it doing anything but watching this stupid movie. I thought that since this movie had a lot of well known actors like James Franco, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, and Vanessa Hudgens that it would have some sort of quality but I was wrong. After completing this movie I sat in silence for 10 minutes wondering that it was that I just watched. It just kept dragging and dragging for no reason. There is no way to write a summary to this movie because the movie has no substance.

Can i say that it was one of the WORST movies i have ever seen. People were walking out of the cinemas. It was like watching an hour of porn. There was no story line, and it was stupid and unrealistic. I don't understand how characters such as James can go so low. I was so shocked and disappointed. Do NOT watch this movie. TRUST ME!The movies opening scene was naked girls, and boobs everywhere. It was disgusting. The camera was zooming into girls bodies and it was disturbing. I gave this movie patience. I kept saying something good was going to happen and NOTHING happened. It was so pointless! I don't understand how people are rating this movie 10/10 or even 5/10 that's how bad it is. Shame on society if they like this movie!

422,heyturk5,Just a prolonged music video,4,21 July 2013,"An underrated modern classic, or a massively overrated and prolonged music video? And not a good one like that of Smooth Criminal. Think of how irritating a collaboration between these 'musicians' would be: Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Taylor Swift, Justin Beiber and oh I don't know, One Direction. They aren't meant to represent characters in the film, I just can't think of a more rage-inducing collection of chart toppers right now. There is very little in the way of plot throughout. A group of very irritating (although very hot) college girls decide they are bored with having no money, doing drugs and partying on campus. Two activities that are quite hard to do without money, but not a lot of the film makes sense so just go with it. So anyway, they walk around in their underwear for a while, hang out in a hallway doing gymnastics and then, very logically... it dawns on them that to escape this boring life they must rob a local diner and go to Florida for Spring Break. Genius! So they do just that, if you miss the robbery scene don't worry, as they will re- enact their heist throughout the film in various locations and with little provocation (more on the annoying repetitive editing later). Most of what ensues is equally nonsensical, apart from the theme of sex and alcohol. Having been to university myself, I can loosely identify with the sort of culture that the characters are meant to be a part of. One girl goes home because she feels 'uncomfortable', but the remaining three stay in Florida and naturally become murderous, heavily armed robbers with the help of possibly THE MOST irritating character ever created in film history: Alien, the part time rapper, part time gangster. They somehow fall in love with him and become embroiled in a beef he has with his ex-best friend. One of the girls gets shot in the arm and decides to go home. So the last two gear up with glocks and neon bikinis and storm a drug lord's home, killing he and his entire entourage with one clip each and without taking a single scratch. Utterly absurd. Believe it or not that is the basic premise of Spring Breakers, let's talk about the editing and style of the film. The soundtrack is actually quite good and being a red blooded male, I enjoyed the slow motion shots of scantily clad teenagers jumping up and down on the beach. The colours are vibrant and overall it was shot well in my opinion with the exception of the repetition of some lines. I didn't understand these because they were repeated with different inflections and tones, at different speeds. Towards the end of the film there was a particular scene wherein one of the girls calls Alien a scaredy cat or something similar. It must have repeated at least six times, it just didn't make any sense! I gave this four stars for the music and scenery. This very much appears to be a style over substance film, it could have been made about half an hour shorter if it wasn't padded out with slow motion shots and the bizarre repetition of certain dialogue. Or maybe style over substance was the point, in which case it accurately reflects just how misguided the younger generations must be, living in an MTV culture with cretins like Minaj etc. being considered roles models, and how empty the pursuit of such a lifestyle really is Watch it, decide for yourself.",Spring Breakers

I would go as far as to say that half way through i assumed the only ending that was possible to make any sense out of this garbage was for everyone to die.Also the fact that a good 5 lines of script are repeated a good 10 times each for absolutely no reason was astonishing.

424,greenwaveforever,"Stylish, Cool, Fun Movie",8,28 November 2013,"Spring Breakers was an overall cool movie. It wasn't as dark as I remember ""Kids"" being, but I was only 15 when ""Kids"" came out and it blew my young mind. Spring Breakers is hot chicks in bikinis doing drugs and partying with hood James Franco. It should have been about 30 minutes longer so they could have more stuff and it wasn't as crazy and shocking as I expected. In fact, I was disappointed with how little nudity we got from the 4 main girls. However, James Franco's character is awesome. Gucci Mane character is awesome. Gomez, Hudgens, Benson, Korine are all awesome. I love how ""goody goody"" Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens are adults now and are giving the bird to the ""you should act lame because my daughter looks up to you and I don't feel like parenting"" people by starring in this film.Overall, Spring Breakers movie sums American values: Hot girls, easy money, drugs, guns, sex, violence, and partying. The plot wasn't weak.The reviewers that complain the plot was weak either didn't understand the movie or are just hating because their boyfriend/husband paid more attention to the movie than them. The reviewers who say it was too violent or sexual were stupid to go see it. Did you not watch the trailer, you idiot? It's the guy who did ""Kids"", what did you think it was going to be like? Complaining about Spring Breakers' nudity is the equivalent of writing a bad review on Schindler's List because it didn't have enough funny parts or the jokes were stale.If you like cool movies, hot girls, gratuitous drug use and violence, then you will like Spring Breakers.

Same goes for the scene where the four main female characters jump on top of each other in a random hallway (seemingly due to drugs, although the specific reason for the this mundane display of pseudo-lesbianism is sadly left ambiguous).

James Franco is a good actor (even in this movie) but i wish he choose more carefully he's roles . Shant,Spring Breakers
441,sxisweetlips88,Surprisingly pretty good!,8,11 December 2013,"I remember seeing the preview for this movie multiple timesevery time I saw it I groaned great another stupid party movebut then I came across it on Amazon Prime and I looked at some of the reviewsand I decided to watch it. Many reviews stated this was the ""WORST. MOVIE. EVER."" but I saw a few reviews explaining that it is intended to be a satire..long story short I decided to check it out. I wasn't disappointed. If I had been expecting this movie to be a fun teen movie about spring break with some drama/suspense mixed in (which sounds like an awful movie IMO, and the vibe I got from the preview), I probably would have been humiliated after watching this movie. This movie LAUGHS AT that kind of media, and those kinds of people. How many people watched this movie because that's what they thought it was? I can see why it has so many negative reviews now. Watching the party scenes in the beginning I was blushinghave I looked and acted that ridiculous in the past while having a ""great"" time? James Francoamazing. The girls were not great (but definitely not bad), but the fact that they have Disney acting backgrounds makes me believe they were picked for a reason beyond their acting abilitiesand if so, I can respect the message (What's Hannah Montana up to nowadays, anyways?). Also, the visual effects on the film were gorgeous. I love that the girls wear sweatpants with ""DTF"" in huge letters on the butt-- what else is being said when you wear sweatpants with writing on the butt anyways? To all those that say this movie objectifies women--this movie is pointing out that women/girls today are objectifying THEMSELVES by acting the way they do in today's culture. This was my first Harmony Korine movie. It definitely won't be my last. 8/10.",Spring Breakers

443,deluxe-super,Very fascinating.,10,30 June 2013,"One of the most exciting films I ever saw. From the moment Skrillex kicked in while kids partying hard on the beach it had me in its grip. Strange, beautiful, dreamlike, disturbing, lethargic and even disgusting, it's all of that. And if you are put off by that, you are not really watching because that is exactly the reason why this is a masterpiece.It may look sloppy but not because the director didn't know how to make a movie, on the contrary. Look at those girls playing around and standing on their heads in the hallway. One of the images that is haunting me since I saw it. Strange and beautiful film making of the highest order. And this movie has a lot of those moments.But what does it all mean? Well, I don't know if I understand it all myself. I only know if you are not willing to contemplate and philosophize this movie its wasted on you. This movie doesn't give away an easy, clear message. Not that its difficult, its just not a movie where you only sit back and relax. Reading all the super negative reviews here I think that is the problem with this movie, it requires something from the viewer in order to be appreciated. Funny thing is that it is one of the messages of this movie. The compulsive effortless enjoyment people demand. Every obstacle encountered in that quest will make people irritated or even violent.

There's no introduction or conclusion and even when you think its about to climax, it keeps going. It uses sexual imagery to keep the viewers engaged in what's happening, while forgetting what it means. There are moments where the viewer may break from the trance the movie bestows, at which point he'll start to question the ridiculousness of what's being shown on screen. Despite this, the movie never takes a break to let you take in what's happening, so it's best to just sit back and let the movie take you for a ride.The movie is a taboo sexual fantasy that keeps teasing you.

To make it even worse the movie tries to depict 'flash backs' throughout, but in reality they are just chopped up repeats from earlier the film that had no meaning or place in the earlier or latter part of the movie.I honestly cannot think of anything positive to say about this movie, seeing a few women in bikini was probably the most entertaining which really shows how bad this film really is!I have no idea where all or any of the higher end reviews have come from, but don't waste your time watching this.",Spring Breakers

448,ctopalis,"Unexpectedly informative, surreal look into American teenage lifestyle",7,3 September 2013,"Spring Breakers is, you not-so-wrongly believe, one of those movies you cannot help but find out about from viral marketing, targeting the mainstream teenage population of the world with the use of renowned, young teenage-idols who are willing to do just about anything to be regarded as adult stars.And truthfully that's what the original intention was. The end result though is a thought provoking film displaying the damage that the pop culture has done to teenagers' perspective of ideal lifestyle in the ""carpe diem"" sense. The director with his overuse of repetitive play of scenes and quotes, a sense of melancholy mixed in even the most happy of sequences along with a soundtrack not suited in a brainlessly entertaining movie, manages to, unintentionally, create a surreal social drama. The excessive display of drugs, sex and violence renders obvious that you shouldn't sympathize with the stars' doings, but instead judge them. It's more of a, what you see in movies only happens in movies, type of message. A reality check for the 2000's MTV, Disney generation of kids turning to wild, abusive, you-only-live-once teenagers.

449,AcidPolice,Don't Expect,9,3 April 2013,"People go into a movie with expectations. When those aren't met, they feel disappointed and decide to dislike the experience they just had. This is the case with most, if not all, of Harmony Korine's films. He's not making films to please audiences, he's offering an experience and making statements in profound ways. Spring Breakers is a dreamlike film with a loose narrative. It exists in a slightly warped reality. You cannot expect this movie to play like an episode of Law & Order. It is a visual and aural poem to be taken in like a painting. That said, the film is still very relevant to attitudes expressed and held in today's youth culture. How many times have you heard ""YOLO"" in the past year? This is showing the dark realities of the YOLO culture in dazzling day-glo. All of the sex appeal and glamour, all of the violence and emptiness. In interviews, Harmony Korine keeps referring to Spring Breakers as a ""pop poem."" I think what he's showing us with this film is every aspect of American pop culture at the same time. Most people are not prepared to be faced with how funny, sad, disturbing, violent, and just plain ridiculous these pop ideals can be when presented in such a confrontational and naked way. If you are able to put aside your expectations and let this film wash over you, you will be rewarded with a powerful experience from a beautifully crafted piece of ""poetry in motion.""",Spring Breakers

People reviewing this movie appear to confuse art with illogical stupidity. This is how the movie breaks down: 4 brain dead girls from college steal their professors car to rob a diner with a plastic gun and mini sledge hammer, then set the car on fire and go to Florida, scot-free. They spend brief moments enjoying spring break before going to a party with gang members, dead hookers, snorting coke, and other stuff that you shouldn't do. Well they get arrested, and get depressed in the cell whining that they didn't do anything wrong. Despite the past 20 minutes you saw. Some brace faced gang member junkie, who believes he is a rapper,bails them out. One leaves because she doesn't like this guy. The other 3 stay, have james franco suck there dick guns, and then they all start robbing people. these girls magically are good at this,despite their lack of skills to hold a gun correctly. By that I mean holding the gun by the barrel and butt to do ring around the rosy. One girl gets shot, and takes a shower for 3 minutes before taking a bus home, not to a hospital. The other two, plus james franco, go to the gang members house to get revenge. james franco gets shot almost instantly. The girls kill every person on the property, without any error for some reason, they do not even have to point the gun in the right direction. After killing everyone, they steal a Ferrari and drive home. The End.",Spring Breakers

Selena leaves the movie after the MTV video gone bad first hour and is never seen again. I think she might have 6 or 7 lines total, I didn't keep count but it wasn't much. They tried to make the first half artsy and cool, but failed miserably. Overall if it weren't for the ridiculous amounts of nudity and Selena ""drinking"" and taking a ""hit"" from a bong, this would be an epic fail.

The previous Korine movies is just great. Kids, Bully and others are just provocative and disturbing. In this movie i thing there is not any new stuff that we were not see in his previous movies. Soundtrack from Skrilexx is great and it describes atmosphere from wild teens in spring break.

453,Graeme_Higginson,A gloomy piece of typical Korine verve,10,15 April 2013,"When I sat down after travelling back across the city, a friend put it best: ""There is no other film that will bring out film majors and general audiences in equal proportions on any given opening weekend."" He was right, and somehow it was Harmony Korine who had done it. Zeitgeist, name actors, and the chronic daring of anyone Werner Herzog would claim as a ""soldier of cinema"" were what likely made for the winning juice.Or the failing juice, wherein the duped mass-market filmgoers were concerned. As another friend wrote, ""If you never listen to any other advice in your life but this, it's worth it: Do not see Spring Breakers. Ever."" Although a following chorus of ""y'alls"" and ""spring break forevers"" left her seeming a little disingenuous, as with most films there will be disappointed people who presupposed what it was they were buying.Hedonistic Florida, popular young actresses stripped naked or thereabouts in the company of others perpetually so, James Franco as a freak gangsta touting every bell and whistle, primitive violence, and a dub-step soundtrack are what is collectively up for sale. On those terms, a general audience is set to conclude.Film majors have a bigger dish. Spring Breakers being the fifth film by Harmony Korine and the latest in photography from Benoît Debie are likely the greatest of its cinephile incentives. Personally, I know that my own twelve dollars left casually.For how it played, the film was simple, although elegantly staged. As expected in anything from Korine, it held a candid crudeness and energy dissimilar to popular cinema in its consciousness and winning punch. How it resolves itself and what it amounts to are questionable, but, with thanks to Debie, there are few moodier experiences involving faces we may have once associated with the straight-edge partaking in the illicit, dirty and lowdown for the ingestion of a camera.Ultimately, Spring Breakers is a film that arrived on a Good Friday with another rebel on a cross for his conviction. It is a sensuous personal film before it is a cold blockbuster, and it decides against being equal portions of both to the consternation and apparent anger of the mass-market — like always with Korine. This would likely account for the many one-out-of-ten ratings from the prestigious community on IMDb.At the end of the day, I'd recommend the standard process of seeing a film for yourself and establishing your own opinion, or purchasing Monte Carlo, a much nicer film about Selena Gomez and her friends in an exotic location.",Spring Breakers

458,cshinebe1401,Spring Break Forever... (Warning May Contain Spoilers),9,28 June 2013,"Spring Breakers is about four girls: Brit (Ashley Benson), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Cotty (Rachel Korine), and Faith (Selena Gomez) who are craving adventure. The movie is basically about the four girls looking for an opportunity to party. The girls are trying to save for a trip to Florida for Spring Break, and through a quick robbery are able to go.The characters are the real shining grace in film. Faith, is played well by Selena Gomez, providing a strong performance as a weak, and identity seeking teenager. Brit, Candy, and Cotty played by Ashley Benson, Vanessa Hudgens, and Rachel Korine respectively, are what drew me to the movie, creating strong characters who are slowly falling from grace. Alien played by James Franco was awesome and I agree with Peter Travers that his acting is what really carries the film. The actresses do their part. but without James Franco the film would have been boring and with out emotion.Overall, the film was excellent the camera work was great and the editing awesome, both aiding in the development of the narrative. The acting as stated was brilliant, especially by James Franco. The plot was great, though it had its moments. The plot was slow in parts, but thanks to the acting the movie does not stall out. The real treat of the plot was its relationship to that of Scarface, were the girls are being corrupted, and slowly brought to the same level as Alien. The film overall Spring Breakers earns a 9 out of 10 from me for its creativity, acting, camera work, and editing; and loses a point for it being long and slow, over relying on the actors and actresses to carry it through.",Spring Breakers

460,jourideblaere,Way worse than anticipated,3,12 August 2013,"So, this is my first review on this site after being a member for 2 years just to warn people about how bad the movie is. Even when you get bad reviews like these i would still say that you need to watch it for yourself since there are clearly people that like the movie and you could be one of them. I for one am not one of them.First off the movie starts out with boobs and buts and some skrillex music. The movie stars bad actresses and Selena Gomez who doesn't fit in the movie at all. It's just an attempt to come off as a bad girl instead of the nickelodeon girl that she got branded. The movie has some nice colors but overall the scenes are just there and completely random. there are just random scenes without any story. THERE IS NO STORY. I read that people say the we (we being people disliking the movie) just don't get the underlying messages, but guess what, why should we? A movie should be judged (in my opinion) on it's entertaining value and the emotions that the movie gives you. This movie was awful and it was painful to watchBad acting - Random scenes - over the top partying and the ending is just plain ridiculous - it's all fake and unreal (which it's supposed to be like according to defenders of this movie). - gun blow job scene - horrendous singing throughout the movie - bad endingJames De Franco put down a legendary scene of lines such as YALL and LOOK AT MY SHIIIEETT which has become famous on the internet.I went into this movie with low expectations and those expectations were not low enough since it was just painful to watch, especially that gun blow job scene which was very painful to watch indeed and the Britney spears singing scene which hurt my ears!",Spring Breakers
461,rhanda,"stinky, sticky, smelly bubble gum wrapped in coke and weed...",7,5 October 2013,"Spring Breakers Review: To sum this movie in a sentence it is stinky, sticky, smelly bubble gum wrapped in coke and weed with a few booze in between. This is not your typical Spring Break movie of girls having fun going mildly wild. These actors and the director/writer Harmony Korine whose wife Rachel Korine plays Cotty in the film. Despite the racy scenes and the dizzying effects of flashbacks, flash-forwards, quick shots and repetition of words it is a movie with a significant message. That repetition of words by James Franco and the other girls each time with a personal monologue. This is a haunting effect that is made so these words will stick in your brain. To never judge someone by his or her actions but by the situations they were put in. Franco's character, Alien comes from poor, drugged and boozed out parents of course he will turn out rebellious in some way. He just spun it in a good way. The modern day Robin hood if you will. Rebel without a cause. The same goes for the girls with their colorful, bubbly outfits that they seem sweet but their poverty and the people they meet made them open their eyes to the possibility of breaking free family traditions and societal norms of college and prayer. This causes people to rethink their lives hopefully it will not cause some teenagers to go too wild. Because I do not want to say this movie was an exploitive one and was just made to sell tickets with hot girls in bikinis. The scenery of this movie is beautiful and that will probably mess with some people's heads by making them seek that. But the movie shows the irony that it is not always sunny in California. For example, Cotty got shot at and goes home. Selena Gomez' aptly named character Faith goes home immediately after going to jail and feeling fishy about Alien bailing them out. She knows there will be something at stake. Her innocence and faith will be lost which somehow probably happens to her friends, Brit played by Ashley Benson and Candy played by Venessa Hudgens. Even their names signify their different personalities. The name Candy is a porn star name right there as opposed to Faith. James Franco does a wonderful job of giving his character some heart with his focus on every word and facial expressions more so than the other actors and that is why he is nominated for best supporting actor for the Oscars no less. Not saying the other actors were not superb they did a stellar job. James just took it an extra mile or two if not more. There were talks of how Franco might have based his character on a rapper called Dangerous. Even with that it takes a lot of guts, passion, practice and hard work to do that role. His behavior among other characters' behavior in the movie shows how friends coax other friends to be like them whether it is just girls or Alien leading the younger girls in his direction. That people will go to any length to seek freedom, fame, love and happiness. This comes from coming broken homes or not feeling satisfied with life back home and just wanting to be away from parents from judgment of God or others that know them. Even with Gucci Mane's character being so malice, selfish, greedy and careless. Gluttony among other sins is seen more than once in the movie even within each character. That is a direct message to American youth and youth in General of what it is to have the All American dream life versus real American life and how these two are constantly fighting off each other to see who will win. Then asking who won depends on whom you ask (at the end). To be with people just like them or even worse that will happily share weed and forget about normal committed relationships or that there is no point but destruction to all this. That rebellion is the answer not calming down and thinking things through before doing anything dramatic such as stealing or murdering among other matters in the movie.",Spring Breakers
462,La_silvers89-62-842129,"Over Hyped, but has Its Place",5,29 March 2013,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. And I will admit, I have an appreciation for the artistic point of view and the satirical references throughout this movie. I am certain that this movie was a satirical jab at the downward spiral one could call the young adult culture forming today. The one that is drug/alcohol and sex fueled. Being a native of Pinellas County, Florida for 24 years, and a recent college graduate of a Florida university, I feel that I have an accurate opinion of the area. For the record, St. Petersburg Beach is nothing like what was portrayed in the movie, which made it extremely more entertaining for my friend and I in the theater. I'm sure that stuff does occur, but don't get the wrong impression of this area from this movie. You want drug and sex fueled adventures try Panama City Beach or Miami- maybe Key West.Anyway, as I said before I wanted to like this movie; however, the exaggerated dialog with a story bare of any real meat made it hard. The cheesy party scenes on the beach were even hard to swallow. Drinking isn't even legal on St. Pete Beach, but for the remainder of the review I will keep facts out, because in all honesty this movie is a complete fantasy.Like other reviewers have said, this is the perfect movie for you if you are looking for an over-dramatic ""Girls Gone Wild."" But if you are searching for a deep movie with a well developed plot and twists, then skip this movie. I wanted more violence, and I thought the threesome scene was weak. If you couldn't tell from the past couple of sentences here, I was going into this movie in search of heavy drug use (some scenes deliver, most lack in this- plenty of alcohol though), and gritty, dirty sex scenes. It's what I was expecting. The murder ""shots"" hardly qualify as such. Little blood, little detail. Few sex scenes. The R rating mostly comes from the excessive exposure of boobs. There wasn't even as much cursing as I was expecting from the previous reviews. I have to assume the people writing reviews about the abundance of sex, drugs, and violence haven't seen movies containing an excess of the above, or I just had way too high of expectations. All in all, I was expecting more, but it turned out as most people would assume. I give it a 5 because I appreciated ""half"" of the movie. I can appreciate where the director was coming from artistically and message wise in the form of camera angels and satire. As far as it being a good movie, I just can't say that it was.",Spring Breakers

466,JovannyD94,Harmony Korine's depiction of the youth is spot on.,7,24 November 2013,"In this movie, Korine's depiction of the world a large majority of the youth is part of is right on the money. Showing us these girls are willing to go to extreme and dangerous measures to get what they want only adds to his depiction of this so called ""party"" world. The movie's portrayal of the wild and spontaneous actions performed by the youth are a bit to bold, however, these actions are key in order to be able to depict this world accurately. With the addition of James Franco's character we see more and more dangerous activity being added to the already existing dangers present in the film making it seem that there has to be some level of violence in order to achieve something. Overall, Korine did a fine job in satirizing how ridiculous the youth is.",Spring Breakers
467,takeyourpillz,Dreadful,1,28 June 2013,"This is possibly the worst film i have ever watched. Did James Franco suffer head trauma of some kind recently because that is the only possible reason i can think of that would make him take part in it. You know a movie is bad when it has this much nudity in it yet it still completely sucks. Where is the plot? It's so totally and completely far fetched its ridiculous. The acting , script and most of all the direction is dreadful. I wouldn't hire that director to shoot a tampon commercial. I had to give this a 1 rating but truth be told i would have given it a zero if i could. How on earth is it sitting at a 6 rating on IMDb? I can only assume the director and cast made thousands of accounts to bump it up. People that gave it higher than a 1 need their head examined thoroughly. It has instantly gone on to my top 10 worst movies ever made and in all honesty i lost a bit of respect for Franco who was previously one of my favourite actors, what was he thinking?!?!",Spring Breakers

Don't listen to what these ""critics"" say or ""super cool hipsters"", they're idiots! I'm still angry over this, and I watched it yesterday! There's tits, OK and that's the only good thing of the whole thing! The movie is 1 hour and 30 min long and 90 percent of this movie is in slow motion! The script must be 15 pages, because it's the same repetitive nonsense in voice over, over and over again! It's editing was as is it was needing to just fill time, and it's all over the place ( hey let just throw random shots and tits ). Literally, literally nothing happens for an hour! And if u hear James Franco did a good job, just ignore them! His character isn't believable, at times u think, eh he's not doing a bad job and then ...then it's garbage. I give the cinematography some props, but then it keeps going and then it's over done and you just want something to happen. I had a head ache watching this! You know those laughable horrible B/C role type movies, where they're so bad you make fun of the movie, well this isn't one of them. There's only been one other movie I felt was near this bad, House of the Dead. The thing is I like the girls in the movie, but it's a trash movie (I have no better/appropriate adjectives, than ""trash/garbage"", for how bad it is). I gave this a 1 on my scale.....oh and....it has Gucci Mane! Worst rapper actor ever! If you want to watch a good sustainable, beautifully shot film with a Story, go watch Stoker.",Spring Breakers
469,atlas210,Artistic Documentation of Contemporary Culture,8,30 July 2013,"Spring Breakers is a pure representation of the banality of the dub-step generation; a misunderstood piece of modern art rejected by the mainstream film goer, and those who would believe any artistic inclination at all is intrinsically pretentious. By adopting the style-as-substance motif the film finds a way to document a generation with no unifying belief or ideal, but as an essence, a series of neon lights reflecting off empty bottles of alcohol and sun soaked skin.And while the structure of the plot may be flawed, it is the visual splendor of the film that cannot be ignored, and that redeems any negating qualities of the piece. And while most film goers will be avoiding any work of Harmony Korine's like the plague, I simply cannot wait for whatever he makes next.",Spring Breakers

I went into the cinema with very high expectations and was still blown away by how powerful and mesmerising it turned out to be. The cinematography and editing was perfect and really accentuated the surreal, trance-like feel. 'Spring Breakers' will no doubt become a huge cult film and will continue to be interpreted in different ways for many years to come. If you get the chance to see this film, definitely do.

It felt like they made the movie too short so they had to make it longer by adding pointless shots. I feel like the movie was 20minutes long so they just shot clips at random and added them in at the final moment. As a person who has seen many movies in my life I have seen my fair share of bad movies.. This, however, takes the cake.. The movie is literally just drug use scenes, half naked barely legal girls, a creepy and dramatic musical number of the stars singing Brittney Spears and James Franco whispering 'spring break forever'. If you say you like this movie then it's just because you fan-girl over Selena Gomez and Vannessa Hudgens.. The way it was shot was not bad but suited more to a indie film style. Not a film with half the cast taken from Disney.. This movie was a flop and if you spend money on seeing this movie i feel sorry for you.It is the worst movie i have ever seen.",Spring Breakers

My expectations going into this was fairly high reading some reviews and watching the trailer. The idea of college students looking for the thrill of spring break and a chance to go wild and party with an added twist of falling in with a drug dealer/white rapper. * BELOW THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!! IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS FILM DO NOT READ!!!*I was VERY!! unprepared for the hour and a half of strung out nothingness I endured. The first half hour sets up the story of four college girls bored in their small town who want adventure and to live the spring break life (3 sluttier 1 good girl) who go to extremes in order to gain money to make it to their goal through armed robbery of a small diner which apparently has quite a lot of money in the till and the 3 wallets they get away with. Long story short the girls get to spring break cue long sequences of heavy drinking and drug use with half naked girls.The girls get arrested and bailed out by the whitest gangsta (James Franco) Alien who talks and talks to the girls about his thug life blah blah blah more long scenes where the lines are repeated and the scenes jump back and fourth.Big surprise the 'good girl' freaks out and goes home... bye bye leaving her three best friends with the very reliable and definitely not creepy Alien who takes the girls under his wing and back to his armory of a home where he explains how much he has.. guns, knives, Calvin Klein... the usual.The highlight if I can call it that is when for some reason Franco decides to serenade the girls on his piano to the sound of Britney spears... cue montage of violence you thought would be a bigger part of the film but really wasn't.. this was obviously enough for some movie goers as they promptly got up and left the cinema, I really should have followed.The final half hour of this film was even more repeating lines back and forth scenes all leading up to a climactic shootout... well a slow build up to two of the girls in glowing bikinis and pink unicorn balaclavas shooting their way into kill a man in his own hot tub (because he used to be Aliens friend but now they are rivals.... doesn't really matter). you would really think Alien would be there shooting up the place to wouldn't you? well he would have been if he didn't get shot in the head by the first guy they come across.

Essential for anyone into dark Indy films (e.g., Tarantino) or cinema geeks in general. It's hard to describe the intensity and greatness of this film in a brief review, but I'll try to summarize: 1) The audio & visual production & editing is out-F%#@&!NG-standing. I consider this a veritable masterpiece.2) The dialog and acting is HIGH above par - superb, actually. I haven't seen a film with such quality of realistic-ness (realism?) in ALL its cast in quite a while.3) The soundtrack is an excellently crafted part of the whole thing -- it fits perfectly with each scene and is generally just.... really good.4) The overall aesthetic and experience is AWESOME.

More so Selena if this was her way of trying to break the pop teen image. But the movie smacked of Michael Mann in just about every characteristic in cinematography, music, setting, and story. Guns Drugs Booze Girls Fast Cars Fast Boat. It got off to a slow start, it didn't speed up, finally there was a conflict in the story which didn't take any stretch of the imagination to write. And the solution was again ""A"" Typical of a Micheal Mann Miami Vice without the Vice. It was a jazzier version of Project X which doesn't say much but If Harmoney Korine is going to make it he better step up his game.

I would recommend 21 & Over if you're looking for a decent party movie but this is a major flop. I am even surprised James Franco agreed to be in this horrible attempt at a college movie. Save your money and your time.

There are sex and nudity, violence and gore, alcohol and drug thrown in one mess without proper retouch, which I consider a huge disrespect to the audiences.

I stayed to the end because one of my friends wanted to see how it ended. After it finally, mercifully ended, many people in the theater laughed because it was so absurdly bad.I can understand how some of the scenes were shot in interesting and artistic ways. Additionally, some of it could be viewed as commenting on aspects of society in original ways. But...The acting was bad. The plot was atrocious. Most of the time, I couldn't even find humor in how bad it was because it was to repetitive and monotonous, so I was simply bored and frustrated. I have never seen a movie repeat lines like this one did. Was that supposed to be a joke? I would have rather watched previews, commercials and messages to turn of my cell phone for 2 hours than this movie. Please do yourself a favor and avoid it.",Spring Breakers

Not in any way comparing this movie to those, just saying it amazes me how as soon as someone does something different, or stray from the norm people who don't get it just trash it. Nas said people fear what they don't understand, and I realize how true that is now. IMDb has movies like Momento at 35 on their top 250 list. I've honestly never posted here, but was really taken back to see people dis the same imagery that that gave stars to in some of the older classics.

I'm a big fan of James Franco, I don't understand why he would ever agree on doing such crap. Selena Gomez was probably the most decent acting in the movie, but still nothing outstanding.

Only 17+ people with an open mind should see this. Dumb teenagers should not watch Spring Breakers, because they will not understand the movie. The whole point of the director was to criticize society and teenagers. The movie seemed like a dream on purpose. The fact that they're always flash-backing and showing boobs is for people realize that this movie represents how teenagers are manipulated by the media. The overreacting has a purpose and it shows how far people can go to reach their superficial goals. Oh, and the Every time scene... If you saw that and you didn't understand THAT THE WHOLE MOVIE was meant to be satiric and a huge irony, you're either 13 or really dumb.

483,zalikabarnes,Ground Breaking,10,31 March 2013,"This movie was utterly captivating. First of all the music Scary Demons and Nice Sprites by Skrillex and brightness of the trailer led drew me in automatically. I was not a big vanessa hudgens, selena gomez, ashely benson, and james franco fan in the first place and normally would not have been willing to get up early and spend money to see them in theaters. But the trailer sparked my interest and I knew I had to go see this movie. The nudity and the violence didn't phase me at all. It was the story that got to me. I read other comments from various sites complaining the the characters should have done this or done that, and that they have no right to do that, or how stupid they were. But in all honesty, I find that the individuals who fell that way only look at the surface of things and did not try to think of the meaning and overall concept of the movie. These girls, the spring breakers, look for excitement and look for change. They are stuck in a place where everything is the same and the excitement isn't the typical bad kind, but the thrill of those that everyone try to stay away from, excitement that goes to the point of criminal. It is only that they would soon realize if that is the thrill they want to continue to lavish in, a world of colors drugs sex violence and not a care on the world, or if they want to go back to the world they know and feel it is their home, reality.This movie was well written and the acting was good to the point of me changing my prespectives towards these actors. Spring Breakers in four words is hypnotic, raw, and mind-blowing.I like this movie so much I would see it multiple times in the theater, download its songs, get posters, and by the DVD.

If you enjoy watching a movie that is 95% montages that are out of sequence with people whispering the same telephone conversation over and over again then this is the film for you. Sure we laughed. But Harmony Korine we were laughing at you. Maybe Korine intended this film to be a mockery of the Spring Break experience, and wanted us to laugh. However, the audience was so confused as to whether or not it was a satire or she was actually intending for it to be a thought provoking drama. Either way she failed because the only part that was slightly provoking was the pool sex scene and the multitude of college boobs zoomed in on the camera. To the top rated reviewer and your advice to see the movie in order to know the dangers of Spring Break: We know the dangers, thats why we go. However the newspapers tell a much more compelling story of the horror that can ensue from a week of binging and dancing half naked on a beach. Every year kids die. They overdose, they fall off of balconies, they drink and drive, and they drown. Im pretty sure any kid that gets accepted to college can see the red flag when a character like James Franco's invites you into his Camero, but a film that tells the truth of spring break and the real life consequences of a manic week at the beach would have been much more effective, and endurable.",Spring Breakers

Although the style of Korine is unique, his content in the film is far from interesting. Spring Breakers is a movie that has interesting transitions, horrible song choices, no plot, and annoying narratives. If you want to hear James Franco say ""Spring Break"" every 5-10 minutes and hope that Korine makes it sound mysterious or odd then you will be disappointed because the narrative in this movie is poor and gets annoying with the continuation. By far the worst work I have seen from the creator of Kids and Gummo. If you want to save yourselves 94 minutes I suggest you watch other movies that don't rely heavily of style. A film is only as good as the volume it brings. The plot is just as important as style and that is the sole reason why this movie is being over-hyped by Korine fans.",Spring Breakers
487,CheezNips,I literally got angry after watching this horrid film,1,27 July 2013,"Okay so when you first look at this movie, it looks like another one of those 'titty movies' made solely for the purpose of seeing scantily clad women, but it has some well known actresses/actors in it. But when you start watching, it tries to add some type of serious drama to the mix. I would have been okay with it, if it wasn't so f*cking mindless. I'm all for cursing and violence, but when I hear Vanessa Hudgens scream 'GET THE F*CK ON THE F*CKING F*CK FLOOR YOU F*CKING MOTHERF*CKER F*CK' 900 times when it's not necessary, it just gets to be annoying. If they had just robbed the goddamn store and left, it would have been better. Instead they sat there screaming and losing their sh*t, reenacting what happened. I already saw it. I don't need to hear it more than once. Honestly the only reason I agreed to watch this is because Selena Gomez is gorgeous. However she leaves less than halfway through the film, and she really didn't even do much to begin with. Everything was so damn slow as well. I lost track of how many times the movie went slow-mo, and some pointless voice-over of one of the girls played while almost nothing happened on the screen. They also repeat the same sh*t over and over and over. 'It's so fun. I want to bring you next year' or some variation of that is said so many times. There are parts where the same lines are repeated LITERALLY right after they are said the first time. I honestly think the dialog and actions in the movie were written by some ADD 10 year old on cocaine. Everything jumps around so quickly, but again, at the same time, IT'S ALL SO SLOW. It seemed like they just kept adding things to the plot that had nothing to do with anything. I still don't know who that black guy was that they killed at the end. What purpose did he serve? James Franco mentioned once that he was best friends with the guy, but every time they were together, some type of violence ensued. I really didn't get it. Another annoying little thing I noticed, was that they used the exact same gun-cocking sound effect every 5 seconds for no reason at all. Hey Rachel Korine snorting coke? Gun cock. Selena Gomez on a bus? Gun cock. James Franco giving a gun a blow job? Gun cock. I'm not kidding. Watch the movie (actually don't) and count how many times you hear that damn noise. Spoilers here but no one should care)The ending was so anti-climactic. James Franco sings a slow song. They ride a boat for 5 minutes (in slow-mo.) James Franco walks (slowly) towards the random bad black guy's house and immediately gets shot and killed. He doesn't even say anything. He just falls over (slowly) and the girls keep walking and committing useless acts of murder (in slow-mo of course.) Then there's another f*cking voice-over talking about how they 'found themselves' and whatnot. Then they drive. Slowly. Suddenly, movie over. Seriously. What. The. F*ck. James Franco is looked at once, but otherwise not acknowledged at all.Basically this movie is about boobs (which you really don't see that much of, other than the opening scene), drugs, and murder. However it tries to mix itself with serious, moody tones. It just doesn't work. The writing is childish and stupid. The acting is awkward. The plot makes no sense. The whole movie is choppy but slow at the same time, and overall, it's just bad. If you want to watch a movie about partying, boobs, and teen mishaps, watch Project X. At least it's plot is simple and ACTUALLY ENTERTAINING.This movie is bad (terrible) and has no redeeming values. I recommend you completely ignore this film.Thank you and goodbye",Spring Breakers

The acting is extremely under-par, the story line isn't really that good, the constant repeat of the same scenes over and over gives the movie a budget film feel, and quite frankly it makes you wonder if the producers made this movie for someone with downs. James Franco has forever been banned from my film collection for even agreeing to do this movie let alone the horrible acting he did in it. I've never given a film 1 star before...

It also shows us the sensitive side of the bad boys. Was successfully introduced the religion that is sometimes put aside this kind of movies.

He is truly a versatile actor. His performance in this movie is so unlike his normal roles and yet, he is great. The movie is full of sex and nudity. As a guy, I loved that. Unfortunately, there are far more bad aspects of the movie than good. The movie is extremely repetitive. It recycles the same scene of college kids partying on a beach, as well as others. Slow motion constantly. The narration constantly repeats itself blatantly to the point that I was annoyed as hell watching the movie. Aside from James Franco, the acting is atrocious. The acting and writing are so bad, that it makes the film funny at times that it shouldn't be. The main girls in this movie are so bad its pathetic, although Selena Gomez is OK. The movie is constantly up and down and you never know what is going to happen. The movie is going in a constant direction until, the first girl leaves, then it is a completely different movie.

It's intuitive that a lot of people complain about seeing movies that portray teens who have dialogue that is very grown-up and not 'teen- like' at all; but then a movie comes along like this one where the teens are just as annoyingly vapid-sounding as they are in real life and they complain that it is boring. It IS annoying in a way; but it's REAL. That's the point. And even though their vernacular is teen-like; their actions show their morality and their true selves. Girls have it rough nowadays and they are more lost than ever. Media shows us how much of 'have-not's' they are by comparison; and parents don't pay much attention because they are divorced and working and, mostly, because they are a part of a generation who had it SO much easier in terms of the economy and the right paths to follow. The Baby-Boomer parents are the ""Me-Generation"" and are not in touch with this post- sexual revolution/divorced parents/drug-addled/internet culture that their children are a part of. I think this movie made a bold statement about the current generation of lost children who are coming into a world where they are not welcomed by a fair job market and where they have to compete for any tiny scrap of power and self-dignity they will ever get. Do these kids really KNOW how to gain actual self-worth? No. And that is the point of this movie. It's a sadness at the end but it's a cautionary tale. And a DAMN good one.",Spring Breakers
495,clementine95,Springbreakers is an attempt at showing a group of girls trip to a popular springbreak spot. They get involved with the gangster culture and end up 'discovering themselves'.,1,7 April 2013,"My sister and I went to see Springbreakers last night and we both agree that it was a repetitive melange of garbage inter-spaced with tits and asses wobbling about for the camera. It felt more like a glorified pornography film rather than a piece of cinematography. We considered walking out before the end but assumed that SOMETHING must happen...unfortunately, the 'film' did not deliver anything of note. Instead, Springbreakers delivered a script which could not have been longer than a side of A4 page, repeated over and over again, for 'effect'. Whatever that effect was, it served more as an annoyance than anything else. It distinctly felt like the director was attempting to be edgy and taboo through showing teenagers taking drugs and having sex, this, however, is nothing new and is quite boring to watch. At times. it was uncomfortably cringe-worthy and plain distasteful. At the end of the movie, which could not have come sooner, our fellow cinema goers agreed that the film was utterly awful and that there was absolutely no point to it whatsoever. I have never been so unmoved and uninspired by a movie. A truly palpable waste of time. Do not waste your money on the cinema ticket.",Spring Breakers

Unfortunately, someone loaded these ingredients in a blender and now it's a mushy mess.I realize that stories don't always have to be told in a linear form but, god almighty, can you please hold one scene for longer than 30 seconds? Every scene was peppered with flash forwards, flash backs, cut-scenes and voice-overs. I can only assume the director wanted to give the viewers the feeling of being drunk or strung out on drugs. All it did was make my head hurt. You don't have to keep flashing back to the scene of the ""good girl"" (Faith) in church. We get it. She's conflicted over the behavior of her childhood friends and her faith. Why not let the scene run uninterrupted instead of spoon-feeding the message with all this creative imagery.In contrast, I thought the restaurant robbery scene was nicely done because it was one continuous shot.It's a shame. I desperately wanted to like this film. Perhaps some kind soul will re-edit the film and put the scenes back in order before they release it on DVD.",Spring Breakers
497,mmasonvw,Garbage,1,7 April 2014,"I had very low expectations for this movie when I went to watch it, yet somehow, it managed to be even worse than I had originally feared. In order to counter the mind-numbingly simple plot and premise of this movie, it attempted to be ""artistic"" through a series of never-ending montages and convoluted ""insightful"" dialog. The problem with this is the fact that the movie's producers kept reusing the same shots over and over and over again, coupled with the most narrow minded, know it all dialog. This most likely was done to hide the fact that the child-star actors casted in this movie couldn't actually deliver a full line of meaningful dialog.Furthermore, there was absolutely no trace of character development, direction, or motivation to help propel the plot. The entire movie just felt like a series of things happening; they wanted to go on spring break, they rob a store, they go on spring break, they get arrested.. blah blah blah. All of this was cut with endless shots of the girls running around half naked, getting wasted, and calling their grandmothers...? I managed to make it a little over 30 minutes into the movie until I simply couldn't tolerate it any longer. Even at the 40 minute mark, James Franco's character had yet to fully enter the storyline.

I felt like the movie never really got started because of the constant narrating. People thought that because Gomez was in it, that the movie would revolve around her, but it didn't because it wasn't about her! It was about all of them not just one girl. Franco's performance didn't disappoint me, i thought he was excellent, if the movie had been about the relationship between Alien(Franco) and Archie(Gucci) and their personal rivalry, it would have been a whole different film. Now i wish it would have been, because i thought those scenes were great, but because the movie tried to focus more on what was going on with the girls thats what made it a let down for the audience.",Spring Breakers

Many were upset when they found out what this turned into, now I know why.As for it being some sort of Cult Classic, not what I am looking for.

Also the story could have lead up to something it felt i was watch a teenage version of vantage point. Also if you are going to have a cameo in a movie don't have Gucci Mane that guy is a horrible actor. I could not understand a word he said. Also if you put guns in a movie at least fire them to make the movie a little better. This movie was a complete train wreck and that's putting it nicely.

502,ForDNiners,Unbelievable,1,29 March 2013,"This is the worst movie I have ever watched on the big screen. This is my first review for a movie and I am sharing my opinion towards this movie because I don't want anyone to waste their time watching this.So basically the story is about four college girls that are massive partiers who want to escape reality and go somewhere for Spring Break. But wait, they don't have enough money to go anywhere so they steal it; they use that money to go to Florida, to party! Then the girls are like, ""I love it out here, it is so much different from reality."" In my head I was like ""what?"" all you did back in college was do drugs and party anyway. Then they all get caught up with a gangster and things go crazy. Selena Gomez leaves first, then the girl with the pink hair leaves second, after realizing that they are getting caught up in some crazy stuff with a gangster. Later on guns go off, people die, the end.So is there a message in this movie? The message is that over time you will find yourself reflecting upon your past actions (crazy actions in the case of this movie)and realize that what you have done was horrible. The message was shallowly portrayed in this disgusting movie. For one, there was this one scene that was repeated like 10 times, and other scenes were repeated multiple times as well. The line ""Spring break forever"" was repeated like a million times. The action was horrendous and the comedy... hmmm, there was none of that. This movie was like one of those annoying pop songs that repeat the same line over and over again and which are meaningless as well. The script of this movie was so dull and ridiculous. This movie could have been like thirty minutes shorter if they hadn't repeated the same thing over and over and over again. The only reason I watched the whole thing is because my friends wanted to watch it. If you want to watch a fake party, and the four main girls doing ridiculous everything for an hour, watch it.",Spring Breakers

This movie is mostly for young adults so grown ups won't really like it; it contains nudity and violence. The plot isn't really clear, so i understand why some people might not like it. James Franco plays his roll very well as the drug dealer. The whole movie looks like one big fantasy life-party. The plot might not be as good, but the style and designing and fashion and party-like theme..It's all so good!I really enjoyed the movie and people should go easier on this movie, it doesn't deserve a 5.7 AT ALL!I give it a 6.9-7/10",Spring Breakers

Wish I'd walked out of the cinema within the first half an hour as I knew there were better films being screened at the same time. I kept hoping that it would improve but it doesn't. There are very few full sentences, no story line and too many ridiculous scenes to count as well as constant repetition of shots and sounds. Would be bearable if it was a well made film but it's not.

It's more about how two little white girls in yellow bikinis with blond hair wearing pink pullover masks can shoot their guns better than black people. Franco is THE most boring part of the entire movie. He talks and he drones and he goes on and on and on until finally I was just begging him to go away. Then there was that scary part in the movie that Korrine set up to make Selena cry - for real. He placed her in a cheap bar filled with black guys, and Selena starts crying for real, begging to be allowed to go home. Is Selena afraid of black people? This film is both racist, and filled with homosexual scenes. As for the film itself, I could have shot the entire thing on my cell phone and probably made a better movie. Don't get me started on how bad the acting is..... For the people who like this film, have you never seen a boob or a butt before? Don't judge all the female body parts by what is repeatedly shown in this film - some were really ugly and were too painful to look at.

It is just nonsense, just randomness.The only thing I enjoyed were the boobies and that is about it. As a friendly advise don't watch this movie even though the trailer looks awesome. First of all you don't who the main character is, because at one point of the movie everybody is narrating, and they're narration makes no sense. Second there is an antagonist but you don't know who is the protagonist. Third the movie makes no sense just no sense it just felt repetitive and everybody just said the same thing over and over again annoying. It says in categories it's comedy it's not.

It is astonishing to me that this generation finds a movie this horribly scripted, filmed, and thought-out to be good. It is not controversial, racy, or thought- provoking. It gives no insight, message, or underlying theme. It isn't that I do not like controversial, bad-ass, or vulgar films.. I do. This film offered none of that!

James Franco does do an amazing job in this movie, and i would recommend you see it solely on his performance. But all in all is all about drugs, sex, and money. It's the idea weather or not to give into temptation. It's kind of confusing, and its sometimes hard to follow what's going on. It's a very ""arty"" film. Your typical party movie, yet different.

These four girls go to Florida after robbing a restaurant and after being arrested in Florida James Franco, in his most absolute horrible role, takes them under his wing.

The ENTIRE movie James Franco is in the back noise saying ""spring break y'all, spring break forever"" the movie repeats lines constantly and there is no story like. If you honestly took out all the unnecessary use of girls with breasts out and ten minutes of a threesome, the movie wouldn't last more than 30 minutes. I have honestly never seen anything so god awful and I wonder why any of these actors took up this movie because I would be embarrassed. And what's worse is actual critics praise it for being different. It's not different, it's unkempt. It's messy and ridiculously unrealistic.

512,amazon-642-941779,Thoroughly broken but still entertaining,6,25 March 2013,"I can see why Spring Breakers is meeting with the greatest financial success of anything Korine's done-- well, aside from the fact that the title and poster gives it a built-in ""confused audience"" who will go in thinking this film is something that it is not. All the revenue-friendly acres of skin totally aside, the film is just plain more slick and mainstream-friendly in its overall look and feel than most of Korine's earlier efforts.Korine's made mostly uncomfortable films, but in Spring Breakers, most of my discomfort stems from the fact that the main characters (save Alien, whom I never would have encountered on campus to begin with) are the very same types of people I went out of my way to avoid back in college. This film is as close as I ever want/wanted to get to the real spring break experience... and particularly on the big screen, it's close enough, thank you.But while the slo-mo party sequences seem believable enough to me, my biggest problem with Spring Breakers lies in its believability. Practically out of the box, we see the girls engaging in a criminal act that would be well outside the behavioral scope of 99.999% of college-enrolled millennials, no matter how totally self-absorbed.This event is necessary to gain believability for what happens later, after James Franco's Alien character enters the picture. Alien is not so much a devious, corrupting influence on the movie's titular characters (I swear to you, no prurient pun intended), more just a natural catalyst for bringing out their barely-hidden inner sociopaths. Without the earlier crime the girls committed on their own, there's no way the audience would ever buy that they'd go along with the likes of him for the third-act ride.Even with that bit of plot groundwork laid, Alien is a highly unlikely partner for these girls. We have to believe that they'd have a reason to stick around with a street thug like him long enough for them to discover their inner criminals to the fullest. Franco is really, really great as Alien - to the point where it's simply impossible to believe that girls such as these would entertain his deeply creepy advances / company for more than five minutes before bolting.Even less believable is the not-so-bright likes of Alien being a real-deal / rising local player, which is central both with his involvement with the girls and the movie's climax. Alien's criminal operations are basically invisible. We only get to see two of his employees and a whole lot of drugs, cash, and guns, and from that we're supposed to buy that he's a big deal on the local scene.I did feel that Alien's relationship with the girls gains some degree of realism after a much-discussed scene that takes place in his bedroom with the girls wielding loaded weapons. How much realism? Well, not much; what ends up developing is basically every man's inner teenage multi-some fantasy, and we all know how often *those* sorts of dreams are even remotely realized. But we see an instant change in his character that makes the girls' interest in him much more believable from that point forward. The thing is, again, a lot of extremely unlikely water had to pass under the bridge before we get to that scene and the accompanying, much-needed character shift.This film moves surprisingly slowly. The slowest-moving section is the first act, the process of the girls figuring out how to get out of Dodge, slow / overdone to the point where when they finally get to meet Alien, it already felt like third-act time to me.Maybe Korine wanted us to get to know these characters in detail, but there's simply not enough to them as people to get to know. The four central girls are purposely one-dimensional characters with nary a personal thought or genuinely reflective tendency in their heads, and I'm quite sure that's by Korine's design, so he should have known better than to try and explore what simply isn't there.Adding to the pacing issue is the repetitious, heavy-handed editing. In addition to repeating scenes as flashback fodder, Korine is fond of playing snippets of the same dialogue over and over during montages to ""make points"" about the characters or over-explain their motivations. It's irritating and unnecessary. I can't emphasize enough how much better the film would have been without this eye-roll-generating dialogue-looping. I was reminded of The Room's endless ""transitional"" shots of the Golden Gate Bridge - except that I rolled my eyes *less* at that.I strongly disagree with a read of Spring Breakers as some kind of ""cautionary tale."" I don't think much of what happens in this movie could possibly apply or happen to real people resembling these archetypes. I left the theater saying, ""So... what was the point of all that?"", which is something I sort of expected going in based on past exposure to Korine's work.Still, the film did stick with me somehow. The visuals / cinematography make up somewhat in terms of realism for the aforementioned problems with plot, dialogue and character development/interaction, giving the film a distinctive, palpable vibe.A previous reviewer got it right - this is a guilty pleasure movie, not even so much for the copious amount of flesh on display, but just as a pure escapist / style flick that does have just a little more brains, soul, and squirm-in-your-chair to it than the average mainstream escapist flick.Is it an art-house film? If so, barely. Is it a must-see? I definitely wouldn't say that either, but at the very least it should make for interesting water-cooler discussions with the fellow indoctrinated.",Spring Breakers
513,jake-morris-23,Spring Breakers is one not to miss!,9,25 March 2013,"Spring Breakers was advertised as a typical teen-party film revolving around four girls. However, this movie was FAR from the normal. This movie revolves around the drug and crime problems in the world today. Using different filming techniques, fading in ad out, using pinkish tint in scenes, created a film that you could not look away from. Using past Disney and ABC family stars, Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens, this movie intrigues the viewer even more. These, once innocent Disney stars, take on a role of drugs and crime. These girls use tremendous skill, making the viewer believe that this may actually be happening. Then, James Franco comes into play in a role like no other. We see this transformed James Franco as a drug and gun dealer with loads of cash. He, with his cornrows, full grill, and tattoos, build a character that enhances the film and catches our attention even more. This movie is unlike any other film that I have ever seen, and I say this in a great way. This movie will keep you reeled in the entire time, feeling for the characters and the situation the whole movie. This may be a lower budget film, but the aftermath of this film is amazing. However, do not bring small children to this movie, as there is many very inappropriate scenes.

514,zach91419,Harmony Korine scams people BIG this time,1,25 March 2013,"First of all this movie was made by the guy who made Trash Humpers, so if you liked that movie you might like this one. The writing in this movie is terrible and makes no sense at all. Selena Gomez is supposed to be a very Christian girl with high morals and ends up drinking tons of alcohol, does drugs, and encourages robbery. She then tells her Grandma that she should come with her to spring break next year implying that she should drink do drugs and have sex with random people too. Selena Gomez is trying to find out who she really is during spring break and that turns out to be a drunk slut. Her friends however are far worse and apparently are now cold blooded killers. These girls in college could have a good future but decide they want to have sex with James Franco and get money in any way possible. One girl gets shot and gets afraid and goes home and the other two decide to stay. I guess they don't care if they are going to die or not. These two girls then tell their parents over the phone that they want to turn their life around and start being good people is the secret to being happy thus implying that they'll go home and start listening to their own advice and get a better life. They then proceed to magically kill tons of people with guns from a gang and steal a very expensive car. The most annoying part of this movie is the repetitiveness of everything James Franco says. That ""Spring Break"" line that he keeps saying that I'm sure Korine finds haunting just sounds ridiculous and annoying. I'm not sure what the message of this movie is because nothing in it makes sense and nothing is consistent. I can't tell if Korine is advocating completely hedonistic life-styles or not because while some of the girls feel bad and go back their ""boring lives"" the last two girls get let off with no consequence what-so-ever. This movie to me just seems like a pretentious piece of s**t. That uses a somewhat interesting premise and unique cinematography to fool the audience that more is being said with this movie than there is.This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen The Room, Ghost Rider 2, and Son of the Mask.

First 5 minutes of the movie, my sister was crying, looking away from the major teen nudity. My mom and I were also looking away. After the first 15 minutes of this movie we left the theaters, after wasting about $100, because this was a dine in theater. The movie was way inappropriate to anyone between the ages of 0 to 1000. The movie didn't go 2 minutes without using bad language, or drug usage, nudity, or anything that had to do with sex. I am happy we left when we did. Never in my life have I ever regretted anything more than I regret this. If all you look for in a movie is sex, nudity, drugs, and horrible language, this might be the movie for you.

Everything, from its ""story"" and ""plot"" right down to its technical aspects just screams out awful. It is best described as an amateur movie that somehow got the financial backing of Hollywood. It is a pity to think of about how expensive all the camera equipment used for the film must have been. Truly a pity, for such equipment is wasted on a Director and a DP who clearly have no idea on how to use them. While other films may be successful in pulling-off the ""cinema vérité"" look, the same cannot be said for this debacle of a film. The movie has the look and feel of a teenage girl playing around with the built-in camera on her Iphone. Not only does this look unprofessional, but it also prevents the film from effectively telling its ""story"" to the audience. A good example of this is a scene at the beginning of the film in which we are given insight into Selena Gomez's character. In addition to the terrible-writing, the amateur handy-cam footage ruins the scene completely. Rather than focus on what Selena Gomez' character is saying, the audience is distracted and disoriented by the appalling lack of coherent camera shots. All of the audiences' immersion in the scene is thus ruined by the lack of coherence in the cinematography. The editing and structure of the overall film is a mess. It is not a film so much as it is a 90-minute montage of short video-clips drawn from different plot-events in the ""story"". We are not given any actual movie scenes that take place in one single location from start to finish. Rather, whatever footage which would have made-up a single scene is instead dissembled into short video clips. These short clips are chronologically separated from one another, with each individual clip placed in a different part of the movie. The film consequently becomes an incoherent mess, and lacks any of the lengthy-scenes needed to tell its story in great-enough detail. As a result, there is no sense of time-and-place given to the events of the story. Such a lack of time-and-space therefore cancels out any prospect of the audience immersing themselves into the film's ""story"". Emphasis should be placed on the quotation marks put on the word ""story"", for it is a poor excuse for one. Not only is the ""story"" itself god-awful, but so is it's poor excuse for a ""plot"". We are not given any interesting insight as to why the girls are set on such a destructive path. We aren't given any hints that they may have abusive parents or a lack-of. Nor does the film hint at poverty being the cause. In fact, any such hints are dispelled when the film positions the characters as privileged spoiled-brats who can afford to attend college. The only explanation that we are given is that they just are plain bitches. That's it. If you are going to make a film about impressionable youth turning to crime, give us a good reason why they are doing so. And not only that, present us with the type of conditions that could force them to do so in the first place. The filmmakers don't do any of this, and instead we are introduced to a group of privileged-brats who have no good rationale for committing robbery and other criminal acts. Having them be just rich spoiled-bitches does not cut it; it ruins the prospect of the audience having any empathy with these characters. Without such empathy, there is no real reason for the audience to be emotionally invested in the film. The ending is a train-wreck of epic proportions. There is no logical-conclusion to the story. The film should have ended with the two-remaining girls dying in the final shoot-out; it would have shown the fatal outcome of them letting themselves get involved with a dangerous criminal. But instead we are given a completely implausible ending in which they both manage to mow down numbers of armed thugs without getting wounded whatsoever. It is absurd that these two teenage-girls manage to gun down with-ease armed thugs who obviously would have more experience with firearms than they do. The ending is so unbelievable, not to mention asinine, that it helps make the movie even goofier than it already is. Which leads us to the character Alien played by James Franco. The character Alien is so over-exaggerated and goofy, that the audience fails to take the film seriously as a result. He is so badly scripted and characterized that he becomes a cartoony caricature, one to laugh at rather than fear. Without a criminal to fear, the film fails to give us any chilling look at the depravity of crime. I find it ridiculous that some people think that this film is somehow ""deep"" and ""insightful"": it's not. It is an unintentional-comedy; one in which the audience does not laugh with the film, but rather, laugh at it with a sense-of-pity at its poor quality. It's sad to think that, at the screening I attended, the audience enjoyed a cute-commercial which came on during the pre-show more so than the film itself.",Spring Breakers
519,heatherdk-646-367685,Don't waste your time or money,1,30 March 2013,"It isn't very often that I will say that a movie was terrible, but this is one of those times. From the moment the movie started until it finally came to an end, it was painful to watch. The acting was terrible for the most part, and the story line went no where. If you are expecting any kind of action or suspense, or even just for something kind of interesting to happen, you will be greatly disappointed. When it was finished, I regretted not leaving 20 minutes into the movie like another group of people did. I think I can safely say that no one enjoyed it, because when the movie ended, everyone in the room was silent...there was none of the usual chatter going on when a movie ends.I deeply regret having spent my money and time on this movie, and would not watch it again if they paid me!",Spring Breakers

I feel like i should be given my money back due to how horrible this movie was.",Spring Breakers
521,cass-sequoia,Why does this movie exist?,1,31 March 2013,"This is the first and will most likely be the only time that I experience anything so horrifically bad that I am compelled to write a user review of it. This is literally the worst movie that I have ever seen. This movie is actually so atrociously bad that showing it to detainees ranks as torture under the Geneva Conventions.A far more apt title for this movie would be ""Stupid Sluts Meet Weird James Franco and Play with Guns"". The movie is 94 minutes long but probably only contains about 45 minutes of original scenes while the rest of the movie is a repeat of these scenes with different filters and effects. The audio is even more unoriginal, with the same words being repeated for 5 minute stretches before the voice-over ""actor"" gets bored and switches to a different, unrelated phrase. There is no coherent plot to speak of, and any scenes that have a semblance of contiguity are ultimately ruined by outlandishly bad acting and glaring plot holes. I like to think that the big-name actors associated with this movie were tricked into participating by bizarre psychological techniques, because there is no possible way that anybody could read the screenplay and ""script""(same 10 phrases repeated for the whole movie) and say ""Yes this is something that I would like to be involved in and have my name and reputation associated with.""This movie was reviewed as ""stinging social commentary"", but there is no moral to be seen, no attempt at a real resolution and absolutely no positive characteristics. It is superficial and it is wrong that people are actually making money from creating this atrocity. All the beautiful eye candy in the world could not bring this movie to anywhere close to watchable, but it feels like the director tries to bribe the audience into watching more of his cruel social experiment with naked, writhing women.I would do anything, except watch ""Springbreakers"" a second time, to get these 94 minutes and $9.75 of real currency, which could be spent on something infinitely more worthwhile, like jawbreakers, a puppy or bamboo splinters to shove under my fingernails, back. I genuinely feel like I have made a terrible mistake in my life because I was convinced to go see this movie and sat through the whole thing. Please, please, please do not go see this movie and instead do something more meaningful like watch grass grow or beat your head against a wall or even just burn the cash you would spend on seeing ""Springbreakers"".",Spring Breakers
522,brandoooo,Wasn't as horrible as everyone made it out to be...,7,1 April 2013,"This is a movie I have been waiting to see for quite some time... and I knew going into it that it was going to be different from quite a bit of other movies I normally watch. But it wasn't as bad as people are making it out to be.I think a lot of people hated it because they didn't know who the director was and they didn't expect a movie about Spring Break to be like that. I went into it knowing full on that it was going to be weird. I will admit the only reason I wanted to see this movie really bad was because of Selena Gomez. Even after learning she leaves about half way through I was still intrigued by it, and I was glad I got to see it.All the actors did an amazing job... James Franco being the highlight. Selena played the perfect part because she kept her good-girl image intact but still pushed her boundaries. When her character decides to leave, I was upset but I was still interested in seeing what happens to the other characters. Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Rachel Korine were all able to hold up their part in the film and I found myself enjoying their performances.If you want a movie with a plot that is straight forward from beginning to end, this movie is probably not for you. It actually sort of lacks in plot. If you like movies that have a unique directing style and different editing, then I recommend this. I personally can appreciate movies that are different and this is definitely one of them. That all being said, I have a few friends that still want to see it and I wouldn't mind going with them.",Spring Breakers
523,IvyOpal,Highlights of the performances and praises of plot,7,1 April 2013,"Spring Breakers was everything I expected it to be. It was exciting and it didn't sugar coat the sex and the violence that was displayed through out the 93 minutes. In my opinion there is nothing better than a strong plot that not only immediately grabs your attention, but also a dialog that is direct and to the point when telling the story. As for the leading actresses of the movie I would say they all captivated the screen and really made you believe who they said they were in their roles. Vanessa Hugens out of the four really stood out for me as well as Ashley Benson. The two of them really gave a sensational performance and they really draw you in. James Franco is a description of the word Talented and he just really demands your attention! Selena Gomez is a real actress she never fails to bring a performance that leaves you breathless. The only thing is that despite the controversy of the movie and the raw footage. I don't agree with the popular opinion that this is her breakout role from her Disney image. Her character isn't squeaky clean but she looks like the Disney star riding her bike with her training wheels still on compared to the other girls. The other girls in the movie just really went for it and didn't hold back. Selena still plays it a little safe with her new movie role and uses the movie to put her on another level instead of her actually playing a character that gives her the edge. I rate the movie 7 because in general I enjoyed it and anyone who is interested in seeing it should know its definitely worth watching!",Spring Breakers
524,jkossoris,They should have paid ME to see it,1,2 April 2013,"Guys... it was horrible. Half the people in the theater walked out, and the rest were laughing at how bad it was. There is no plot, and they repeat the same scenes and lines over and over again because apparently the director couldn't come up with new content. Please save your money. Since my review needs to be 10 lines long, here comes a ramble: It was horrible it was so bad like really bad like super super bad really really super bad horrible awful bad bad bad bad bad bad incredibly bad I CANT BELIEVE I ACTUALLY SPENT MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.

525,linkluvor-zitty,"Partly enjoyable, but all in all, a waste of time",3,6 April 2013,"I was excited to see this movie, mostly because of Vanessa Hudgens and the reviews I read on rottentomatoes & here. I thought it would show (again) that she (VH) isn't talented at all, but in fact, she was the best thing in the movie. She could truly grab the meaning of her character (maybe because she is similar to Candy in real life as well). James Franco was great too, but that's not a thing to be questioned. The other girls, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine were good, but they weren't really significant.The thing that got on my nerves, was, that the movie was actually boring. The dialogues were awful, I didn't see any meaning in repeating meaningless sentences, two, three, five times... it just got more and more boring. And there was not a single character similar to me, or any other average viewer despite the fact that I'm in the girls' age group. Yeah I know, that the ""message"" was, that more and more teens live without goals and motivation to do anything with their lives - but come on, these sluts are way to rare (in my environment at least) to be based on. And Candy's and Brit's simple stupidity was also nerve-racking for me, that they didn't even feel sorry for Alien being shot. But let's say, it's not a real-life story, then it should've been at least interesting and catching. But it wasn't. I could've gone out anytime, and I wouldn't have lost anything.To sum up, this was a good opportunity for Vanessa Hudgens to step out of the Disney image, and James Franco's parts were also enjoyable, but the movie itself was a waste of time.",Spring Breakers
526,danvandenaarssen,Harmony Korine's 'interesting' new film.,1,6 April 2013,"Judging by the trailers of 'Springbreakers' I thought this film was going to be of decent standard. I thought wrong. If you are looking for a film with good acting, a good story line, and good special effects than this film is definitely not for you. Every single character int he film is flat, the most interesting character is that of Selena Gomes, and her character disappears about half way through. I appreciate that Harmony Korine makes films for alternative reasons than audiences enjoyment, and that became even more clear to me after watching this. I would suggest not to waste your time, or money (like me), and just give this miss, trust me... you are doing your intelligence a favour.",Spring Breakers
527,fantom2583,An aggressive value judgment in Harmony Korine's erratic movie,8,10 April 2013,"Harmony Korine doesn't do the polite or say sorry: he slaps his opinion about a generation in the viewers' face with unvarnished frankness in his erratic movie, in which he digs into the topic of diversity, breaking out and pushing the envelope. The four girls could be anyone, it doesn't matter who they are, they are only the embodiments of personalities, characters, we don't need to know more about them and their background, than what we get from them. How far is this generation willing to go in the dark side of life? What can alcohol and drugs do to them, so are they the ones controlling their actions or are they reckless because of their own nature? If the generation goes until the end and reaches the wall, how does it take the next step? Does it regret its actions sincerely or promises everything just to survive the party? Korine is apparently exaggerating, even the intoxicated parties don't mean a straight way to the stygian murders. But the emphasis is not necessarily on the murders, just the percept, the value judgment itself is the point, if we disvest the exaggerations, the director's opinion still remains clear. Korine doesn't believe in dialogues concerning the underlining of his message, the interactions between the four girls are irrelevant, the even carries this part too far, repeating some sentences like slogans is rather annoying than effective. Effective are the pics, the represented situations, my favorite is the montage during the Britney Spears song, the basic situation itself is quite surreal: the gangster sits at the piano and plays Britney, but at the same time terribly snappy, the most beautiful angel of the pop world turning into one of the biggest bitches of the world, Korine has a taste of humor, the movie is about such characters. James Franco overtops the other actors with his Jack Sparrow-inspired acting, his acting is huge in the movie and his elbow-room is the biggest as well. The four girls could actually be anyone, the actresses could also be anyone, Korine shows a flip here as well. Vanessa Hudgens thanks for the opportunity and kicks another into her HSM-character. Every actor is in place, portrays the character to be shown confidently. Although the movie sits down in some places and sometimes this lack of dialogues can be disturbing, the efficient pictures, the aggressive music and the value judgment yelling on the linen lifts Korine's one-man movie way beyond the average. Nice work.",Spring Breakers
528,middleclasssuccess,Dorky,1,7 April 2013,"Well if you were a tween and want to see bathing suits, OK, but if you are educated (a little) this movie is stupid. The plot... well, take that back, there was no plot. It was weak, like watered down water. The character development was very poor. Where was the climax in the first thirty minutes, Oh, was that the climax? The characters were all too much the same. Very poorly presented. All the ""main characters"" were presented as idiots, or dead brains (maybe that was their intention?) Where was the protagonist, antagonist? So apart from empty space of fair story line, the movie was - like I said, good for a tween who wanted to see bodies and imagine. Advice, fire this writer and producer.",Spring Breakers
529,Nudepanda,Just... Bad...,1,28 February 2014,"I went to see this ""film"" a while ago at the theater with my girlfriend, neither of us knowing what to expect. It made us want to leave in the first fifteen minutes of seeing it. I watched as people left throughout the film screening and we stayed to give it a chance in hopes it would improve. It didn't. If asked which movie I dislike the most, it would be this one; even beating Dragon Ball Evolution on my list. It tried way too hard with its filming techniques and its satire falling flat on its face. The overuse of the motifs in this film such as Alien saying ""Spring break fo' eva"" made me feel annoyed rather than wanting to see this as a reflection of youth culture. The only redeeming quality the film has is that it appears as though Harmony Korine wants to annoy his audience until they revel in their annoyance; drawing attention towards the irony the film presents by getting in their faces. What made me question the plot the most was the reasoning behind the actions of the characters before going away for Spring Break. They have enough money to buy vast amounts of drugs and be in school through the support of their parents, but yet they can't procure enough money to go on a bus trip where they use their bodies to get what they want (ie men, drugs and alcohol). If you glimpse at the narrative itself, isolating it from the filmic techniques, it alone struggles to maintain the positive qualities of cinema. As soon as the credit sequence appeared, someone yelled out ""GARBAGE!"", prompting everyone to laugh at this attempt of a film.",Spring Breakers

The entire dialog contains about 10 sentences and are repeated throughout the entire movie. It's like watching a football en the commentator starts talking about his fishing trip.

I have a daughter who is 22 and I can relate to young people wanting to have fun and see different things, but for others to take advantage of young girls is something I don't want to see. This is not art and it was not entertaining unless you have a sick mind. The theater manager gave us a refund and agreed with me. I came to this website to see if I could figure out how it ended. I guess it ended better then I thought. Yet Iam not sorry for walking out.I know lots of movies are disturbing and at the same time could be considered art but this film from what I saw did not have it. I told my daughter she should see it to see that sometimes its better to stay home and be bored rather then get caught up in the evils of this earth, but I hope she continues to not listen to Dad and not see it but here what I said about the movie and that is it sucked.",Spring Breakers
532,ChristyMalyan,I left the cinema early,1,18 April 2013,"I went to see this film at the cinema, all be it rather naively in terms of what I was expecting. Perhaps that has clouded my initial judgement of the film, as the trailer portrayed it as something completely different, but none the less, my opinion has not changed that even for the film it's supposed to be, its still rather terrible. After twenty minutes I considered leaving the cinema, but my friend convinced me to stay until James Franco's role became prominent. It was a long wait, and furthermore was not worthwhile. We finally left during the Piano scene, in which Franco performs a rather bizarre version of a Britney Spears song, minutes after sucking off a Pistol silencer. At the cinema i really didn't get it; the film was not formulaic, there was no real plot line, the characters were generic and all the same, the scenes were edited and directed in a strange fashion that made the movie difficult to follow, and a vast amount of the footage was simply young people jumping up and down in various different destinations, to various different Skrillex tracks taking various different drugs. When I got home and read some reviews I began to understand it more. It's boredom, lack of actual content, superficialness, stereotyped characters and awkward vibe is apparently a pun in itself of the alienating life of the MTV generation. Perhaps its because I'm English, but I found the tale completely unrelatable. Even after understanding the film however, It has not changed my opinion in the slightest. Deeply compelling message or not, this film has one fatal flaw - nothing about it, in any way, is likable. The Characters are almost impossible to tell apart except for their breast sizes, most of the lines in the film are repeated three or four times, often in a row, the action scenes are few and far between, the constant use of gun-clicking dissonant sounds added in over the top only makes whats going on incredibly confusing and the plot is literally non- existent. Furthermore, Selina Gomez may be the most pointless character in a movie of all time - after talking about how she wants to escape her small-town, Christian life style, she meets a drug dealer and decides to get the first bus home, which is her final involvement after just half an hour.I still haven't seen the ending, but quite frankly i don't care. From what I've heard, I haven't missed much, and i'd recommend anyone who wants to watch this film to simply watch Natural Born Killers instead. It achieves everything this film tries to, without trying to be so clever that you can't actually understand the point of it, and has the dark humour, intense scenes, witty dialogue, gruesome moments and interesting characters that this film lacks all round. As my friend pointed out, the only thing the film had going for it was the constant array of naked women in almost every scene. But that in effect only made the film seem pointless, and at the same time took away any sense of credibility or that this was a film with a deep underlying theme. Some other reviewers have commented that this film is horribly misunderstood, but if it is so misunderstood the majority of people are appalled by it, it clearly hasn't been executed properly. I'm no movie buff, but I have seen a variety of films of different quality, different intellectualism and different styles. This film is arguably the worst I have ever seen, and in a bizarre echo of it's weak plot, it seemed to me as if the director had pulled a fast one to raise some money, go down to Florida and film a load of drug-soaked orgies for his own enjoyment.",Spring Breakers

It most strongly resembles a Girls Gone Wrong video. Stunningly- artistic, attempts of young womanhood getting it on, and it's superbly ridiculous plot. Primarily, the script, could be an argument for the moral corruption of youth and rebellion, if a church sponsored this movie I would not be surprised. After the scenes of drug and alcohol use, the girls meet up with a local gangsta who just totally takes Disney teen-aged rebellion into the next century. Embracing the dark side. What's with all the Brittney references? W.T.F.? Is this her life story? Is Alien suppose to K-Fed? The slowest action-movie I have ever seen. The apologetic ending induces another W.T.F. moment. Let's do all of this because our lives are so boring... Let's murder some drug dealers and go back to college... Unbelievable! Each scene in the movie becomes more and more obvious it's a turn youth away from sin. Teenage self-discovery? Where did the plot go wrong? I think it started with the first line of dialogue....

I was so wrong.This movie was painful to follow, mostly due to the fact it completely lacked a plot. It was an hour and a half of montages and voice overs. The movie was unfocused, anticlimactic, cheesy ( and not in the good way) and was just a total mess and a waste of time. Thank god I did not pay to see it. If the directing ""style"" of this movie is considered artistic, then wow art really is dying. The best way I can describe it is basically a 90 minute long trailer. A bunch of random scenes spliced together with character voice overs. It unforgivably jerked you along the ""plot"" without ever giving explanation or justification for any of the characters actions. After watching the movie, I still have no idea what exactly happened and furthermore, do not care to figure it out. The truth is, the actors while shooting the movie probably had no idea it was going to end up the way it did. Before editing, the movie probably had a good, but small, chance of being mediocre at best. But wow, that movie was a heaping pile of crap.

Prisoners in Guantanamo Bay should be forced to watch this movie as a form of punishment. There's no plot, there's about 20 minutes of actual footage made for the movie which is constantly repeated throughout, and to top it all off, my grandfather of 85 could have done a better job as a gangster. If the writer had a daughter, and she was on crack and wrote a script, it would probably turn out better than this. This movie appeared to consist of 3 pages worth of actual dialogue repeated as though the actors had a stuttering problem and felt the need to repeat the line 3 times before moving onto their next line - 20 minutes later. Lots of boobs and rear end action shots is probably the only thing keeping anyone interested in the movie, and even that's lacking slightly. The motivation to watch this movie is the hope that at some point some softcore porn would pop up and make it that much more interesting. The movie turned out so bad that the most captivating aspect of it was determining whether or not the women's tits were fake or real. As for the characters, I've seen children's water colour paintings show more emotion than any of them, with the exception of James Franco, who clearly looked like he knew it was too crap to act properly, and as a result made the strangest possible faces he could to compensate for the lack of proper acting throughout the entire movie. I genuinely believe that the only reason that this movie made any money was because the cast consisted of Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens, and the idea of 'ex-disney stars gone bad' seems appealing to a large group of people. I feel as though watching hardcore, sodomistic porn would be easier to explain to my parents than watching this. If I were James Franco, I'd have attempted to pay the producers to prevent this movie from being aired. As much as I admire James Franco, this was probably one of the worst decisions of his working life. I don't know how much money this movie made, but watching it for free isn't even worth your time. The only reason I'd purchase something as awful as this would be in order to provide the 4 girls with some revenue they can put towards the future therapy they'll need to get over the fact that they partook in total and utter rubbish. The actual movie can then be used as evidence to MY therapist as to why exactly I need therapy as well. To summarize, If you're looking to waste 94 minutes of your life, watch Rebecca Black's 'Friday' on repeat for an hour and a half. Your ears may bleed but you'll feel better than you will if you watch this movie.",Spring Breakers
537,marshall0694,Raunchy without a climax,6,25 June 2013,"Spring Breakers was a hard decision for me, i think they casted the right girls to play the parts without a doubt - especially for the plot. Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez were the advertising campaign for this movie and i think and they definitely did right it doing so, matching two similar roles to two qualifying personalities. The cinematography and use of sexual behaviour shows the modern perception of spring break in a completely different light and definitely makes it the film a 'raiser' for the male audience. Unfortunately the film feels like its aimed primarily at the male audience and most of the scenes seem to be there to step it up a level and show us more and more skin. Its unfortunate because the film could of been executed really well but instead, somewhere along the line they thought 'Lets make a softcore adult film that somewhat neglects the storyline and makes it seem rushed and pretentious'To me there wasn't a noticeable climax in the storyline and two of the main characters got axed out of the story early into the film with no re-introduction at the end.

So I was not looking forward to watching this movie, since a lot of my friends who had previously seen it had warned me about it being horrible. Whether it was my lowered expectations that caused me to like this movie, or the fact that it was actually a good movie, is something I can not say; however, one thing that I know for certain is that Spring Breakers is a very artistic movie. The filming is very creative and in the moments the movie lacked a little bit in activity, I found myself appreciating the art in the filming. I found every scene to be filled with interesting setting and lighting, which I truly enjoyed. I find it is a movie that you either will love, or you won't, but if you are an artistic person, and like to see things from a different perspective than others, you should definitely watch this movie. I enjoyed it, despite the nudity and violent scenes.",Spring Breakers
539,lynnbabii09,BORING... however....,5,21 June 2013,"This film is undeniably boring and highly repetitive... however... it does have an underlying message that I think people will find is the overall moral of the story.Here you have 4 girls who are bored with their lives and just want to get away from their college life and experience spring break like everyone else. This obviously includes sex, drinking, drugs, and scandal-this is the world we live in today. Young girls exploit themselves and call it ""fun""...In my personal opinion, I don't think the movie is supposed to be ""FUN""... It's whole purpose is to show us that what we believe to be fun in today's society does nothing but harm us whether it be physically, emotionally, or spiritually. You will sit and watch these girls supposedly having the time of their lives and if you understand it you should say to yourself ""This world is seriously effed up."" I have seen people review this movie and say that it is unrealistic and it lacks creativity. These are fair points but think about this: People go to jail everyday for pretty much everything you see when you watch this movie. It's creativity is not in what you see, it's in what you don't.",Spring Breakers
540,nxsquash,I Could Spit On Film And Make A Better Movie Than This,2,14 January 2014,"Articles stating that the point of this movie is to highlight the ""pointlessness"" of mainstream youth in this country is an interesting take that I didn't really think of while watching it, and be that as it may, the movie still a steaming pile of filth. I'm really surprised that James Franco took this role. The writing in this movie lacks any creativity whatsoever. The four primary characters bear more of a resemblance to ditsy bimbos in a porno than any college kids I've ever seen. To sum this up as a mirror for the milieu of youth in this country is the only redeeming factor, but KIDS was doing the same thing in 1995, and did a far better job at it. Maybe I'm missing something - I really dig Harmonie Korine and I think that he's a great writer, but I think he really dropped the ball on this one. I'm guessing he was partying along with all the other people in this movie and that his brain cells weren't up to the task of quality film production.",Spring Breakers
541,nvdnvd,Awful,1,23 June 2013,"So awful I created an account here. It's absolutely painful to watch from start to finish. The story is completely unbelievable, and to make it even worse completely uninteresting. The fact that Kids and Trainspotting come up as similar movies is just utterly irresponsible and incorrect. Those movies would be polar opposites of this.The acting may be great depending on if the four girls are actually human beings with an IQ above 40. I personally believe they are not and this was not in fact acting but these terrible people just being themselves. At best this is a ""crime"" movie for tweens or people that generally don't understand what crimes are or any clue on how to execute them. I didn't have the highest expectations going in, but from some of the good reviews I was at least expecting a half baked attempt at some grittiness.In conclusion, if you are thinking of watching this I would instead recommend softcore porn for the superior writing and soundtrack.",Spring Breakers
542,jackyl713,"4 girls go out of their way to have the best spring break ever, only to get more than they could bargain for.",5,25 June 2013,"When I first saw this movie and the summary, I thought it was going to be about these girls who come across a drug dealer and get into some trouble. Turns out, these girls are already trouble.Bored out of their minds, they decide to go out and stir up some trouble in order to have the greatest spring break ever. After blowing all their money in this way over the top party (with scenes that make this generation look worser than they already are) they end up robbing a restaurant only to be later arrested.This is where things get interesting. During a scene, where the girls are in court waiting sentencing, in the back lies Alien, a rapper whose concert the girls had went to during the evening before the robbery.At first I didn't know it was James Franco, and I'll say this, he is the best part of this movie. He is entertaining as hell, and if it wasn't for him I would've stopped watching this movie.He bails them out and offers them a deal to work with him. However, one of the girls (Selena Gomez) has had enough and wants to go home, and so she does. The girls go on several robberies, not knowing that Alien (James Franco) has a enemy. During a scene, he shoots one of the girls in the arm, and suddenly she has had enough of Spring Break. (Yeah, it took a bullet to the arm for that. Get real.) So the girl with the pink hair leaves.This leaves Vanessa Hudgens (who is hot as hell in this movie) and this other girl. They become very intimate with Alien (especially in this scene where they take their guns and put them in his mouth, where he begins to simulate oral sex. Too bad Vanessa ain't a Tgirl) It all comes out to an end, where Alien and his two girls go out to finish off the gangsta. Shockingly, Alien is killed immediately, leaving the girls by themselves. Without so much as breaking a sweat, they kill the guards, and the gangsta. (I don't know if they killed the two hot women making out in the shower-I hope they didn't...) The last scene shows them riding off in the gangsta's car.All in all, if it wasn't for the gratuitous scenes of excessive pot smoking, alcohol drinking, and girls going wild, this movie wouldn't be so bad.There is a somewhat touching scene where Alien (James Franco) plays Britney Spears' ""Everytime"" on the piano, and him and the girls sing. The scene is partially ruined due to the montage of robberies shown during the song playing, but other than that. James Franco is the best part of this movie, and if you like him, and you don't mind seeing teens acting insane...well, go and watch. There is something like human somewhere in there...",Spring Breakers

Then they put a white guy acting super ""hood"" like the stereotypical Black guy, and then they take him and the girls to his ""hood"" where there is only black guys as if enforcing the stereotype. The only Black people in the film had to be under the Black stereotype.I also love the fact that Selena Gomez's character was not uncomfortable being around a bunch of white drunk/ drugged up sexist men, but as soon as she is around the Black people she feels uncomfortable.This movie is horrible.

544,fishinginmd,The Doom Generation for this Generation! Just Awuful!,1,26 June 2013,"I give it an F for failure. Truly pitiful. Almost as pitiful as this review - ""Its more then just spring break, its our chance to see something different."" Four college friends are determined to make it to Florida for spring break this year. After saving up for many months they are still short cash for the trip. When one of them comes up with an idea to make money in an illegal way they decide that is the only way, this decision begins to change the girls way of thinking and when they meet Alien (Franco) things get even more out of control. Some can handle it and some can't. I have to start off by saying that this movie is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a movie called Spring Breakers. Lots of drug use, drinking and nudity. For a movie like this to have the cast it does makes the movie more intriguing to see (for me anyway) and they all do a good job in it that you forget who you are watching. The movie started off pretty exciting, the middle really drug but the ending makes you glad you stuck with it. This is by no means amazing or something to rush out and see, but it is a movie that has enough excitement in it to keep you watching and makes you glad you finished it. Overall, nothing too original but worth watching if you can handle it. I give it a B-. Dude, lay off the bong!",Spring Breakers

546,lara-younes,Absolute disappointment!,4,26 June 2013,"I can't believe I wasted an hour and a half of my time to watch this movie! I find it absolutely useless. Up until the first half, I was still wondering why it has ever been made. And, what's even more disappointing to me is why Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson and Vanessa Hudgens ever considered taking part in such a film. I mean, little girls who watch Disney/Pretty Little Liars would be obsessed with these girls and would think of them as role models and would have most probably been waiting forever to see this movie, only to find out they can't do so due to it being rated 18+. However, let's assume that a random little girl got access to this movie and watched it, what would she learn? Would Selena, Ashley and Vanessa be role models then? Or will they be participating in the diffusion of bad habits and in spreading bad influence among young teenage girls? It's sad to know that actresses nowadays would go this far just for the sake of getting some cash in. Also, I still can't help but think about the purpose behind this movie. At some point, I felt like I had intellectual problems because I couldn't understand the moral of this film; let along the purpose of it, but after seeing every single person who was watching it with me either fall asleep, or have no idea what was going on as well, I was relieved. But then, I was stupid enough to even reconsider watching it again so that I could at least find one little detail that made this movie a worthy one, and I happily decided NOT to do that to myself again. So I guess we really shouldn't judge a book by its cover, because what seems to be a great movie on the outside, with a well-known cast and big names, turned out to be an utter disappointment.-Sincerely, a girl who used to spend hours watching Disney channel and looking up to those young actresses.",Spring Breakers
547,saralr1221-724-477028,T and A,1,28 June 2013,This is an awful movie. It has no plot and is 50% women in bikinis or topless shaking their boobs and asses. It's almost like a horribly long awful music video. The woman have no personalities and are hyper sexualized. The film is shot in a disgusting creepy voyeuristic style. The film makers should have been honest with themselves and shot a straight forward porn. At least then they wouldn't have mislead people and tricked them into thinking they were watching a real movie. At several points I thought it was like film version of Girls Gone Wild but with less dialog and more bad music.I think this could have been a great film if it had a plot and wasn't so focused on the female cast members bodies. I had high hopes because the leads were all women but I was disappointed. Also some of the dialog was just ridiculous. Women do not say stupid things like 'it makes my pussy wet'. The word 'pussy' was used so much I was actually wondering why all the women were talking like they starring in a porn. I felt like I was trapped in a frat boy's wet dream.

The film is so bad that they have to keep repeating previous scenes, and you end up thinking some cast members have stutters as they have to repeat one line at least three times. It is so bad Selena Gomez legs it after half an hour or so, after this movie, none of the cast will ever star in another movie.

I think it has exaggerated some details, like certain scenes in movies. However this type of film is being used too much what has not funny and it gets tiring, it is always the same in all of them.

His films are really , 'out there' they're weird . but interesting & good at the same time .

This movie is like the worst movie i've ever watched my entire life. it is not even a comedy or drama like IMDb says. It is a 90 minute of absolute crap, some stupid dub-step music playing, tits, butts, some guys jerking off so if you wanna enlist this under porn movies genre go ahead, but it's gonna terribly suck on that too.Now let's cut the swearing and get to the storytelling (no worries, there are no spoilers up ahead) our director here did his best to spoil every moment of the movie for you with that stupid, unnecessary flashbacks and fast-forwarding every now and then. He even spoiled the ending for me at almost half of the movie. The writing is completely terrible, you can watch Selena Gomez calling her Grandma 3 times on the movie saying the same exact words!!! with a few words changing every time. Seriously?! are you out of words to repeat every damn sentence over and over? So what's left I've not talked about? Aha! the acting.

There is no significant plot line and the acting is poor, except for James Franco (his acting is good, but his character is intolerable). By the end of the movie, I only remembered two of the characters names. Twenty minutes into the movie I asked my friends when they thought the story line would begin. To this point, it is just college kids drinking and doing drugs without any character development. After an hour, I again asked the same question. At this point it was still just college kids drinking and doing drugs, but now they were yielding guns. There were a few glimpses of hope for the story line to develop, but nothing ever came of it.

With a budget of 5 million dollars, this movie did so much more. Spring Breakers was so deep, but it's rare for people to even care or notice symbols anymore in films.

566,Emmyk09,Real Evil or Real Big Amounts of Drugs?,9,16 July 2013,"When I saw Spring Breakers in theaters , it was me and my friend in the theater with several other elderly people. One of the women had a grand daughter who worked on the film and wanted to show her friends the work. By the end of the film they were talking to the woman on how their granddaughter could work on that piece of trash. I on the other hand loved the movie! I knew what I was getting as a Harmony Korine fan; a gritty masterpiece filled with home stretched truths about spring break! The four(well three) central characters of the movie are Faith , Candy , Brit and my personal favorite Cotty. Each girl is selfish in their own way and act like an actual... young adults who need to be selfish in order to find themselves. Faith (Selena Gomez) who I am iffy if I want to count as a central character leaves the plot line too early in my opinion, she should have stayed another ten minutes possibly after she points a gun at someones head, she could have been the star of the movie if she hadn't left earlier into the movie. Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) is the lesser of two evils in my opinion and it worked well to see her as a bad girl who follows along with anything to have a more riveting Spring Break with her best friends. Still that doesn't mean that she isn't a snake in the grass because I believe the ending proves that. Brit(Ashley Benson) is the more of the two evils between the two girls because she seems to be more of a planner than her partner in crime. Seen with a tequila gun earlier in the movie is a foreshadowing of how ruthless she could possibly be.Finally Cotty (Rachel Korine)is my personal favorite because she is an entire plot within herself. She is a hurricane of low self-esteem and need to have male attention to feel wanted. Cotty is outlasted more than Faith because of her low moral value. Though she does get shot making her see the danger she is in , she is still the star out of the four girls because she has a plot that is tragic because you know that this girl might not go anywhere that her face and body cant get her too.James Franco is the only male character who stood out since he really was the only constant male in the movie. Everything from the corn-rose to the love of Britney Spears is hilarious and makes you want more than you are given! This movie is great because of the characters and how they are developed and despite the lights and naked breasts surrounding the screen this is a great movie with a cast that just takes the movie to the next level.",Spring Breakers
567,johnbown6,"Good movie, great presentation",9,16 July 2013,"This movie is really hard for closed minded people to enjoy. It's a movie that one has to analyze to understand. In order to enjoy this movie, you have to really look into everything that's going on (how the characters are feeling, how they got where they are, and what they did to get there). It's a movie that portrays the sin that runs rampant in many American's lives. The four girls (Brit, Candy, Cotty, and Faith) venture off to find something more exciting than their simple dorm life at college. They need money in order to do this, and they start by doing simple crimes, and they only escalate from there. As the movie progresses, the complete lack of conscience begins to be seen. Evil completely takes over the girls and it is seen how easily money can change people. The situations that they're in towards the end of the movie, and the dark tone that director Harmony Korine conveys creates a picture in our mind of the way that some Americans act, and how far they will go for money and fame. Once they're in that hole, it is hard to get out, and instead of trying, as Faith (Selena Gomez) did, the girls continue their evil acts in their hunger for money. Overall, this movie was very good. Props to Korine",Spring Breakers
568,gallagherbailey,Worse Movie,1,18 July 2013,"This has got to be the worse movie Hollywood has produced. It has very famous actors which may have been the only reason for it's success. It does not have a plot or any twists in the movie it was poorly narrated and directed. And to see Selena and Vanessa doing stuff like that makes me sick to think what has happened to once innocent Disney girls. The drugs, sex and violence which the are involved in only makes me think that's what they want to be portrayed as. Those scenes make me lose profound respect for the girls in the movie as i thought they were nice and respectful women who were role models. Furthermore, i find that this movie is not worth watching as it is pointless and a waste of 90 minutes and that when you watch it you will understand the futility of this poorly directed film",Spring Breakers

The movie is supposed to be a satire about the stupidity of each American generation. This movie was edited and directed to perfection to portray this. People complaining about acting? No plot? Really? Did they watch the movie I did? Maybe they have sh*t for brains, because this wasn't about acting, action, or pornographic content.There is PLENTY of proof that common folk won't understand, such as the repetition of ""spring break forever"", or how the smart ones realize they're not stupid and leave first. Even when they're explaining that spring break is where ""they will find themselves"" while f**king doing drugs, killing people, and having sex.Or the scene where they keep complaining ""OMG WE NO HAVE MONEY FOR SPRING BREAK, SAME ROOMS, SAME SCHOOL OMG, REAL LIFE SUCKS, IM SUFFERING SO MUCH, POOOOOOOR MEEEEEE! ... ... ...Bitches let's rob a restaurant and go spring break FOREEVER!""Great movie showing dumb ass thinking from a dumb ass country.",Spring Breakers

The only reason for this was because I knew exactly what I was in for. A lot of people thought it was going to be a deep, meaningful movie with a complex plot that comments on today's society. These people were wrong! Spring breakers is a true black and white film that shows what can happen on spring break. It was very visually interesting and the violence and sexuality was extremely prominent, but what else can you expect from a spring break movie. There will obviously be sex and drugs. The acting was decent and the plot was not the greatest, but it was still a great movie. Anybody who saw this movie for the cast or to discover the hidden meanings behind it were disappointed because that's not what this movie was made for. Yes this movie has some big names, but if that's all you saw this movie for or all you will see this movie for you will hate it! You have to know what to expect when seeing a movie and you can't always expect perfection (you can't expect Lord of the Rings from a movie like Napoleon Dynamite!) Spring Breakers was not perfect, but it was a damn good movie! So just keep in mind that this isn't for everyone and keep an open mind while watching it and you'll probably like it too.",Spring Breakers

Other than a couple shots of the Sunshine Skyway bridge though, the scenery was mostly just standard generic Florida. The movie? It was horrible. Were they handing out the bad Acid when this was being written & directed? I wasn't expecting much from a movie entitle ""Spring Breakers"", but this movie fell short of those already low standards. Or maybe the director just wanted an excuse to hang out with Selena on the beach for a few weeks?Conclusion: Rent from Redbox for a $1 if you live in the Tampa Bay area.",Spring Breakers

Then I thought there would be a point to this story so I stayed. Wrong. There was no theme, and a meaningless plot. I'm also into movie with action and conflict. This was weird conflict and the script was also weird. The characters were extremely annoying. I was annoyed. When the movie ended I ran out.

This movie has no plot and makes no sense and is completely stupid beyond belief!!! We only sat through it because we were somewhat curious of how this tragedy of a movie would end up and it was somewhat comical in that it was so stupid and we were like wow, who would make a movie this stupid. We also wondered how it got past any screening person. Now that I think of it, maybe the reviewers were all high or something. The acting and the screenplay was completely terrible as well and completely unbelievable.

Not only was the plot ridiculously STUPID, but the way the movie was filmed with so many of the same scenes made me quickly frustrated. They just kept playing the same scenes over and over. I was so happy to see that Selena Gomez was smart enough to play a decent character and not be in the entire movie. Vanessa Hudgens is a horrible actress and not even a three way with James Franco can excuse this girls pathetic attempt to be an adult. This movie should be burned. Horrible acting, directing, plot.

In real life, who acts like that??!! I've been to many spring breaks and its nothing like that unless you're a drug whore and completely insane. And even if none of that stuff bothers you, there was no story..just dirty girls living in what looks like a crack house that changes burnt out light bulbs with only fluorescent colors.

There was a lot of repetition in the character's lines, which became annoying. The movie became so much longer than necessary. It made this generation appear crazy if it even gave any insight to the generation at all. What drew me into the movie originally were the actresses & how well known they are for previous roles which makes the movie seem appealing. It made their acting look crappy because of how bad the movie was. The only reason I fully watched the movie was to see if anything came together or there was some form of redemption but there wasn't & it left you still confused. How anyone considers this a good movie is beyond me & a 4/10 is a generous rating.",Spring Breakers

It's one of those movies you regret you wasted time watching it. In my opinion the director attempt to make a very indie movie and the result is- well it's pretty awful. I didn't enjoy the film -at all-, that is based on images and the little scrip is only the actors voices in off. One of the worst things was that the sing Britney not to mentioned Alien singing or the girls and there costumes. Anyway I could write every little fail but the fact is that this film is the worst I've ever seen.

I understand how someone could come up with the idea, but they had to be high on drugs to think it was a good idea. My theory on why the director didn't break down in the middle of production and realize the whole movie was idiotic? He must have been constantly on drugs. I'm not just saying that. This is the kind of movie that people talk about when they are stoned. Saying how deep and profound all the layers are. ""It's all like wow! They like go there for spring break, but it's like they like become gangsters! Like wow!"" I think there some some kind of attempt to make parallels between the hedonism of the partying college kids and the nihilism of the gangster lifestyle (wow, like so deep).

It's making fun of it in a dark and twisted way that is supposed to leave you feeling uncomfortable and probably even sad. The girls are basically partying for the entire film but regardless of the fun they should be having, it feels wrong and empty. You probably felt kind of disappointed by the movie, which is how it should be. You actually feel what the characters are feeling. Searching for your identity at Spring Break is basically the saddest joke. And the whole idea is so brilliant.This movie takes you on the journey of 4 girls stuck in a generation that warps their thoughts and hearts. The line between right and wrong fades in order to get what they think they want. They don't know what they love, they don't know what makes them happy, and they don't care what happens to them in order to figure it out. They don't figure it out. and unfortunately, and beautifully... that's the point of the movie.also brilliantly throwing in Brit Spears jams. Brilliant.

581,schulzenatalie,"I seriously question the moral character of anyone who could like this ""film""",1,5 August 2013,"This whole 'movie' more closely related a teenager's wet dream than anything else. I was thoroughly disgusted and uncomfortable throughout the entire movie. Really, if I wanted to watch 'girls gone wild' I would have just rented that, not this sorry piece of crap trying to be a real movie.First, the same party scenes are shown over and over and over and over...WE GET IT. I got it after the first scene and to be senselessly reminded of it repeatedly just got to the point where I wanted to punch someone in the face. Keep in mind the only reason I watched this movie to the end was because a friend told me it was good, a friend whose opinion I will never truly trust again. It was a infuriating barrage of drugs, breasts, drugs, beer, slo mo dancing, more breasts, drugs, more beer, more breasts. Cut all that crap out and the movie would have been 10 minutes long.Second, the plot was so completely unrealistic and slow moving it's a stretch to even refer to it as a 'plot'. These girls are able to afford a trip to spring break after robbing a restaurant for money (no consequences), which they could have probably afforded if they didn't do drugs while in college (consequences, what are those?), get to Florida where they proceed to do more drugs and act like idiots, one even goes to a party alone where a bunch of guys are there who get her messed up and somehow she doesn't get raped? (again, no consequences). They do end up getting arrested but only get a slap on the wrist and told to pay a fine.What?!? they stole the first bunch of money, how will they get more? Oh right, because a money hungry gangster drug dealer just happens to be at their judgement and bails them out, then just decides to accept them into his life while another long scene ensues of him showing them all his guns and money (and his bricks of drugs stamped with his logo - I'm sure no one has connected those dots). Cue cut scenes of random violence, more nudity and more drugs, then skip to the end where the 2 girls that didn't go home somehow become professional hit men and take out an entire armed squad of rival gangsters without so much as a scratch and then drive away into the sunset in the bright orange Lamborghini that NO ONE would ever recognize as a stolen vehicle.The entire movie was cheesy, senseless, disgusting and in no way artistic except for some well placed camera work here and there.

The only thing that killed it for me was watching two bimbos take down Archie's whole squad without having to reload. Aside from that seeing the Disney girls go wild in my home state of Florida was a huge bonus to me. Boy do I love the innocent presence that Selena brought to the film.

Setting aside the eye-fest of 20 year old bikini clad honeys, you'll find the eye-opening seedy underworld of St. Pete, Florida driven by lust for money and sex portrayed masterfully by James Franco. A viable balance of the struggle between bad-girl vs. Christian girl is played out beautifully by gorgeous newcomer Selena Gomez, who as it turns out, truly knows how to act.The reason for only 9 stars is the futile attempts of Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson to portray small town criminals.

Nonetheless I found myself to be left jaw dropped to see how young talented actors are so willing to play the tacky card in order to be seen as adults in the industry. OK! We get that you are no longer looking for Disney to sign your checks but come on! A little class should always be taken into consideration when choosing a transition role in one's career. This review is not an attack on anyone who was casted. It was just an eye opener that is all. I still enjoy seeing these actors at their best but a movie like this did no justice for them.

If you watched or are going to watch this movie to see t!ts and a$$, you'll enjoy the first half. But you're gonna kinda be disappointed with what comes after. The movie evolves from a brainless flick about girls going on spring break to bringing out a message about the sickness of youth's society.The amount of bad ratings surprises me, especially the reviews saying that this film has no depth or plot. It definitely says something about the struggling youth in school and how desperate they are, their naïveté, and the sick b@stards who are running the slums and picking off girls.I thought the screenplay was great. The repetition of scenes and dialogue really drives in the themes of the film in. ""Spring Break Forever"" because none of them want it to end. The acting from the girls was pretty mediocre, though I thought Selena Gomez's depiction of the reluctant good girl was alright. But James Franco performed amazingly. He was so creepy and dirty and self obsessed in a way you'd expect his character to be, but he let some humanity show through which made him more real and just nasty.I thought this was a good movie and it doesn't deserve the hate it is receiving.

Admittedly, the first 20 minutes I questioned why I was watching the film, because the characters at this point slightly irritated me and where I'd read reviews I think I was looking for loopholes etc. The start was just boobs everywhere which irritated me. However, later scenes (although still graphic in content, still had some relevance to the characters themselves, and showing Faith talking on the phone to parents while the shots of the other girls were rather more of a slutty drug using style, showed the innocence of this character. I think it was a shame that they took her out so early in the film after jail. I feel the film peaked once they had been arrested and they spent their time with Alien.. It was bizarre but definitely more interesting. Unfortunately, the end was a bit unrealistic (but I feel that the whole of it was not really meant to be so) - just cos two girls who have only just started shooting in comparison to members of gangs who have done it for far longer, probably unable to take that many guys (also, the time when the girls shot were often not entirely synced with the person being shot which amused me).. But despite it's ridiculous number of flaws, I enjoyed it.. & don't think it should be discredited as much as the many reviews on here.Also, a number of people are hating on the style in which it used lots of florescence, but I feel it put toward the film rather than taking away.

The Spring Break at all is shown for about 15 - 20 minutes and isn't really genuine, only naked breasts doesn't occupy the image at all.

592,hlindemuth,"Sold Short, Near Perfection.",10,21 September 2013,"You knew it was an R rated movie about spring break before you started watching Spring Breakers, didn't you?I'd say that I don't understand all the negative backlash surrounding this film, but I definitely do. There are a good amount of sex/drugs/violence related activities that are off-putting to many. I understand how the shock of seeing these scenes could turn off a person who is easily offended. However, it isn't as if this comes as a surprise to the viewer, the movie was promoted this way and you can surmise that Spring Breakers will have these sort of things simply from seeing a poster for the film. For that reason, I don't consider the complaints that people have made stating that sex/drugs/violence ruined this film for them to be valid. Now that I've addressed why Spring Breakers is rated so lowly, I'd like to tell you why this has been my favorite film of 2013. Firstly, the acting is absolutely perfect, and this is the best performance I've ever seen from James Franco. His portrayal of the character ""Alien"" is equally true to life and chilling. The leading ladies of Spring Breakers were all pleasant surprises as well. While Selena Gomez, Rachel Korine, and Vanessa Hudgens all gave very solid performances, I think that special accolades should be given to Ashley Benson whose portrayal of ""Brit"" was definitely a stand out performance. Even Gucci Mane was very believable, although it could be argued easily that he was just playing himself.Secondly, the partying scenes and prominent usage of the soundtrack that everyone complains about are absolutely essential for setting the backdrop for the story. The scenes feature real spring breakers and gives a very authentic feel to the girls' spring break location. Yes, they are graphic and could offend someone who is somehow not expecting nudity upon seeing the trailer, but there's a certain reality that is offered by those scenes that you just can't get from actors. Also, while others will complain about the soundtrack, it makes a good deal of sense to play party music during the party scenes and gangster music when the cast is engaging in illegal activity. It should also be noted that the score has a very haunting quality to it, and there are a few oddly placed ballads lending the same quality.Thirdly, Spring Breakers features many flashbacks and foreshadowing during the scene changes, which I think serves beautifully to help the viewer both tie together things that seemed insignificant earlier and keep the viewer in a captive state of wonder as he/she anticipates when the momentary glimpse of the future just seen will come into play later. This style of scene change is especially fitting to the film because at many times, as the title lends, the characters are in hazy states and this style emphasizes that for the audience.Spring Breakers is highly entertaining, well made, and has the incredible ability to evoke emotion. What more could a person want in a movie?",Spring Breakers

The content of the movie would probably last about 30 minutes if they didn't do all the weird annoying cinematography in between every scene.

Is bold enough to move outside the epidemic of boring and predictable plots flooding Hollywood.I admit watching Selena Gomez staring into a camera and images of people shotgun beers didn't captivate me immediately. But it's all part of a greater whole; as the story progresses things develop and you meet James Francos character who is brilliantly done and you begin to see what this movie is really about.This movie takes a mirror and reflects it on a small percentage of the MTV generation. The people who were raised by rap videos and violent video games. Those who grew up with getting what they want and where overindulgence and excess was the norm. The ones who could never live a normal life, thinking they'd all grow up to be millionaires and movie stars.If you want something that meets the formula for a cliché blockbuster hit steer well clear of this one.

595,djgrantrichards,That bad I had to join & give a bad review of it to warn others,2,18 November 2013,"This film actually wound me up so much that I had to write about it. I've never posted on here before and only on Lovefilm a few times, admittedly when writing about bad films and when I mean bad, I mean really bad. Give me a bad B-Movie a la Sharknado and I can lap it up, as it's supposed to be bad. When something is trying to ooze cool and hoodwink potential viewers in to the fact this film could be awesome, then I guess in this instance, I've had to take my very small stand against weak movies.I'm going to work on the Sh1t Sandwich principal here. So I'm starting with some good. There is a lot of nice cinematography in this movie. Some real rich shots, but a few sexy shots do not maketh a movie.Let's get onto the filling now and it's a sour tasting, out of date by a few months filling. There really is zero story. Oooh we're 4 frustrated girls who wanna leave town and celebrate Spring Break somewhere awesome, and then we bump into a dodgy geezer. There's your story. I've saved you the 93 minutes of your life, right there. But I shall continue, just in case all that flesh in the trailer might lure you in, still. James Franco's character is really, really annoying. Not scary and edgy, just really annoying. Of course with cinema, we can suspend belief, but this isn't Inception, the filmmaker is suggesting the things that take place in the movie really happen. They don't. Just so many implausible and pointless circumstances, that I won't go into, not because I don't want to give you more spoilers, more that I do need to limit how much more time I waste on this drivel.Now to top off our sh1t sandwich.

596,Darryl-learie,It's like an infomercial from hell - life is too precious to waste watching this,1,10 December 2013,"This movie was a disturbingly sad career choice for Disney stars Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgeson - It's as if they decided to throw away any good values and integrity as a result of their long maintained good clean fun Disney image. By doing this movie they basically flushed everything good they stood for down the toilette - it was disturbing , akin to the Catholic Pope deciding what the hell I'll do a raunchy porn movie. Aside from all the above, the movie flowed like a infomercial from hell, every few minutes replayed the same dialogue like a song chorus to techno beats - like watching a cheap music video stuck on replay.Or like a really bad acid trip.I made an account just to warn people about how truly awful this movie is.What you won't find in this movie;Any character actually evolving A point, a moral to the story, Interesting and fascinating characters",Spring Breakers

For people who truly love the art of film will appreciate this movie. Of course there are beautiful young girls on a spring break adventure. I honestly thought this film was going to be a goofy comedy that resembled that of a ""National Lampoons: Blah, Blah, Blah"" production, but I was surprisingly shocked by the end of the film. Good work all around. The directing of Spring Breakers was the most notable part of the film via my eyes.

There was absolutely no plot and the ""climatic"" part of the movie lasted for about 30 seconds, was entirely in slow-mo, and was not climatic in any way shape or form. My 6 year old brother writes better stories than the writer of this film. About 95 percent of this movie made absolutely no sense and did not correlate with anything resembling a plot. The character development is so terrible that the only person's name that I can remember is Alien and that is only because I remember reading it in the description.Do not waste your time.

599,olioose,"An illumination of our current cultural climate, but a failure to deal with these issues.",3,19 December 2013,"If you are approaching this film expecting an experience following the principles of naturalism and realism, you'd pick up on the plot and character flaws almost straight away and perhaps miss the more artistic techniques . But for me this film felt like an artistic attempt at pointing out the obvious and being quite boring in its doing so. I appreciate that the film aims to identify and expose the consumerist and media-fuelled world that we now live in, especially for its target audience, which I took to be young adults around the age of college (Uni) study. For example, Alien's repetition of the words 'spring-break (forever)' reflects the repetition of marketing slogans and advertisements that attempt to persuade us that whatever being sold is amazing and perfect. Director Harmony Korine also highlights the disenchantment of sex and the loss of sexual privacy; it is continually associated with money in this film, as are most things, but it's also performed in public (swimming pool), illustrating its cheap value and common practice in modern youth culture and media.My issue with the film is that it not only makes an obvious point, but makes it for the ENTIRE film, with its multiple cut-away montages that feel like they're filler and repeated dialogue and film shots. What's worse is it just presents the problem; it fails to offer any form of solution or analytical insight. For many things I think that is absolutely fine; I come from a theatre background and post-modern performance largely involves presenting questions, not providing answers. With a topic as superficial as consumerism, which effects everybody in varying degrees, it is not enough to just be presented it in a quite abstract way. We are all aware that it exists. I think the film tries to create a fresh perspective towards it; a reminder to the audience of what they're bombarded with every day. Although not essential in certain works, there was absolutely no character context or progression, with the exception of faith who we're told is religious. And has a Nan. That's about it. None leave for home with any personal excuse; its simply that something has happened that they didn't like. Being arrested and getting shot. We were given information about Alien, but to me he didn't feel like he should have been a focus; he allowed the girls to become manipulative and morally corrupt. I say 'become' very liberally here, as there's no evidence that the girl's personalities weren't like that from the beginning. Which arguably they very much were, seeing as they robbed a restaurant to go on 'Spring-Break'. They're seemingly fluctuating morality and personalities makes it difficult to pin down any characterisation at any one time, and certainly nothing is concluded or resolved by the end, other than the fact the last 2 girls have suddenly gained mad gun-skills and an insatiable blood-lust. I love that the director's wife played Cotty; for me, this illuminates the fact that they literally could have got ANYBODY to play these parts; as long as they had an objectively nice body, of course. Because how could you possibly make a comment on culture with ugly women? I suppose its fortunate that the use of many objectively attractive scantily-clad women are used, otherwise half of the movies audience wouldn't have been around. Let's face it, if men see a film with an attractive girl in, they're more likely to go and see it. This is one of the huge principles that the film tries to address but instead, in my opinion, promotes. I realise I've commented that naturalism doesn't play a part in this film, but with the notion of Spring-Break being a real event that not every American partakes in, I find it difficult to believe crime would be an adequate choice to fund the holiday. I think the worst part about the film is the over-emphasis. Again it could be justified by the repetitive nature of consumerism and bombarding an idea into somebody's head, but in the end it feels like we (as an audience) are being treated as stupid. There are SO many scenes in which money is tossed in the air; we get it, MONEY EXISTS AND ITS A FOCAL POINT OF THIS FILM. I think this filmed could have been an hour shorter and just been just as effective (or not, as the case may be). For example, when we're first introduced to Alien's old friend and rival dealer, 'Big Arch', in the club scene, they spend an eternity looking at each other and flipping through the past with montage. I felt this length was totally unnecessary, as well as adding nothing to the plot. Well, except hammering home the fact they used to be friends. Crucial.I think the film demonstrates a sexist attitude in an attempted satirical style, but instead the script, characters and narrative aren't clever enough to make this point clear. If the film is meant to be sarcastic, it didn't make enough of it to be effective. The objectification of the female image is a huge issue at the moment globally, and Korine does not make enough of an effort to address this. Finally, a word to all the people defending this film because of the Director's 'style'; this is not enough of a justification for a badly made film. In fact, when working with a unique and original style, it's even more important to retain consistency and people's attention. A film doesn't have to be epic, it has to be interesting. Unless the point is that it's supposed to be uninteresting. Which Spring-Breakers largely is, but without meaning to.",Spring Breakers

Literally nothing happens and there is no purpose to any actions made. From an artistic point of view I can see how this can be portrayed as a visually beautiful film, that is only the shell that has certainly not been filled. All I can say about this film is that there is a unneeded amount of pointless montages of things no one cares about and boobs. That is the film. I have literally summed up and spoiled the movie just with that. The trailer offers a fast paced exciting film full of content and incredible performance from James Franco.

I mean there are ways to invent that 2 girls can shoot up 10-15 guys, but not the way the were holding the guns, without even reloading once (considering they already both shot 2/3th of their magazine on the first enemy).However I still gave it a 5/10 because, however the script isn't very strong, I must admit that the actors themselves did a more than decent job.

To anybody who doesn't want to watch a film that will leave them thinking, it's an entertaining film anyway. The actual style of the film itself shows that it's trying to do something else, Harmony Karine sets an atmosphere where the same phrases are repeated several times ""Spring Break, Spring Break Forever"" and of silence, to make it almost awkward really emphasizing how crazy the whole idea of spring break is.

You would expect some wild behaviour, but they are also intelligent, more so than in most films that would portray pretty girls as stupid and/or weak. The teenage characters are believable, and that makes for more powerful drama. The wildness is not the typical comedic Hollywood fare, there is a darker edge.

The world of appearances against the world of ideas. Truth vs lie. Preferring to live in the largest and most disgusting lie instead of the bittersweet life. A gin tonic that exudes eroticism and engages the eye to enjoy for an hour and a half of unbridled ecstasy and which doubts and certainly calls the viewer into question: maybe you are not always supposed to choose the right path.Furthermore, fashion actresses, a superb James Franco, dance music, drugs and partying star in a particular play which, far from looking like a rehash, proudly overlooks the wild originality.

I created this account purely to warn the rest of the universe not to bother with this atrocity. At no point in this film did I stop and think ""Hey, this isn't that bad"" because it was the absolute opposite. I would genuinely rather watch my relatives have an orgy in a bathtub full of pureed zucchini than ever lay eyes on this film again. The scene where the teenage girls rob the fast food store with plastic guns and sledgehammers is ridiculous as any grown human within that establishment would have wiped the floors with their wigs instead of handing over money and wallets. Their further reinforcement of their great achievement is one of the early signs of repetition that will make you want body slam a floor full of Lego. The acting and lack thereof was completely atrocious and unrealistic. Rachel Korine's sandals in the promotional poster were almost enough to convince me not to watch this film. A friend (as a joke) suggested that we should watch it and absorb the wonderful acting, plot, and directing. I celebrated when Korine was shot and was no longer present within the film. Selena Gomez did herself a favor and exited while the opportunity was there, but I thoroughly enjoyed when she encouraged her grandmother to join her in sleeping with strangers, snorting cocaine off of fat people and drinking more alcohol than her geriatric liver could probably handle. Shall I even continue onto James Franco's character? Apparently he only took the role for his friend, the directer which was a poor decision. His transformation made him look like a Caucasian Snoop Dogg recently defecated from the rectum of Vanilla Ice. His accent made me want to funnel warm fecal matter into my eyes. If I ever hear the phrase ""Sprang Break Fa-Eva"" one more time, so help me God, I will burn everything in my sight. His boasting of possessions such as Calvin Klein Escape (which literally smells like rectal leakage) in conjunction with seductively sucking on a gun silencer was probably the most cringe-worthy part of the entire film (paedophilic orgy in the pool aside). His rendition of Britney Spears' Every time was almost the breaking point and is up there with the top five most painful scenes that I have ever endured in a film. His accomplices, the twin males, were a completely unnecessary addition to the already flaming pile of horse excrement that is this film. The final confrontation (if you can even call it that) between Gucci Mane and Alien was short lived as Alien was killed almost instantaneously. The two remaining adolescent females with zero arms experience manage to miraculously murder an entire house full of gangsters without even reloading. To call the film as a whole garbage is a compliment. The soundtrack was mediocre at best and the repetition of redundant scenes from the beginning of the film (which weren't even necessary the first time round) was a poor decision.

Many people contend that it exploits the young actresses, or that it is hedonistic, or that it buckles under its own depictions of exploitation and hedonism. A smaller number of reviewers are experiencing Spring Breakers as a satire about Spring Break, and are attacking others who do not feel that way about it. Spring Breakers is on thin ice with people, no pun intended, who are determined to have it parrot their own deal.Whereas the director has made other movies like this, where he takes a taboo and he films it in a non-judgmental way. In Spring Breakers, there is a scene where gangster Alien and sex bandit girlfriends sing a very pretty Britney Spears song together over a baby grand piano. In another of his movies, Trash Humpers, there's a scene where someone gives a blowjob to a willow tree. Gummo features a child whose face looks like a container. There are things we are freely disgusted with in the world of today. Spring Breakers is a movie about eight or nine of those things, so it might make you feel aggressive. I don't think Spring Breakers shares these feelings though. If Spring Breakers exploits anything, it is probably its own judgementlessness. Furthermore, I don't think a lot of these reviewers have fully pictured what the movie would be like if it were more like what they want. Best case scenario it would be a 94 minute still frame with instructions on where to rent a different movie. Would the better movie have cautionary payback time at the end like in Requiem for a Dream, lest we find out that the director thinks the wrong stuff?

Great acting all the way around and Korine's wife even plays a big part i the movie.

622,goalegal,Just awful...,1,20 August 2016,"What a craptacular waste of time. This movie is made by a man-child who wishes he was still in college/on spring break. It's nothing more than an explicit, extended MTV music video made for horny little boys to catch glimpse of some boobies..though they'd be better off with a ""girls gone wild"" video because at least they wouldn't have to suffer through the monotonous pretense of a plot line in between the topless scenes. Oh and **spoiler alert!** the only one of the main starlets who takes her top off (the directors wife) doesn't have anything that great to look at. This is not profound or thought provoking. This is not art. This is not even entertaining (unless you're 13 and have never seen boobs before). This is a sad, exploitation of young girls who were convinced to do something stupid and ultimately bad for their acting careers. The only actor who was decent in this movie was Franco. But still, just don't waste your time with this silly, trying so hard to be a Woody Allen-esque, film.",Spring Breakers
623,antimachis,Respect!!!,8,23 August 2016,"If you don't like it, just have at least a little respect, and don't share your garbage to others, please! Because there are many films, that I don't really like or value (Action films, science fiction, animations, Terry Gillian Films, Memento, Dark Night Rising, etc, etc, etc...), but even that, and due to respect to a filmmaker and his work, I give never a vote under 5 or 6.Thats the minimum you can give if you really like movies, are decent and show respect and humanity. Even if you hate it, or this hurt your feelings or believes, its really sad to see folks giving a film a 1 or a 2. So, just think about it!Thanks!",Spring Breakers
624,businessrand,Sloooooooow...repetitive and non linear.,1,14 July 2013,"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever sat through. Let's get started:The conflict never really presents itself...after 20 minutes of whiny girls complaining about not being able to afford spring break inter-cut with shots of them lying passed out in a room, doing drug (which apparently don't cost money) you start to think...""OK the main conflict is getting to Spring Break"" No.I guess the main conflict was supposed to be a drug war between two rival gang members. Kinda of disappointing for a movie titles ""spring breakers, especially since they don't' show up until 40 minutes into the movie.There are so many loose ends and non-closing story linesFaith bows out of the movie after being creeped out by Alien. We never heard from her again. They make a big deal about robbing a diner (and how much money does a diner have on hand? Apparently enough to rent a condo, 4 scooters and transportation to Florida)The director's wife plays Cotty, who flashes boobs, has sex on screen takes a bullet in the arm, then also heads home.There is a buildup of a former friendship between the rival gang leaders. Barely addressed, and concluded when they are both shot by lackeys IN A MONTAGE sequence.Literally 70% of the movie is montage sequences, and dialog from earlier in the movie being repeated over and over, over some horrible out of date trance music. The plot is non existent. I have a feeling they too the 5 million budget and used it as an excuse to go to Florida/Italy for vacation, and for the director to get access to as many boobs as possible, and to cram his wife into a movie.Terrible terrible terrible to the last. I would watch Epic Movie 10 times before watching this again. I can't understand why it has a rating above 5...it must be a lot of people are rating this film based off of the amount of boobs that are present.",Spring Breakers
625,ljrubal,This is a joke....,1,27 January 2017,"Received a call from a friend advising, ""you gotta see this movie, it's the worst movie ever."" With that ""stunning endorsement"" I sat down and started to stream the movie. This movie is so bad you have to watch the entire film to believe a movie can actually be this bad. The story is ridiculous, the ending is just, what word am I looking for, ""dumb."" The only redeeming quality is a few ""boobie scenes."" How does Hollywood invest money in crap like this? I don't know if this is the worst movie ever made because I haven't viewed all movies but I'll bet dollars to donuts it's in the top 3 worst of all time. Don't waste your time or money on this so called ""film."" James Franco performance is just as bad as his teeth in this movie.",Spring Breakers
626,kelly-69739,Indulgent.,1,8 December 2019,"It seemed to have good ingredients: sex, drugs, some level of artistic cinematography, but watching it from start to finish felt mostly like torture after the first few minutes. Almost zero character development, no plot to follow, no variety of content. It felt at times like I was watching an hour and a half long music video caught in a loop with a monotonous voiceover. It was mostly a series of clips of people partying and girls doing bad things in slow motion. The same clips over and over, the same few lines over and over. I was bored.",Spring Breakers
627,yasa-27889,Watch if you want to waste an hour of your life.,1,9 April 2017,"This movie is the worst movie, I have watched! For every other awful movie, I have watched, after a while it seems pretty good, but this is just crap, there is no character development on the female characters and some on the male character (alien). Its just full of naked people dancing on the beach and getting splashed with booze; going to house parties and taking cocaine. There is constant repetition of lines, they probably ran out of things to say. It is a waste of my hour! There is no plot to this movie, it's just stuck together like crap!",Spring Breakers
628,haaselperro,Spring-breakers Review,6,27 December 2019,"Very creative stunning shots. Watching the violence and crime scenes mixed in with the spring break experience, brought back that sense of shock I felt as a kid watching spring breakers party for the first time. Lots of beautiful girls and there's a sense of comedy and irony. I loved when the heavy gangster is playing Britney Spears on the piano.",Spring Breakers
629,indiathomasan,Worst Movie of the year 2013,1,21 June 2017,I have never watched a more ridiculous movie. I can't express how the movie was poorly up together. It was made to be amazing but it really wasn't. The Spring break voice was played over and over it gave the movie a weird atmosphere.By far the worst movie don't have anything else to say...,Spring Breakers
630,polskijames,"get rid of your sensitivities, its meant to be disturbing",9,21 November 2017,"If you're not familiar with Harmony Korine, you probably didn't like this. 9/10 because no one is perfect!A key element of his directing and writing is that he sexualizes young people. Notice I didn't say 'girls'. It's boys and girls. If you look at the breadth of his work there's an underlying theme of innocence juxtaposed with sex. I don't find this offensive, although some will. I do however, find it hard to watch at times. And when I watch his movies every single one i have a visceral reaction. I think that's the point. Korine aims to make you uncomfortable, to show you the private lives of the everyday people you see.. Now yeah, spring breakers is a gangster movie and no, i don't think my 14 yo neighbor is playing with guns. But i think this is what he's doing. Some of this is real life for people; its gritty and unbelievable and goes against all that stuff your momma taught you. And he does it so well. He presents you with something sweet and innocent, then slowly shows you truth. God i love that. I am also quite happy with his portrayal of the south FL spring break culture. I was born and raised in Clearwater...this stuff in the movie was no joke. The drugs/sex/dancing/cars/strip clubs, that's all a real south FL thing. It's not a party year round, but you can bet from March-April things get nuts (between west FL beaches and Miami's Ultra fest, you do the math). I was quite impressed with Gomez and Hudgens breaking away from Disney with a movie that is in such stark contrast from what they came from. Franco never disappoints. Just watch it, try it. It's not for everyone. In fact I think a lot of people would miss the point. But I really love the rawness that Korine brings to filmmaking and this was one of his best.",Spring Breakers
631,avinashkr-19466,Katai Wahiyaat..!!,1,14 December 2019,"I thought the movie will be great because of Selena Gomez, but it was so ridiculous, I even didn't watch the whole movie!!",Spring Breakers
632,huntergrrd,Pointless Movie Waste of Time,1,9 January 2019,"This movie was one of the biggest waste of times that I have ever thought possible, I even went and watched the movie for a second time to make sure that I was correct on my opinion. The movie was completely repetitive throughout the whole thing and for example if you are wondering what I am talking about ""This is what spring break is all about"" stated at least 20 times throughout the second half of the movie. Spring Breakers is a movie that quite frankly made me bored watching it and seemed to have absolutely no meaning behind it. If you are looking for a porno type movie I guess go for it because the movie seems to be based around sex, drugs, and women with no tops on. I feel that the movie had absolutely no meaning behind it and it was fairly pointless like stated before.",Spring Breakers
633,soyhead,Save yourself,1,24 October 2019,"Unless you want James franco saying ""spring break, spring break forever"" in his awful voice to carry itself into your nightmares; I wouldn't even go there.",Spring Breakers
