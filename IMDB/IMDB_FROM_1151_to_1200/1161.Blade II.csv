0,Leofwine_draca,Top-notch combination of action and horror,9,25 November 2015,"Finally, a great popcorn flick that's an improvement over the original movie and offers up an often stunning combination of the action and horror genres to great effect. BLADE II, like its predecessor but more so, skilfully combines full-blooded gory horror with some excellent martial arts choreography, here done by Donnie Yen who also appears in a minor role. Although the plot is fairly predictable stuff, sometimes rehashing scenes in the original movie except with different places and characters, and the various plot twists are a little contrived at times, this is never anything less than very entertaining. Sometimes it may be silly but that's part of the charm. Never has there been such a combination of the ultra-cool (the action) with the ultra-cheesy (Snipes posturing wildly, e.g. the hilarious ""sunglasses throw""), a combination which makes BLADE II a more satisfying film than the original -which is no mean feat in itself.The director is the acclaimed Mexican Guillermo del Toro, who brings his usual visual artistry (the world in which the film takes place is a dark, Gothic, decaying netherworld of ugliness and filth), plot elements (scary transforming monsters, mechanical devices which attach themselves to people and don't come off) and actors - yep, Ron Perlman is back from CRONOS and used to good effect once more. Starting with a wild action sequence in which Snipes takes on a pack of motorbike-riding vampires, the film rarely slows down, offering up some great set-pieces like the vampire's rave, the sewer hunt and the over-the-top finale. Influences from the likes of ALIENS and PREDATOR are evident but staged differently enough to avoid being too similar or noticeable to ruin the flow of the film.My love of the martial arts is quickly growing and BLADE II offers some fantastically-choreographed fights and swordplay. Incredibly fast moves and hits are seamlessly blended with CGI characters (to do those moves which truly are impossible for human actors to perform) and the result is adrenaline-pumping action highlighted by an appropriately pumping score. I really was on the edge of my seat for the vampire-busting antics and kept on looking forward to the next scene, and the next. The final one-on-one, in particular, is spellbinding stuff. Nice to see that they threw a few wrestling moves in there too to keep things fresh and entertaining (!). Wesley Snipes effortlessly slides back into the character of Blade and it's nice to see he doesn't take things quite so seriously this time around; however, his screen presence and talented handling of the action makes him a hero to be proud of.As for the horror-side of the film, well this is where things start getting really nasty. Forget the vampires from the first film (who now become normal, everyday kind of menaces), the newly-designed Reapers are a horrific bunch of subhuman-looking creatures who have a really disgusting surprise hidden up their sleeves which I don't want to spoil too much (other than to say there are some great shocks in store for the first-time viewer). The gore and violence is played to the hilt and this is a film packed with people being sliced in half, having half of their heads cut off (really sickening bit there), throats torn out and blood spraying all over the shop. Plus plenty of the usual arm-snapping, neck-breaking and bullet-busting everyday kind of film violence. The vampire destruction sequences, showing the creatures burning into skeletons and exploding into ashes, are truly spectacular and a delight to watch. Here's a film where I can 100% recommend the excellent CGI effects used - and I never thought I'd get a chance to say that (not a big fan of computer effects at all, but they work really well here - congrats to all involved).Cast-wise, it's nice to see Kris Kristofferson back in shape (although the movie doesn't do a very good job of explaining his back-from-the-dead presence), although there's another unnecessary and frankly unwanted love interest in Leonor Varela. Norman Reedus makes for a likable accomplice, Scud, despite being a bit of a geek, but the most surprising thing is that the chief nasty vampire (a really evil-looking screen villain) is played well by Luke Goss, also known as one of the members of '80s boy band Bros! A nice mixture of talent is evident in the vampire cast members, with actors ranging from the aforementioned Ron Perlman (as impassive as ever), to Donnie Yen, to Danny John-Jules (another British celebrity turned Hollywood star) to THE STENDHAL SYNDROME's Thomas Kretschmann. Although it never goes any deeper than being a purely visual display of effects and action, BLADE II is a solid and above-average entry in the action/horror genre and even something of a minor classic. Definitely a film that can be enjoyed more than once so a full recommendation to this one.",Blade II
1,SnoopyStyle,Close call but a couple of things bothered me,5,23 May 2014,"Blade (Wesley Snipes) rescues Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) from one of the vampire's tanks and turns him back into human. Scud (Norman Reedus) is Blade's new human sidekick. There is a new form of mutant vampires called The Reaper. They are even more powerful than the regular vampires. Blade must form an alliance with the Shadow Council to battle this new threat. He teams up with the elite vampire team The Bloodpack.The new type of vampires look alright. There is more CGI blood and a higher body count. The fights are back. I guess if blood, kills, and fights are what you're looking for. And why not. Then this movie has it all and more of it. However I don't particularly like the CGI fights. They look like a video game. I always prefer the real hand-to-hand combat stunts. The other thing that irked me is the quick return of Whistler. While it's understandable to revive Whistler, it was done so quickly that it strikes a sour note. Those are annoying enough for me to marginally vote this down.",Blade II
2,kosmasp,Tongue in Cheek,8,11 May 2007,"That's the kind of humor G. del Toro uses here. Apart from his apparent (and on the DVD Extras much discussed) affinity for a special body part, he introduces us to a new villain here. Now of course you will say, this makes sense, a new chapter, a new villain. But this is an entirely different kind of villain. A villain that will force Blade to do something he(we) never thought he would do ...Apart from the balls out action, the movie will have the tongue in cheek humor too. What it doesn't have, is a story. So yes you could dismiss the movie because of that. But why hating, if you can just enjoy this crazy wicked piece of film. That's what I did, because the movie never ever let's you think otherwise. So it obtains and stays this way from beginning to the end. So if the movie doesn't take itself seriously (and that in an excellent way), why would you want to do that?",Blade II
3,jboothmillard,Blade II,5,28 November 2005,"In the first one who fought against evil, this time he joins them, but don't worry, it's for a good cause. Wesley Snipes returns as Blade/Eric Brooks/'The Daywalker' who has looked for Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) for years, and when he finds him he needs his help in fighting with the bad guys. Basically he joins the bad guys because there is a threat to both his side and the bad side, some ugly vampires that have huge side opening mouth (bigger and uglier than the Predator) that are immune to silver, but can be killed by sunlight. Also starring Ron Perlman (from Alien: Resurrection and Hellboy) as Reinhardt, Leonor Varela as Nyssa and Norman Reedus as Scud. Snipes is still very good, and the special effects are very good, but I don't think this is as worth while as the first. Wesley Snipes was number 96 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Worth watching!",Blade II
4,Tweekums,Blade must fight alongside his old enemies,7,8 May 2017,"As this instalment opens we see a man going to a rather sinister looking blood bank in Prague; it is run by the vampires and they intend to drain him little do they know that they are his prey. He is Nomak, a 'Reaper' or mutated vampire that will kill people and turn other vampires into a reaper like himself. Meanwhile Blade rescues his friend Whistler from his two years of captivity with the vampires. Shortly afterwards Nyssa; the daughter of the leading vampire approaches Blade with a surprising request; the vampires want his help to eliminate the reapers. He agrees but it is a very unstable alliance; many of the vampires he has been asked to fight alongside want to kill him there and then. Once the action gets underway they learn something rather worrying; the reapers aren't effected by silver of garlic only sunlight or intense ultra violet light will stop them. As the film progresses it emerges that not everything the vampires told Blade was true; in fact some facts about the reapers was even withheld from Nyssa.This film isn't quite as good as the first but it still provides plenty of entertainment. There are lots of impressively choreographed fight scenes and some spectacular vampire deaths; the use of CGI meant these looked cool rather than gruesome. Wesley Snipes impresses as Blade especially in the numerous fight scenes which he makes look real. The supporting cast is solid enough with Kris Kristofferson returning as Whistler; Ron Perlman putting an entertaining performance as the vampire Reinhardt; Leonor Varela as Nyssa and Norman Reedus, who plays Blade's new weapon designer 'Scud'. The story itself is perfectly fine if fairly predictable for the most part; there is a decent twist later on. I liked the design of the reapers; their mouths were possibly the most disturbing thing in the film. This may not be director Guillermo del Toro's best film but he does a fine job keeping it pretty dark without making it hard to see what is going on. Overall I'd say this is a decent sequel; I imagine most fans of the first film will enjoy it.",Blade II
5,ma-cortes,"Nice second sequel with lots of action-packed, blood , gore , twists and turns",6,26 November 2020,"Decent and acceptable follow-up with the mythical Vampire Hunter : part man, part vampire , all hero , containing several surprises , gory scenes and plot twists .

6,Quinoa1984,A sequel that does everything in it's power to top the original and it comes to being as good.,8,22 March 2002,"Blade 2 takes what made the first Blade film good and transforms it into a different country with different characters (outside of Blade and Whistler) and a possibly deeper feel, and it works without going into the bad sequel range.This time, the vampires Blade (Wesley Snipes) has been hunting down for so many years want to make a truce so that he can help them kill a new breed of monsters called reapers, which if you want a brief description are creatures that look like half vampires half zombies and half, whatever, with a chin that opens up a big damn mouth that before attacking it's prey could resemble a mini-sarlac pit (star wars reference).  Blade reluctantly agrees, knowing full well that the vampires could turn on him and Whistler if things go wrong.Overall, Blade 2, for the fans of the first one, will not dissapoint them. It contains enough imaginativeness and gore effects to brighten the most down of horror film and comic book enthusiasts.  The film also contains some of the best makeup I've seen in a while in a horror movie. A-",Blade II
7,Coventry,Don't Fear The Reaper(s),5,22 January 2006,"Part two unquestionably is the best entry in the rather dreadful ""Blade"" series, simply because the director's chair was occupied by a gifted filmmaker for a change. Guillermo Del Toro might be a little overrated (""Cronos"" and ""The Devil's Backbone"" really aren't that good...), from a routine and dull vampire movie script, he can make a remotely entertaining and visually impressive time-waster. With Del Toro in charge, it quickly becomes obvious how badly the first ""Blade"" and ""Blade 3: Trinity"" lacked a decent director. The story is also slightly better than in the original Blade, with our half man  half vampire hero teaming up with his enemies to battle an entirely new breed of bloodsucking species; the Reapers. These pale and caped monsters are seemly immune to garlic and other old anti-vampire tricks and  very interesting  they drink the blood of vampire victims as well as humans. There's still way too much hi-tech nonsense going on in this film and the fights between Blade and his vampire opponents now look like lame imitations of ""The Matrix"", but at least there's some relatively good humor in the script and Wesley Snipes is kept on a short leash by Del Toro. Kris Kristofferson reprises his role of cool old mentor but the best part is reserved for Guillermo Del Toro's buddy Ron Perlman. He's the leader of ""The Blood Pact""; a squadron of eccentric vampires that are trained to kill Blade. Perlman is the real star of this movie with his impressive charisma and barbaric looks.",Blade II
8,hitchcockthelegend,"Lock up your daughters, boys and girls, the Dark Knight returns.",8,18 October 2009,"Bride Of Frankenstein, Aliens, Hellbound: Hellraiser II, three horror sequels that proudly didn't shame the original film of each respective series. There's others of course, and naturally it's all arguable, but I would vouch for Blade II as being a worthy entry on any greatest horror sequels list any day. Stephen Norrington's original first entry from 1999 is itself vastly undervalued in the action/horror pantheon, such is the case here with this Guillermo Del Toro directed sequel. Guillermo Del Toro raises the bar in comic book-manga-esquire violence, flayed limbs aplenty, gore drenchery unbound, droll gallows humour throughout, expert choreography and all delivered at a break-neck pace by its makers. It's kind of hard to see why the discerning thrill seeking comic book fan hasn't truly embraced the first two Blade movies {a third, fun, but cheesy instalment followed} as bona fide genre highlights.Joining Snipes {Blade} in this return is Luke Goss, with the former Bros pop star a surprisingly effective performer, Ron Perlman, Danny John Jules, Leonor Varela and the-ahem-returning Kris Kristofferson as Whistler. Screenwriter David S. Goyer is perhaps guilty of underwriting the characters outside of Blade and his new nemesis. Certainly The Bloodpack members are barely given stories worthy of interest. But it's high octane action one is surely looking for in a piece like this?. And we get it, with blood and bells on. Blade II made a worldwide profit of $100,000,000-and rightly so because it deserved that success. Its reputation appears to have dimmed as much as its leading mans star appeal has, but it marked a return to form for its director and it remains a wonderfully exciting and blood letting piece of genre entertainment. 8.5/10",Blade II
9,LeonLouisRicci,Meet the New BladeNot Like the Old Blade,7,28 May 2015,"Director del Toro Has No Doubt Gained a Following. He has the Talent of an Artist From Hell. The Look is Gruesome, Grotesque, Extremely Gory and Nauseating. It Seems that His Style would be a Perfect Fit for the ""Blade"" Series. Well, it's a Matter of Taste, So to Speak.If You Like Your Vampire and Horror Movies Ultra-Gory and Disgustingly Wretched than He's Your Man. That's Exactly what This Thing Is. Wesley Snipes Returns as the Vampire Vampire Hunter, but in This One He Teams Up with a Squad of ""Suck Heads"" because there is Something Threatening the Vampires and by Un-Natural Selection will Target Humans Too.These ""New Kids on the Block"" are Harder to Kill and Make Vampires Look Like Sissies. The Director Seems to Wallow in the Well of Wanting More Gore, More Often, and More Sickening with Each Passing Scene. It All Becomes Rather Routine After a While and there is Just So Much Nastiness a Viewer Can Take Before One Becomes Anesthetized. The Martial Arts Scenes are Many, but the CGI is Rearing its Ugly Head Frequently. In 2002 They Had Not Quite Got it Right and Some Scenes Look a Bit Cartoonish. But the Makeup and the ""Real"" SFX are Impressive. Overall, its a Different Movie, Mostly, from the First Blade, it Wears its Changes Loudly and Proudly. Some Fans of the First One Might be Disappointed, but it Will Obviously Gain the Gore Crowd and Fangoria Types will be Touting and Shouting. The Movie Almost, but Not Quite, Loses Touch with the Source Material, or Perhaps Not So Much Loses Touch but Gives it an Extreme, Excessive, Embellishment. For Better or Worse. You Decide.",Blade II
10,poolandrews,Top comic book sequel to a top film.,8,29 January 2007,"Blade II starts as the half Vampire half human Vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes) continues his 2 year long quest to find his friend Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) whom the Vampire race have held captive for that time after the events in the original Blade (1998), Blade finally has tracked him down & frees him. One night back at his base a group of highly trained Vampires known as the 'Bloodpack' infiltrate it & they deliver a message to Blade that the Vampire king Eli Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) wants a truce between the two warring sides, Blade agrees & the Bloodpack takes him to their headquarters to speak with Damaskinos personally who wants Blade to help him & his race exterminate a new breed of Vampire known as a Reaper. This new type of Vampire needs to feed on fresh blood every few hours & preferably Vampire blood but once they have wiped the Vampie race out they will turn their attention to the human race, they are immune to silver & garlic & infect their prey with a virus that turns them into Reapers, in a matter of months the whole planet could be overrun with the things. It' up to Blade & the Bloodpack to destroy the source of the virus, the original carrier named Jared Nomak (Luke Goss) before it's too late...This American German co-production was directed by Guillermo del Toro & is the second outing for the popular comic book character Blade, personally I think the original Blade is complete class & I was slightly worried by this sequel as I thought that it would be a huge disappointment but I'm happy to report that Blade II is almost as good as the original which was more than a little bit surprising. Anyway, David S. Goyer returns to pen the sequel & he does a fine job again as this time around he has more scope & money to play with as he makes everything that little bit bigger, louder & more ambitious. The film moves along like a rocket yet still manages to have a good story which has more to it than you may expect, the character's are good & the uneasy truce between Blade & the Vampires is well used & is always there as an undercurrent, there are a few twists & turns as people aren't quite what they first seem & things aren't quite as straight forward as they seem, there are also some neat ideas here particularly the Reapers themselves whose jaws split apart to reveal snake like tongues. I liked the ending which isn't the usual Hollywood 'happily ever after' type thing & the script also does a good job of making the main villain Jared quite a sympathetic character who in essence is just a victim of his circumstances although deliciously evil at the same time. Overall I was very impressed with Blade II.Director Toro does a great job & while I can say this has a decent script with better character's & narrative than your average Hollywood no-brainer Blade II just wouldn't be any good if it were not for it's gore, violence, fights, chases, monsters, glamorous sleek chrome plated weaponry of various descriptions & it's cool attitude. Blade II has a fantastic look about it with great production design, it seems to alternate between dark run down decrepit sewers & back alleys to ultra sleek, modern & shiny scientific labs & complexes & it's a perfect mix & Toro manages to get the blend just about perfect, visually Blade II is top-notch. The weapons are suitably over-the-top & used to good violent effect throughout with the fights & action scenes extremely well choreographed & actually pretty exciting, the costumes are cool too with Leanor Varela standing out in her skin tight leather outfit at the end. There's plenty of blood & gore here, there's loads of the red stuff splashed around, there's plenty of disintegrating Vampires, people sliced in half, someone has the top of their head cut off, someone is blown up & there's a yucky autopsy scene. The body count in this must be pretty damned high.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Blade II looks the absolute business & has that sleek ultra well made Hollywood polish to it with great cinematography, top special effects, the usual catchy techno music to accompany the numerous set-pieces & excellent production values. The acting is decent enough, Snipes as Blade is suitably emotionless & delivers the one-liners with the appropriate enthusiasm. Kristofferson puts in a good shift while Ron Perlman equally so, ex-boy band singer Luke Goss is an unexpected choice for but rather impressive bad guy, Varela makes for a nice looking love interest & Norman Reedus is good & pretty likable as Scud.Blade II is an absolute top action horror hybrid big budget popcorn film that's a very worthy sequel, it's as simple & straight forward as that. Make sure you watch it as soon as you can, followed by Blade: Trinity (2004) & Blade: The Series (2006) stars someone called Sticky Fingaz...",Blade II
11,CinemaSerf,Blade Two many....,5,4 August 2020,"This time ""Blade"" (Wesley Snipes) joins forces with the vampire council to prevent the all-out eradication of the human and vampire species by the cross-breed ""Reaper"" that has such a rapacious hunger that it will devour just about anything to survive - no-one is safe! He allies with the ""Bloodpack"" and with ""Scud"" (Norman Reedus) on a quest to track down Luke Goss ""(Nomak"") who is the one creating these hybrid monsters, and to stop them before extinction beckons. This has quite a strong storyline, the characters are given some time to evolve and the chemistry between the rather static Snipes and Kris Kristofferson (""Whistler"") works well on the few occasions it is on screen - though not really well enough to compensate for pretty wooden performances from messrs. Goss and Reedus. As with the first film, the fight scenes are far too heavily staged; they rob the story of menace and the over-use of the soundtrack to accompany these extended, gory, slaughter-scenes really does reduce this to an almost cartoon status. It is good to look at, stylishly produced, but sadly nowhere near as good as the original.",Blade II
12,lastliberal,I'm a Supervamp,7,23 March 2007,"It's based on a comic book and revels in that history. It has more grotesque scenes than in all of George Romero's zombie classics combined, which is why it is a hit with horror fans. One of the redeeming factors is it's fight scenes. Don't take my word for it. The fight scenes in this movie are better than Green Goblin vs. Spiderman or Gangs of New York, both which lost to it in the awards chase.Blade (Wesley Snipes, who is so chiseled that his six-pack abs look stocked with 16-ounce cans) and the Bloodpack are on the trail of of super-vampires, led by Nomak (Luke Goss). These über living dead are pasty, rheumy-eyed monsters whose chins are laced up with seam-like scars. When they eat, their chins open like maws, revealing spiky tongues to do more damage. These guys aren't bothered by silver bullets or garlic.Hey! Who does vampire tats? And, why are the vampires in these movies like Versace-ridden Eurotrash you see dwelling in the most perilous areas of nightclubs.Music by Gorrilaz, Mos Def and Ice Cube add to the dark ambiance of the movie.",Blade II
13,zardoz-13,The Nosferatu Slayers,10,29 March 2013,"Actress N'Bushe Wright didn't reprise her role as Karen in director Guillermo del Toro's ""Blade II,"" but Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson are back for this blood-drenched, action-packed vampire slaying epic. The vampires exploit their own in this surprise-laden tale of complicity, duplicity, and heroism. The opening moments of this ramped-up sequel recount Blade's creation. He begins his narration of the past with the line: ""Forget what you think you know."" Blade has been searching for Whistler, the man who raised him and taught him how to control his affliction and live with it. Whistler was beaten up by the fangsters in the original ""Blade"" and he has become one of them in this pugnacious but swiftly-paced sequel. ""Blade II"" is comparable to ""Aliens"" in franchise terms. ""Blade: Trinity"" followed and qualified as a major disappointment, with few of the surprises and cool action scenes of the previous ""Blade"" outings. This time around, for the sake of brevity, the Vampire Nation approaches Blade to establish a truce. The ruling Vampire Overlord, Eli Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann of ""Wanted""), offers a truce because they have identified a greater enemy than Blade. The new enemy are called 'Reapers."" Jared Nomak (Luke Goss of ""Death Race 2"") has started a one-man war on the fangsters. Worse, when a Reaper (whose elaborately lethal jaw splits into three pieces when it strikes) attacks, its poison doesn't kill the victim. Instead, it turns them into Reapers. As one of the vampire leaders points out to Blade, ""These things are like crack addicts. They need to feed daily."" The always suspicious Blade decides to team up with the Vampire Nation and joins a unit known as 'the Bloodpack."" Moments later Blade is informed that the Bloodpack was formed to destroy him. The Bloodpack consists of Priest (Tony Curran of ""Gladiator""), Asad (Danny John-Jules of ""Red Dwarf""), Snowman (Donny Yen of ""Iron Monkey""), Chupa (Matt Schulze of ""The Fast and the Furious""), Verlaine (Norwegian actress Marit Velle Kile), Lighthammer (Daz Crawford of ""Snitch""), Reinhardt (Ron Pearlman of ""Hellboy""), and Nyssa (Leonor Varela of ""Texas Rangers""), and they've been training for two years to take on Blade.Del Toro stages some exciting action scenes in the sewer of Prague. ""Blade II"" looks great, and it takes the franchise to a higher level that ""Trinity"" couldn't rival. Snipes was born to play Blade!",Blade II
14,Boba_Fett1138,Just as entertaining but not as good as the first.,7,12 September 2004,"Blade is back! And unlike many other sequels this movie doesn't disappoint.The movie is just as entertaining as the first Blade movie was. However they tried a bit too hard to surpass the first movie. They added a bigger budget, a more complex story, more fancy special effects and more deadly vampires but in this case bigger is not better...Blade (Wesley Snipes) is as cool as ever. Also returning in this movie is the character Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), which in my opinion was not a that good idea. I never have been a big fan of characters returning from the dead for a sequel. Added in this movie are some more cool vampires. The bloodpack is awesome especially Ron Perlman as Reinhardt of course but I also liked Tony Curran (Priest) and Donny Yen (Snowman). The main villain might be a little bit disappointing compared to Deacon Frost from the first Blade movie but there are still some nice scene's and some spectacular fights with the main villain from this movie; Nomak (Luke Goss).Yet again it are especially the fights and action sequence's that impress although there is some overuse of special effects during some action sequences at times.Compared to the first movie, this one is more horror like which is thanks to Mexican director Guillermo del Toro who knows to create an even darker atmosphere and adds some good and gross horror scene's.Maybe not as good as the first but still very entertaining and cool. Bring on ""Blade: Trinity""!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Blade II
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A different flavor,7,28 August 2009,"I base this on the Special Edition DVD release. When a strange and aggressively reproducing breed of vampire turns up, Blade finds himself forming an alliance, which is born out of necessity and very unstable, with his life-long enemies. This makes for an interesting and fresh situation for the film series, and the dynamics, how the uncomfortable group relates to each other, does lead to some nice moments. The bad-ass factor is back and kicking, though it kind of gets to be over the top at points. Maybe that was the idea, I guess. Ron adds a lot to it, obviously, the man could render anything awesome, and him and Wesley are impeccable together. The ego-stroking is absolutely ridiculous, and this is so full of testosterone that the audience is likely to drown in it during the viewing, but there are dramatic instances, too, and the conflict between the two sides working together definitely doesn't cease to be tense or cool during the running time. This is paced well, with quite a lot of build-up as well as action(and every sequence of that feels unique from the rest in the movie, and they tend to rock), and it's certainly never boring. Instead of attempting to top the opening of the first(let's be honest, the rest of that film didn't manage that, and with good reason), this chooses another route, and thus also does a fantastic job of setting the tone, as it is not the same as Norrington's entry. While what you prefer is up to the individual, it's tough to claim that these aren't both marvelous, pun intended. This is more playful, intentionally cheesy, and the horror aspect gets used to a greater extent. There is genuine suspense in this. The effects are far superior to those of the original, if whether or not you care for the new way the death ones look is subjective. Dialog is pretty well-done. The story is magnificent again, if at least one subplot is awkwardly half-way cut out, leaving odd moments that don't stand on their own. Acting is mostly impressive. The music is spot-on, at least the equal of the 1998 flick, and possibly better. There is strong language, disturbing content and bloody, brutal violence in this. On the two discs are three audio tracks(a commentary with a Frankfurt and Del Toro, who is amusing, one with Goyer and Snipes, who is hilarious, and an ""isolated score"" one), the ""press kit"", several featurettes(the one that distinguishes itself is The Blood Pact, a documentary of around 90 minutes, which I will review on its own page here on the site), deleted/alternate scenes that you can watch with or without the director and producer's thoughts, all of which are informative. Finally, there's an art gallery, a ""survival guide"" for the tie-in video-game, a music video, a teaser and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of Guillermo's style and/or of the franchise. Noteworthy sequels are a rare sight, and this certainly deserves recognition for helping to combat that unpleasant truth. 7/10",Blade II
16,view_and_review,"Good guy rocked, bad guy not so much so",6,18 April 2007,"""Blade 2"" was a little bit of a step backwards. Blade, of course, was as cool as the upper atmosphere, but the nemesis is what makes a movie. In comic books and movies based upon comic books, the villain is who makes the hero. If the villain(s) are weak or undesirable, then the hero doesn't shine as much by defeating the nemesis. But when the nemesis is powerful, strong, or charismatic even, then the hero is also viewed as powerful and strong when he/she defeats him/her.The hybrid creatures in ""Blade 2"" were strong and nearly indestructible, but they were a bit on the disgusting side. The main villain and his father were equally on the disturbing side. Blade is partnered up with vampires this time around, which makes for a tense atmosphere. The uncertainty and twist with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and Scud (Norman Redus) added a little bit of flavor to the movie, and it was nice to see Scud get his just deserts. ""Blade 2"" just didn't have the same appeal as the first one, but it was still good.",Blade II

The look of the vampire mutations are superbly horrific, but the CGI fight scenes are even more horrific. I mean you can see it switching back and forth between computer generated and real. The plot's creative, but the dialogue isn't great and the villains not talking hurts as well. Leonor Varela as Nyssa just doesn't work, she's overly nice and too restrained to be a vampire and an assassin and to be raised by Damaskinos. There isn't a particular stand out character here, other than Blade. I originally had the sequel being superior, but after just watching both, the original's clearly the better film.",Blade II
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly underrated sequel effort,9,8 October 2015,"Recruited by his vampire prey to help them out in a deadly struggle they've been recently engaged in, Blade finds that his new employers have a far more sinister agenda in play than previously told and must battle his way through this new threat.This was quite the enjoyable and highly entertaining sequel. What really gives this one some great parts here is the addition of a fun new breed of vampires found here, not only finding a great way of introducing the creatures logically from the storyline as the explanation of them being a viral mutation offspring of vampires is given a truly great touch but also managing to put their physical changes here to good use as they're really freaky looking and gets a lot from these advanced forms. That is mainly due to how it fixes one of the major problems with the original in a far more even pace this time around, by appearing more as an Action film than a true Horror film and generating action pretty much more nonstop fighting the creatures. From the teams' first encounter in the underground dance hall where the individual members have encounters of their own in the kitchen or up in the guest-rooms before the frantic, frenzied battle on the dance-floor where the team is able to overpower several of the creatures in brutal, utterly bloody battles before finally getting the upper-hand and dealing with the strays left behind which provides the further fun of the autopsy sequence where they finally learn about the creatures. Furthering that, the sewer battles are even better as there's the tense suspense of the darkened locations providing a creepy setting while there's a lot to like as they swarm over the team requiring plenty of gun-fighting and weaponry that mixes in tons of gore with furious action scenes. That even leads into the other grand action scene here where there's the series of thrilling hand-to-hand battling and even firefight scenes that are just a blast. There's even a really great amount of prosthetics here to showcase the vampire's change in physical structure rather than opting to leave it strictly CG, which is a hugely appreciated feat and all together makes this good enough to hold out for the film's positives. The biggest problem here is the rather clueless and utterly inane series of twists, which make the last half-hour quite packed with story lines and exposition rather than action the way it had been from the start, especially with several of the characters' allegiances shifting for no real reason simply to make for a bigger impact and it falls apart somewhat. Along with some dodgy and lame CGI work here showing off their superhuman abilities during fights, these here are all that's really wrong here.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Blade II

Though I would say I liked it about the same as the first one even though it had more action, the first one had a better plot.  Though I understood everything and did not find any of the plot twists to confusing or anything like a lot of others complain about. The darker setting is very cool and the European setting makes this movie have a Gothic setting.  It is a combination of the very old and new that gives this film great atmosphere.  The plot is there is a new breed of vampire on the streets and normal vampires need Blade's help in disposing of them, but can he really trust them.  I highly recommend this flick.",Blade II
20,zetes,"Big, dumb, and forgettable",5,27 March 2002,"Blade II isn't terrible. I, in fact, like it a smidgen better than the original. That film suffered from a very uninteresting love interest (who doesn't come back) and a dull villain. It had its moments, though, and so does Blade II. The visuals in both films are excellent, with a marvelous eye towards the set designs and costumes. II contains more computer animation, with several scenes using far too much computer animation. It tries to hide that a few times by setting the sequences in the dark or whatever, but you'd have to be mentally challenged not to notice. Because of this, its action sequences don't carry as much weight or energy. It steals liberally from The Matrix and, even moreso, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's slightly better than The Matrix, pretention incarnate, but can't come close to the physical beauty of CTHD, whose action sequences did not rely on computers.Blade II steals its plot wholesale from Aliens, which is a common action film to steal from (it's probably the best ever made at this point, over 15 years old now). The villains are pretty cool, but they're a direct combination of Max Schreck (of Nosferatu fame) and the aliens from Aliens. They're still pretty brutal. A lot of the supporting cast is simply terrible. The film employs a ton of uber-predictable twists and betrayals.

The story is better than the first one. Okay, you never see real people, it all happens in the underworld. Fighting scenes are better done qua fighting and bringing it in front of the camera. Make up is also much better. Some people hated this one again due the CGI Blade, well, these days it is used a lot, watch Hellboy or Spiderman.

And Guillermo Del Toro has his fingerprints all over this thing with the Reapers. It's much more stylish than the original, but it's also shamelessly ridiculous. They retconned Whistler back to life and didn't even blink doing it (although, try to imagine this movie without Kristofferson). And that's really part of its charm. There's plenty of bad CGI here (Snipes is full-on digital in a few scenes), but then again, it was 2002 - they were computerizing everybody back then. There's also Ron Perlman, so there's that going for it.But when all is said and done, this is a pure action movie, and there's a constant flow of energy.

Blade even takes a nice bath in a deep pool of thick blood which made me stay away from tomato juice for my entire life. Kris Kristofferson, (Abraham Whistler) acted at first like a very old man who just came out of a coma and then he started to use his brain power and helped Blade accomplish some of his tasks.

27,thesar-2,Marvel Presents: Hellboy VS Blade,8,2 November 2009,"It's definitively a rarity: seldom sequels top their originals. 'Blade II' is one of the exceptions. I admit, I'm not one for ""origin"" stories as they normally take too long to get to what we came for, and the original 'Blade' is also an exception: it didn't take too long and was thoroughly enjoyable. However, any problems with #1 (bad, very bad, CGI, Blade acting amateurish) are gone and they move (fast) forward with a very good story and action. An already-established Vampire Mix-breed Hunter, Blade, is given the opportunity to team with his nemesis, the vampires, when a new advanced-model Vampire enters the ranks. Their (or his, to begin) mission: destroy all vampires and then supposedly wipe out humans, following. Blade's no dummy, so he's taking all precautions after rescuing his mentor, Whistler, teaming with him and newbie, Scud. It's an extremely interesting concept to the relatively new series and though it mostly plays as a ""mystery,"" it's pretty easy to figure out from the get-go on how this will play out. Nevertheless, it's fun if you just sit back and enjoy, if blood-thirsty vampire action's your idea of entertainment. Pending you watched this when it first came out, it might be more original, but after the success of 'Hellboy' (also starring Perlman,) 'Aliens' (boy, it had a lot in common with Cameron's film) and any of the 'Underworld' movies, it's hard to see this original as it was in 2002. It was, despite some obvious ""plot-twists"" and some silliness – slooooow-mo scenes can be annoying at times and watch how interesting sunglasses can be. Regardless, sit back, root for the male-vampire slayer as it has a little bit of everything for an action, horror, comedy and adventure person to enjoy.",Blade II

It's got a few cool and/or effective moments, it keeps moving, and everything about it says ""basically adequate though uninspired action flick.""  Snipes makes an acceptable b-movie sort of action figure, with less presence than Vin Diesel but more talent than Chuck Norris.  Kristofferson is blandly adequate in his very generic role.  Ron Perlman is, of course, quite good, although the movie's characters let several good chances to kill him go by just so they can keep him around longer.  The minimal story is pretty much okay.  Some of the fight scenes are well-choreographed, although the finale is a bit too along the lines of a wrestling match.  I watched it to the end and didn't feel overly restless, so if you just kind of like action pictures and it's on TV it's worth at least looking at.

It maintains its confidently laid-back spirit and calmly assured bad-ass protagonist, this time expanding the luscious lore that surrounds both and only making a couple of missteps with the narrative.

31,bowmanblue,Am I the only one who thought this was better than the original?,9,15 November 2014,"I remember when Blade II came out - everyone was saying how much better it was than its predecessor (that's not saying the original was bad - it was excellent, too). However, now I look at the other reviews, I see many pretty scathing appraisals of the film, so I thought I'd readdress the balance.Blade II makes the bold decision to team the titular character up with those he has sworn to destroy - namely vampires - in order to hunt a new super strain of the undead who plans on feeding on both humans and vampires.What follows are some pretty good action and fight scenes against a race of monsters who are well-designed enough to actually be pretty horrific. Besides some of the non-English speaking actors (who's lines are purely understood with the aid of subtitles) all the cast play their parts well. Wesley Snipes finds it easy to keep going as the half-vampire, Blade, but Ron Perlham deserves a special mention for generally being nasty to Blade and getting away with it (or does he?).A good sequel should offer the same and more. Blade II does this. It's easily recognisable as a Blade film, yet takes the story in a fresh direction to the original, meaning it isn't simply a rehash of old ideas. I would rank it alongside other such great sequels as Terminator 2 and Aliens. It's just a shame they couldn't repeat the magic with what followed: Blade Trinity (but that's another - sad -story).",Blade II
32,ericstevenson,A superhero movie?,7,16 May 2018,"Nowadays, we live in the golden age of superhero movies where great films of the kind are always around the corner. This film was made at a time that now seems like ancient history when it comes to superhero movies. I didn't like how I wasn't familiar with any of the characters. I went through the Marvel Encyclopedia and don't remember seeing any of these guys. It works much better as just a standard action movie. It's often fight scene after fight scene with vampires being killed over and over.There is still much better creativity in this movie than most of the Transformers films. They do at least manage to expand on the vampire mythology. I knew that was the guy who played Daryl from ""The Walking Dead""! I personally didn't care for the original Blade movie. I felt this was better as I was more accustomed to the setting and it didn't feel like they were just repeating stuff. Dozens of better superhero movies exist now, but as an early film, this wasn't half bad. I admit some of the effects don't hold up that well. ***",Blade II
33,The-Sarkologist,Much better than the original film,5,23 December 2011,"For some strange reason this was much better, and much more enjoyable than the first film. It had less clichés, had a few twists, some of which I didn't anticipate, and has Blade teaming up with the vampires to fight a third enemy, though whether this third enemy is an enemy of blade is a little unclear, however it does become evident that he does becomes Blade's enemy by the end of this film. Also, the movie was filmed on location in Prague, and not only have I been to Prague (though not for so long that I could say that I recognised some of the places) but it adds a bit more of the exotic feel to it.However, before I continue, we must remember that while vampires have existed throughout human history in one form or another (though I would not agree with those who say that vampires are one of those legends that appear to turn up in multiple cultures) Bram Stoker had his original vampire, Dracula, arise from this corner of Europe, though Transylvania happens to be in Romania and not the Czech Republic. So, while the first movie is set in Los Angeles (and I found it a but odd that a major vampire temple would be located in Los Angeles) this film goes back to where the vampire legend began (sort of).Basically the vampire world has been rocked by the appearance of a mutant vampire. The mutant, which the call the Reapers, feed on vampires, and turn vampires into Reapers. This, obviously, concerns the vampires as the Reapers have all of the strengths of the vampires, but their only weakness is a vulnerability to sunlight. Further, reapers that have been turned tend to be a lot more violent and a lot more dangerous. Further, the vampires use the threat that the Reapers have on humanity as a way of bringing Blade to assist them.In this film, Blade is tracking Whistler. It turns out that he was not killed in the last film, but rather has been turned into vampire. However, he is not running around like a vampire, but rather being constantly tortured. As vampires regenerate and age a lot slower than humans, it is easy to torture him to the point of death, and then come back a few days later for a bit more.Despite this film being substantially better than the previous film, Blade II is still not much of a film. I did enjoy it more, and getting rid of some hot shot young vampire and trading it with an ancient vampire as the bad guy made it a lot more enjoyable for me. Still, it is not exactly a film that I am going to be watching again anytime soon.",Blade II

38,Floated2,Step down from the original,3,15 November 2020,"Having previously watched Blade, then almost immediately watched this sequel, can see the differences among the two films. Found only the original to be decent but after watching Blade 2, may think life highly of the original.The magic and great style we saw in Blade isn't evident here in the sequel. The budget is bigger so the picture quality does look better, and the violence in gore is also a step up. Some of the vampire scenes we see directly are rather gross to look at.The plot is less than great and what makes this film worse than the original is the addition of more people. Here Blade teams up with a team to track down more vampires. Which means there is less focus and screen time of Blade. Less dialogue in this sequel coming from Blade as well.Also no consistent villain, where as in the original it was well established that Frost was the villain. Here there are some twists in the end but most of which are predictable.Although the ""love interest"" is better this time around, as the character of Nyssa is better than the character of Karen from the original. The addition of Norman Reedus (from the Walking Dead) was rather awful, as his character was irritating from the start. Ron Pearlman does a solid job.There was some action but overall the film moves at a slow and rather boring pace- and the running time is less than the original. Blade 2 just wasn't as fun as the original and as expected.",Blade II
39,poe426,Cinecomic actioner...,7,30 October 2014,"BLADE II lays claim to being even more comic-bookish than the first film in this series; and better, to boot. While I'll always contend that Blade- the character- was ""inspired by"" the movie GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE (in which William Smith plays the half human-half vampire son of vampire Michael Pataki, who rapes a human woman in an open grave), the filmmakers who opted to bring the character to the big screen committed a cardinal sin when they tricked him out with a variety of automatic and semi-automatic weapons. In the comics, he carried wooden stakes, which sufficed. In the movie(s), wooden stakes never enter into it. Go figure. BLADE II has several things going for it: a sometimes frenetic pace... and the director, Guillermo Del Toro. If nothing else, Del Toro's participation automatically means that the movie will look great: he incorporates the Mario Bava and Dario Argento influences that have given his movies a most distinctive look. The vampires, too, prefigure the creatures in THE STRAIN (the teleseries) and The House of Pain has to be seen to be believed (it's where vampires go ""to feel something,"" which takes on a whole new meaning when you're a vampire and you have what amounts to super powers). The ending is identical to the ending of a script I submitted to the first season of TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE (titled VAMPYRE, about an undercover cop who goes all the way by allowing himself to be bitten by a vampire), another reason I really liked this one.",Blade II
40,johnnyboyz,The film relies on visuals to cover up its frustratingly poor plotting.,5,19 February 2007,"Despite enjoying the first outing of Blade; I was very weary going into the sequel of a film that relied on blood, over the top action and comic book violence to tell its story and I'm glad I was otherwise I would've disliked this second film even more.What happens in Blade II is that Blade is forced to ally with his mortal enemies, the vampires, to fight an even deadlier foe that will consume both of them. First the vampires; then the humans. The main problem with Blade II is that it's completely full of holes. The way the film is pieced together means it keeps that oddly distracting air of mystery and sense of no real trust between the two allied forces that spoils, and thus ruins, the end twist. The whole truce plot is very weak throughout and you definitely get that feeling, especially since the initial incident of them attempting to make a truce features a female vampire trying to decapitate our hero instead of reasoning with him. What's more, the truce is actually hard to fathom given their filmic situation and the hatred they have for one another in their world.Another thing that was weak was the fact I could see straight through the third ally character. I found it amazingly convenient that Blade had found a new sidekick following Whislter being taken by the vampires; and the twist towards the end can be seen a mile off. Rather than add something to the team; the character of Scud was really just someone there to make it look like 'the whole Vampire race/ three others' rather than 'the whole Vampire race and just two others'. The only thing he added to the film was the fact a daft, predictable twist was sure to arise. Something that I found laughable when really I shouldn't have was the fact that once the Vampires and Blade's threesome are together; they create more problems for themselves rather than their enemies. Scud gets himself into all sorts of problems when he's operating his surveillance van and the other allies just don't seem to learn that bullets won't work on these bad guys (Not yet, anyway). Another annoying, predictable thing the film has going for it is the vampire team Blade's assigned with. I thought these particular characters would make for juicy cannon fodder once the film progressed; and I wasn't too far wrong  brainless and only mildly entertaining. By the time the film has entered its final third and all the twists start to unravel, its become a bit of a mess. Suddenly, bullets can kill the Reaper Vampires, the normal vampires aren't so 'good' anymore and Scud can't even seem to remember weather his own inventions are or aren't explosive devices. With this, Blade II relies on visuals to make up for it's holey plot. The fight scenes are impressive at times whenever weapons are involved but the final fight was a little too 'you hit me, I hit you' in my opinion. I liked the early references to Samurai with the Japanese sliding doors mise-en-scene and reference to swords and the script has some amusing quips and situations the Vampires and Blade's unit find themselves facing and sharing throughout. But, with too many things wrong with it overall; I have to stand up and say that this is rather overrated and a little care with how obvious/inconspicuous certain plot points should be made should've been addressed better.",Blade II
41,filipemanuelneto,"Blood, testosterone, fire and beating... the return.",5,9 August 2020,"We are facing yet another film in the ""Blade"" trilogy, planned and designed for young adults thirsting for action, with more choreographed fights than ballet and litres of fake blood that splash everywhere. This film, instead of bringing something new, is limited to repeating more or less the same recipe as its direct predecessor, which was a box office success. It is worth seeing, if we do not want an elaborate or deep film but just pass the time.The script for this film is simpler, in my view, than the one used in the first film of the trilogy. Here we already know the characters, there is no need for introductions and the feeling of superficiality that we had already mentioned in the first film is accentuated. Here, Blade is called by the heads of the vampire community who decide to propose a truce, on the condition that he help them hunt a new strain of vampires, the result of an evolution or genetic mutation. This new strain has a leader who is the most powerful and resilient of them. The problem is that the new vampires, instead of feeding on human blood, are killing other vampires as well and are an immediate threat to both humans and vampires. Of the three films in the trilogy, this is the most scientific and the one where the question of the ""vampire virus"" is more detailed. Of course, the film has some twists, there are allies that are not trustworthy and enemies that, after all, are not so dangerous. The dialogues continue to be quite heavy in their language, but that didn't bother me ... I think it suits the film.One thing that I think has improved a lot in this film, when compared to its immediate predecessor, was the cast and its performance. Wesley Snipes continues to look convincing in his role as a ""killing machine"" and at times seems virtually indestructible. Kris Kristofferson gives us a weak character but still full of smugness and the same tough guy as always. Norman Reedus looks quite nerdy, but the character required it and the actor was good at noticing and acting accordingly. Ron Perlman is, in my opinion, the best actor in the film and he was very good in the character he played. Leonor Varela and Luke Goss also gave us excellent interpretations.Technically, the bet remains on action scenes and the use of CGI and other high-quality effects. We have fights and deaths for all tastes, choreographed battles, cliché phrases, slow motion effects and blood. Liters and liters of fake blood like a computer game. The sets and costumes are good, and in addition to Blade's impressive costume, eye-catching and stylish, we also have the costumes of the vampire combat teams, also black and with metallic adornments referring to the punk universe. Speaking of which, we have to mention the soundtrack, loaded with electronic music and techno, well suited to the youngest.",Blade II

It is a vampire flick, so it was supposed to be gory. The action from this film was way much better and thrilling than terrible first ""Blade"" movie, resulting in one of the most entertaining and well made horror flicks ever made.Too bad than the third part of the franchise lacked of this same level of quality.Anyway, this is the only ""Blade"" film that I liked.",Blade II

Well, four years later, ""Blade II"" rolls out, and the good news is that the action and the fast-paced blood-spewing entertainment continues. The bad, however, is that the story and the writing are less creative, failing to really immerse us in the vampire lore that made ""Blade"" so interesting. While the bad plot development doesn't really saw the legs out from under ""Blade II"", it certainly makes it difficult for anyone who did not really enjoy the first ""Blade"" to get anything good out of it.For the sequel, Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro steps in to replace the vacated spot left by ""Blade"" director Stephen Norrington. The difference is apparent but not that drastic. Del Toro uses a more martial arts style of filming fight scenes and this takes away some of the highly stylized shots of the first film. The action is not as cool-looking but the fight choreography is a bit better. Del Toro is also more imaginative in terms of how the characters look.The plot takes place two years after the last film. Blade has been out in search of his mentor Whistler (Kristofferson, who, surprise, didn't actually die in the first film) when he is approached by the vampires who request his help. The reason is that the vampire mutation has apparently evolved into a strain called ""reaper"" and these reapers feed on vampires. Agreeing only because these reapers are deadlier than vampires with less weaknesses, Blade teams up with some skilled vampires (ironically trained originally to kill him) to take the reapers down.The reapers are more barbaric creatures--not very interesting for the film's focus, but brought to life in an interesting way by Del Toro. They are pale, bald creepy figures with chins that open up to reveal parasites for feeding on their victims. They make the overall tone of ""Blade II"" more about the gross than the sleek like vampires. In fact, most of the vampires in the film are just dubbed as such, it doesn't really play a role in their characters. The lore of the first film is simply taken for granted here so we can jump right into the plot.The cast is even worse than ""Blade."" Why? Because there are more people in it. Last time, the only bad performance we had to deal with regularly was Stephen Dorff as the evil Deacon Frost. This time, there's a whole crew of pathetic vampires and then some other nuisances. The worst might be the annoying new sidekick of Blade's/tech geek character Scud played by Norman Reedus. The script also calls for a new vampire love interest for Blade, which might be the worst part of the film. There's nothing in the film that says these two should be interested in each other yet they are. Those two examples are just the stand outs in a cast that you kind of are just hoping will die at some point in the film, which interestingly enough, most of them do.David S. Goyer, the original film's writer, continues with the great pacing that made ""Blade"" entertaining, but in this film, there are too many characters and the pacing leads to us not caring at all about any of them except Blade. Even then, ""Blade II"" is only an excuse for Blade to kill more vampires/reapers, not grow as a character. Some of the strengths of his character from the original just disappear, like his struggle with the fact that he's half- vampire. This is mostly because the plot is not conducive to rehashing those themes.""Blade II"" is a great example of how a sequel maintains the entertaining elements of the original but cuts off the material underneath with a fair plot. The film aims for ""not disappointing"" instead of ""good,"" and so it achieves just that and nothing more.",Blade II
46,Anonymous_Maxine,"Ahhh, MUCH better!!",8,11 April 2002,"Blade II is an exciting action film that takes the tired vampire story and adds a new twist by introducing an entirely new villain. Sure, there is sure to be some controversy (at least among film fans and fans of the genre) about whether or not it is right to introduce new characters in this way. Vampires are a tired theme at the movies, but it is a time-honored genre in itself that deserves respect just from the fact that it has been around for so long in literature before the movies. The question of whether or not the writers were justified in introducing these new characters is, in my opinion, satisfied by the fact that they made such quality villains that fit so well into the genre.I am thrilled to see that they didn't just make another dumb Blade film that was exactly the same as the original except for the possibility of some new special effects, because these new characters, called Reapers, are exactly what the film series, as well as, potentially, the genre as a whole, needed. Reapers are blood-feeders, just like vampires, except they feed on humans as well as vampires, effectively making them an enemy of both, and their thirst is much stronger than the traditional vampire. And to make matters worse (or better, depending on whether you are an enemy of the Reapers of a member of the audience), they are identified by a scar which runs down their chin. This scar is where the lower jaw splits open when the Reaper is feeding, creating a frighteningly massive mouth like a vampire version of the Predator, and which has things inside it reminiscent of the horrifying and strangely unique Tremors. There are some amazing make-up effects here as well, although I can see the film being automatically overlooked at the Oscars in 2003 simply because it is the successor of such a low class action/horror film, as well as because this is just not the kind of movie that wins Academy Awards. I'm not sure that there is anything in this film that is likely to catch the Academy's attention, but the make-up was very impressive to say the least. Wesley Snipes returns to the role of Blade, the half-human/half-vampire creature dubbed the `Daywalker' because of his ability to withstand sunlight. This is in itself one of the better parts of the movie, because even though I was enormously unimpressed with the original film, there is no one that could play this character as well as Snipes does. There is also an interesting conflict introduced as Blade is forced to team up with the vampires, his mortal enemies who we are to assume could turn on him at any time, in order to fight the Reapers (by far the more dangerous enemy), who reproduce,' you might say, at an astonishing rate. It's too bad, though, that the existence of the Reapers was introduced by vampires in a rather impressive although entirely unnecessary fight scene between a couple of vampires and Blade himself. Blade is attacked one night by two vampires wearing body suits (and some goggles that probably retain the coolest effect of the entire film), they fight violently for several minutes at full speed without rest, until one of them suddenly kneels before Blade and asks for a truce, informing him that there is now something on the streets that is even worse than him. If they were going to ask for a truce, you would think that they would approach him at least a little differently. One of these vampires (the better fighter, as it were) turns out to be Nyssa Damaskinos, a sexy brunette vampire who's lipstick was not smeared in the least even by all of those flying kicks that she took to the face from Blade about 15 feet in the air. Remarkable.There seems to be a growing trend of having honest fight scenes replaced at an ever-increasing amount by special effects. Consider how vastly the role of special effects increased in Jet Li's fight scenes in Lethal Weapon 4 (relatively few special effects), Romeo Must Die (massive amounts of special effects), and The One (relatively few movements that were NOT special effects). This same trend is clearly influencing other films that are not made to be primarily fighting films, such as Blade and Blade II. The weapons that Blade carries around are still cool (think of them as a dark version of the toys that James Bond was sometimes given to take on his missions), and while the fight scenes in Blade and especially Blade II are undeniably thrilling and fun to watch, it's impossible to ignore the fact that most of what we are watching is computer generated. As a whole, Blade II succeeds in reviving the story of Blade, which was not done justice by the original film. The Reapers were a much-needed and very impressive addition to the story, and the resulting conflict between the vampires and Blade himself as they are forced to take sides together provides such an interesting conflict that it almost overshadows the one created by the Reapers, who are by far the more dangerous villains. There is, of course, some stuff here that was thrown in without apparent reason and therefore without beneficial affect (such as the unnecessary, however impressive, fight scene between Blade and the two vampires early in the film), but as a whole the film rises high above its predecessor. The fact that the original film ends with Blade becoming a worldly vampire-hunter is mostly ignored in this film, although this one does end with a similar bit of comic relief and may even leave room for a second sequel. And as much as I disliked the original film, after watching Blade II I can't say that I would be too disappointed to see a Blade III come out in a few years.",Blade II
47,GOWBTW,More action there than the first!,8,16 February 2009,"The first Blade movie wasn't bad, this sequel has more to it. Blade(Wesley Snipes) is back again. Only this time he gets to team with the enemy to take on a more dangerous enemy that the other vampires couldn't take out. A group of more elite vampires require the help of Blade, and they help take out vampires that can't be defeat the same way. These vampires are parasites. They make regular bloodsuckers look like mosquitoes. At first, Blade had to recuse his mentor, Whistler(Kris Kristofferson). Those two have been tight for years. Somewhere in the long-run, there were some traces of distrust. The real turncoats was Whistler's replacement who was attacked by some female vampires. One of the elites(Ron Perlman) who had the explosive to his head set by Blade. The only elite vampire was loyal to Blade and not to her family. Knowing to trust only Blade, she died passionately to him. The fight scene are remarkable, the plot is fascinating. No problems whatsoever. I liked it! 3 stars!",Blade II

This delivers some gritty action from beginning to end.Wesley Snipes is awesome in this. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and that's saying a lot where horror sequels are concerned. They are seldom as fulfilling as this, although it is far from a masterpiece.I liked it, but didn't love it.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",Blade II
49,Captain_Couth,The Blade Franchise: Blade II,9,28 August 2005,"Blade II (2002) was better than the first film. The perfect sequel that's filled with blood, gore and kinetic graphic violence.

After a rough night of slaying the undead, a group of the largest Vampire Clan wants a meeting with the man. They give him an offer that if he refuses will spell the end of life as we know it. Factoring in Blade' hated for the undead this'll be a tough decision for him to make. What will he do?Blade II was a wild film that was keenly directed by Spanish film maker Guliermo Del Toro.

50,generationofswine,An Honest Review,3,25 November 2016,"Wow, this tanked fast didn't it? Still, Blade II is not as bad as the next one...and neither are nearly as brilliant as the first.Those of us that know Blade know him as a man obsessed. Vampires...vampires...vampires...VAMPIRES!!!!!! BLAH! A man that wants to kill them, ALL of them, including the ones that help him and fight by his side. He's cold, he's heartless, he's a killer...at least when it comes to the occult and now, suddenly, he has a bit of a heart? No matter how small? It sort of took away from the character, I mean this is Marvel we are talking about, they are famous for heroes with serious flaws and now, Blade's biggest is stripped away? Disappointing.And then the Big Bad. Dracula? No. Varney? No. Morbius? No. We have people with no real history made us entirely for the movie. Kind of a let down, but that could just be for rights...still, the one singular good Blade did have Frost, so....was it just out of laziness? I don't know, the point is this has about the same taste of the dull, lazy action movies and little charm of even the cheap horror movies it's basically, well, it's basically Underworld with a Marvel hero.Pass. Move along. This is not the Marvel you are looking for.Not only that, but after Blade, it's a serious let down. A series should not go from awesome to kind of boring that fast.",Blade II
51,freemantle_uk,Best of the Blade films,9,7 December 2009,"To some people the release of Blade was a watershed in comic book films, leading to a more serious tones in the genre. I personally think the real watershed film was Bryan Singer's X-Men, but that doesn't stop the first Blade film being an enjoyable film and still important film the vampire and action genres. The first Blade film was very successful with only a modest budget, a sequel seemed to make good business sense. New Line ensured that it kept their star and writer of the first film and comic book fan David S. Goyer. They also hired a top director, Guillermo del Toro to ensure it was more then a simple cash-in.Two years after the events of Blade, our hero (Wesley Snipes) is on the search for his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) in Eastern Europe. Whisper had been held hostage by the vampires, who Blade assumed had killed himself to avoid becoming a vampire. Blade is able to rescue Whistler and reform the team with their new member Scud (Norman Reedus). Within the vampire world a new enemy has be born, the Reapers. The Reapers feed on vampires, have all their strengths, but can resist garlic and silver. Sunlight is their only weakness. They are lead by Jared Nomak (Luke Goss), but the Reapers are an almost zombie like creature, needing to feed daily to survive. The vampire nation offers Blade a truce; to help them destroy the Reapers before they become a threat to humanity. He offered to lead a team called the Bloodpack, a special team that were meant to kill Blade. Included in this team are Nyssa Damaskinos (Leonor Varela), daughter of the vampire leader, and Reinhardt (Ron Perlman), a vampire who has a particular dislike for Blade. The teams unite to stop the powerful Reapers.They is a good mix of a dark serious tone that made the first film really good, but with a decent mix of humour and one-lines to balance things out and make Blade II a excellent action film. Del Torro directs some fantastic action and fight sequences, but also brings his own style to the film. It shows he has a good eye for this type of film. He also adds some horror moments which another strength of his. He makes a first paced, entertaining film.The theme of enemies uniting to face a greater foe is nothing new. It was done in X-Men 2 (which was released a year later), in Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series, in computer games like the newer Sonic games, Bond films, the lists goes on. But it was done well in this film, and there are plot twists and betrayals in this film. There is also good interplay between Wesley Snipes and Ron Perlman (who latter works with Del Torro in Hellboy).The first Blade film deals with a almost religious element of the vampire world with the re-birth of the Blood God. In Blade II Goyer tackles the issue from the other direction, a scientific view of vampirism as a virus, and the idea of evolution. We also get to see more of the vampire's world in this film and less of the human world. I like the idea of modernising the vampire myth.There is a good cast. Wesley Snipes is perfect as Blade, both as a somber character, as a fighter and knows how to deliver a one-liner. Kris Kristofferson returns to the mix and is decent. Ron Perlman as already mention a fine member of the cast, so is Luke Goss as the villain and the fine German actor Thomas Kretschmann as the leader of the vampires.Finally the soundtrack is very fitting for the film.An entertaining film for Blade, comic book, material arts and vampire fans.",Blade II
52,dee.reid,Y'all know the name...BLADE,10,23 March 2002,"""Blade II"", the highly anticipated sequel to the 1998 action thriller of the same name, met every single one of my expectations.  I expected ""Blade II"" to surpass ""Blade"" in almost every way and it did.  This meant more weapons, more action, more vampires, and the best part of about this movie of course, Blade himself.  There is a lot of shots of vampires being dismembered, blown up, and fried by sunlight. ""Blade II"" takes place two years after the events of the first film. Blade(Wesley Snipes) is continuing his search for his long-dead friend Whistler(Kris Kristofferson), who has since become a vampire.  Blade eventually finds his quarry with the help of another chain-smoking human, Scud(Norman Reedus).  It isn't long before Scud and Whistler begin to go at one another for who is better at inventing vampire-killing weapons.   Soon after, Blade is later informed of a truce that is being called between him and the Vampire Nation.  The entire reason for the truce is that a rare mutation has occurred within the vampire strain.  It seems that a new breed of vampire called a ""reaper"" has resulted from the mutant strain.  These ""reapers"" are a kind of super-vampire.  They have an insatiable thirst for blood, needing to feed every few hours.  In turn they will feed on anything, even other vampires.  They have intense strength, are immune to silver and garlic, but are still vulnerable to sunlight.  They are led by Nomak(Luke Goss), the originator of the mutant strain.  The Vampire Nation needs Blade's help in eliminating the reapers before they wipe out everything on Earth.  To do this, the Vampire Nation allies Blade with the Bloodpack, a team of specially trained vampires who were originally training to kill him. The Bloodpack, which consists of Reinhardt(Ron Perlman), Chupa(Matt Schulze), Snowman(Donnie Yen), Lighthammer(Daz Crawford), Verlaine(Marit Velle Kile), and Priest(Tony Curran), are a very tough bunch.  The group is headed by the vampire leader's own daughter, Nyssa(Leonor Varela).  So together Blade, Scud, Whistler, and the Bloodpack set off to eliminate the reaper threat.  Make no mistake, this movie rules.  It is far superior to ""Blade"" in almost every way.  The reapers are very cool looking.  You should also be on the lookout for one feature of the reapers that was not shown in the previews. ""Blade II"" is actually scary too.  ""Blade II"" is also less dark in tone than the first film.  ""Blade II"" also has a bit of humor, which is provided mostly by Norman Reedus and Ron Perlman.  The acting here is great too. Wesley Snipes does a fantastic job in this movie.  I had previously never heard of Luke Goss until I saw this movie.  He is fantastic as the evil and twisted Nomak.  I almost hate to say it, but he's even better than Stephen Dorff's Deacon Frost in the first film.As I said before, ""Blade II"" is one exciting, scary and exhilarating action film.  I can already see that this movie is going to be a smash at the box office, so don't be surprised.",Blade II
53,alindsay-al,Its okay but not as good as the original Blade,6,11 September 2014,I believe the original Blade is a highly underrated comic book film that is great but this film is okay and fails to live up to the level of the original. This film sees Blade ally with a group of Vampires to go against a new vampire hunting race that could affect vampires and humans alike. Wesley Snipes is fantastic as Blade and I really believe that he was the perfect casting for the mix of charisma and sturdiness for the character. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag I don't understand why Whistler was in this film but I thought he was good in the film. I thought the person who was looking like he was having the most fun was Ron Perlman who was great in his villainous role with his chemistry with Blade being really good. Blade's love interest is poor and a waste of time for the story and the main villain is not memorable at all. The story is poor compared to the first one with the romance being lazy and most of the team are not developed at all and the unnecessary bringing back of Whistler. The script is okay with Snipes and Perlman having the best lines and delivering well but nobody else had any decent lines at all. The style was great with the Gothic take of vampire lifestyle mixing with real life that makes this character so unique. Blade 2 is okay but it isn't as good as the original and I won't be rushing to see it again.,Blade II

Also Blade 2 is such a Nostalgic piece for me as it's such a product of it's time period that Early 2000's with it's style (All leather characters & cool as hell) & it's exciting adrenaline shots of very stylish action (Matrix style) & a itself in it's look & fabric of that time period of very early 2000's & i love it for that as that was my time at the Cinema days & fits my Nostalgia for this type of adrenaline & fast paced action sci-fi Horror flicks (Blade 2, Resident Evil, The Matrix, Underworld, Exit Wounds & many more)I loved this film since first seeing it twice in the Cinema bk in early 2000's & was absolutely blown away by how Awesome everything was & how absolutely incredible everything looked, i mean it's such a well thought out & richly detailed fantasy world in this Sequel.Wesley Snipes is great in his role again as Vampire Hunter Blade, he's as Cool as he was in the first film but here he has more Cool gadgets & stuff.The cast is top notch with veteran Kris Kristofferson bk as Blades right hand man, his all hill billy & angry & Luke Goss is excellent as the new breed of extremely deadly Vampire that feeds on other vamps & he's got a vendetta against the Vampire society & he plays it fantastically, he's scary as hell & would be cast again in Del Toro's Hellboy Sequel years later.Now here is the best part of this excellent action packed Horror-Thriller, it's the casting of the one & only THE PERL!!!! Yes, Ron Perlman steals the show once again (He did in Alien: Resurrection) as one of Blade's enemies named Reinhardt & he's one tough mutha, a big bald sonfa bitc# with a real bad attitude & yes Perlman is perfect for the role!!! This dude stole the movie even though he's a villain/badguy type, Ron just gives him such an attitude, such a lager than life presence & he looks so damn Cool too.

The Sewers set piece is where Perlman's tough & deadly Reinhardt shines best, he steals the show down there with his F-U attitude towards the Reapers that completely out number them & to how much danger this little team lead by Blade are in right now. Reinhardt doesn't like to take orders, especially from the Day Walker!!!

56,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A knockout and the best of the Blade films,10,3 July 2015,"Guillermo's Blade 2 is like Blade, except injected with a syringe containing 50cc's of adrenaline, an intricate blast of Del Toro's imaginative creature design, and a bit of red colored cocaine just for kicks (the vampires in the film snort that stuff like candy). There are few franchises where the sequel surpasses the original (terminator comes to mind), but this is definitely one. Don't get me wrong, I love the first Blade. It's just.. this one leaves it in the dust. Wesley Snipes returns as the original dark knight, hunting blood suckers and tossing one liners faster than he tosses UV light bombs. He's and wonder to behold in the fight scenes, all virile menace and energetic badass. He's forced to join forces with his vampire enemies to take on the terrifying reapers, led by Nomak (Luke Goss). There's so many characters, effects and set pieces happening it almost demands a rewatch or ten. Leonor Varela makes a sultry female vamp, Kris Kristofferson returns as the ever grouchy Whistler, Norman Reedus has a ball as Blade's stoner sidekick and Ron Perlman gets all the best lines (""like my daddy said right before he killed my mom.. you want anything right ya gotta do it yourself""), and there's a whole excellent supporting rogues gallery including Tony Curran, Karel Roden, Donnie Yen and Thomas Kretschmann. Del Toro works wonders with the action aesthetic and special effects, making us feel like we're really there watching these creatures of the night pound the ever loving hell out of each other in one fantastical, bloody, stylistic scene after the next. He never ceases to amaze me with his creativity and vision, and in my mind the Blade comics are a perfect outlet for that talent.

57,JoeKarlosi,Blade II (2002) BOMB,1,4 October 2006,"Dreadful. Everything is wrong with this sequel to the enjoyable BLADE, and its faults are typical of what's wrong with a large number of modern ""horror films"": all action and assaulting sfx and practically nothing else. I'm generally not a fan of CGI, but the computer graphic effects here are exceptionally amateurish and fake-looking. The characters on screen fight each other and leap about, looking as fake as those unreal computer game people the kids love to play with. In fact, when I saw this pathetic excuse for a movie in the theater I was so insulted that in my frustration I uncharacteristically leapt up for a few seconds for all to see, angrily pretending that I was manipulating Nintendo joysticks in some silly video game. My wife was embarrassed by this, as it's something I'd never do in the middle of a movie. I sat down quickly, but she wasn't nearly as red-faced by my behavior as I felt while watching this garbage. It's also a dark and dingy experience, very long, and all of its characters are equally uninteresting. Boring as hell in spite of all the mindless action bombarding you at every angle. Oh, and there also is some lousy Rap ""music"" tossed into the toilet with regularity too.

While I loved the fight scenes and the harder edge they all had, the film still felt lacking. It's weird, I enjoyed it, but it could have been so much more. Maybe it was Whistler's revival that was too awkward, or the Bloodpack being strange or the fact the part of Asad was over acted.

It made me a bit nauseous.I can also appreciate how the film is all about blade, but the story is told through the other characters.

61,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A doable followup but not as strong as Blade (1998),7,24 July 2015,"Although Marvel in the late 1990s was just beginning to produce and widely release live-action versions of their comic book properties, not many probably saw what would be the upcoming popularity of Wesley Snipes starring in Blade (1998). It might have been an obscure character at the time but that particular movie is what ignited the fuse for what would be Marvel today. With its stylized hard R action/horror and storytelling elements, it was definitely not the type of movie Marvel would release until more than half a decade later. It's weird too because with this powerhouse releasing up to roughly 3-4 properties a year (some of which are sequels) nowadays, it's surprising to see that the popular vampire hunter got his well deserved sequel after 4 years. Talk about neglect. With this entry there's a lot that was kept right but it did have more noticeable problems than the first.Like most sequels should start, the time Blade II (2002) takes place is a little after the first movie. After recovering the coordinates to where a group of vampires are holding his old friend Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) captive, Blade (Wesley Snipes) and tag-along techie Scud (Norman Reedus) are approached by Nyssa (Leonor Varela) a leader of pure blood vampires for assistance against a new type of vampire. The new vampire is named Nomak (Luke Gross) who not only feeds on humans but also other vampires (pure blood or not) and the after effects are still the same except they turn into what Nomak is. As the saying goes ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" or as Blade puts it ""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer"" - well put. As for putting Blade in a new situation, it's different and new. As for how the story is executed is another thing to be debated on. It's not that it doesn't work as entertainment because it is fun. The problem is that once viewers begin to see how things start unraveling, it becomes fairly predictable.A big question left unanswered is the return of Kris Kristofferson's character. It's not that nobody wanted him back but how it is quickly brushed over that doesn't look or feel legitimate. Apparently Whistler was held captive for years, but that's not the biggest question. The big one is how'd he recover from a headshot wound? So apparently he was bitten and turned - okay. Blade finds him and injects a remedy and was quickly cured. But if it was years since Blade recovered Whistler how'd he heal so easily? It doesn't make sense, plus the subplot of thinking that Whistler isn't fully recovered keeps being brought up but is never confirmed. What's the point? Comic book aficionado David S. Goyer again wrote the screenplay. It's appreciated that Goyer attempts at keeping everything straightforward but it's all in the wrong places. It's too straightforward in execution and not enough in subplot information.This is about it though in flaws. All the old and new characters are interesting to get to know or revisit. Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson still have great chemistry along with Leonor Varela (who is quite attractive). Co-starring Varela's character is Ron Perlman, Matt Schulze, Donnie Yen and a few others who play the pure blood vampire group. It also makes sense as to how Ron Perlman got cast to star in Hellboy (2004) since Guillermo del Toro is directing this feature. Another nice little addition that usually comes with the ""del Toro package"" is at least one creative creature design. If there's one thing del Toro works best with, it's creature effects/design. Here is no different - the new vampire that Nomak represents is much more threatening than Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) ever could have been. They have a special feature to their bite that is just jaw dropping. And for this alone, you know there'll be a good dose of horrific gore and action. This again no doubt is stylized action; full of sword play and fist fights. Always entertaining stuff.The cinematography by Gabriel Beristain in his first megahit movie was nicely shot. Beristain has had experience before but this would be his first work for a much bigger film that had a much larger release. All of Beristain's angles are steady, well lit and capture all the unique set designs. The music composed by Marco Beltrami had an interesting take and provides a different listening experience. With Beltrami's experience in the horror and action genre, it only feels appropriate that he could make the music his own. The only thing that Beltrami does not do the film right is creating a continuous main theme for Blade. The main title that cleverly mixes electronic synth and jazz like tunes is catchy but it's never revisited again. If Beltrami could make a memorable theme for Hellboy (2004) two years later, why not Blade II (2002)? The action cues are well constructed however, with loud percussion and horns. It's basically taking a horror score and injecting it with adrenaline. Bring it on.If paid attention to closely enough, the execution becomes fairly predictable and an explanation for a returning character goes unfinished. However, those errors do not sink this sequel below good quality. The hard action/horror elements, main characters' chemistry, music and cinematography help keep the vampire hunter vehicle running on all cylinders.",Blade II

But in this sequel, he fights WITH them against a group of reapers!I found this sequel to be pretty good!

63,philip_vanderveken,"I like the idea of a new approach, but wish for a little less action shots.",6,20 April 2005,"Blade is back and harder than ever. I had the feeling that this time the creators have payed more attention to the choreography of the different action and fight scenes and less to the story. Whether that is a good thing or not depends on your taste for movies of course. Personally I liked the first one better (although it has been a long time since I saw it, so the way I see it may not be entirely correct), but I still like movies with a good story. I know many people will disagree with me, but different people, different opinions I guess.In ""Blade II"" Blade forms an uneasy alliance with the vampire council in order to combat the 'Reapers'. This is a rare mutation of vampires and they feed on vampires as well on humans, transforming the victims in Reapers themselves. The council has to admit that they aren't able to control the problem and that they need Blade's help. Together with The Bloodpack, an elite team of vampires trained in all modes of combat to defeat the Reaper threat, Blade will try to prevent the Reapers from wiping out the entire vampire and human population...If you are looking for an adventure and action filled movie, than this is probably THE movie for you. It has plenty of it to offer and I'm sure that all the fans will love it. However, if you are, like me, more a fan of vampire films than action movies , then you might ask yourself why the first movie needed a sequel like this one? However, I also must say that I like the fact that they try an original and new approach to the centuries-old way of telling vampire tales. I'm not saying those should disappear, certainly not, but a new one now and then can make things even more interesting. Anyway, the movie left me a bit with a double feeling as you may understand. I give it a 6.5/10. It's OK, but could have been better.",Blade II

It's not scary because it has action! Maybe it's not that different, although it has a good plot. From this trilogy, I would say this is probably the best but I can't count on that, yet. Here's my explanation: I've only seen part of the first film, not even finishing it. Then I watched the third. Then I watched the first and didn't even finish it (again). Then I watched the second! So yeah, the whole series was a mix up.I like the way how this film can be seen without watching the first film because it helps explain the whole movie during the beginning, so it was not a problem watching this movie at all. This is a very fun and entertaining popcorn film! The action scenes are well made, with the use of the L-camera (is that how they call it?) and great choreography and CGI.Horror fans would also get to see some great kills and some squeamish scenes. This film is not meant to use realism. It's just to have fun. Wesley Snipes' acting was generally good as well as Leonor Varela. The creature and production design were all great.This is a different Guillermo del Toro work but it is a worthy addition. It's entertaining with the great action scenes and it's also filled with emotion (towards the end). Not scary, but if you want to watch an entertaining popcorn film, this is for you.",Blade II
65,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Better than the original by leaps and bounds, Guillermo Del Toro's ""Blade II"" is a furious, bloody, fun ride with some surprising emotion...",9,17 February 2012,"The 2002 New Line release ""Blade II"" is directed by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth), from a script by David S. Goyer. (Blade, Batman Begins) A sequel to the 1998 Stephen Norrington comic-book film, ""Blade II"" is, in every sense, one of those rare sequels that is a triumph over the original, which is no small feat, as the original a strong film in its own right, and is arguably one of the films whose success with the public lead to the modern popularity of comic-book films, and brought about modern classics like ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""The Dark Knight."" (Which was co-written by Goyer)This film picks up a few years after the original. Half-man, Half-vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes) has finally tracked down his former friend and mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristopherson), whom is being held in suspended animation in Prague by a group of vampires. After saving him and ridding his blood of the vampiric virus, Blade and Whistler (along with a new sidekick Scud, played by Norman Reedus) are attacked by two vampiric assassins, who reveal that they were sent by aging elder Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) to ask Blade for help. Blade is forced to team up with a pack of vampires employed by Damaskinos (called ""The Blood Pack"") in order to battle the ""Reapers""- genetically manufactured ""Super-Vampires"" that have gone out of control, and have the ability (and urge) to kill human and vampire alike.The plot is a bit silly, but then again, no sillier than the ""Blood God"" from the first film. The film really works well for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, this is obviously a Guillermo Del Toro film- his distinct and poetic visual style is present, and his camera work is beautiful and elegant. His direction and visual sense is quite astounding, which is a big part of why he is one of my favorite directors of modern cinema. In addition, Marco Beltrami's magnificent and tragic/Gothic score serves as a perfect compliment to Del Toro's masterful direction- the film is a treat for the senses, and is much more elegant than you'd think a film about vampires and martial-arts fights would be.The acting is very strong. Snipes and Kristopherson deliver subtle, powerful performances, and all of the secondary characters (such as Scud, Damaskinos, and Leonor Varela as Damaskino's beautiful daughter) are all fantastic. Special points go to Blood Pack members played by Ron Perlman and Donnie Yen, whom are just a joy to watch, and are a lot of fun.The action is a step up this time. The first film had some solid action, but it suffered from what I call ""Pre-2000"" syndrome (when films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" became more prevalent). By that, I mean that the action in the first film felt a little manufactured and didn't flow as nicely as it could have. Here, the action has a more operatic, ballet-like flair, which works better on the big screen. (Save for a few wire-fu moments that left me gagging) There is also a grander scope to this film's action, and it just feels more thrilling.The visual effects are surprisingly strong, but have some problems, which is where this film loses a point. In 2002, when this came out, CGI artists hadn't quite yet ""gotten"" how to render people. (And some movies, even today, 10 years later, have this problem) A lot of the effects are improved. When vampires ""Ash"" (disintigrate), they look much more convincing than in the first film, which looked... well, bad. Also, the effects work on the reapers (who have split-jaws and a phallic, alien-like tongue) was amazing, and looked perfectly real. But for whatever reason, there are a number of shots where Blade (and others) are rendered using CGI models, and it looks... really pathetic. They look like plastic dolls (with bad lighting), and move in a hysterically unnatural way. It really takes you out of the movie at times.But asides from that one (fairly major) complaint, this is arguably the perfect ""Blade"" film, and it is the finest of the trilogy. I give this a great 9 out of 10. See this movie!",Blade II
66,Luigi Di Pilla,WHAT A MESS !!,1,9 November 2002,"It was not what I expected and after thirty minutes my wife asked me to stop this mess. She was going to be sick and me too. This is absolutely a catastrophic movie and I never thought that this would happen for a sequel. But what we learn about this is not new: the sequels are every time a bad copy of the first one. I have to admit that I liked the first film. I imagined to see something of the nicest place in the world that is Prag and where the film has been turned. Instead of from beginning it is always dark and there are too many stupid and unnecessary brutal scenes. There is no suspense and the special effects seems not to be real. I highly recommend to stay far away from this one. Sorry, there is no place for it in my best of dvd collection. 0/10.",Blade II
67,uds3,Vampires you really don't wanna mess with!,8,29 July 2002,"Oh yeah, Oh yeah - this is right up there when ur talking serious action fare! Totally counter to the norm, this sequel is streets ahead of the original in terms of style, action, choreography...even testosterone tease. It even manages to flow on reasonably well from the original tale with Snipes awesome in his re-incarnation as the martial-arts vampire vigilante with a cool line in both armaments and fashion sense.If one had gotten Ridley Scott, Dario Argento and John Woo together on a horror/action flick collaboration, BLADE II might have been the outcome. A tad low on plot development? Jeez, give me a break...who goes to see a flick like this looking for character and plot development for God's sake? Certainly not the theater full of actions fans I saw this with the other night. It gob-smacked the entire audience!Few of you would not know by now that ""Blade"" is put on a new ""case"" this time...hired by the very vampires he hunts so well, to eradicate a bunch of genetically altered super-munchers that feed on their own kind. Most of the film plays pretty much as a re-run of ALIENS, even down to the new breed's retractable mandibles - half Ripleyesque, half PREDATOR unplugged! Derivative or not, this thing rocks. Very RESIDENT EVILish at times with arguably the most stunning fight sequences ever presented. By comparison, BLADE 1 is for wimps.Call me sick, but I personally found the night-club sequence where some remarkably good looking female vampires were being disembowelled and/or having their backs ripped apart to satisfy the blood lust of their companions, totally erotic! As many have commented, the film generates a savage desire to be bitten oneself and to be able to share in this gratuitously violent existence. Ron Perlman, sartorially resplendant as the gothically unchallengable and virtually indestructible Reinhardt, has probably come up with his finest role here. The concluding confrontation between him and Blade is as good as anything I have ever seen. The viewer could never say they were short-changed here!A celebration of vampiric evil, offhand I cannot nominate a more adrenalin pumping children-of-the-night tale. ""Stylish"" doesn't adequately cover it! I agree, the fx range from campy at best to straight out jaw-dropping (pun-intended) However the less effective sequences are thankfully very short. Leonor Varela hands us the best-looking euro-vampire yet (mind you, the setting is Prague!)and if ever she needs to bite someone....I will gladly take a ticket and stand in line!My ONLY complaint is the pathetic and totally inappropriate last scene which single handedly destroys the credibility and emotional power of the previous one (the rising sun!) It was unnecessary and should have been cut leaving Blade (and the audience) alone that dawn, with just their own thoughts.Tremendous effort all round. If you don't like it, you have no imagination, no taste for horror films and no right having been in the theater in the first place! No self-respecting vampire would look at you twice!",Blade II

69,DJAkin,The Return of Whistler!,5,31 March 2002,"This movie was good because Whistler was in it!  Sure, Blade was good but Whistler stole the movie.  Whistler had all the good lines and fought really good.  What I liked most was when Whistler would get mad at Scud or that one Vampire and call them names like NIPPLEHEAD.  Whistler questioned Blade a few times but that was just because he was like a father figure and just looking out for him.  What I liked about Blade 2 was that the bad vampires looked like Nosferatu.  It's been way too long since we've had a good Vampire flick where the blood suckers truly look like Nosferatu.  That is where Blade 1 lacked.  If you're going to make a movie about Vampires then make them look like monsters, not some GQ person from the makeup department. Whistler never fails to deliver.  Kris always plays that role well.  Too bad he didn't get nominated for a best supporting actor award in Blade 1. Perhaps this will be the year for Whistler.  Also, what's the deal with that good looking Vampire dying at the very end?  It was too emotional and made me think of Kirsten Dunst from Interview w/ Dracula.  All in all this was an ok movie.  Whistler made it watchable.",Blade II

71,oneguyrambling,"Better than any ""killin' Vampires"" movie has a right to be.",8,6 November 2010,"Blade 2 opens in a seedy looking ""blood clinic"" in the Czech Republic, where the guy who was in the 80s boy band ""Bros"" (seriously) anxiously awaits his appointment time. Bros is Nomak, and it looks like he is to be a victim of a trap untilThe credits start, and Blade himself does a voice-over that gets us up to speed - a useful technique that is over in around 3 minutes - and kills two birds with one stone. Newbies and those that forgot are updated, and we know who edited the film and other miscellaneous stuff that no-one pays attention to.We catch up with Blade in a 6 minute scene that effectively shows us everything that is cool about Blade, (and why he deserves better films than Blade:Trinity).Cool weapons and toys, including a muscle car. - Heavily stylised movements, violence and stunts. - Cheesy jokes and dry dialogue. - Cool karate moves and a no mercy approach to killing vamps. - The man wears his sunglasses at night! COME ON!At the end of the scene Blade saves Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who I would never picked as the guy who would say ""Like hammered sh*t"" and make it sound cool.So we're 10 minutes in, we know the primary guys and their background, now we can go into the Blade 2 plot. Mmmmmm, that's good movie-making.After a momentary digression to meet Josh, Blade's new ""assistant"" who calls himself ""Scud"" and called Blade ""B"" for some reason, Blade announces that he is giving Whistler some stuff.Then the vampires drop by for a visit to tell Blade and crew about the latest threat to mankind, called Reapers. (But not before it is clearly evident by some very dodgy CGI work that not all the budget went to special effects.)After a brief chat the Blade posse hitch a ride to Vampire HQ for the exposition part of the film, where the next 90 minutes are nicely mapped out for us, allowing Blade to get to the serious business of killing various things.Blade is told all about the Reapers by head vampire Damaskinos - which in short are a threat to both vampire and human - he is introduced to his soldiers for the mission. They are called the Blood Pack and include the usual Gen X crew of tattooed, pierced muscle bound freaks, including the underrated Ron Perlman and the horribly under-utilised (in this film) Donnie Yen. There are three ""BIG"" scenes in the film. The first is the stakeout and search of the House of Pain, a vampire club. Coincidentally the best bit of Blade by far was also the scene in the vampire club, at least Blade 2 has several other scenes which are almost as good, which the original did not.I know I'm getting older now, but I still would think it a bit odd when 8 odd heavily armed and shirtless guys walk into a club unchecked, and no-one even bats (pun not intended) an eye.The scene is given time to play out, we witness all the kinks and quirks of the vampires in their ""natural habitat"", and the tension builds once it is evident that Blade will face the Reapers for the first time.And when the Pack finally do meet the Reapers in the flesh, it still gives me tingles when the ""Woah"" moment arrives.In the first showdown between Blade and Nomak it appears that they are quite evenly matched, and that Nomak has had some karate lessons on the sly, we are given a taste of what might come, but ultimately it is left for later.The second BIG scene occurs when the Blood Pack and Blade venture into the tunnels to take on the Reapers in their home turf, even though it contains much of the action and killing in the movie it is simply a prelude for the even BIG-ger finale to come.The final BIG scene is the showdown that occurs at vampire HQ, and it has everything that a grown boy needs from his vampire flick: torture, stylised violence, faceless henchmen that are really only fodder between boss fights, WWE Smackdown moves, blood-baths and of course SUNGLASSES!If you were underwhelmed by Blade, or can't be bothered with most comic book adaptations I would still urge you to check this out. Blade 2 isn't just Del Toro cutting his teeth, it is a really solid movie when considered on its merits. It stands head and shoulders above Blade and (especially) Blade:Trinity, neither of which I own.The movie is violent, of course it is. But once you are able to get your head around the fact that Blade is simply butchering vampires and reapers, (none of which exist guys), all thoughts of how gratuitous it all is should vanish. This is the same with zombies really; vampires and zombies don't exist, and if they do they're already dead anyway, so killing them is perhaps a little redundant and therefore warranted.This movie is so stylised that I argued one day that it should almost be the first movie shot entirely in slo-mo, that ""honour"" eventually went to Zack Snyder's 300, which turned 80 minutes of action into a 2 hour flashy crawl.All in all I strongly recommend Blade 2, it obviously has good production values, with set design, costumes and even music that complements the action, and Del Toro knows when to build up to something, and then how to stage a big set piece.Final rating – 8.5 / 10. Up there with The Dark Knight as one of the best comic adaptations going. I've watched this 4 or 5 times now and it never gets old.

72,xredgarnetx,Great fight scenes,6,28 October 2007,"BLADE II has our antihero uneasily joining forces with the vampire league to wipe out the Reapers, a group of degenerate vampires that prey on vampires. What Blade is actually doing is walking into a trap, but that's to be expected, and the climax of BLADE II plays out in similar fashion to BLADE. What sets this sequel apart from and possibly above BLADE are the fight sequences. They are spectacular, and the CGI used to make some of the more spectacular fight gags is less obtrusive this time round. Mr. Snipes as Blade is in fine form once again, and Kris Kristofferson is back as Blade's aide de camp. The delectable Lenor Varela provides the romantic interest as a fellow vampire, and Ron Perlman has a strong supporting role as one of several warrior vampires sent to aid Blade in his quest.

Blade II is no difference. I will be honest. I didn't see Blade I. Wasn't interested. Didn't grab me. I knew of the Comix, I thought Wesley Snipes was a great cast. But for some reason, I didn't get into that one as I had this one. I found it interesting, watchable,gross. I like that kinda thing!
In Blade II we have another evolution of Vampires that actually make sense. Yes, as I get older, I am sick of the traditional Vampire..even those who rip open the neck and expose flesh. Whoopie. Ya seen it once, ya seen it 1,000 times. Here, I see it--and more, and the thing about it is..its very interesting and different.The story was 'alright', but remember I didn't see Blade I. It didn't take Blade I to see and like Blade II which is another plus for this film. The minuses for me was the teeny-tiny possible love interest, I could have done without it. And the new vampire elite squad, I would have liked a tad more character development on them, I found them interesting but I never got to know them. Kris Kristofferson's character seemed like there was more than meets the eye, but went nowhere in this sequel. The twists and turns in Blade II were fine, but could have been much, much sharper developed. I felt it was made into a 'machismo' type film....throw in great martial arts and...wow! No need for that really. The film should have just evolved.The film should have developed more about Blade, his new relationship to his mentor and those evolved vampires vs. the elite vampire crew. Don't get me wrong, ""something"" was there, but not enough. Including the fighting. I love a good fight, several of them in fact. But I love Guillermo del Toro, and needed more of his vision. (Is it on the editing floor ready for DVD extra minutes, perhaps?)All in all, Blade II is watchable if you like this kinda genre and I do. Don't let the kids watch, for sure. It's interesting and could be better. In saying this, I know there's probably a Blade III.

Problem is, it leaves this horrible aftertaste.  With the first movie it was more of a action movie than a horror movie.  This time it's more horror than action.  So if you liked the first movie, this movie might confuse you.I don't even consider it much of a sequel.  Just another Blade movie. It's totally bizarre.  With the first movie, it was almost believeable, but Blade 2 tip toes into the unreal realm.  Blade was about vampires.  Blade 2's vampire decendents look like something off of either Dark City or Alien.Biggest gripe is how utterly fake the CGI is.  (I haven't seen CGI this fake since Harry Potter) The first movie had great cgi, but in Blade 2 not only is the movement fake, but some of it isn't even finished.

77,mattymatt4ever,For fans only,4,15 September 2002,"If you're a fan of comic books or comic book movies, then please disregard my comments.  ""Blade 2"" is slick, flashy and well-made.  It's packed with action and most of it is well-choreographed.  But I just couldn't get into it.  I didn't find the plot all too appealing, the little plot there was. This is basically an action showcase.  The first minute you see Blade pop up on screen and beat the crap out of these ugly vamps, you wanna cheer.  But after a while, the action runs its course.  With a stronger script, I think this movie could've gone a lot farther.  The special f/x are elaborate, the soundtrack is way cool.  Aesthetically, Guilermo Del Toro did a fine job.
I saw the original ""Blade"" and thought it was pretty good.  It could've been a lot better, but it was entertaining.  I loved the opening shot of the original, in the vampire club where the blood sprays from the ceiling. That was a beautiful scene in a demented, perverted sort of way.  But I had a hard time watching the sequel without my mind drifting off.  I love Wesley Snipes, and recently he hasn't been in too many movies.  So it was good to see him on screen again.  I really don't see too much of Kris Kristofferson, and as old as he is, he still maintains a cool presence.  If you do happen to rent or buy the DVD, please don't skip out on the commentary with Wesley Snipes and writer David Goyer.  Snipes has an incredibly good sense of humor.  It was almost like Snipes and Goyer were doing an episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 2000.""  So instead of hearing pretentious comments about how great working with this person was and how great this scene was, they blurt out all sorts of hysterical things.  It's great to know that a fine actor can lay back, watch his own movie and simply have fun with it.
I've grown desensitized to most graphic violence in films, but even for vampire movie standards, I will say that the gore factor in ""Blade 2"" is tremendous.  So if you're squeamish, this really isn't the film for you.

However there maybe a double-cross among the proceedings. Blade II is a sequel that manages to be even better than it's predecessor. For one the action sequences are imaginatively staged and the gore level is even larger. Snipes as usual has the silent hero thing down pat and Kristofferson is always a welcome sight but the script this time is written with more depth and the relationships between characters manage to give this more of a watchable edge.

You may remember that in the last film Whistler (Kristofferson) appeared to be killed off, well the audience was deceived and he wasn't killed off. Blade is doing his job while looking for clues to find his old friend. Filling Whistlers role at home with Blade is Scud (Norman Reebus), a young wannabe cool kid who enjoys making vampire slaying equipment and watching powerpuff girls while toking on a big fat spliff. Blade finds Whistler and attempts to detox him. All of a sudden Black Ops vampires (Leonor Varela a.k.a. Nyssa, and Danny John Jules a.k.a. Asad) infiltrate Blade's base of operations with a message from the vampire overlord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann). Blade and his merry gang of slayers agree to meet the Vampire overlord who tells them that a mutant vampire strain is making a new breed, dubbed Reapers. The only way to stop the mutation is to kill his alpha carrier Nomak (Luke Goss, who is great BTW), killing him will kill all the reapers he has created as they are linked via blood. Blade begrudgingly agrees to join the Black Ops Vampire team, a.k.a. The Bloodpack which features random vagabond bad-add vampires such as Reinhart (Ron Perlman), Priest (Tony Curren) and Lighthammer (Daz Crawford). Working with Vampires to bring down a mutant vampire lets Blade be exposed to the real underground Vampire world, his hope is that working with the vampires will allow him to learn enough about them to bring them all down in the future. And so, the epic journey and battle begins. This film goes a long way to better the first Blade film and it actually does it in parts. The main gripes in this for me are Whistlers return after being killed in the first film, the overuse of obvious CGI in some of the fight scenes with Blade, and the obvious plot twist which is looming with Scud. Apart from those things the film is actually more mayhem and chaos than the first film which actually works really well. Despite it working good as a comic-book fan this isn't the Blade I'm used to, there are obvious attempts at humour and puns within the film which isn't Blade, but unless you are a comic purist like me you'll probably enjoy it. The origin story is featured in the film again (directly stolen from the first film) so you do not have to have seen the first film to work out where Blade comes from and how he got his powers. I enjoyed this film, maybe not as much as the first film because that had charm and style mixed with a good plot and dialogue. As an action film though this film excels beyond the first film, I just think there was more potential that could have been milked from this. Blade's relationship with Nyssa maybe or using the member of the bloodpack more - bearing in mind Donnie Yen (Snowman) has a lot of experience in the martial arts combat choreography featured throughout this film. All in all though Guilllermo Del Torro has made a great film which fits nice in the series of Blade films or works as a standalone. Like the first the musical score is upbeat and pacey much like the film. 7 out of 10",Blade II
80,CitizenCaine,A Worthy Sequel,6,14 January 2004,"Wesley Snipes returns as the day-walker in this worthy sequel to the original Blade. The plot is less formulaic than the first one, which is especially necessary in sequels when the newness of the originality of the characters disappears. This time Blade teams up with select vampires to hunt a more deadly threat to both vampires and humans. There's tension between Blade/Whistler and the vampires, and Blade starts to fall for one of the vampires. There are several more good plot turns that follow. The action is fierce and swift, even more so than in the first movie. However, the vampire lore takes more of a back seat in this film, and the effects are far more intrusive and grotesque in this film. Kris Kristofferson once again plays the crusty Whistler, although his reappearance in this film is somewhat dubious. Ron Perlman is a worthy adversary as one of the select group of assassins. Donnie Yen does a good turn as the sword wielding member of the group; I would like to have seen more of him. The third Blade movie will be coming in Spring I believe, and it will certainly be worth seeing. **1/2 of 4 stars.",Blade II
81,jhclues,Solid Horror Film,7,5 April 2002,"Wesley Snipes is back in the role of the title character, in this offering that leans decidedly more toward the Wes Craven horror/action side of the genre than to Anne Rice gothic, and be advised that there is enough blood-letting and gore on hand to appease even the most insatiable viewer, in `Blade II,' directed by Guillermo del Toro.  	Half human, half vampire, Blade has all of the powers of the vampire, but none of the weaknesses; he is called `Daywalker' by his sworn enemies, the vampires he has vowed to destroy, because of his ability to move about unimpaired in the light of day.  And, knowing his mission, the vampires have formed and trained a special unit, the `Bloodpack,' whose sole purpose is to hunt Blade down and eliminate him, before he can get to them. 
	But the story begins with an unusual twist:  Instead of hunting Blade down to kill him, the vampire `Shadow Council' reaches out to him with the offer of an alliance; in fact, they want him to lead the Bloodpack against a new enemy, one who threatens to wipe out the living and the undead alike, if allowed to proliferate.  They are mutant vampires known as `Reapers,' a new breed with a thirst for blood that is unquenchable.  Initially, Blade demurs, until the vampires provide him with proof of what the Reapers can do.  	Before he will begin, however, Blade first secures the aid of an ally and weapons expert named Scud (Norman Reedus), then insists on tracking down his old friend Whistler (Kris Kristoffererson), whom he has not seen for some time, and fears has been `turned' by the vampires.  And when that is accomplished, and once the entire team is in place, Blade and the Bloodpack begin their nocturnal hunt for the Reapers.	Del Toro has crafted and delivered a movie that is pure action and entertainment, geared to those whose appetites run especially toward the blunt, hard-edged and graphic.  And once it begins, the blood flows freely (including a vat of the stuff); rest assured, all who enter here will have their thirsts quenched.  Del Toro presents the story itself in a fairly straightforward manner, offers a couple of twists and has enough threads going to successfully hold it all together within the framework of the action.  Most importantly, he provides the kind of thrills that get the blood pumping and the adrenaline flowing, and the F/X are first rate (get ready for a rush when one of the Reapers opens his mouth and zeros in on the throat of a victim).	For a film like this to work, it is dependent on the ability of the audience to suspend disbelief and be able to immerse themselves in the story, and to do that, the protagonist must at least be a credible character.  And that's what Wesley Snipes gives you as Blade.  He's got the moves and the look, and he makes it convincing to a degree that enables you to go with the flow without having to think too much about the whys and the wherefores of it all.  This is pure escapist fare, and Snipes provides exactly the kind of character it needs to be successful. 
	The supporting cast includes Ron Perlman (Rienhardt), Luke Goss (Nomak), Leonor Varela (Nyssa), Matt Schulze (Chupa), Danny John-Jules (Asad), Donnie Yen (Snowman), Daz Crawford (Lighthammer), Rey-Phillip Santos (Red Eye/Reaper), Thomas Kretschmann (Pox) Tony Curran (Priest), Pete Lee-Wilson (Blood Bank Doctor) and Marit Velle Kile (Verlaine).  In the end, what you see is what you get, and what you get is very likely to be exactly what you expected from `Blade II,' which is plenty of blood-drenched action wrapped around a story soaked with intrigue, betrayal and things that go bump (in a BIG way) in that long, eternal night of the undead.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.",Blade II
82,CharltonBoy,Fangtastic!,8,8 April 2004,Well what a cracking film Blade II is. I must admit i wasnt expecting too much considering the first film was average but this blows the first film out of the water! The story is superb but what makes this film is the action and special affects. The computer graphics are of the best i have ever seen. The way the Vampires turn to smouldering ash when attacked by silver is quite amazing and looks so real. This is also very gory so i would not recommend this for kids but if you love action horrors that keep you gripped i cant recommend this highly enough. Quite Brilliant. 8 out of 10.,Blade II
83,ivo-cobra8,An imaginative awesome the best stylish action film ever made!,10,30 October 2015,"Blade II (2002) is the vampire superhero action horror sequel film to the original film Blade (1998). We have a kick ass sequel to an R rated kick ass first movie you go the mix of Daryl Dixon who still looks the same and a ball headed Hellboy Excellent!!! Blade II is an awesome movie!!!! Not only does it takes 4.years for this movie to come out since the last movie, but we see Wesley Snipes returning as Blade and he Is awesome!! I love this film but I love the first one way more. It is my second favorite in the Blade trilogy series. So in this movie Blade is on a search for a Whistler, who is now a vampire in this movie. He tracks him down, he finds him, than he meets up with this group of vampires called the Bloodpack. They need his help to track down Nomak (Luke Goss. and he has basically an ability to turn vampires in to Repears that can hunt both vampires and humans. So, yea...That's your basic plot. There are a lot of twist from here and now, but it is AWESOME! Because Wesley Snipes knows all those martial arts, they are nice to look at, and since it is 2002 we now got in to the phase, where the fights scenes are awesome and the choreographer says something once heavy handed, you will see bloody violence right away when the character turns in to an CGI model and it is shown trough whole movie, you can really see that, specially old dude drops kicks, kicks Blade right in the face and goes in to an CGI character, you can kind a see that, kind a weak, but does it track down from the movie? Hell to the no! This movie is awesome!!!!! The beginning of the movie, in the first 10 minutes, Blade already kills like 25 people. That's how it is done, just like in the first movie! He killed like 50 or 60 people from the very beginning of the movie it is AWESOME!!! Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) is a bad ass! He is amazing bad ass! Norman Reedus like I said before still looks 12.year old boy, he is still Daryl Dixon, he still has the same hair style, the same look stubborn on his face and he looks like damn, don't you age boy. And you voice is going now heavy now todays world, but don't you age. Ron Perlman is awesome, he loves to make you hate him, but you can't hate him because he is Ron Perlman, you just laugh at him, because he is such a bad ass and he is such a an awesome, he is so awesome! Where is Hellboy III. Even in Alien: Resurrection (1997) Ron Perlman was standout in that film, come on, the man is just AMAZING! The effects in this movie is pretty good too, besides the fight scenes when they turn the CGI character however, but that's okay I can kind a forget about it because Spider-Man (2002) come out the same year, of course they also did do the same thing, yea, I guess you have to live, with that back than, I'm pretty sure they can do better now this days. Choreograph and everything, Guillermo del Toro takes over, this movie has director, David S. Goyer returns as the writer in this movie. David S. Goyer is a good writer, I have to give him that, he is an awesome writer! How do you make Blade even a more bad ass, than he already was? I think that was possible, it is possible. This movie it is possible and it is awesome! Wesley Snipes has that charm back again, he has that to be a bad ass, but it has that humor aside Blade II, like in the strip club or whatever they were at. Ron Perlman really was about to shoot Blade and Blade had him track down at his gun and he sit like smiling, Wesley Snipes your gold boy your Gold!!! Without the doubt, the acting in this movie is awesome, Effects are awesome, Action is awesome, story is awesome, Cinematography it is kinda even a bad ass, you actually feel bad for one of the characters, tough she was cute, I am just saying. In the end of the day Blade II is one of the best sequel ever, you have to watch this movie!!!!! Guillermo Del Toro is endlessly imaginative when it comes to creating new style, action, and ideas for the vampire mythology. Now the plot doesn't have much character development, but it has just enough interesting twists to keep you interested as well as entertained. And like I said, if you are looking for a movie with brains, this movie should meet your criteria, but if you appreciate brawn, this will blow you away. The sword-wielding warrior Blade (Wesley Snipes - ""Demolition Man,"" ""White Men Can't Jump"") returns to fight the Reapers, a new race of super vampires hell-bent on annihilating all other vampires before destroying the entire human race. Blade aligns himself with a high-powered team of vampires to defeat an evil greater than either has ever battled.9/10 my second favorite in the Blade trilogy my number one will always be Blade the first one.",Blade II

86,FilmOtaku,"Not as good as the first, but still a decent flick",6,10 December 2004,"As Scud (Norman Reedus), an armory expert who Blade has employed since we last saw him in the original ""Blade"" says, ""Lock up your daughters boys and girls, the dark knight returns."" Blade (Wesley Snipes) is back, and this time, he is forced to form an uneasy alliance with the Shadow Council, the elite group of vampires he normally is fighting to eliminate. The reason is that there is a new mutation of vampire in the population that is spreading rapidly, vampires called ""Reapers"" who feed on other vampires. Blade is talked into helping the Shadow Council find and kill the Reapers because once they run out of vampires, the logical progression would be to move on to humans. Blade is assisted in this endeavor by The Bloodpack, a group of highly trained vampires employed by the Shadow Council who have ironically been training the last two years solely in the art of killing Blade himself. We also see the return of Whistler, (Kris Kristofferson) and the introduction of the aforementioned Scud.In terms of story, ""Blade II"" is pretty good. The constant tension between The Bloodpack and Blade provide both dramatic and hilarious moments alike, particularly between Blade and Reinhardt (Ron Perlman). There seemed to be more humor overall in this film, and it was done well. Director Guillermo del Toro (""Hellboy"") gives us a film that is full of style and some pretty cool monsters, (and great makeup) but some of the special effects used during the fight scenes in particular were mediocre at best. Perhaps, being a film fan who doesn't put action films at the forefront of her film preferences, I am being a little simplistic in my views, but I often question why, if something just doesn't look good on the screen, an alternate method of presenting that scene isn't used. I'm referring mainly to the fight scene between Blade and one of the Shadow Council messengers that takes place in front of a wall of lights where the CGI figures looked ridiculously cartoonish. Again, I am merely an observer of action films, not a lover of them, so perhaps my view is too plebeian.""Blade II"" was another enjoyable popcorn flick that falls into the usual sequel category  not as good as the original, but in this case, it is at least an enjoyable, fun movie to watch. 6/10 --Shelly",Blade II
87,AngelHonesty,Better Then the First,6,10 January 2020,"This film follows suit with the first, as it's mainly about Wesley fighting/Killing creatures.

88,ghostfiendghost,Better than the first,6,20 January 2019,"Its interesting to see an earlier film of Del Toro in action

89,nicholls905-280-546911,Decent sequel,10,26 January 2020,"When a sequel changes its director, it wasn't a great sign. Norrington delivered a stylish vampire hit and deserved to return to the seat, but apparently chose not to. Enter Del Toro and if you've followed his career, the guy is a visionary. Blade 2 is essentially Blade part II. That's an important thing to note, as the storyline thread is heavy connected to the first. The film is far from the first film and the filmmaker ensures this is a completely different film. I love this film and the first. Both filmmakers had strong visual styles and it was a shame neither would assist the third film. The villain is well constructed and unlike Frost from the first film, he could kill Blade from the beginning. The film has a fun cast and a filmmaker at the beginning of his career. There's some minor errors, but they could be due to budget lags and a rushed production.",Blade II
90,gigan-92,Best of the Three No Doubt!!,9,18 July 2009,"The best of the Blade trilogy no doubt, and one of my personal favorite films of all time!!! If you thought 'Blade"" was a decent action flick, ""Blade 2"" will blow your mind, proving effortlessly that it out does it's predecessor easily. WWWHy? Because one of the greatest directors has taken over: Guillermo del Toro! Guillermo really gives the film the tone the first one lacked, in pretty much every aspect possible. The lighting is more eerie, the villains much more threatening, etc., etc. First off, I love the cast!! Wesley Snipes and Kristofferson both return, both a host of new characters arrive, much more lively and likable ones to add to this. Where as Norman Reedus' performance is top notch and Leonor Varela is sexy as hell, Ron Perlman!!He steals the show in my opinion with his fantastic performance. It is characters such as the Blood Pack that make this film much more enjoyable than the first. The sense of conflict of Blade working with his own enemies to defeat a bigger threat, while still having its light touches of humor, is great. David Goyer really out did himself here. The art direction is stunning, from The House of Pain to the sewers, everything really sets the mood of the film as a scary-comic book come to life. Luke Goss as Nomak is dope and this time the end fight is truly pulse pounding! The pacing is better and the action seems literally non-stop. Also, we dive deeper into Blade's inner demons as he begins to challenge his hatred of his own kind and the story is simply great here. And the score is even better, this time Marco Beltrami being the composer. Tradgic, emotional, chilling, the score delivers the right tone at the right time. Such as Nomak, as when the audience finds out his true origins, the music is sad and remorseful for him, rejected by his own father. ""Blade 2"" is definitely one of my top hero flicks of all time!!",Blade II
91,jucsetmai,Blade II on 4k ultra hd,9,12 September 2021,"The Bloodhunt Begins...........
Not all follow-ups are created equal, nor do they surpass there original movies. The general rule of part II's is that they are do be bigger in scope and feature much more action and body counts depending on the genre in which it falls. Blade II certainly passed that on all levels. Case in point when you get writer/director Guillarmo Del Toro behind the camera then it's game on and man does he do it with this sequel. Everything is amped up to movie geek level with no detail left untouched and the performances given at full A+ status. A perfect sequel from start to finish. Blade II's high-def debut also looks fantastic. Images are finely detailed and crisp. Audio works all 7.1 channels with ease and fills the room with perfect sound balance and subtlety. All of the bonus features from the DVD have been ported over. Nothing should stop you from picking this up today...... Coming soon on Warner Bros 4k ultra hd release December.",Blade II
92,Bogmeister,Blade & Vampires & Reapers & Tigers & Bears,6,17 February 2006,"When you do a sequel, one option to not simply repeat the events of the first film is to up the ante. In this follow-up to the first Blade(98), we not only have the standard vampires to contend with, but a new threat called Reapers, which feed on vampires, just as vampires feed on humans. There is also an elite group of bad-ass vampires teaming up with bad-ass Blade (Snipes), though you tend to forget they're vamps at this point; they come across as a new team of super-heroes. Of course, sooner or later, vamps tend to revert to form, but there's less of the standard bloodsucking and more of the standard martial arts swordplay. The plot is a bit more complex than the 1st pic, with some backstabbing and counterplots revealed late in the game. The new monsters, the Reapers, a more extreme version of vampirism, provide the horror angle.So, in all, you end up with a film with numerous genres mixed together to form an unusual super-hero horror soufflé. You need only be familiar with director del Toro's monster picture ""Mimic""(97) to appreciate the flavor he strives for. Like his previous film, this is heavy on grotesque creature visuals, quite unusual even in this day and age, but usually covered in a familiar slime. The combo of computer FX and advanced puppetry is admittedly impressive, though some of the long shots of creatures jumping from wall to wall become cartoon-like. Snipes as the hero is more relaxed in this 2nd go around, and they brought back Whistler (Kristofferson), supposedly killed in the 1st flic, a somewhat contrived plot turn. Perlman as another vamp overplays his hand a little, but del Toro was right to bring him along for ""Hellboy"" a couple of years later. The climactic fight is pretty brutal, with both combatants showing off their superhuman abilities to the extreme. By the end, however, you may wish Blade had focused more on his life mission instead of reacting to the machinations of others throughout most of the story.",Blade II

A new vampire order clan joins up with Blade and Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) as they must try to exterminate these vicious and very dangerous creatures.Electrifying and ultra-violent sequel to the hit 1998 Marvel comic based movie that reunites Snipes and Kristofferson with a new cast especially Ron Perlman as one of the good vampires. Guillermo Del Toro (""Hellboy"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"") directs this movie with his visual style as impressive as always makes this movie far bigger then the first one. There's gore abound, great action sequences, good performances even by Perlman and a unique different type of vampire that you don't see everyday in an average vampire movie.A must see sequel!",Blade II

The decision to have Blade team up with vampires in this film was brilliant and really ratchets up the tension. The addition of Guillermo Del Toro in the director's chair adds a certain flair as well. The villain is a little lackluster compared to the first one, but still offers something unique.

95,LebowskiT1000,Pretty good sequel,8,25 March 2002,"I was pretty pleased with ""Blade II"" for the most part.  There was a lot of things that I didn't like, but not enough to ruin the movie for me.  Some of the fight scenes were down-right incredible, but a few times the director went a little overboard with the computer effects.  Some of the scenes looked a little silly due to the computer effects.  This is going to sound a little odd, but I thought some of the fight scenes were a little too much of a comic book (flying all over the place, people getting thrown across the room, impossible martial arts moves, etc).  Being a movie made from a comic book, that might sound odd, but they were just too over-the-top.  But, like I said for the most part, it was a pretty decent movie.  I liked all the characters, and in some cases I was sad to see them die so soon because I thought there was potential for a kick-ass fight with him/her, but that didn't pan out.Compared to the first Blade, I thought it was probably just as good.  I liked the story in Blade II a lot actually, it was pretty interesting, and I loved that Blade and the Vampires were forced to team-up to take on these new breed of vampires called ""Reapers"".  Very ironic!  Anyhow, the action is great, the story is great, the characters are great.  If you've seen the original Blade and liked it, then you'll probably like this one as well.  Be forewarned though, this movie is a lot more bloody than the first film.As far as a third installment goes, I'm all for it.  I'd love to see Blade again in another adventure.  Anyhow, I enjoyed the movie, and I hope you will too.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Blade II
96,Antagonisten,Entertaining,6,18 January 2005,"I have a weak spot for comic-book action. Something about the mix between today and the supernatural has always drawn me to it. And i found the first ""Blade"" to be one of the more entertaining in the genre.Blade (Wesley Snipes) has been looking for his old-time companion Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) for a long time. Whistler was taken captive by vampires and Blade has slaughtered his way through the vampire clans of several countries to find him. Now though there is another threat to the human race that also affects the vampires themselves. Soon Blade is given an offer he can't refuse, resulting in a unholy alliance between the vampires and their greatest enemy.Guillermo del Toro is a man with what the Germans would term ""fingerspitzengefühl"". He's got that special feeling for what works on screen, especially when it comes to movies like this one. Blade 2 refines most of the elements seen in the first Blade movie. This is a violent and action-filled journey into a comic-book world and del Toro is not taking any prisoners. Wesley Snipes seems to enjoy himself as Blade and most of the other actors also seem to blend in nicely in the mood of the film.There were only a few minor flaws that bothered me. Most of all the sometimes shaky CGI-work. Some of the special effects look cheap to say the least. Especially the use of digital ""stand-ins"" for the actors that are used in some action scenes to spice them up a bit. All in all though this is an entertaining ride in it's overblown testosterone-rich way. I rate it 6/10.",Blade II

Everything about the first movie which was great has returned, but is now even better. Wesley Snipes brings back to life one of the coolest Marvel characters on film. The vampires are even more frightening and the action is amazing. The story has a lot more thought into it this time. More turns are featured, with interesting characters which really make you think about. The action doesn't kick off straight away, but rather delivers itself at the right moments. During to the high certificate, the film includes lots of violence. A lot of comic book adaptations are made targeted towards a younger audience. Having a mature audience is best for the 'Blade' series as it really adds to the atmosphere of everything. Prepare to not only be entertained by frightened.

The special effects here are really great, but there is far too much blood, too many long and unnecessary 'ballet' scenes and generally far too much 'shoot-em-up' footage for my taste. When you think of it, in order to kill the vampires, you don't really need all those weapons, martial arts knowledge, etc. All you need is a flashlight with a good battery! Maybe I am being overly pragmatic here, but even as I wish for films that go over the top (surely, the movies are and remain a 'dream factory'), I would also like them try to make some sense at the same time.

This is also what I feel about the second movie. It's basically the same movie with great action sequences, great make-up, great special effects and a cool Wesley Snipes as the eponymous hero. I liked the idea of Blade working together with vampires, as well. I found the Reapers to be rather... silly, though. The ""Alien-esque"" mouths felt kind of over the top.

Disintegration of vampires is still present, but at least it now looks a lot more cool compared to the first movie. In fact, I am now pretty OK with it. So, what more can you ask for from a movie like this? Having seen ""Hellboy"" and this movie, it seems del Toro was a real savior of the comic book based movies, and I can only say: ""Thank you!"" I give the movie 9/10, because even though this is everything what movie about Blade should be, we need to take into account what movies deserve 10/10 score, and those are masterpieces.

From ultra dark to super silly just is just too much Love Norrington's style and approach. Despise del Toro's.When somebody sets out to make a sequel they want to make it better than the first one. Better is not more! Quantity sure as hell ain't quality here. More guys on blade's side this time (a bunch of cool looking characters that don't get nearly enough screen time for the viewer to feel any emotion for them), more cool action(which in some cases doesn't really serve the story at all), more effects(some pretty good, but the CG Blade looks unrealistic and just plain bad). Plus he jumps all around the place like a monkey on speed, sadly making the movie loose any credibility it was left with after the opening sequence.Did del Toro even take the time to watch ""Blade"". An opening scene that has gained an almost legendary and infamous reputation, a scene which will go down as one of the coolest club dance scenes ever is more than enough a reason to make the opener in the second installment at least half as good. Nope, not even a glimpse of effort. As if del Toro intentionally wanted to do this, I just have a feeling he managed to make a big F..K YOU to all ""Blade"" lovers and threw together a movie that does nothing but the worst with the material. The cinematography (compared to the first Blade) is worth dick and they could barely find some decent electronic tunes to go along. It's pretty hard to find anything better in this sequel except for some really R rated violence scenes and some really funny scenes between Blade and Reinhardt.An adrenaline-pumped hyperactive movie that doesn't take time to stop and think but instead just keeps going into the wrong direction from the very start. And I'm not talking plot-wise at all, but going from the very cool and smart Blade from the first movie to the cliche filled movie (the first action scene where he almost crashes into his car(which is hardly used in the movie anyway) and then gives it a kiss)with a jumping maniac that should at least have done it with the female vampire.
A bad choice for a director whom I respect for making the choice to take a completely different approach but also despise for failing miserably.The Blade franchise stands on a limb.  6/10",Blade II
103,domino1003,The Return of The Daywalker,8,30 June 2005,"""Blade II"" is an interesting turn in the series, and more graphic than the first film. Blade (Wesley Snipes)has managed to find Whistler (Kris Kirstofferson), who supposedly died in the first film (He was attacked by vampires and then shot himself), but he also finds out that he is being hunted, but for reasons he didn't expect: The Vampire Nation need Blade to help THEM. A mutation has struck within the vampire community that turns them into creatures that attack not just humans, but also vampires. Those that get bitten and survive turn into one of them, called the Reaper. A very reluctant Blade soon joins forces with the Bloodpack, lead by Nyssa (Lenore Varela)and Reinhardt (Ron Perlman, a bad ass as always). With no trust on either side, they go on the hunt to wipe out the creatures.With cool direction by Guillermo del Toro, this is an improvement over the first.",Blade II
104,SkullScreamerReturns,Perhaps even better than Blade one,6,13 November 2021,"I remember liking Blade 1 & 2 when they were new. Now I watched them again. Still quite good though maybe not quite as good as I remembered.The second movie is directed by Guillermo del Toro whom I mostly remember from Pan's Labyrinth and wouldn't have guessed he directs action movies too. But he is a strong visionary and I must admit he does good job at making the scenes look very stylish to look at. The action is maybe even better than in the first film, and Wesley Snipes is the perfect Blade character once again. I was also happy that Blade's mentor/mechanic character Whistler (charismatic and cool actor Kris Kristofersson) is still around even though he supposedly died in the first movie.The plot is quite good. I liked the idea of Blade having to team-up with his enemies to fight a more dangerous enemy together. There's more weapons, more action, and more at stake.Towards the end the movie started to feel a bit more average comic book action and not a masterpiece, but overall still very much recommended if you think you like some vampire-slaying action with dark shades on.",Blade II
105,hokeybutt,Sometimes Bad CGI Is Worse Than No CGI...,5,5 June 2005,"BLADE 2 (2+ outta 5 stars) Wesley Snipes did a good job on the first Blade movie so I have no beef with him coming back to make more of them. For this second installment the filmmakers came up with a decent story and a good bunch of actors. Unfortunately, the script could have used a little more pizazz... and they could have used a lot less phony CGI work in the fight scenes. I realize Snipes may not be a trained fighter... but replacing him with an unconvincing CGI simulation does not help the movie one bit. I think this time around Snipes came on a little too strong with his ""cool"" persona. Blade definitely came off as cool in the first movie... but this time he comes off more as someone desperately *pretending* to be cool. Kris Kristofferson makes a welcome return as Blade's previously deceased partner and he seems to get the better one-liners, while Blade himself is stuck with dud lines like, ""Keep pushing, a**hole."" Ron Perlman does a pretty good job as well, playing an uneasy ally of Blade's. They are forced to team up to destroy a special kind of vampire that feeds on other vampires and so is ultimately more dangerous to mankind. It's all fast-paced and kind of interesting but all that jumping around and blowing things up does get a little old after a while.",Blade II
106,todd2u,this was just awesome,10,6 April 2002,This was a lot better then the first. I loved the first but this one was a lot better. I was in like awe the whole movie. Some of the fighting scenes were really cool. The director did an awesome job on this movie. It was scary and had lots of action at the same time. Snipes did a god job at Blade. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good action movie or loves Blade. You will not be disappointed with this movie. TRUST ME!,Blade II
107,supertom-3,The kick ass movie of the year!!!,8,29 March 2002,"I have always thought that Blade was an underrated action classic and one of the coolest, most stylish action flicks ever and so the sequel filled me with excitement. I knew it would be bigger, badder and bloodier but my god it surpassed my expectations. Wesley is lightning in this film, even more than in Blade 1. He has more one-liners and opportunities for some humour and he delivers his lines with his usual charismatic class. Del Torro has basically taken the sort of style that Stephan Norrington used in the first film and charged it up to even more super cool levels, the soundtrack is also excellent and the vast array of weaponry on offer puts the first film in the shadows. Del Torros history of directing horro flicks plays well in this film, and also the visuals are suitably dank and lurid. The cinematography in this film is pure excellence. The fight sequences are brilliant. They are extremely well choreographed, frequent and suitably violent and gore filled. Also the new super Vampires known as Reapers really give the film a fresh edge it needed to have after the first film. Not since I saw Brotherhood of the Wolf have I come out of the cinema wanting a repeat viewing so badly. Its pure adrenaline, clapping of the hands, excellence from start to finish. Us Brits are not usually known to show are appreciation for a film too outwardly during its presentation but the whole audience were cheerin, laughing and applauding in ore at the movie. The few minor quibbles would be that despite the excellent special effects there was one scene, when Blade first encounters the bloodpack in a fight, which had a completely computer generated Wesley for a few moves which did not look to realistic but the rest of the effects were first rate and the action in the rest of the film made up for it. Its entertaining, mindlessly cheesy fun. Overall this gets a 7/10",Blade II
108,skybrick736,Blade 2 (8/10),8,17 November 2015,"Blade 2 had a lot to live up to with the successful entry of the initial Blade movie. Luckily for audiences Guillermo del Toro was at the helm of the project and he did not have a letdown. The action is way better, it is predominately kung-fu with less evaporation of vampires. Although the story is not as strong as the first, the plot incorporated the ""keep it simple stupid"" motto as its method, which really payed off. Blade's (Wesley Snipes) team is a strong mix of characters played by heavy hitters, Norman Reedus, Donnie Yen, Ron Perlman and again, the great Kris Kristofferson. The sequel has a more gore, more action and more sinister villains compared to its predecessor. Blade 2 hits on lots of film genres, which makes the movie a great, unique watch for any film viewer.",Blade II
109,Bogey Man,A pretty noteworthy lesson in hysterical editing and cinematography - Hollywood getting closer to Hong Kong,6,9 December 2002,"Guillermo Del Toro (Cronos (1993), Mimic (1997), The Devil's Backbone (2001)) directed this fast and furious sequel, Blade 2 (2002), to Stephen Norrington's original Blade (1998) that gave hope for something interesting and personal to come out from Hollywood in this horror/action department. Wesley Snipes' charisma and strong presence accompanied by Kris Kristofferson's calmer talent with the over-the-top special effects and martial arts made the first film a very nice experience and piece of 90's ""Hollywood genre cinema."" The sequel isn't quite as positive an experience but still has its moments and positive things.Snipes is again Blade, the half human, half vampire, vampire killer trying and willing to save the world from the bloodsuckers that inhabit everything and can be everywhere as long as there's no sunlight, silver or garlic near them. The sequel has a new kind of vampire breed that fights and feeds on also the ""normal"" vampires and very soon Blade is forced to join forces to fight the more lethal and meaner enemy that cannot be discussed with at all. What follows is mayhem, blood, ""suckheads"", typically not-so-deep characters, CGI effects and plenty of action. The sequel is written by David S. Goyer who also wrote the original Blade and for example The Dark City (1998) for Alex Proyas of the Crow (1994) fame. The plot is pretty simple and as it includes plenty of action and martial arts scenes, it is really pretty hard to feel bored while watching the film, at least I didn't feel at all. The beginning, the punch to the viewer senses, is very long and interior/exterior based action spectacle that ends only when the film makers could be sure that no one in the audience was bored or not interested in the premise! The beginning gives some clues about the film's most interesting merits that are in the editing and photography departments. The editing is fast and fierce but not irritatingly and amateurishly so. It all serves the film's cartoon like (vampire) world in which words like slow, peaceful and safe are very rare and not so easy to be found in its everyday life. When the action begins, the speed is very fast and this is taken to its maximum effect by the hysterical editing and inventive usage of camera. There are many great and long drives and different speeds of the drives that make the film genuinely stylish as they are not used in vain and all the time but cleverly and restrainedly to add the effect only when the piece needed it. Also the dark scenes at the sewer and the infamous vampire bar are pretty atmospheric and there's also a brief but memorable bit of blue mist pushing through the windows and blinds to give the kind of incredibly beautiful and moody effect as in the greatest Hong Kong pieces like Ringo Lam's City on Fire (1987) and Danny Lee's Dr. Lamb (1992) and its stunning flashback scenes at the lamb's apartment. And this is not the only thing this film has in common with the Hong Kong films and makers.The fight choreographer is no less than the Chinese Donnie Yen who is known for his breath taking fighting talent in various Hong Kong films like Yuen Woo Ping's Iron Monkey (1993), Raymond Lee's New Dragon Gate Inn (1992) and Tsui Hark's Once Upon a Time in China 2 (1992). He also has a small role in Blade 2. The martial art fights (which are plenty, too) are, alongside the mentioned visuals, among the things that make the film's action so interesting and kinetic, and thus the film a bit close(r) to Hong Kong films. The major bad thing is the special effects that seem little too ""computer like"" and don't seem to fit to the film. The CGI gore and vampire killings are not so convincing and flawless but still nice to watch as in some computer or video game, but not in a film. The film is most likely equally violent with the first film, but the first film had much more effective and inventive special and vampire effects than this sequel. Especially the beginning of part one is among the greatest beginnings I've seen for long time in any horror attempt.The needless ""shock epilogue"" is also a very irritating and seems to be there as if the screenwriter had had one minute to write it and then decide, during the same minute, whether it will be included in the film or not! Also the usual one liners could be completely lacking but fortunately they are not too irritating and ""entertaining."" Blade 2 is harmless and fast paced piece of Hollywood horror and action film and in its own unpretentious genre it is among the more interesting and definitely professional attempts for some time and well worth a look for those interested in the genre. Definitely should be seen on the big screen as (of course) any other film, too.6/10",Blade II
110,theshadow908,A very good sequel.,8,21 January 2006,"Blade II is about the human/vampire hybrid still on his mission to destroy vampires. When there comes a new species that feeds on both vampires and humans, Blade must team up with an elite group of vampires to take them down.This movie really does hold up against the first. The only thing that keeps it from being better is the rather cartoonish CGI sequences. The acting is better this time around, and so is the story and the writing. This movie is a lot funnier than the first, and also has some of the greatest fight scenes I've ever seen. The villain in this movie is a lot more interesting and engaging than in the first movie. The relationship between Blade and the sworn enemies he's forced to team up with is pretty cool to watch. All in all, this movie is a lot of fun.The creature effects are really cool. Anyone looking for a creature feature won't be disappointed. The stunts are better as well. I might as well just sum it all up by saying that Blade II is more exciting, funnier, and has more action and better acting than the first one. The only thing that's disappointing to watch is the pathetic CGI work.8/10",Blade II
111,bh_tafe3,"Critically divisive, but successful sequel",6,1 December 2014,"Blade II is a difficult film to rate. Firstly it comes closer to capturing the look and feel of a comic book than the original, which is a good start. A familiarity with the characters is also helpful.There are more than a few issues with the plot. Whistler is bought back, his death rather unconvincingly retconned and the stakes are upped to try and make everything super dooper Bladey, and there seems to be something missing.Blade gets some Vampire slaying groupies, the bad guys are super scary looking with multiple jaws and the stakes are ludicrously high. I'm being deliberately vague here because a lot of the plot and contrivances are things will either work for you or they won't and you really have to see the film to know which camp you fall in.Snipes and Kristofferson are on top form reprising their roles, but neither major villain in this one stacks up to Dorff in the original. While Blade II certainly isn't a bad film, and has its share of admirers, (for the atmosphere and feel mainly, but many liked the plot, which expands the Blade universe and the vampire mythos) it left many viewers feeling like a lot of elements could have been done better. Specifically the antagonists really could have been built up more and the script could have flowed better.I don't know of anyone who hated this, and a hell of a lot of people went to see it, and quite a few loved it. Average film. Works as a companion piece to the original, but something of a missed opportunity, it left me with the idea that there was a better film waiting to get out.",Blade II
112,ozthegreatat42330,A step up from the first one.,8,19 March 2007,"This is a rare event for a sequel, a film actually better than the first one was. Kristofferson and Snipes are both true to form, and the beating and bashing sequences are much better. Also there is somewhat less gore in this film, and it really isn't all that necessary. If I have any complaint it is with all of the jarring music in the film. It tends to wear thin on your nerves after a while. With the exception of Ron Pearlman the secondary characters do not come off as memorable as in the first feature. All in all, however, this feature is an enjoyable way to pass two hours. I hope the third film in the series is at least as entertaining.",Blade II
113,smakawhat,Picture Aliens II but without the fear and terror...,7,22 March 2002,"Enter once again that realm of Hollywood action marketing...The sequel....In this case what is new?!?!?  Well they stuck pretty much with the same winning formula.  Blade is his old comic book self as well as his sidekick and nemisis parts, little on dialogue, big on action and looks.  Here director Guillermo De Toro (Mimic, Devil's Backbone) tries to see if he can put his crowning touch on this very likable character.In short this film was kind of odd, It started off kind of dissapointing, and then got better, and actually kind of did real good towards the end. It also had some GREAT scenes.  The basic plot involves a new breed of vampires (Reapers) that are stalking all of the planet including the ordinary vampires.  The high council asks Blade for his assistance in stopping the threat which is more powerful and more thirst ridden and could wipe away all life..  Henceforth Blade allies himself (cautiously with his small team of humans) AND with the 'Bloodpack' an elite vampire fighting force that was originaly set up to kill none other than the daywalker himself.My biggest problem with this film was that there wasn't alot that was new. That being said the first Blade was just a great neat thing, but watching this I couldn't help but have the feeling, yeah I've seen this already... been there done that.  However, with the addition of these new Reapers there was something more to get excited about.. only problem is they are introduced very slowly into the picture... just enough to tease the audience..Also the director has some great looking shots that are very eerie..  there is alot of suspense.. but not much dialogue but after all it is a comic book like script.  The action is first rate involving some great fight scenes that are 1 half Matrix like, 1 half standard bone crunching, and 1 half WWF!! (I think the director has this thing about wrestling moves)...  In the end it comes out very unique as the Reapers are no EASY kill..My biggest beef though was that the film wasn't scary..  unlike the first one.  Maybe they needed more women stalking guys and then ready to do the ole praying mantis thing (in the first film that just gave me the chills), here however, the film comes across as re-make of Aliens II with the Reapers (LOTS OF THEM) and the rag tag 'Bloodpack' is a knock off of the alien marine fighters but without any of the charisma, depth or likeableness. Picture Aliens II with the spaceship co-ridors and aliens replaced with improved vampires and sewer tunnels but without the chilling edge of your seat terror.That being said the film is what it is, a simple action film, with some good fight scenes, neat villain(s), and some good shots.  I just wish they could have made some of the supporting cast have more lines, and more insight into their characters.... some of them were kind of bland and they could have done WAY more with the script. But overall it was a good film.Rating 7 out of 10",Blade II
114,deepfrieddodo,Blade Is Back,8,24 December 2020,"Quite a different plot to its predecessor, Blade II sees the titular character team up with vampires in order to fight a new strain, 'Reapers'. Seems like a plot that wouldn't be brought in until at least the third installment of a saga, but it works!Yet again Snipes proves to be the best choice for Blade, only this time he's surrounded by a bit more of a star-studded cast (e.g. Ron Perlman, Norman Reedus, Donnie Yen). With this lot in tow it is again action-packed, the only downside being that evidently in the years since the first, CGI had developed a bit more and so it was piled on here. Fight scenes are still brilliant, but given a little bit too much jumping to great heights, etc., this is especially true in the climax. Seems a bit of a waste as when you have Snipes' physicality it should be used naturally, instead it looks a bit more like a cut scene from a video game. By no means bad though.An unwarranted love interest is fortunately not overwhelming, and the plot is allowed to take its course. The level of detail in the Reapers, however, is magnificent. A scene allowing a look within the species shows the level of detail that was gone to. It makes it a bit less of a usual vampire film, silver and stakes are out the window, guns are used a lot more heavily, and there aren't many typical vampire traits. Having said that, it holds true to the Blade arc and is another excellent installment.",Blade II

The story, written by David S. Goyer here is even more complex as Blade (Snipes) who bails out his mentor/sidekick Whistler (Kristofferson), who from a lab, and the duo and the new partner, Scud (Norman Reedus) are urged by the vampire nation to assist them in riding the world of a new threat that are called ""Reapers"" and their feared ringleader, Jared Nomak (Luke Goss).The Reapers themselves, are certainly a work of art, and not only they feed on humans, but vampires, too.  That's why has the nation deeply concerned and they see their bitter rival Blade and Whistler to lead the crusade.Blade, Scud, and Whistler are soon paired with the Bloodpack, a buffed up and ambitious version of ""The Wild Bunch"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" (take your pick).  The unit's sole purpose was to kill Blade and they're led by Nyssa (Lenor Varela), the king's daughter and Reinhardt (Ron Perlman), who sort of resembles Victor Franko minus the hair.Once the bunch find their targets, the movie begins to get very intense and the fight scenes are brutal, so I'll put at that.  There are some unexpected surprises that follow and you're not sure what will happen.Director Guilllero Del Toro is no stranger to making movies that deal with vicious creatures.  ""Cronos"" and ""Mimic"" are a couple of noteworthy examples.  And here, he takes the film in a direction in the way someone drives down a back road at night, not knowing what they run into.  You ask yourself ""Where do you find the suspense in that?""""Blade II"" asks the same question and you don't how to answer that.  Well, it's just as good as the original, if not better.",Blade II

This is easily the best film so far this year. With some of the most fantastic action scenes seen in years, Blade 2 finds itself in the same ilk as Aliens and Terminator 2. Guillermo Del Toro's latest creation is a grotesque, blood filled masterpiece that far surpasses the original.  Wesley Snipes returns as the title character, Blade.  Feeling much more comfortable then he did in the original, Snipes verifies the fact that he is the most talented action star working today.With a supporting cast, that includes a scene stealing  Ron Pearlman; enough gore to shake a stick at; amazing action scenes; and one-liners to boot -- Blade 2 is a must see for anyone who likes action.",Blade II

Turning them in to reapers a form a vampire that is believed to be twice as strong and Agile as the basic vampire. Blade reluctantly offers to help in order to prevent a outbreak break of these creatures. Blade It's a great follow up to the first fill it must be wrong with the jumps right into the action with Blake already established we're not having to explain that about how vampires operate in and their weaknesses. The idea of having blade team up with vampires is a great concept given the team is a group that was trained originally to hunt him down and I had to take orders from its route back to tell us got a build tension especially what's the second best character in the film being Ron Perlman as Reinhart second you see how you know that the time is it to come in when they clash. He mostly definitely will use an impact on the film what speaks true considering Del Toro would end up using him as the protagonist in both his Hellboy Films. That can be said for alot of the cast here much more interest this time around. Kristofferson returns at Whistler. Do you get way more sass from this film as a post to just deliver and dialogue he gets a lot of funny lines in this movie. Also you have Scud (Norman Reedus) sort of a replacement for Wessler as he recovers he's good for quite a few hours. And also Donnie Yen's in the movie however honestly don't expect him to do much he gets one shining moment and then he doesn't really do anything else for the rest of the movie he doesn't even five blade which would've made for a really great fight. I guess they didn't want him to overshadow Wesley. The villain is much more better this time around. Nomak while you don't really know why exactly he's doing what he's doing, once it comes from circle and someways you can understand where he's coming from. He's most definitely a way more of a bigger threat than deacon frost was the first film fight between him and blade intense. He's a actual threat.",Blade II
119,Quebec_Dragon,Slick vampiric action,7,17 July 2009,"Technically and visually, it's awesome. The director is great at making action look cool. The fight scenes are fast, sharp and exciting, probably helped a lot by the choreography of Donnie Yen (although he was not alone). The actors were obviously replaced by computer graphics a few times but it's not too bad. One of the best parts of the film is the blood pack, a team of vampires. They might not be developed very much but they have killer looks and moves. The story had a promising concept, a new strain of vampires hunting traditional vampires, and their design was very good and creepy, especially the mouth. However, the action eclipses the story by a fair margin and there's not much plot development nor is it likely you will care much about the few dramatic elements. Wesley Snipes as Blade shows amazing physical prowess but almost always wearing his dark glasses is almost as stoic as Arnold in the Terminator movies. This is interesting to see as a stepping stone for talented director Del Toro's future projects: the 2 Hellboys and Pan's Labyrinth. It's also a decent sequel to the first Blade without as much character development but stronger action and visual design. It's worth a rental and perhaps a buy if you're a Benicio Del Toro's or Blade fan. It's leagues above the rather poor third installment and it's where you see how much a director makes the difference.Rating: 6.5 out of 10",Blade II
120,tburke85,Blade 2 A Much Better Improvement Over The Original,8,15 June 2009,"Blade 2 is a much better improvement over the original from director Guillermo del Toro who is admirable in making this sequel by amping up the action, improved special effects, and a more deadly villain(s). del Toro has shown his skill as a filmmaker in all his movies and this one is no different. Welsey Snipes returns as Blade and he's still a solid choice for the character especially in the action/fight sequences. In this sequel Blade forms an uneasy alliance with the vampire council in order to combat the Reapers a more deadlier breed of super-vampires who not only feed on humans but vampires as well. Kris Kristofferson also reprises his role as Blade's mentor Whistler and he's still effective in the part. Lucikly he's given a little more to do in this one. The rest of the cast are good in their roles including Ron Perlman, Lenora Verola, Thomas Kretschman, Norman Reedus, and Karel Roden in a brief appearance as a corrupt lawyer. Luke Goss a relatively unknown is the stand out as Nomack the leader of the Reapers. Goss makes for an imposing a villain who's a real challenge to Blade. Their final showdown at the end was a bit of a letdown mainly because it's over too quickly but Goss still makes for a great villain none the less under all the makeup used to create his character. The rest of the cast are okay in their limited screen time. The action/fight sequences are impressive and there's more of them in this one fortunately. The pace was fast mainly because of the action and some of the new characters are developed enough others no so much. The final showdown between Blade and Nomack felt rushed as mentioned before but it was still fierce and intense. The ending was fitting and the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Overall Blade 2 is better than the original with plenty of cool martial arts action, impressive special effects, some suspense, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (Snipes and especially Goss) who make this vampire sequel worth the time to watch.",Blade II

I'm not sure why exactly. By definition, they're a little too dark & fantasy like for me, but (& probably wrongly) I've always seen them as made for younger people.Through chance I've happened to see both Blade 1 & 2 though & they've been pretty much what I'd imagined beforehand. Not bad films at all & pretty straightforward to follow, but with a suspension of belief needed obviously.Blade 2 was marginally better than the 1st one. Some very good action scenes & cinematography & Snipes, Kristoffesen & happily Luke Goss (who deserves some good luck) all make this film worth watching. There's nothing wrong with the plot either, but it's just not the sort of topic that interests me.A high 4/10",Blade II
122,basrutten,"Yeah yeah we get it, Snipes is cool",2,17 March 2006,"The first Blade was an entertaining movie, so the sequel should be fine, right. Guess again. While it's certainly along the same lines, this sequel seems so targeted at pleasing a (pre)pubescent crowd that only cares about gore and eye candy that it actually becomes painful to watch to anybody who doesn't fit that demographic.The main idea behind ""Blade II"" seems to have been to make everything as ""cool"" as possible. Apparently, this boils down to Wesley Snipes killing scores and scores of vampires without the slightest bit of trouble. Snipes is so completely invulnerable and the action is so completely over the top that the action alternates between mind-numbingly boring and unintentionally funny.But at least it looks good, right? Well, not really. The movie clearly suffers from an overuse of CGI, and most of it isn't terribly convincing. Some shots are so fake they even make you laugh out loud. Just about the only thing they did do right was the gore: the are massive amounts of it and it looks truly gross for the most part.Well, maybe the story can save it then? Wrong again. ""Blade 2"" about the most by-the-numbers script you can get stuck with. There are a couple of twists, but you can see them coming from a mile away. The characters are as one-dimensional as they get, the plot is very basic yet makes little sense (Blade is such a super person that he can easily wipe out both old and new vampires, so why team up with the old ones?), and the dialog is full of tired and unfunny one-liners that leave no opportunity unused to show us once again how supposedly cool Blade is. Yawn.""Blade II"" is an extremely poor action movie, with a dull, stupid and predictable plot and even more dull, stupid and predictable action sequences. Watch only as a cure for insomnia.* out of *****",Blade II
123,shadowman123,A very good follow up,8,24 January 2009,"I loved the first Blade movie, it had all the correct ingredients to make an excellent action movie. I was also happy to say that Blade 2 is also good, if not that little bit more stylish visually than the first. This time the plot focus on Blade helping his sworn enemies take on a new breed of vampire , basically like a James Bond movie we have a straight forward plot , gadgets and action which action make it all the more pleasure to watch and also this round we are take further into the Vampire Nation and we get to look at the world of and complex vampiric politics. There are also pretty solid and strong performances from Snipes,Pearlman , Krisoffen as we also get to see a lot more of the human 'side' of Blade and with good hints of comedy along the way which just make it great. So if your a fan of the comics and action movies and you enjoyed the first definitely give this one a shot , you won't be disappointed.BLADE 2 : 8.1 OUT OF 10",Blade II
124,HenryHextonEsq,Only so much you can stomach... ;-),1,16 April 2002,"My word, I would say that there's a fair lot of delusion, difference in taste and occasionally outright insanity (One entitled ""The Caliban Institute""...) in these comments below...! A few I agree with, but not so many.The imaginatively named ""Blade 2"" was certainly a slipshod film; a composite of 80 % violence, and 20 % very dull filler material. Plot horrendous, acting unable or unwilling to rise above the pyrotechnics; virtually all characters indistinguishable from one another... The only differences are the character-as-eye-candy prop (perhaps necessary in this visually repellent farrago of a film!) Nyssa; a few bizarre bits of late '80s British retro casting - Danny John Jules and a certain master Luke Goss - and neither chap is used at all interestingly. Plus, there is no sense of why Blade is any better than any of them, or more interesting. He is merely one monotonous thug among many.Don't expect any hint of realism, despite the massive excess of violence... Few if any of the main characters seem the worse for wear despite however many times they are summarily butchered and seemingly dispatched. None of this is explained at all. I hear some sorts saying ""It's escapism! Get with the game, Tomster!""... some escapism I say; I don't want to escape to a frankly dull world with practically nothing but violence without context, meaning or end. How could they have made it worse...? Perhaps a ludicrous, unsubstantiated ""romance"" slotted in there? Ring any bells, folks? ;-)Of course, if you enjoy big screen depictions of violence and gore for the sake of it - even ones that aren't that well done - you may just enjoy this. If you have a predilection for nauseating images, you are as they say, quids in. But don't you tell me this is a good film. It is an awful, decidedly ugly one, that fails on all counts.",Blade II

126,rparham,Sharpen this Blade,8,31 March 2006,"Many individuals have raised the issue that it is rare to find a sequel that matches the quality of the original, let alone surpasses it. On that short list, you should find the film Blade II. The sequel to the 1998 vampire action flick is more stylish, more exciting and scarier than it's predecessor, making it a solid entry in the comic-book adaptation pantheon.Opening some time after the conclusion of the original, we find our hero Blade (Wesley Snipes) searching for his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), whom the vampires converted to a vampire and kidnapped. Shortly after locating and curing Whistler of his vampirism (using some complicated retro-virus magic serum), two vampire ninjas drop in on his hideout, but not to kill him. The vampire nation is seeking Blade's assistance in ridding them of a new mutant strain of vampire, dubbed the Reapers. You don't want to mess around with the Reapers: aside from being impervious to silver and many of the other standard vampire repellents, they have a nasty habit of splitting their lower jaw in half and sucking you dry in a much less appealing way than normal vampires.Blade joins forces with a elite group of vampires that were trained to hunt him down, the Bloodpack, led by Reinhardt (Ron Perlman) and Nyssa (Leonore Varella), daughter of the leader of the vampires, Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann). Blade and the Bloodpack begin hunting the Reapers, but it quickly becomes obvious that they have an agenda that goes beyond stopping these mutants.A big component in the improvement of Blade II over Blade has to do with the presence of director Guillermo Del Toro. Director of several stylish horror films, he brings a more unique flair to the proceedings. The film is darker, with harsher shadows and moodier lighting than the last entry. The action sequences are also well choreographed, using computer generated imagery that generally integrates well into the live action to add an extra kick to them.Unlike Blade, Blade II also has a stronger element of horror to it. This is principally attributable to the presence of the Reapers. The standard vampire in a horror film is rather passé these days; the Reapers, however, are not. It's easy to see that the Reapers are representative of any major disease, be it AIDS, bubonic plague, etc. They are hairless, light skinned, and will feed on anything that moves. The scenes where they attack en masse are reminiscent of such films as Night of the Living Dead, although with a little more kick to them than the slow, shuffling zombies of that black and white classic. Where the vampires in Blade were not that scary, save for the film's opening, the Reapers are and add an extra level to Blade II missing from the original.Wesley Snipes is back in fine form as Blade. Still not graced with an overabundance of dialogue, Snipes imbues the character with a little more attitude than the first time around, making Blade a character that is easier to sympathize with. Ron Perlman turns in his usual solid performance as Reinhardt, taking the role of central villain for the piece. Kristofferson is also his curmudgeonly self as Whistler, and his presence is welcome.It is always refreshing to see filmmakers take a decent film and liberally expand and improve on it with a quality sequel, which seems in short supply these days. Blade II manages the break the curve, and if you were a fan of the original, the sequel is more than worth your time.",Blade II
127,aleksanderk-95350,Cheesy Blade,4,4 April 2021,"Blade 2 reminded me of a cheesy 80s action film. It has non stop fight sequences, with CGI effects that have not aged well. The villains never really feel all that intimidating. It has a silly twist that made no sense to me. Turn of events Norman Reedus at the end has been working for the bad guys. He explains to blade how he placed a fake bomb. Blade replies back that he knew and switched it with a real bomb. So he explodes the Bomb once he takes it off the main bad guys head. Why not just detonate the bomb while it's on Ron Perlman's head.",Blade II
128,foxtografo,Gets better at the end,7,29 August 2021,"When this movie came out I loved it, but I was 20 years younger and I was easily impressed by the CGI which is, to be honest, very well implemented in the fights, giving a special dynamism that looks really cool.Now, many years and movies later, I see all the story flaws, how useless is the Bloodpack, which pretty much ruins the movie for me, they're a bunch of literally useless show-offs, I don't want to give away detail in case somebody didn't see this yet, but it could be used so much better, there was definitely potential there that went to waste.The look of the movie is the best, dark and cool cinematography, and Snipes is also perfect as Blade.Rating in my head was dropping by the minute, but the movie improves quite a bit to the end, specially the epic head to head final fight (again, the CGI here was very well used).It's a good action movie that could have used better its characters, if it was better written, but definitely the best of the trilogy.Not as perfect as I remembered, but still fun to watch.",Blade II

130,CrassActionHero,A Rusty Blade,4,16 December 2006,"Blade 2(2002) Review: Blade is back. The Blade this time around is getting rusty. Blade makes a not so exciting sequel. Here's why: Blade 2 is not as good as the first. The first installment had action and intrigue. It was not great, but was good. Here, Blade gets a little repetitive. The opening scene was not really good. The vampires this time around are quickly taken out with such little effort. A single gunshot does the job? C'Mon. Vampires are tougher than that. Also, i can't stand the first vampire at the beginning of this movie to be a total wimp. You are a VAMPIRE. You have super strength and agility. Why are you so terrified? It was just irritating as hell.The story was okay at first till later on a bad plot twist happened. I still am scratching my head wondering ""what was that""? The Reaper vampires are not all that impressive. They all look the same and are very dull looking. Every other character here was very one-dimensional as you can get. Blade 2 does have some good action here, but is not enough to redeem this. Blade this time around is more merciful than the first Blade. That is a problem. I liked Blade when he would slay a vampire at a drop of a hat. The ""unholy alliance"" made no sense later on.(The plot twist sucks) Too much CGI. Forget about character development as well.Blade 2 is nothing like the first thrilling installment, but is the brainless sequel. Blade 2 has no depth towards it either. From a convoluted plot to a forgettable villain, Blade 2 suffers big.The Last Word: Leave your brain at the door. This is better than ""Blade:Trinity"". But than again, that's not saying much.",Blade II
131,arthera09,this movie really needed a villain,4,3 April 2007,"What I like about the first Blade movie was Deacon Frost. I loved the character and thought he was very well executed. This movie on the other hand just did not have a satisfying bad guy. The action was not bad, and I really liked how they incorporated the wrestling moves into the fighting style. I hated how Scud turned out to be a familiar and that Blade was onto him the whole time. They should have just killed him off and left that part out. It was weak story writing and felt forced. The special effects at times looked really hokey, but I actually did think some of the shots in the final scene had a good vision, but the special effects department just did not pull it off. The fight scene where Blade beats up all those armored guards was boring after a while and I just wanted it to end. The girl was hot, but that was all she contributed. I thought there was a lot of plot potential and great character moments involving the blood pact, but they totally missed out on that. The couple in the blood pact relied on the opening scene where they are seen hugging each other. The fact that they really did not do much else with them between there and when they actually die together it was sad. By the way Wesley Snipes is just not that funny. He tried, but just could not make me feel for the character at all. The one good thing was the reapers looked amazing, but beyond that not much there. Overall the movie just did not have the script and I felt bad by Del Toro and I know he can do much better work, and if given a better script I feel as if it would have turned out better.",Blade II
132,sam_smithreview,Wesley Snipes is Blade! one of the Best sequels ever made,10,25 April 2016,"Blade 2 takes what made the first Blade film good and transforms it into a different film with different characters (outside of Blade and Whistler) and a possibly deeper feel, and it works without great! This is how sequels should be made.This time, the vampires Blade has been hunting down for so many years want to make a truce so that they can recruit him to help them kill a new breed of monsters called reapers, which if you want a brief description are creatures that look like half vampires half zombies and half, whatever, with a chin that opens up wide.Blade reluctantly agrees, knowing full well that the vampires could turn on him and Whistler if things go wrong.Overall, Blade 2,is a great film for fans of Action movies, comic movies or the first one. It contains enough Imagination and gore effects to frighten the most horror film and comic book enthusiasts. The film also contains some of the best makeup I've seen in a long time.",Blade II
133,Ghenghy,The Vampire movie to end the fascination with Vampire movies,2,29 March 2002,"I posted a scorching review three days ago immediately after seeing this abomination but I must have gone too far cause I dont see it on here anywhere? Quite simply the worst movie I have EVER seen, and that's saying something. The worst direction, the worst acting(if you can call it that), the worst editing, and even the soundtrack is a dismal disappointment compared to the first installment. Any fruit loop that tells you that Blade II is better than the first is nuts-PERIOD! I am not anti-vampire. I love vampire movies but this thing is Jackie Chan(minus personality) meets The Predator. Just ridiculous, and you will be dying for it to be over 15 minutes after sitting down. My friends warned me and you are now forewarned. But, if you like your action sped up 2-3x to where it's nothing but a constant blur then you may enjoy this pig. They couldnt even get the Krispy Kreme doughnut scene right.

137,bannonanthony,A brilliant follow-up and excellent second instalment in the trilogy.,8,21 July 2006,"So, I finally got around to posting my review for this movie. I must say that BLADE II is probably the best of the trilogy. I absolutely6 refused to watch this sequel until I'd seen the original. After I did, I wanted to see this one as soon as possible. I was not let down. I was pleased to see Kris Kristofferson return as Whistler as I enjoyed his performance in the first movie. Of course, Wesley Snipes is excellent as Blade once again. I liked how this film made use of an ensemble cast as this time, the humans and vampires are in danger and Blade must team up with a crack team of vamps who were being trained to kill him.I was especially surprised when I heard that Luke Goss, whom I knew from 80s boy band Bros would play the big bad vamp Nomak in this film. But he is excellent any time he is on screen, very menacing. Ron Perlman and Matt (FAST AND THE FURIOUS) Schulze are very good as two of the reluctant vamps teaming up with Blade and Norman Reedus is very good as the two-faced Skud.The action scenes are all handled brilliantly. and the final death of 'good' vamp Nyssa is very moving. All in all, a brilliant film.",Blade II

Nomak was created in a lab, yes but by whom in the head oldest vampire Damaskinos(Thomas Kretschmann)whose daughter, Nyssa(Leonor Varela) hasn't a faintest idea of having a brother.I especially enjoyed the parts where he was almost drained of blood but brought back to life and killed Scud(Norman Reedus)who had been helping Blade when Blade was searching for Whistler.

139,claudonio,Intense action and thrills,8,17 April 2002,"""Blade 2"" is a kick ass action thriller. It tops the original in every way. It is just as dark if not darker than the original, the action is more frequent and intense, the effects and acting are better also. I was expecting this to be a good film, it is and then it's more, this film gives us lots of everything, gore, blood, bullets,action and keeps it coming for 2 hours, there is almost too much action in this film. Wesley Snipes performance here is much better than that of the first film, in the first film he had this frustrated expression plastered on his face throughout the whole movie, here he has some comic moments and is much more expressive. The action is where this film really excels, the first film had lots of action and this film makes it look anemic, from the opening on, this film is loaded with action, I mean loaded. The weak spots in this film revolve around the plot, but they are few and far between. ""Blade 2"" is easily the best action film to hit theaters all year. The complaints I have are far and few between, some of the effects look cheesy, and the final fight scene is a little too outrageous, other than that, this film hits the bullseye",Blade II

At least that is the what the plot wants to be... but we don't see movies like this for the plot, do we. We see them for the action.Nearly every action hero has a weakness or a weak moment where they must face their inner demons; a point where their convictions flag -- not in Blade. Wesley Snipes delivers to us a hero that never questions himself; a hero that relentlessly pursues his enemy, takes the battle to them on their turf and wipes the floor with them.

141,rcolgan,Cool Characters and Great Action,8,11 August 2015,"After the great success of the first Blade film and before the horrific disaster that was Blade Trinity, Guillermo Del Toro took the reigns of the Blade franchise for it's second outing to turn Blade into the first Marvel movie franchise. In spite of this being Torro's first venture in to action, he proves that he is clearly suited for the genre already having the trademarks that make him such a great director, including his flair for cool designs and his ability to create stylish and focused action sequences. Taking place 2 years after the first Blade film, a mutation has occurred within the vampire community that causes them to mutate into a new species called Reapers. These creatures are stronger, faster and have a far more extreme blood lust, sucking both the blood of vampires and humans at a rapid rate. Thus Blade and his team of vampire hunters are recruited by an elite squad of vampires called the blood pack, to hunt down the Reapers and save both vampires and humans from this new threat. Once again Snipes is on top form as the Blade, bringing the right mix of humour and sword wielding mastery needed to bring the comic book character to life on screen. But the best new addition to the film is the inclusion of the Bloodpack. Their incorporation into the film creates an interesting dynamic as they were originally trained to kill the daywalker, but put in this new situation are forced to work with him. Thus we're basically waiting for the timb bomb to go off throughout the film, waiting for the inevitable double crossing to begin. Although whilst they all look like the badass vampires they're supposed to and the team as a whole are effective in the story, several members of the team don't seem to get any real screen time. Out of the 8 in the team only 2 of them are being given more than the bare minimum amount of dialogue, making it too clear the rest of them are the vampire equivalent to a nameless red coat. But the members of the Bloodpack that the film does give time to live up to their badass looks. Ron Perlman plays the leader Reinhardt, who brings his usual tough guy attitude to the role, whilst sharing a cool unfriendly rivalry with Blade, where the pair constantly try to oneup each other. Then there's Nyssa who acts as the main liaison with Blade and his team. Whilst her role in the film is fairly typical as the standard love interest in spite of sharing little chemistry with Snipes, the character still has some great moments through her fight scenes and an interesting side plot exploring where her loyalties should lie.Toro takes all his talents from directing horror movies into the action genre, with the Reapers slit lipped mouths looking like they could have been ripped directly from a horror film. He's also able to adapt to the action genre by incorporating a constant sense of movement in his camera movement, making the already fast paced swordplay even more exciting. The only downside with the action is the CGI, which at times is rather chunky and ends up making Blade look more like an action figure. However it's so well implemented to maintain the flow of the fight that the effects never distract from the enjoyment of the scene. Not everything in this film works, with some characters having no real purpose and some poorly explained story elements like Whistler coming back from death in the first film. But what does work is so great that it's easy to look past these flaws. This is by far the best Blade film by delivering on all the cool things that made the first film so enjoyable, with it's fast paced action and awesome designs, whilst improving on the formula with even more impressive action sequences and a great story that leads up to an extremely satisfying pay off.",Blade II

Funny, because I am not a big fan of sequels, because they tend to lack much of what the original had. Anyways, Wesley Snipes is back, and so is Kris Kristoffersen. Much is the same, the humor is the same, Blade is still the coolest cat in the world and he still has the most amazing weaponry handy. So what is the biggest difference between Blade and Blade II? Well, the action. In the first movie, they had cool music and martial arts. In this movie, they have both those things, plus computer animated moves to make it look like Blade can jump immensely high and is very quick. For me, that didn't quite work because it is so obvious that it is computer animated. But a movie like this isn't without flaws, and if you count them all, it is still an entertaining movie.

The film is no doubt cooler than the first but not automatically better because the pessimist is slower and the movie is a bit smaller in any case a smaller one. With over 10 minutes filler.However bad looks different I always find it awesome when the people in a sequel idea in expand and at least enough new offer that you can watch the movie itself so you could watch this movie without knowing who Blade is or without the first And yet you would never be lost, that's the right way to make a sequel.The movie has a super cool look, the slogans are wandering out, sometimes they are not that good at me, but not so much that it bothers me. The movie does not come with many surprises that can really surprise but I think that was not the goal.The battles are unfortunately not so nice because too much CGI effects are used which have not been decently changed and the movements are inhumane. I do not know why but this movie has not been filmed in Cinemascope for some reason either. And the film editing is very difficult to follow.Catapulting the middle draws a bit and the movie has no big surprises the last half hour makes everything worth of that is why you watch this movie the last half hour is top North best fights best effects and best action that is the right way how to make movies.Gillamo Del Torro has used the right people here and his visual look fits perfectly in this bleak world the computer effects are just as bad as in the first part but I think that's intentional the practical effects are fantastico.",Blade II

Maybe the surprise was meant to shock you, but to create this sub-species, which almost went totally out of control, just to catch blade, is a little to incredible.  I presume the whole creation of the creature could have been faked just to get Blade to come over to Vampire Inc's HQ, where they could have just finished him off there.But the ending is less over the top than the original.If you are not comparing it to the original, it might be OK, so don't go seeing the movie with the expectation of a great followup and it will be OK.",Blade II

This movie was even better as it had a compelling storyline that followed through nicely. I like the idea of having two separate types of vampires. Most people said Blade 2 wasn't good because it had Blade fighting along vampires, but isn't Blade supposed to have several vampire traits? I thought it worked out fine, and Ron Pearlman does another great job in a movie.The only problem I had was with the swerves and what not. If Reinhardt was working alongside Damisaikus (I can't spell it) the whole time then why did he wipe out a whole slew of bald vampires with Nyssa and Blade earlier?

The vampires actually seek Blade out to help them kill a super-vampire by the name of Nomak who has no weaknesses except sunlight. I also like the relationship Blade had with Nyssa. It very much establishes Blade as a deeper character than previously thought. Especially when he chooses to kill Nomak when as said ""they want the same thing."" I also love Wesley Snipes as Blade and even Luke Goss plays a good Nomak.The fight scenes are very entertaining...when they aren't Computer Generated. The actual real people fighting was entertaining to watch, the CG in this film is definitely a down-point because its way too obvious. Those scenes have not aged well.Overall this is an entertaining followup to Blade, obviously its not better and its not on the same level but does that really matter? Its still good. 8/10",Blade II

I enjoyed this film very much, I plan to go see it again while it is still playing at the local theater. I give it 4 out of 5 stars",Blade II
151,Viva_Chiba,Good action-horror flick,9,3 October 2010,"I never saw any of the others ""Blade"" movies, i catch this one late night on cable, i found it good.The movie contains stylized gore, (vampires transforming into ""dust"" or ""ashes"" when they get killed) blood, and a good amount of action, including some martial arts fights.The plot have some continuity with the first Blade movie, so i can't judge much: After rescuing his partner Whistler, Blade joins with the vampire alliance in order to kill a new ""race"" of monsters called ""Reapers"".Wesley Snipes does a good job as ""Blade"", the kick-ass action hero ! Donnie Yen have a role as ""Snowman"" a kick-ass sidekick (a swordsman), Donnie also choreographed some of the fight scenes (good work Yen !).Trivia: in the credits you will see the following ""disclaimer"": ""No Reapers were harmed in the making of this movie"".",Blade II
152,Gambitt,Guess I always like the first one more,5,23 March 2002,"Blade 1 had just the right amount of action, horror, gore, paper-thin plot, and cinematic style to create a movie that was entertaining for the masses yet still get some nods from weathered movie critics.  Blade II takes this balance and goes over the top, using outlandish fight-scenes, loads of CGI, plenty of blood-dripping, gut-mashing gore, and even a bit more expletive language in the script.For a movie of this genre, the plot is needlessly complicated and drawn out, and there are a number of pointless plot twists thrown in towards the end. In the first movie, Blade made vampires look sadder than storm troopers, so new baddies were needed for the sequel.  Enter the reapers: vampire vampires that resemble the mutant love children of Nosferatu, Quasimodo, and Alien. So Blade teams up with the good vampires to fight the bad vampires. Sounds simple enough, right?  So why does it take over 2 hours to get through all the but-kicking?  It seems that lately there have been a number of action movies that have aspirations to be epic dramas.This is an extremely violent and gorey film.  ""Black Mask"" comes to mind as a movie on par with Blade II on the violentometer.  Blade II features numerous disemboweling, dismemberment, and mutilation scenes.  The action scenes and fight sequences are fairly typical, though many are shot closer than I prefer similar to the confused fight scenes of Batman and Robin. Also, if you ever come face to face with a zombie, mummy, undead, ghoul, vampire, reaper etc... watch out!  Forget crosses, silver, or holy water. All monsters in this post-Matrix age are highly trained in Tae-Kwon-Jiu-Jit-Fu, WWF-style.It wasn't all bad.  The movie succeeds as a thriller, making you jump at times.  The special ops vampire unit is an interesting lot, though none of them are developed enough for the audience to get attached.  Too bad Donnie Yen's talent was wasted.  If you're going to use a stereotypical Asian, sword-wielding, samurai character, then dangit at least let him kick a lot of but!So in short, if you are a big fan of gorefest movies  (ie the type who grew up reading Fangoria), then Blade II will not disappoint.  If you like your movies to be a little more, or at least know their bounds and not pass them, then I would steer clear of Blade II.  My final rating is 5 / 10 (watchable, but mostly forgettable).",Blade II
153,SPaS,Even better than the first one!,9,24 June 2002,"A Full-blooded gore galore 2-hour roller-coaster ride! That's all I gotta say about this film and I'm going to stick to it.Easily a 9/10 points film, only 2 complaints: *WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILERS*1) The Uber-vampires are once again harder than anything when introduced: one can take on dozens of ""normal"" vampires, but later on they 'grow weak"" (In the sewers 2 NORMAL vampires are capable of taking on hordes and hordes of ubers! And Blade himself takes them on with just one hand standing on a small cliff where the uber's seem to be unable to climb or jump onto at the moment!)2) The music... yet again and once for all: would Hollywood finally believe that DURING ACTION RAP AS BACKGROUND MUSIC SIMPLY DON'T WORK!! During preparations, yes. During testosterone-indulging conversations, yes. But during ACTION - BIG NO! Heavy tunes, heavy tunes- either rock (Worked beautifully in Crow) or techno / hard trance (works best, as seen in Blade 1, Replacement killers etc.) And a word about the using of trance: before putting on anything that sounds cool in that side of the Atlantic, ask an opinion about it from Europe. ""Confusion"" [P.P.R. RMX] was a lucky shot in the beginning of Blade 1, but ""Blood Is Pumping"" by Voodoo & Serano in Blade 2 is not just VERY old news in here, it's also a bad example of a rip-off remake (the original is  ""Up to no Good"" by Porn Kings). Just from the top of my head I could have given the makers half a dozen better tunes to play in the rave scene. So, for the next time, give me a call :)",Blade II
154,WilsonLau,Best action movie in years,10,24 March 2002,"Blade 2 has all the ingredients of a great action movie. More importantly it lacks all the ingredients that an action movie doesn't need. People are saying it lacks depth in plot but I think that the plot is solid, it doesn't contradict, it doesn't confuse, it makes sense. Besides I feel that the plot was adequate and was not as thin as people are saying it is. The movie is of course non stop action from beginning till end. You can really tell the difference that it makes when you have an experienced kung fu choreograher (Donnie Yen). The fight scenes are 10 times more intense than in the first. The characters are really cool, have cool weapons and are just really neat to watch. Wesley Snipes doesn't miss a beat and proves once again that he is a solid action movie man. Enough with the lovey dubby junk with movies like One Night Stand, back to bone crushing, neck breaking action. Blade 2 provides all the elements of a classic action hit, it doesn't let up and it doesn't let down. 2 thumbs up.10 out of 10",Blade II
155,TheBabblingFool,two words: Kick Butt!,8,25 March 2002,"I am going to make a statement that may tork off you anal movie-goers, so brace yourselves. Blade 2 is the only sequel that with out a doubt blows the first one away (although the first one was great) since Terminator 2. I will say that the plot wasn't as tight and good as T2, but it surpassed its' predessesor on many levels.The first thing that is great about this film: the character that is Blade. Half-man, half-vampire, (which raises the question, which came first, Blade or Angel?) Blade looks like a cross between a ninja, a biker, and Batman. Finally there is a black action lead character that does not need to spout ebonics, crack wise about everybody else's race, and try to be ""the blackest guy on earth"" (Learn from this Will Smith, Chris Rock, Chris Tucker...). Wesley plays his role with confidence, and a very cool attitude, and as normal as a vampire-man would be.Now lets talk about the enemy in this flick, the Reapers. Not since the early 1990's have I seen a better thought out creature than this. The design behind the anatomy of the Reapers is extremely well thought out, and a lot of appriciated detail was put into it. I don't feel like giving away all attributes about them, but just think of them as a cross between Predator and Marilyn Manson during his Holywood phase.So here lies the plot, these Reapers drink both human and vampire blood, so therefore the Vampire nation calls Blade to lead a team of Vampires (who were origionally trained to kill Blade) to destroy these Reapers before they reak havoc on everybody. It's not extremely complicated, but it works dammit.The greatest thing in this film is the fights, I knew that Wesley Snipes knew martial arts, I just didn't know he was THIS good at it. I sat in awe as I watched Wesley whip out moves that would make Jet Li jealous. The film does use computer effects during the fights to make Blade and these other super powered creatures fly and get thrown in the air with a grand flow to it all, and it works really well.Long review short: If you wanna see a action/horror/martial arts/vampire/superhero film (Lord knows how many of those are out there)then go see Blade 2 right now!",Blade II
156,whatdoes1know,The Caliban Institute,10,3 April 2002,"If you look to the side, you will see that the vampire's lair is called the Caliban Institute. Caliban as in the freak trying to kill his master in Shakespeare's the tempest, and Caliban as in anagram for Canibal--cannibal, or vampire eating vampire. Blade is the little boy's fantasy come true, and it scratched the itch I got from watching pretentious-PG-13-for-little-Goths-wannabes-posing-as-dark-movie-Queen-of-th e-Damned by mutilating the bodies of Satanicly twist-minded vampires, and turning them into BME poster children. In the end, as Satanic as Anne Rice wants them to be, her vampires are no more menacing than a pair of white fags--I mean fangs. As menacing as these pansies pretend to be, they would probably faint at the sight Robbie Williams' ""Rock DJ"", which is the stuff you see in the clubs Blade hangs out at. It also turned away from the wow,-mom-I-know-kung-fu-too,-look-at-me! action genre in moments of sheerly brilliant comic relief. Bor lei jun and Seunlau ngaklau both showed that jump kicks are the stupidest moves to throw against wrestlers, and Blade knows it and takes it to the next level by bringing the prowrestling in the kung-fu. Finally, the tragedy of the vampires is played much more dramatically here than in either of Anne Rice's movies, and the end is a pure beauty.",Blade II
157,crowrobot,Blood-drenched action flick that delivers the goods,8,24 July 2007,"""Blade II"" is a blast, an atmospheric horror-action thrill ride from director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth). Filling his canvas with sticky surfaces, gold hues and tones, and blood as only del Toro can do blood, ""Blade II"" is simultaneously exciting and gross.Long story short: Blade (Wesley Snipes) must join forces with the Vampire Nation to eliminate a new breed of vampires called Reapers. Reapers feed on both humans AND vampires, so it's bad news for both sides. Made leader of a team previously trained to hunt him (which includes amongst its members Ron Perlman and Donnie Yen), Blade finds himself in some very deep trouble as he discovers that there is more than meets the eye to the Reapers.The Reapers are one of the best parts of Blade II. Armed with Predator-esquire jaws and an incredibly disgusting tongue, they are quite possibly the grossest antagonists in recent memory. They are also very persistent, occasionally resembling the creatures from the Alien series. There is an autopsy on a fallen Reaper that is both fascinating and repulsive; I would suggest not eating before watching this scene.del Toro does a fine job with the action scenes; wisely utilizing the terror of the Reapers as a starting point, the only downsides to the action are the occasionally really fake-looking CGI stunt men (especially in the vampire-ninja fight). The smack downs between Blade and Nomak (Luke Goss), the original Reaper, are wonderfully over-the-top and cartoony.Blade II is just loads of fun, even more so than the first movie. Just remember not to eat before watching.",Blade II
158,Mitch-25,Action from beginning to end,9,24 March 2002,"Yes, this movie didn't have much of a plot.  But, did you really EXPECT one? What you will expect and do get is ACTION, and LOTS of it.  Wesley Snipes makes the perfect vampire character.  He is tough, but very likeable.  The fight scenes were great.  And as hard as this might be to believe, this is BETTER than the first.One note about the blood and guts: There is LOTS of it.  Almost EVERY creature in this movie seems to bleed from some place.  But, unlike some movies, the bleeding does add to the movie.",Blade II
159,McFrogg,Painful,1,17 April 2018,"Blade is back in this much gorier and CGI-ier sequel. It's more of the same garbage, but with a pinch of dog excrement added.If the pansy vampires from the first weren't bad enough, we now have ""Reapers"", mutants who feed on blood suckers. And since this is H.P. Lovecra...uh, Guillermo Del Toro, it needs to be as disgusting as possible (at least he didn't include his fish fetish), with the reaper's jaws breaking open, revealing a leech-looking tongue.The vampires seek out Blade to help them exterminate the Reapers. This time, Blade has a new, marijuana smoking sidekick, a resurrected Whistler and the ""Blood Pack (tm)"" to help him kill the new monsters in the goriest ways possible.The whole movie is like a nightmare, and not in a good, classic horror movie way. It's hard to describe, but imagine if your uncle Larry decided to travel to hell and when he came back, he wanted to show you his vacation movie. Everyone is a foul-mouthed sadist in this movie. Everything looks and feels disgusting.We're so lucky we even get to see our ""heroes"" dissect one of the ""Reapers"". Why? Because Troy McClur...sorry, Del Toro, wants to shove disgusting things in your face. If you watch the behind-the-scenes feature, it's revealed that they used sex toys and fake semen to make the Reaper's innards. That should tell you something about the quality of the movie. There's also a strange scene at a vampire night club, where a woman's back is cut open and the spine is exposed. What's the point?The twist near the end, where Blade's new kid sidekick is revealed to be a traitor is so stupid and illogical I almost laugh when I think about it. Earlier in the movie, it's revealed that Blade saved the stoner from two vampire girls (yet another excuse to add vulgarity). He ""planned it all along"". Yeah, right. How does that even work? ""Plan A: Rip my intestines out of my body. Then, Blade will show up and save me. He'll probably kill you two, and I'll quite possibly die myself. Plan B: ...wait, there's no plan B? Who wrote this plan, David S. Goyer?""The fight between Blade and the main reaper Nomak is like watching someone else play Mortal Kombat on Playstation 2. I'm don't expect realistic physics in a comic book movie, but at times Blade looks like he's a big-headed, rubber puppet bouncing on a string. When the movie finally ends (at a peep show, where else?), the words of the tragic villain Nomak echoes through my mind: ""it...it hurts no more!""There's no beauty in Blade 2. There's no goodness or truth. I'm not sure if it deserves to be called a movie. It's a waste of time, money and film. Like its predecessor, it's just meaningless garbage. Save your time and watch/read something better.(Del Toro ripped off his own movie in Hellboy. I'm talking about the sewer battle. How lazy!)",Blade II
160,Blackace,Ohh My!! Blade 2 Is One Bloody Good Sequel.,8,5 April 2002,"I'm not going to write a long review for Blade 2. I just want to say..""SEE IT!!"" This sequel is much better then the original, with more fight scenes, more gore, way more vampires and a lot of cool surprises. I was very impressed. Wesley Snipes did a great job reprising his role as the DayWalker. In a recent interview he said he would be happy to do a Blade 3 if the story was decent and other comic book characters we're introduced. So there's a good chance for a sequel. The plot for Blade 2 is about a new breed of vampire that doesn't have any weaknesses. Trying to use silver bullets, garlic, holy water, or crosses just don't work. The only thing that can kill them is sunlight and a stake through the heart (I guess they DO have a couple weaknesses). They are twice as strong and agile as the normal vampire. They also have a heartier (no pun intended) appetite for blood. The Daywalker is teamed up with the BloodPack (group of Vampires that we're trained to terminate the DayWalker) to stop the new breed known as Reapers. The plot isn't anything special, but it keeps the movie moving in the right direction and provides plenty of action along the way. My only disappointment was with some of the cheesy special effects use during the fight scenes. One fight between Blade & Nyssa was partly done in CGI and looked pretty bad. Why wasn't wire-style fighting used instead? More could have been with the plot as well, but what's here isn't terrible.Overall it's a must see movie. If you watched the first Blade and enjoyed it, Blade 2 should be on your list of things to do.",Blade II
161,Exiled_Universe,A very good movie but no better than the first one.,9,26 August 2019,This movie was very good and i enjoyed watching it but it wasn't better than the first one and if i had to choose between the first one and this one i would choose the first one but i still love this movie and i thought it was cool. The special effects were a big improvement from the first one so thats a good thing. I feel like the first one did a better job showing and explaining blade and had more action and better scenes. There was a whole new feel to this movie starting from a whole new group and characters and new villains and vampires and it makes the movie look silly at some times and sometimes i get aliens vibes from the whole group hunting vampire and stuff. The movies best part is the first 10 minutes just like the first movie but the only other good part were some of the fight scenes and the club scene but the music was kinda the only cool part and also the shootout within that part. I mean i feel like it was very different from the first and a lot of new things but i feel like thats a good thing too because its a new movie and its good thats its not the same thing even though i loved the first one but i feel like it was better to turn a new leaf. It had a whole new vibe and most of the movie is taken place underground which also again makes it feel like the movie alien where the whole movie takes place in space which i just realized that sounds kind of creepy. Anyway probably a one time watch for now but not forever and i will definitely see these cool movie again sometime in the future and i cant wait to see blade trinity and it should hopefully be a good ending to the blade trilogy which is sad but there might be a new movie soon by marvel sometime in the future or should i say by Disney. Anyway watch it its cool but see the first one first obviously.,Blade II
162,culmo80,Best of the Blade films,8,4 March 2008,"Yes I know, that's saying a lot (or not much) but it's true. The first Blade, to me, is comprised mostly of introducing the audience to Blade and explaining this version of the Vampire. These vampires are not affected by religious icons unlike Vampires in other works of fiction, just as an example. I also thought Stephen Dorff didn't pull off the arch-villain too well. He always comes off as a bit snotty and I just couldn't accept him as this mastermind to bring about a Vampire god. Maybe I'm being too critical, who knows.In Blade 3, the villains across the board seemed like amateurs compared to what he faced in previous films. Even Stephen Dorff was more believable than Parky Posey or the rest of that bunch. Dominic Purcell as Dracula or Drake....nah, not buying it. Hey, I like him in Prison Break but as the original vampire, I think they could have found someone with a little more depth. Hey, the guy who played Dracula in Van Helsing pulled it off perfectly. Also, there was just too much comic relief from Ryan Reynolds whom I could not buy as a vampire hunter. Every line from him was a joke, it seemed. Plus, they killed Whistler...again. Kris Kristofferson(sp) had little more than a cameo in this film simply so they could bring in eye candy with Jessica Biehl (sp). She did alright but it wasn't anything special.Now, take Blade 2. The villains were believable. The acting was good for the most part and the plot was interesting and deep enough. Basically, after Blade tracks down Whistler who has become a vampire himself, he is recruited by the Vampires to help fight a new common enemy, the reapers. The reapers are a mutation of the vampire virus that creates a creature more powerful than the vampire and harder to kill. Blade agrees to team up with the Vampires to hunt these creatures until it turns out that the head vampire has set this all up to create the next step in the vampire evolution. That's a pretty brief synopsis.What makes this Blade film different is that there is actual character development for Blade. He develops, if nothing else, a respect for vampires and even a possible love interest with a Vampire woman. This was starkly different compared to the other films where Blade is just a constant brooding individual who never changes.The special effects are great; no more of that obvious computerized blood that made Blade 1 almost silly at times. The fight scenes are great and come on...any film that has Ron Pearlman in it is going to be good.Blade 2 just had a different feel to it.",Blade II
163,Space_Lord,Reaper madness!,7,24 May 2005,"Enjoyable sequel in which Wesley Snipes reprises his role as Blade, the half human, half vampire vampire hunter! Blade must team up with his vampire enemies to combat a new threat that could endanger both humans and vampires: the reapers! The reapers are powerful vampires that feed on vampires! How many times can I fit the word 'vampire' into this review? I don't know! But I digress, this film is great action from go to woah, featuring all you could ever want in a vampire movie. Plenty of gore, gadgets, action, and fights, and all backed up by a solid performance by most of the cast. Snipes is awesome, Ron Perlman who is excellent, and Kris Kristofferson once again.

It doesn't matter.Luke Goss is very good as Kamon, and the special effects - Oh my - they're beautiful.  So many slow-mo camera moments, deadly gadgets, brilliant vampire combustion, and actually very, very well done monster FX for the reapers.The only person I really didn't like was Whistler's replacement, but that just meant I enjoyed the ending even more.

165,Batkid1,"Pretty good sequel, but not for everyone.",8,12 August 2007,"This movie manages to live up to the under-rated original, but just like the 1999 remake of THE MUMMY, if you didn't ""dig"" the first one, then you won't find anything different about the follow-up. Wesley Snipes does less talking and more fighting as he faces more enemies and meets possible allies ( some of them are annoying). Kris Kristofferson returns as well and Ron Perlman joins the gang, but has plans of his own. The film will not scare anyone, but it will pack a punch for Action/Adventure fans as there are numerous stunts and enough blood to satisfy the ""gore"" fan. Sometime the stunts don't work because they rely too much on CGI (Realistic animation done w/ computers).There also could had been better character development and less flaws, but that wasn't the film's biggest goal. People who do not like ultra-violent movies or are ""squemish"" have better stay clear because once this film starts, it never let's up. Recommended for fans of the first film and those seeking a type of ""action-sequences- galore!"" movie.",Blade II
166,EdYerkeRobins,Thrills? Yes. Style? A little. Substance? NO!,5,23 March 2002,"There are two kinds of vampire movies: those that present the vampire as a dark, soulful, mysterious, troubled being, and those where they're just fodder for ass-kickings from uber-cool vampire hunters.  ""Blade II"" is, like ""Blade"", definitely in the latter category.  It's also the kind of film that works solely as a cheap thrill, enjoyable for the moments watching it in the theatre without any lasting impression.	""Blade II"" is full of one thing, and that is Wesley Snipes killing lots of vampires.  Not just everyday vampires, mind you, but a new breed of super-vampires called Reapers.  The Reapers are such a threat that Snipes is joined not only by old friend Whistler (a returning Kris Kristofferson) and new assistant Scud, but also by a vampire task force, a motley crew who look interesting enough but not-so-surprisingly provide very little help to Snipes in any of the film's multitude of fight scenes.  They also make lots more Reapers very fast, which also helps because it provides a lot of fodder for the film's multitude of fight scenes.	Now that it's been established that the core of the movie is composed of fight scenes, the question becomes are the fight scenes enjoyable? Exciting, thrilling, and absurdly unrealistic (director Guillermo del Toro replaced the live actors with computer-generated body doubles so they could do what no real actor could  its just a shame that the transition from live actor to CG body is so obvious), the one-on-one fight scenes are a sight to behold (particularly when Blade uses wrestling movies in a climactic battle, after running up walls and jumping what looks like 20 feet in the air), but, like in any other film, anti-climactic sequences where Blade takes on large groups of Reapers single-handedly without batting an eyelash get old very fast.  Seeing vampire after vampire vanish into CG smoldering ash and bones is impressive the first time, but after seeing it time and time again, one will leave the theatre in a sort of trance, the only thoughts on their mind being, ""Too many computer graphics...""	This is really a shame because there's some beautiful direction and unexpectedly good story in ""Blade II"".  Del Toro, following up his acclaimed ""Devil's Backbone"" and considerably less acclaimed ""Mimic"", has crafted a beautiful dark atmosphere.  An interesting mixture of technology and gothic architecture, it fits the film and its characters perfectly.  Scenes in an underground series of tunnel-like enclosures have great use of shadow, even giving a sense of mystery to something as obvious as a roving pack of Reapers seen in the background creeping along the ceiling and walls of a corridor towards a character.  David Goyer crafted a much more significant and engrossing story (when all is revealed at the end, its surprisingly smart) this time around, albeit with some occasionally really dumb dialogue. It really kills the dark tone of the setting and movie if the audience (myself included) is laughing at the protagonists' lines (Whistler was especially bad at this, lashing petty insults at the vampires at every opportunity).  Unfortunately, since the action takes precedence, very little of these two great traits come off as more than afterthoughts.	""Blade II"" is a little too action packed.  As enjoyable as seeing Wesley Snipes killing lots of vampires is, when that seems to be the only draw it's enjoyable for all the wrong reasons.  The film's other aspects are good and would've been really great had they been developed, but these were shelved for action that is good enough for a quick thrill but cheapens the film so it doesn't leave a lasting impression.  Is this a terrible thing? Not really, but it's a little disappointing.  If quick thrills are all you are interested in, ""Blade II"" is a good fix, but if you want more substance in a film look someplace else.",Blade II
167,superboy478,Weak Sequel!,8,31 March 2002,"Blade II is probably one of the most dumb sequels made. It didn't make too much sense, the plot was boring and overrated, and it was too short.Wesley Snipes returns as the half human/vampire Blade. This time, he is not fighting vampires. He is fighting creatures known as Reapers. That is basically it.
Ages: 17 & Up!Hopefully Blade III will be better. I can't wait!",Blade II
168,DJ_Shilo,Hunting Season Continues,9,21 September 2018,"Guillermo Del Toro steps into the director's seat and takes over for ""Blade II."" Seeing has how Del Toto is a visionary; it's not hard to figure out why this sequel is superior to the original ""Blade."" ""Blade"" was a rollercoaster ride of high-octane action and gory vampire violence, but ""Blade II"" takes it to new levels, and we learn a little more about this mysterious hunter they call the ""Daywalker.""It about half human half vampire, Blade (Wesley Snipes), who finds himself up against a new mutated strain of vampires called ""Reapers."" When the vampire lords realize they can't combat the creatures, they turn to Blade for help. Of course, Blade is reluctant, at first, but he decides the Reapers are a greater evil. With new weapons and gadgetry, he strikes an uneasy truce and teams up with his sworn enemies, the Blood Pack, before the Reapers take over and drive humankind and the Vampires into extinction.It opens in a blood bank in Prague. I sense this is not the place you want to go to give blood. It seems dank and unclean. Not to mention the doctor has what looks like a Freddy Krueger glove. Before everyone in the blood clinic gets slaughtered, a character who remains a mystery looks at the camera, and we get a quick glimpse that he is a different type of vampire before the camera cuts to black. These new vampires called ""Reapers"" are quite a fresh design. Guillermo Del Toro's imagination knows no limits, and it shows.Blade prowled the streets in the original film like a lonely warrior but now finds himself against all the odds as he must take on the reapers and keep the vampires on their feet because he is smarter than they think. Wesley Snipes is still convincing as Blade. He's intelligent, aware of his surroundings and cracks jokes in his sarcastic ways but can again blow something up if he wanted to and make the body parts fly. He seems to be much stronger and more prominent than before, and this proves when he puts up a big fight against two vampires that get sent to retrieve him and deliver a message. They tell him - ""You have been our worst enemy, but now there is something else on the streets worse than you!""He was raised from childhood by Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who trained him to fight the vampires and kept his vampirism in check with an injection of some sorts. Whistler returns in this film, now rescued from a tank harvesting his blood and revived with a retro injection of some sort. Snipes is more agile as Blade this time around. He is older, wiser and still uncertain about himself. With this new threat of the ""Reapers,"" Whistler designs the new UV weapons when they examine a dead Reaper and discover a stake will not piece its heart due to it surrounded by bone. He also gets a lot of flack as being the old hillbilly and berates Blade's new assistant, Scud (Norman Reedus), for screwing up the operation he started years before.Del Toro crafts a visceral and well-made film filled with gorgeous special effects, high production and, of course, more blood, gore and extreme violence to fill a bucket. Make no mistake, ""Blade II"" is a brutally, intense film and not for kids. It's twice as violent and disturbing as the original. Usually, I would say something about the violence levels being that extreme, but it works well for the film because most will want to see Wesley Snipes pounding on the vampires and watching them scream or run. It's entertaining to watch the Vampires/Reapers suffer in gory defeat. No one is safe from Blade's new weapons and gadgets when his iconic sword starts cutting through everything in its path and his guns rip everything to shreds.Most of the second act is Blade chasing after Jared Nomak, the vampire who created the ""Reapers."" They are quite an exciting concept. They are pale white, have a three-way jaw with sucker-like tentacles, and they feed on both vampires and humans. They also have some sort-of scar running down their chins that turn out to be an opening for their mouth, like a clef. Therefore, Blade's usual weapons do not work as well and use the UV lights to combat the creatures when Blade decides to go into the sewers to take them out.You can almost bet there will be a ""Blade III."" I am not sure what kind of vampire they can design, but I am interested to see it because of the high-quality Del Toro brought to this film. He doesn't rely on a lot of computer effects. You can see some are when Blade is climbing on a wall, but for the most part, he delivers a well-made film. Some will be turned off by the extreme violence, but if you liked ""Blade,"" I can't see how you are not going to be thrilled after seeing this. It improves on everything the original did. I left out the Bloodpack Vampires for a reason. There is not much to say with them. One holds a revelation we see coming in the second act. There are two revelations, actually, but it's better to see them, but don't be surprised by it..",Blade II
169,IOBdennis,Puerile stupidity,1,9 September 2002,"You can't SPOIL anything that is already rotten.  This movie is blindingly stupid, inane, and disgusting. Yes, it's got shock appeal for those who like gore.  But now that we've seen people French kissing with razor blades in their mouths, people slicing each other open to expose muscle tissue and spinal columns, Hollywood has done nothing more than animate what those in my generation saw growing up in ""Tales from the Crypt"" comic books (now there's a misnomer!).The kung fu sequences in this film are predictable, repetitive, and the computerized elements are glaringly apparent in the DVD version.  And when one hackneyed story element is enough, they throw in a slow-mo rap sequence, as if to make everything okay.The story that amounts to about two pages of dialog is mildly interesting at first, but one quickly loses interest, just as the filmmakers show they were disinterested in the plot and devote most of their time on the blood, gore, and fight scenes (YAWN!).Scarey?  NAH!  The modern re-make of ""Nosferatu"" is better, even down to the makeup.  Hey, Hollywood, more guts doesn't make anything scarier. Hitchcock knew that (unfortunately he was wrong on the technicolor issue).  Movies like ""Psycho,"" ""The Innocents,"" ""The Others,"" ""Sixth Sense,"" show how to involve the audience in a story and thrill them at the same time.",Blade II
170,MinorityReporter,Decent entertainment but overall inferior to the first!,6,17 October 2005,"Blade II is a very entertaining film. To summarize the film is fairly easy as the film consists of one fight sequence after another and that is not a bad thing. Far from it because it is highly entertaining to watch Blade kick some ass but it is also the greatest flaw of Blade II, which could have been even better than the first film.Blade is back in action and the storyline picks up a few years after the first one ended but the story is just a loose draft to provide for a lot of heavy action. The film starts off strong with Blade chasing some vampires. Blade soon accomplishes his objective and after only a few minutes of peace Blade finds himself in the middle of some heavy action once again. It seems to me that the film makers knew that there wasn't much of a story and just decided to cover it up with a lot of action and to del Toro's credit, it nearly works. A few action sequences are marred, however, by some very lame and unbelievable CGI. The CGI is so bad in fact that the film is dragged down from an otherwise deserved 7. Overall the action works though and I must admit I was entertained and after the first viewing I even preferred Blade II to the 1998 original. After re-watching it, however, I realized that a lot more attention was payed to the first film.Wesley Snipes returns in the sequel as the title character and he is woolly at best. His performance is pretty non-existent. Most of the act is in posing and looking cool which we knew he could do from the first film. I am not asking for a deep personal look into the character's psychology but a little depth couldn't hurt now could it? Most of his lines are hissed in the usual Blade manner and so not a lot of new has happened to the Blade character. The character of Whistler returns once again in the form of Kris Kristofferson who does what he can but as the story is pretty flat so his character is as well which is a shame because we know from the first film that Kristofferson is a talented guy. It seems that the leading ladies are all picked by their lack of talent because even though I didn't think it was possible an even worse leading lady was found for the second film in the form of Leonor Varela. Her performance is lifeless at best and her ""relationship"" to Blade is embarrassingly badly written. Ron Perlman is in this film as well and some say it is his best (before his breakthrough in Hellboy) character but I disagree. While his character is the most worthwhile in the film it still isn't great. The villain played by Luke Goss is a decent villain and seems like a decent challenge to Blade (unlike the villain of Blade Trinity) and there are a few interesting showdowns between Blade and the villain. Other than this the acting is pretty standard.The film's visual style differs from the first film and this is good because it further separates this film from the first. Blade II can stand on its own. The color palette has moved more towards earth like colors like brown(ish) and yellow which makes the film interesting to look at during the slow talking parts. The overall set work is excellent and especially the sewer set is very claustrophobic and atmospheric, kudos to the set people and the director. Here also the music should be mentioned as it is nearly as good as in the first film which had a great soundtrack. Compared to the instantly forgettable soundtrack of the third film it is like Mozart. A few changes have been made to the wardrobe as well. Blade's costume has become more streamlined and some color has been added to the his cape and this looks great. Blade is cooler than ever.Blade II is not a deep or personal film for that matter but it is entertaining and two brainless hours of pure testosteroned action. My suggestion is that you leave your brain at the door and enjoy the action because there is plenty of it and the Blade character himself deserves a closer look. The film is not as good as the first but it is still an exhilarating ride and the comic book feel remains making Blade II a decent film.6/10",Blade II
171,HBeachBabe,"great visuals, weak story",7,27 September 2002,"The effects for the new Reapers were amazing.  The way the jaw split as well as when they did the disection, made you really believe such a creature is real and they just managed to film it.The story was recycled Buffy meets the Dolph lundgren Punisher film, where the hero makes a deal with his enemies to fight an even worse enemy while falling in love with a person he is supposed to hate and betrayed by those he trusted.  Bland, boring and wholly unoriginal.But the amazing visuals are almost worth the 2 hours of mediocre plot.  If you are looking for a great vampire story watch Buffy or rent Near Dark.  If you want great effects and non stop digitally enhanced martial arts set to a pulsating soundtrack, watch Blade 2",Blade II

Guillermo del Toro, who directed ""Cronos,"" ""Mimics,"" and ""The Devil's Backbone,"" took over and did a fantastic job with this movie.  Besides Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson (again as Whistler), writer David S. Goyer (who wrote ""Dark City,"" ""Death Warrant,"" ""The Crow: City of Angels,"" and ""Blade""), returns as the writer. ""Blade 2"" is one of the several sequels that surpasses the original.

Unfortunately, plot and character development appear to have been left on the cutting room floor.The fight scenes are fun, but it grows tedious. While blade 2 is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor, the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier.This bloody punch-fest lacks the charming antagonists that livened the original movie.If only as much time was spent on the script as was spent on the fight choreography.Take away everything that was original about BLADE, add some exploding vampires, and vampire night at the WWF - you get BLADE II, a knock-off, rip-off waste of film, released to suck the blood and money out of audiences everywhere.Just never seems very convinced of itself that a sequel was even necessary.This second instalment in the trilogy tries to crank things up even more than in the action packed original, which makes for an obnoxiously hyper active movie.Isn't as sharp as the original,Despite some visual virtues, Blade II just doesn't cut it.The fast-paced action is unnervingly fast, almost dizzying. The story is thin, the plot is predictable, but Wesley Snipes carries this comic book character off with enough clever humour and self-indulgent pathos to carry it off.There are plot twists and inventive fight scenes galore, but what director Guillermo Del Toro loves most is the gore.Blade II is almost excessively violent OK, it is excessively violent but that's exactly what Snipes and Blade fans want.

176,fullenw,Greatest comic movie EVER!!!!,10,22 December 2006,"In Blade II Whistler returns,that was a BIG plus. It also has good continuation from part 1. 1 gripe some fans have is the CGI fights. I didn't like them but they weren't so bad that they ruined the entire movie.Guellermo del Toro's directing in this was like Tim Burtons directing in the Batman movies: He's so good at making a villain so ruthless yet you can feel sorry for the villain too.Unlike Blade Trinity, Blade II has so many characters yet still manages to focus on Blade. Ron Perlman did a great job also.(real treat for Hellboy fans) This sequel has Blade teaming with the Bloodpack that trained 2 years to hunt him, so they can get rid of new vampires called Reapers. Scary thing is Reapers are far superior to regular Vampires. The final fight between Blade & Nomak was surprising and was pulled off really well. Whats really interesting is that throughout the movie its hard to tell whos on whos side. In conclusion: twist, lots of action/little drama, great acting, superb cast, awesome director makes for one of best action movies ever. Its a shame Del Toro couldn't direct Blade trinity,(he was making Hellboy at the time)",Blade II
177,ARTaylor,Good but not Special,7,25 May 2011,"I didn't care for this one. Maybe because I heard so many people say it was better than the first that I got my expectations up too high. I didn't find the characters all that compelling or the universe all that intriguing this time around. The villain certainly wasn't as interesting as Deacon Frost. It didn't seem like Blade had any substantial subplots to keep us interested in him. I hated that they brought back Whistler after his terrific sacrifice scene in the first film. Perhaps if the first had set up his return, but as it is it's just sloppy continuity. The action and style of the movie are great. But they would be out-shined by Del Toro's Hellboy movies. It worked, but it wasn't as fresh as it was when the first movie came out. At the very least, the CGI looked finished this time around. The movie is okay, but it doesn't really do much to stand out on its own. The character was already introduced, the story was nothing special, and the fights were nothing that The Matrix didn't already popularize.",Blade II
178,Time Tripper,Action packed good time.,7,3 April 2002,"Blade II is an excellent film if you are only seeing it for its action sequences.  There are many, they are big, and they are loud.  Wesley Snipes is again great as Blade, who seems a little more human this time out.  He seems more vulnerable this time around thanks in part to Blade's student/mentor relationship with Kris Kristopherson's Whistler. 
Blade also has a new partner, ""Scud"", who provides comic relief and helps move the plot along when it needs it.  Blade is also teamed with a team of vampire commandos.  The commandos were awesome for the screentime they were given, and I really wish that they'd been developed more.  Ron Pearlman really stands out as the vampire with the biggest grudge against Blade. Snipes and Pearlman play well against each other in this movie.One drag on the movie, unfortunately, is Leonor Varela, playing the beautiful daughter of the vampires' supreme leader (one can assume he took over after the vampire council was destroyed in the first film).  She and Blade become a little too attached to each other a little too quickly. Varela's acting ability doesn't add anything to the part.  She only sounds believable when delivering the all-important exposition that furthers the plot.Another problem is that the plot isn't particularly clever beyond its premise.  Beyond the idea that Blade would have to team up with vampires to kill even more merciless super-vampires, the movie pretty much writes itself.  None of the double crosses that litter the film come as a surprise, and you might find yourself wondering how Blade got himself into several of the dumb situations he finds himself in.Beyond those flaws, however, you are still left with an incredible non-stop action extravaganza.  Blades deadly skills have seemed to increased since his previous film, as have his arsenal of anti-vampire gadgets.  The props and design departments for Blade II certainly did an amazing job.  Also, thanks to computer effects, Blade moves faster and is more agile than ever before.Blade II is a very well done action film.  Although it does have a few flaws, those flaws DO NOT take away from the non-stop, fast-paced action of this movie.  Not as good as the Matrix, but one hell of a good time.",Blade II
179,m0rg16,It just sucks,4,22 April 2006,"This sequel takes out everything that was good about the first film and adds in stuff that doesn't work at all. The marvelous action scenes are replaced by traditional Hollywood fights where you have no clue of what's going on and several times the director feels the need to use unrealistic CGI just to replace his actors. You can easily tell the difference between actors and the CGI versions of them, especially in this film. Trust me. Especially dumb is the scene in the beginning where Blade fights against another vampire, and it is shown from the side as if it was some kind of Mortal Kombat video game. You'll have to look hard for a dumber action scene, actually.The Blade series is here turned into something much less mature and adult and into something that is even more dumbed down than the original (which was no Casablanca, but still good). Action at exactly every corner, lots of shooting and fighting and screaming. But no character. You don't really care for anyone in this film, not even Blade. Why is that? Because Blade is no longer the animal he was in the first film, he's much more refined here. He takes time to meditate, he actually lets a wounded vampire go and he does a lot of unnecessary sword moves for no other purpose than to get the audience to watch Wesley Snipes make his moves. In several scenes, Blade flashes his sword around despite being completely alone. Instead of cutting of a tube, he raises his sword and slashes in the air for five seconds before actually turning to cut the tube off. Why? It just looks dumb. Let's not forget the dumbed down rap music and hip characters they threw in. Compare the young and cool Scud to the old and weathered Whistler. Whistler kicks ass, whereas Scuds constant hip remarks are just annoying. Why didn't he die in scene one?The visuals are very colorful. The colors are: Red and blue. That's it, you won't find any other colors here. It gets very tiresome after awhile, and the visuals are further damaged by the constant use of CGI even when it's not necessary! A lot of times CGI blood is added, or cgi characters. It just looks bad. Period.Also, vampire lore is changed. The vampires no longer put up a fight at all, instead they die just by a single gunshot wound. In the original, Blade actually had some trouble beating a few vampires and was taken down by a few of them in some scenes! Here, they go down dime-a-dozen and one wonders why we have to go through two hours of Blade just kicking immense ass in action scenes that are rehashed over and over and over again. Let's not forget the obvious plot holes and character mistakes. In one scene Whistler, an old vampire hunter, knocks out a vampire villain, grabs a sword and then... Takes off? Why the hell didn't he just turn that sword on the already knocked out vampire and save Blade some trouble? What kind of vampire hunter does NOT kill an evil vampire when he has him under his blade? Stuff like this is abundant all the way through, and makes you sit uneasy in your seat.Also, the villain is nowhere near as characteristic or colorful as Deacon Frost in the original. It's just a bald headed, pale super vampire who can take out anyone except for Blade. We don't give a crap about the stupid sub plot they threw in about him, or any of the other stupid subplots.Gah, it hurts my head just thinking about this mess. Avoid.",Blade II
180,diztorted,Action gets an upgrade,9,2 April 2002,"Most of the films that come out each year belong to certain genre, whether drama, horror, action, etc. But once in a while, there are films that not only belong to a genre but redefine it, films that change your vision to this certain genre. The kind of films that make you think ""Just when we thought we had seen it all...this comes out"". And this year that film has a name... Blade II.Since it is a sequel, it is obvious if not logical to compare it to its predecessor, but no matter how much you might like the first one, or how much you hate sequels, this is far superior than the other one. The mood is incredible, the action top notch, the music adequate, the visuals stunning. And what I love the most, scenes in which I went ""How the heck did they do that?!!!!"". By the end of the film I had to wait for the lights to come to find my jaw because I dropped it sometime during the movie.
Of course it has its flaws, but the film is so hyperactive that you don't have time to think about then while the movie is on. I mean, why is it that the bad guys are so dumb and many and the good guys agile and few? huh? But then again... This is part of a folklore you have to follow like the slowiness of the zombies or the shredded pants on werewolves, right? So it is not a problem here either. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD and see it over and over again during my insomnia nights at 3:00 am.I read Wesley Snipes suffered a lot during the shooting, I guess you have to pay with your own blood for something to be alright.

I mostly like sequels if they are not complete mess, and this film is not, but some things about it don't let me say it is as good as the first Blade. First is the atmosphere. It changed completely and it doesn't affect film in any good way. In the first film we have a misterious story about the man who always works alone, and adding a dozen other characters on his side and changing the atmosphere did the film less enjoyable. The second is new characters themselves. Here we have another villain like Frost from the original, who just wants to turn everyone into vampires, in this case of another kind. And though these new vampires can drink blood of other vampires, there still would be a war between them instead of extinction which would have been caused by Frost's plan. It is stupid in its own way. Dozen of Blade's vampire companions are not better than their boss. They are just boring and cliched. Norman Reedus' character is stupid and looks odd in this story. Resurrecting Whistler was another stupid thing to do. It makes a moment of his death in first film pointless, though he is the only character except Blade who is pleasant to see in this film. Guillermo Del Toro's directing is quite good, but the script, story and characters don't let it to be a true virtue. Oh, and this stupid stereotypes about Czech people as if they are Russians (they listen to Russian cliche songs, though real Czechs don't do it).

186,taikman,"Not a smart movie, but a stylish and gorily entertaining one.",7,2 September 2002,"'Blade 2' is an action movie crossed with a horror. It is macho, gruesome and very, very violent.That description will have put many of you off completely, which is fair enough, but if you do have a taste for the action genre then you should see this movie, because it kicks ass.For those of you who have not seen the first film, vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes) is half-human, half-vampire, with their  strengths but not their weaknesses - except for a thirst for blood. He's a bit like Buffy, but a lot nastier. In the first film the vampires took his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristoffersen) and Blade is seeking him. Blade finds the old man but also learns that there is a new breed of vampire loose in the world, almost unkillable mutants called Reapers, who feed on vampires as well as humans. Blade must team up with a elite unit of vampires to try and destroy the Reapers, while watching his own back and developing feelings for one of his enemies.The movie is actually an improvement on the original. We get a closer look at the vampires, particularly one family, and, ironically, they become more human, which makes them more interesting than when they are just sadistic killers. But the real foundation of the film, the thing that all action movies stand or fall on, is the intensity and style of the action. It is here that Blade 2 triumphs. The fights are adrenalin-surging amalgams of power and precision, speed and slow-motion, beauty and brutality. Guns, swords, fangs, kicks, throws, punches, dark glasses, black leather, tatoos (including a Maori design), vampires disintegrating in showers of sparks and gore. Because it is so spectacular, and occurs largely to the undead or faceless guards, the violence does not have the unpleasant, dehumanising feeling that many more realistic action movies do. With its superhuman warriors the film belongs to the tradition of martial-arts fantasies developed in Hong Kong and is exemplified by 'The Matrix' and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. While it does not have the class or intelligence of those modern classics, Blade 2, with its merging of Gothic shadows and cyberpunk technology, is very stylish. I could not say it was smart, and it certainly is gratuitous, but it is, literally, bloody cool.

There were too many special effects, the fighting was to commercial and even the acting wasn't as good. I mean for gods sake he did a wrestling move in one of the fight scenes. The balance and feel of the film was not right. Blade's kind of love interest vampire women didn't really fit in with his character either. He's a hard arse vampire killing machine and not at all sentimental, apart from maybe about his mother.They introduced a hybrid vampire / monster thing which didn't help things either. It very rarely works when they do that, look a aliens vs predator for example. That kind of put the vampires and Blade working together to kill it, but the hybrid has the same sunlight weakness as the vampires and has nowhere to hide but rhe sewer. Just find the sewer in the day and drop a UV grenade in there. Boom film over. It just didn't work. The fight scenes were good in the most part but that wasn't enough to carry this film. Even Whistler returning was kind of rubbish. He died in the first film and I feel they should have left him dead. The whole idea of Whistler returning was to bait Blade which doesn't make sense, because this group of vampires were nothing to do with Frost' group in the first film. Just no.

191,cToTh-2,Just when you thought they could not top the first one...,8,25 April 2002,"...they turn around and provide you with a movie that surpasses all recent vampire movies, with the possible exception of Shadow of the Vampire.This movie was awesome, and this new vampire was quite imaginative, as far as I'm concerned.  The look of those things was disgusting, and if it could disgust me, then it's a keeper.  Even until the very end of the movie, the appearance of those things was...odd, to say the least.  I never really got used to seeing them.So basically, a new vampire race had emerged, one that fed on both vampires and humans, one they termed as Reaper.  Due to their higher metabolisms, they were required to feed almost constantly, and their victims would be soon transformed to form an additional member of this race.This type of vampirism spread more like a plaque than anything.  Not only that, but to make matters worse, these creatures were tough....really tough. Left unchecked, they would definitely replace vampires at the top of the food chain.  Which is why they enlisted the aid of the Daywalker, Blade.To find out what happens next, or even to see just how tough these creatures are, it's best to watch the movie.  It was definitely worth my buck, or rather seven of them.  The special effects were awesome, but sometimes it's a bit tiring to see one man fight many every so often throughout a movie.Given the nonstop action, a bit of humour, a few wrestling moves, imaginative creatures and great special effects, this movie is now one of my all time favourites.",Blade II

I certainly don't. What I do care about is this...this movie delivers on every entertainment level. It's hip. It's nasty. It's fun. It's like a living comic book. and...AND...it's got Wesley  Snipes kicking ass and taking names. I don't know about ya'll but the main reason I wanted to see this picture is because Wesley is in it. It also has Ron Perlman, Donnie Yen, and Kris Kristofferson. What's not to like? Oh, and as I recall, the critics weren't crazy about the first Blade movie. Humph! Just goes to show who really listens to movie critics, huh?",Blade II
194,auberus,Now Blade has a Soul...,7,28 August 2002,"Blade I was what I call a good rental for ""popcorn eater"": good action scenes, descent acting but nothing more. Blade II is what I call a true motion picture, a cinematic experience. How many sequels (in the horror genre) are better than the original movie? Moreover how many good comics adaptation do we know of? ""Few"" is the answer for both questions and Blade II might be among those ""few"". It is a multi-layers movie where the action/horror fanatic will have what they're looking for, a Vampire/Kung Fu flick (and that's fine) however those of us who are asking for more than just another Blade sequel might discover a very thought through movie blend in a myriad of details with extraordinary fight sequences (thanks to Donnie Yen) and a ""design"" feel to it. Obviously the main critic against Blade II is a very ""simplistic"" scenario when you know from the beginning what is going to happen: the story is about Blade (Wesley Snipes) who is half vampire, half human and refuses his vampire nature trying to fight the ""bloodlust"" he suffers. His hatred for the vampire and therefore half of himself is unlimited. In this sequel Blade forms an uneasy alliance with the vampire nation in order to face an even greater enemy: the reapers who feed on vampires as well as on human (who are luckily to us close to Blade's heart). The scenario is simple but not simplistic and Guillermo del Toro ""tour de force"" is to give volume to this scenario by blending it in a very design atmosphere exploring the notion of ""Duality"". Blade's duality is obvious: he is fighting half of himself like a metaphoric evil within each and every one of us. The secret of his redemption does not lie in what he is but in what he does and what he feels. His quest for humanity ends at the same time as his hatred for the vampires but moreover for himself. On the opposite the reapers are bodies/corpses, their reasons for being are purely physical, basics (they live to feed) their appearance pushes the limits of horror (reaching the borders of gore) in order to demonstrate how unhuman they really are, in other words how ""Essence"" (where you come from) in that case human or vampire is not what matters. This gap between the beauty of Blade (Wesley Snipes) or Nyssa Damaskinos (Leonor Varela) and the reapers (Luke Goss etc...) emphasis the gab between ""Soul"" and ""Soulless"". Guillermo del Toro delivers his best movie (after Mimic in 1997). Unlike Mimic which was a well directed but average horror movie Blade II is an exceptional horror movie supported by terrific actors (Kris Kristofferson, Ron Perlam etc...). Witnessing on screen the birth of a Soul is not a usual thing. Guillermo del Toro managed to do it in a paradoxical beautiful manner.",Blade II
195,lawrenceconwayvulcan,A different kind of jaw jaw,8,12 March 2018,"Blade II may be the trashiest (in the best sense of the word) to be directed by a Best Director Oscar winner. Wesley Snipes returns as the vampire hunter who is part vamp himself as facing a new breed of blood suckers who are a greater threat to humanity. Guillermo Del Toro brings his trademark eye for the weird in the form of the Reapers (and their nightmare jaws that open for to suck on victims) who lead by Jared (80's pop idolLuke Goss) Nomak. There are sequances that have a slow burn of suspense unfolding before exploding into dynamic action including one (typical of Del Toro ) set in a sewer system. That is not to say that bad guys are not dispatched in fun ways, one is vaporised by a bomb and another is sliced upwards. Ant there fight scenes that show off Snipes martial arts skills to the max. Blade II may not be high art like The Shape of Water but it is a lot of fun.",Blade II
196,Don_Falone1985,Highly underrated,9,13 November 2021,"Not too sure why this excellent sequel has such a low score on IMDb. It's a fantastically paced, well developed and brilliant CGi action horror movie. It follows on from the original, but this one involves Blade now teaming up with a group of vampires to fight a new hybrid breed of vampire, that are a threat too all of humanity and the vampire race. It has humour just like the first one, but also the character development is excellent due to the 2 hour movie length which is about right for a movie like this. It's very enjoyable and I saw it a number of times years ago, but upon watching again recently, I must say it's definitely ahead of its time. It was made in 2002, and you would think it was only made recently such is the excellent CGI and affects. Highly recommended sequel in which sequels in the movie industry are rarely decent.",Blade II

BII is one of the best movies I have seen this year and it ranks up with the first Blade on how good it is. The direction is great, the acting is great, the blood and gore and special effects are suberb! I do suggest you see the first Blade first if you are considering seeing this one.

198,Krog__,Best Action Film In a While,9,2 August 2004,"Blade II is one of the best action films I have seen in a while. Probably ever since the first Matrix. Of course, let me go on to explain... I didn't see the first Blade before seeing this. What attracted it to me was something rather odd: Danny John-Jules, who plays the Cat on the British sitcom ""Red Dwarf"", has a supporting role in this film. And I was expecting it to be a horrible movie... anyway, back to what I was saying. I need a plot to evolve in order for me to enjoy it. So like, if a movie is about one thing and it stays being about that one thing, I don't enjoy it. Like Lord of the Rings: it starts off they have to destroy the ring and the goal never changes -- I disliked it for that reason. Nothing changed.But the evolving plot is why I liked Blade II. Not only does it deliver stylistic and awesome action, but the plot evolves above the point of Blade-vs.-vampires. That's where it truly succeeds. I gave it 9/10 -- it's, in my opinion, a very good example of a great action film, but I'd never give a pure action film 10/10. That's just me, though. If you like action films... enjoy :)",Blade II
199,HawkHerald,Where's the fun?,1,26 December 2009,"This sequel is awful. It has a lame plot (the Reavers threat), a pathetic villain (Nomak), and a very awkward attempt at a romantic subplot with Blade and vampire princess Nyssa (Leonor Verala). Blade 2 lacks the energy and fun of the original film which may be in part due to the loss of original director Stephen Norrington and one of the more interesting characters from the first film, Dr. Karen Jensen (N'Bushe Wright). The direction of Guillermo del Toro, whose Hellboy films and Pan's Labyrinth were extremely enjoyable, is at best questionable including a questionable decision to transition from a live action fight scene to ridiculous looking CGI. Norman Reedus also stinks up the joint as Scud, who became Blade's mechanic/weapon designer during the time Whistler was a prisoner. It would have been a far more interesting film if the story had followed Blade on his mission to rescue his mentor.",Blade II
200,xristoff93,Okay.......I guess................,5,15 October 2016,"I am a fan of dark fantasy movies like Underworld.So,I took up on Blade as well.The first one was OK as well even though the visual effects were not so good but that is understandable considering when it was made.I was hoping for an improvement at the second film.I didn't really see it.While the plot is very interesting especially in the beginning with the introduction of a new element,after a while the hype is gone.There are many reasons behind that.First of all,there are a lot of unnecessary bad-ass wannabe moments when many characters try to act tough with no reason at all.Second of all,full of silly clichés.The vamp squad's members names were all typical,tough and mighty,trying so hard to create some kind of badassery but fails since they are so weak.Their cloths and weapons,ridiculous gigantic hammers etc....They are just not that great.They had a fierce appearance but had a weak result.And what about those supposedly explosive punch metal things that Blade had?No one exploded...big fuss for nothing.A vampire squad of the very elites and they had no equipment??And almost none of them could fight?They were dropping dead like flies..Another thing that ruined it for me are the plot holes.In the first they appear with special outfits that protect them from light,but later on,when Blade suggests they fight the enemy in daylight,every seems confused,surprised and angry because they are saying they have no way to escape light.WHAT ON EARTH?Even in the previous movie,vamps could stand in daylight with mere sunscreen or wore black leather clothing and helmets.Yet in this one,sun light seems to burn even their clothes.No explanation of Damaskinus appearance.Why was he like that?Why did he look like he was sick?Why his blood was blackish?Also,Whistler acts like he is in his home,not caring much about the movie or what happens.Blade's complete lack of any emotion,may seem cool in the beginning,after a while it gets tiring.Priest was bitten and he started transforming almost immediately and Nisa too.Lighthammer was cool for like a whole day.A plot hole to create an element of surprise or suspense?Big fail....Nomak transformed anyone who bit him.In the end he was shown bitting numerous humans or vamps(whatever the guards were) but I suppose that doesn't help our story telling so we pretend it never happened,right?What about Blade?He seems to be really affected by brute force,bullets and electricity but in the final battle he gets smashed upon walls and pillars and he acts like he's been touched by butterfly wings.His chest is getting cracked and he sits up a second later but then,he gets punched and seems to be suffering.WHAT???Also,he is supposed to have all of a vampire's strengths but none of their weaknesses.So he is as strong and fast as any vampire...Then why any other vampire appears to be so weak when they come in comparison?There are may other plot holes and uncontinuities but I care not to list them all down.I believe all these are more than enough.In the end,we have a nice villain,creepy and strong.A biological mystery and a lot of shooting and fighting in dark places.On the other hand we have plot holes,bad acting,silly clichés and childish battle choreographies.It gets a 5/10 barely...",Blade II
201,nivek_nailgun,as good as the first,7,26 March 2002,"I didn't think this was any better or worse than the first installment (which is a rarity if you ask me) and I really enjoyed it. Without gushing on and on,I've got to address the lengthy criticism posted below simply because the plot holes weren't quite as bad as the one commenter had thought:Alleged problems with the plot:I. The ancient vampire...1- Yes,he managed to live for centuries and build himself up,but he was certainly not guaranteed eternity and hence what he was searching for. The new breed wasn't to replace him so much as to see his 'kind' become invincible and dominate.2- Lost control of the Reaper simply because it was experimentation.3- I'm sure the ancient vampire brought Blade to his home rather than another location simply because he felt safest there.4- Had the ancient vampire had intermediaries talk with Blade and present the entire plan to him,Blade may well not have gone for the whole idea. In other words,it would seem more genuine coming directly from your mortal enemy than one of his lackeys.5- The only thing I can say to objection #5 is that the movie is fantasy,so it should be given some leeway here.6- Again,a film. Had the ancient vampire not shown the enemy (and hence the viewer) the test tube vamps,we would have been left in the dark and the critics would have screamed 'Plot hole!' all the way to the bank.7- Doesn't kill Blade when he can. Well,that isn't so much a criticism against Blade II as it is action movies in general. This will probably be the case with 98% action movies forever.8- I'm not sure where else the ancient vampire should have ran off to. I say again,perhaps he felt safer in his lifelong stronghold.II. The Reaper Virus (aka Zombie Movie hides as Vampire Flick)1-5- No real complaints here,just how the script went and I personally liked the idea. But opinions will always vary.6 - The original Reaper takes his own life at the end of the film after being mortally wounded. He merely thrusts the blade further into his heart after feeling the release from his painful existence begin.III. The lackeys (Other Vampires & Human agents)1 - Perhaps the Vampire Nation only had a pair of prototype suits...it's never stated otherwise.2-3- Typical movie action. This is another sin committed by 98% of action movies and not just Blade II.4 - Willingly follow Blade into the sewers to hunt the Reapers with UV grenades and no way to shield themselves .....BUT it was the best and fastest plan available.III. Lovestory between Blade and the Vampire PrincessBlade killed his mother in the first movie when he realized she was a complete traitor. He didn't fall for Nyssa's attractiveness so much as her genuine personality. Besides,it's a movie and they just added a small twist to it with the small bit of lovestory.IV. The Fight ScenesI liked the fight scenes myself overall but have a bit of a complaint with the computer rendering. Some of it was just too obvious and could have been done better.I'm not trying to flame here or anything,but I certainly think the movie is worth a viewing and if you're really not going to like it,that's fine...but complaints about 'holes' aren't quite as penetrating as some folks might lead you to believe.",Blade II

203,james_norman1981,Friday night fun if not as good as the original.,7,17 February 2006,"There is a school of thought, seen on this very website, that suggests Blade 2 is superior to Blade 1. Quite why this is I don't know as, like many films of its ilk, horror sequels, Blade 2 tries to give us everything we saw in the first movie multiplied by 10! It succeeds in this limited goal, but, in my opinion, fails to make a good, simple, coherent or fun action film.The original Blade was not without its faults and the sequel endeavours to address them. One dimensional characters, failures of plot and a rather weak ending are all details that made the first movie fun but not quite the finished article. Anyone who's seen the final fight in Blade will know exactly what I'm talking about. Unfortunately, in an effort to rev up an already fast paced, hardcore action flick, the director of Blade 2 has gone a bit far...Since the Matrix, wire work has been done to death so it is to Guillermo del Toro's credit that he tries to do something new. Unfortunately, as with the third Star Wars prequel, the blending together of CGI and real time action fails in two ways: the fighters are neither balletic, nor do they appear human. Here, in Blade 2, we have fights that seem more like a computer game than a film, both in how they look and, equally jarringly, in how the stunt-men/animations move.Added to this is an unexpected, new found compassion from Wesley Snipes' Blade. Whereas in the first film he'd draw his sword once his firearms were depleted of ammunition, this time he actually fights multiple adversaries with his pig-sticker firmly sheathed! Now maybe the resolution of his mother's death at the end of the first movie made him feel a little bit better about vampires in general, but he's still supposed to be hunting and destroying them for crying out loud... not touching them up.Similarly, his collection of toys, read weaponry, has suffered a great deal from sequelitis. Whereas before he had cool, retro guns and the occasional unusual tool, now he has silver coated pistols, bizarre ultraviolet grenades, spear guns that fire a bolt of silver at umpteen thousand metres a second and weird, spinning, bladed things which seem to be vampire seeking and capable of turning corners...Now I must admit to liking it when a film takes a moment to explain what weapons the protagonists are using. Lethal Weapon's comparison of hardware is a great explanation of the two cops characters. In Die Hard, when Karl pulls out his rifle, we get the indication that now he really means business... But in Blade 2 there's an almost fetishistic manner to the way various guns are talked about and the character who builds most of these weapons is both incredibly irksome and very poorly explained. Plus it begs the question: why would someone as friendless as Blade hang out with someone as annoying as Scud? It also made me wonder what happened to the female doctor from the first movie. I don't know if I just missed it but I didn't hear a reason for her absence. Nor did I hear an adequate one for the presence of a guy who did not survive Blade 1...Other characters have also appeared in the interim and few of them are any good. The story behind this film is that some sort of super ugly vampire has sprung up (Luke Goss playing to type) and the normal vampires need our friend Blade to sort him out. This he goes about doing with the help of the Blood Pack, a bunch of what we're led to believe are the hardest of the hard in the vampire world.You could've fooled me. Not only are the Blood Pack less than intimidating, they're also incompetent, badly acted and more than a little unintentionally humorous. One also has to wonder why the producers forked out for Donnie Yen, one of Hong Kong's top action stars and a genuinely thrilling martial artist, to be part of the Blood Pack only to have him do absolutely NOTHING IN THE WHOLE FILM! I mean come on! This is the man who's three fights with Jet Li (across two films) are perhaps the greatest martial arts moments EVER! The thought of Yen, Snipes and a decent choreographer had me practically salivating from the off. When it became clear it wasn't coming I was more than a little miffed. I was also more than a little sickened. Blade 2 is not for the faint hearted and, unlike the original, is well worth its 18 rating (in the UK). The mutated, or re-mutated, vampires are not pretty in any way shape or form and they only get worse as the film progresses.So I hated this film from beginning to end, right...? Well, the answer to that is no! Although it has a great many flaws, which I've taken a somewhat unfairly savage delight in highlighting above, Blade 2 does some things well and some even better than the original. There are powerful fights, stronger dialogue, a few genuinely 3-dimensional characters and a twist or turn here and there which, although not exactly unexpected, are handled, in both the build up and the execution, with aplomb. Del Toro deserves credit for fashioning a solid, if occasionally unnecessarily extravagant, Friday night movie that ticks many of the boxes marked 'A Good Time.' Like the first the ending is a bit weak and there are far too many unintentionally humorous moments, but overall Blade 2 is a cracking film that, to my mind, is not bad at all. I still prefer the original but, while I can hardly offer unconditional praise, I would suggest that if you liked the first you'll probably enjoy the second. Just don't show it to anyone who doesn't like seeing the details of a person's internal anatomy...",Blade II

I really liked the original Blade movie (it was a good action/adventure movie with Wesley Snipes acting as a perfect Blade).Blade 2 has a very weak storyline and the entire movie focuses on showing as much gore as it can. Acting is bad (as if the director, the less-than-talentless del Toro told the actors not to interfere with the movie), the soundtrack is barely ok.Also, there so many special effects, after a while it is just tiring to watch this movie.Watch it only in a cold, dark, boring, lonely day when you **really** have nothing better to do.",Blade II
208,slimjack,Delivers fast and gory atmospheric action.,9,29 March 2002,"I don't know what's gotten into vampires lately.  They use to be such a genteel and refined bunch.  Well dressed. Intelligent conversationalists. All in all, a satanic monster you could bring home to Mom.  Nowadays, vampires dress like bikers, swear like dock workers and take a chunk out of your neck without so much as a by-your-leave. Dracula would be rolling in his grave if it weren't for the stake.  As the vampires get rougher, so do the vampire hunters. The ascetic, professorial Van Helsing type wouldn't last a second in today's undead environment.  We need a shotgun welding, sword fighting, tattooed warrior of the night. Enter Mr. Blade. After the fine Blade I, he returns in the superior  if unimaginably titled  sequel, Blade II. It's crammed with style, action, flamboyant acting and twocount em, two kinds of vampires!  Let me tell you, you get your moneys worth with this movie. There is a new kind of vampire in Budapest called The Reapers. They are so unmitigatedly evil that even Anne Rice would be repulsed.  Normal means of vampiric elimination won't work with them.  They laugh at garlic, gargle holy water and use wooden stakes for toothpicks. Their Achilles heal is that blood is more than sustenance for them; it is a crack-like drug that they must constantly imbibe or die. To defeat this menace, the old guard vampires reluctantly join forces with their scourge Blade. Of course, bloody mayhem ensues.  In fact, there are times when Blade II resembles a baroque anatomy class. Gore this extreme is usually a mistake as it has a tendency to anesthetize the audience.  The director, however, knows what he's doing. Guillermo del Toro shoots the bloody business with all the attention to mood and atmosphere that a Val Lewton or a James Whale would bring to a classic Universal horror movie. Blade II is never too campy or so strait as to be depressing.  The action is fast, furious and genuinely exciting.  There were a few problems here and there, though. Blade and company have obvious computer doppelgangers for some of the more unlikely stunts. Also the fights were interspersed with professional wrestling moves that struck me as clownish. The rest of the audience, however, cheered every flying knee drop that cropped up. The cast is pretty high rent for a movie like this. You'll have as much fun watching the actors do their thing as you will with the action and special effects. Wesley Snipes does Blade perfectly. He plays the part dryer than a martini, yet with just enough swagger that we know he isn't going for a serious character study.  Kris Kristofferson's Whistler is the best cantankerous old coot since Star Trek's Doctor McCoy. Ron Perlman is excellent as Reinhardt, a really hard-case vampire none to pleased to be working with Blade. Luke Goss is completely repulsive as Nomak, the lead Reaper. Great work all around. Blade II is not a movie for the faint of heart. The violence is bloody, extreme and graphic and all that gore is there simply for your morbid pleasure. No social relevance. No comments on the human condition. Blade II is an old-fashioned exploitation flick dressed up with all the wiz-bang bells and whistles of modern movie making. It's grand fun while you are watching but you may hate yourself for enjoying it.",Blade II
209,lanycera,"A bit less stylish than Blade I, nevertheless a great movie",8,6 November 2020,"Blade I was epic. I loved the cinematography (I mean the opening blood rave scene is just cult at this point), the soundtrack and Wesley Snipes as Blade.I'm not sure how the Blade series ended up on such a low rating, because it's better than most modern 'superhero' flicks and miles better than Underworld.
It's an excellent dark comic translation, packed with great fighting scenes and style.
Blade I was not bloated with special effects; it's dark, minimal and gritty.Blade II laid on a bit more special effects, less minimalism like the first one - nevertheless, a great action movie and the soundtrack was top notch.
While some parts were predictable, some twists in the story did surprise me and bumped my rating up a fair bit.The movie was directed by Guillermo del Toro and generally stayed true to the vibe of Blade I. I would rate II overall a bit less, but not by too much.Honestly, it's going to be hard to make a remake worthy of Wesley Snipes and his Blade legacy.

The Vampire Nation offer Blade a truce and ask him to lead their Blood Pack (a group originally in training to hunt him) in a search and destroy mission.This film is dark, comedic, stylized action (based on the comic book of the same name), and has some nice character moments, especially as the line between enemy and friend becomes blurred between Blade and Nyssa (Leonor Varela), the leader of the Blood Pack and daughter of the Vampire overlord and Blade and his newly rescued/vampire detoxed mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Wesley Snipes, as Blade, has cool down to a science. Watching his fight scenes is like watching music in motion. Luke Goss, who plays the threat and new strain of vampirism, a Reaper, although looked and dressed like hell, carried himself with aristocratic elegance. Ron Perlman ""sucks"" in the best possible way as the vampire Reinhardt. He's a nice mix of blood stopping toughness, undead cool and black humor (a vampire who chews gum?

If the scripters tried to be original, they didn't succeed... how many times has ""a virus"" been involved in disaster movies and such? The ""Evolution"" vampires are so dumb when fought its plain silly. Worst of all, it doesn't appears as the actors are given any chance of doing a good job, since the script kinda ruins it... Wesley Snipes does it well but not even him gets a chance to do some decent acting. No, scrap the 3rd movie- Blade 2 is just a spin-off to show more brutal action to maniac kids. 4/10",Blade II
212,theroscoevine,"It's ok, I guess, if you like dumb action....",3,4 October 2018,"No style to this one. The first movie had real visual flair, creative camera work, lots of cool, stylized shots. This movie had none of that. It's full of crappy CGI, really noticeable in several scenes, including the introductory fight between Blade and Nyssa, in front of the hot lights, which I think must have been used as an attempt to mask the cgi, but failed, as Nyssa's acrobatics are clearly artificial and cartoony, and the movie really overplayed the vampires death bit, where they burn up, right from the first scene of this movie. That concept, introduced in the first movie, was used fairly artfully, until Blade II. 
The inclusion of the thought-dead Whistler, reprised by Kris Kristofferson, was ponderous at best. I guess they just thought this movie need ""grizzled, old, angry man"", and it was worth subverting the most emotional sequence of the first movie get it. 
I will admit that I didn't hate this movie as much as when I saw it in the theater, (I write this on 10/3/18, right after watching it for only the second time), but it's still not good. 
It's hard to say what makes a movie bad, but they really nailed it with this one. It's a bad sequel and it's unfortunate for many reasons, including the fact that it was directed by Del Toro, who I admire. This is not some of his better work, though I have enjoyed several of his movies. It's also irksome to me that Snipes considers this his favorite Blade movie. WTF? Snipes likes THIS over the first one??? WHY???
It's on Netflix, so no extra cost.....",Blade II
213,Stofft,Great Kick-ass Movie,7,28 December 2002,"So Wesley is back in this really cool sequel. In this movie the action is packed and there is alot of awsome moves to see.As for the story its pretty much going on as the first one, only this time there is an new vampire that is the enemy.For all that wants great action and alot of it, you must see this movie.",Blade II
214,nvjs,The best of the trilogy,7,22 July 2012,"Let me start by saying this is by far the best in the franchise. Goyer makes a better writer and producer than a director calling the shots. Pun intended. What lacked in the first one, was a worthy foe to match Blade's force of nature and efficient dispatcher. Dorff just seemed like a trashy-chic vampire who spouts cliché'd one-liners in between over-acted fits of spontaneous, narcissistic rage.This one has Nomak who isn't a villain for story sake. He's a tormented, estranged hybrid of a crack-head and vampire. He's an experiment of his father, Damaskinos's.A baddie by circumstance.While the story is good enough here, I feel that a lot of little things add up to detract from the Blade series. First is the set design. Clearly this is where del Toro either skimped, or overlooked. The sets look so bland while the characters obviously were where the money was spent. Next, the Reapers look a little ""barebones"" and ""neatly un-imaginative"". del Toro spent too much into their anatomy and not enough anywhere else.Third is the color palette. del Toro is such a renowned film maker and for good reason. His films look so rich and evoke emotion. The ""blue days and amber nights"" just don't pull it off. Look at ""Hellboy"" 1 & 2! Nobody and I mean nobody, does the amber filter like del Toro. It's so over used and now it's old hat. Nobody uses the color palette/filter as a tool for storytelling. Instead they ""utilize"" it strictly for aesthetics.As I've said, ""Blade II"" is still entertaining, just that all of these flaws detract from the perfection it could have easily attained.",Blade II
215,yaaah_69,"MASTER OF THE NIGHT AND SUN WALKER, DELIVER-UP THE VAMPIRES",8,2 April 2002,"What has made 'BLADE 2"" outstanding is the fact that Guillermo del Toro (Cronos, Espinosa del Diablo,(The Devils Backbone) He is amazing, and can lead you into his stories without you even knowing.I liked Blade, but I like this Blade 2 so much better. The characters are more put together and animated. Ron Pearlman,(Cronos, Quest For Fire, City of Lost Children) puts out a great performance, three dimensional. Wesley Snipes,( Blade. Murder At 1600, To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar). does a  monumental job of being the Sun Walker and his performance is double time, with respect to Blade.The fight scenes  and the mutant vampires are at no time boring and they keep you on the edge of your seat. The only thing I saw that might be copied from another movie was the hinged jaw of the mutants, and I saw that in a movie called Predator, and It was not a carbon copy, but enough to remind. Christopherson was not too bad, at least he had more scenes than he did in Blade. Another actor I liked was Leanor Verala, (The Taylor of Panama), she brought depth to her character as the daughter of the King of Vampires.
I hear there might be a BLADE 3 , I look forward to seeing a third in the Blade franchise. ciao yaaah69",Blade II
216,firstruleofmethclub,"The best in the trilogy, showcases Del Toro's many talents",8,17 April 2015,"The second piece of this vampire hunter trilogy blurs the lines between Action, Super Hero and Horror, which personally I'm kinda liking.This time around, Blade (Wesley Snipes; New Jack City, Chaos), Abraham Whistler (Planet of the Ape, Provinces of Night) and new arrival Scud (Norman Reedus; The Boondock Saints, Pandorum) must team up with the Blood Pack, made up of Dieter Reinhardt (Ron Perlman; Hellboy, Outlander), Nyssa Damaskinos (Hell Ride, Wrong Turn at Tahoe), Chupa (Matt Schulze; The Transporter, The Fast and the Furious), Asad (Danny-John Jules; Red Dwarf, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels), Snowman (Donnie Yen; IP Man, Highlander: Endgame), Verlaine (Marit Kile; Doctors, Blue Murder), Priest (Tony Curran; The Midnight Meat Train, Underworld: Evolution), and Lighthammer (Daz Crawford; Hammer of the Gods, Game Over) in order to defeat UberVamp Jared Nomak (personal favourite Luke Goss; Death Race 2, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Tekken) and his army of Reaper Strain Vampires.With me so far? No? Then go watch the damn movie! It's very bloody good. The opening is almost as strong as the original, and pretty much everything else about it is better. Not to mention the fact that I'm a total Luke Goss fanboy. All of the characters are so much better. They interact and everything. And even though Wesley Snipes has never really impressed me as an actor, the character of Blade was a little less cheesy, which always helps, and basically just better all 'round.SPOILERS FOR BLADE, BLADE II and TRINITY: An interesting point, without ruining anything about the trilogy is that in all three films, vampires fight vampires. Not in the whole ""Blade's half a vampire so he kills full-on vampires"" way, although there is most certainly that, but in Blade, Frost kills the Elder vampires to become La Magra. In Blade II, The Blood Pack and Blade team up to take down a new, much more dangerous breed of vampires. And in Trinity, Dracula goes around killing vampires, pretty much for fun. Just food for thought. I've never read the comics much myself, so I don't really know if that's something that's been going on for a while, or if it just turned out that way.There were a couple of lame bits. Some very stupid lines like ""they took all of our weapons. Even your sword."" Even your sword! Man, the single weapon for which you were named after that has killed more vampires than any other thing on the planet, and the vampires took it away from you? The audacity! And there's this whole thing where Whistler is alive again, they went most of the way to explaining it, and then sort of forgot. It would have been so simple to have a four second flashback cover the lot of it. Oh well.Still though, I'm very, very fond of this one.77%-Gimly",Blade II
217,deltadave669,As entertaining as the original.,7,28 March 2002,"If you liked the first Blade, I Imagine you would like the second as well. Like the original, this movie is a great action ride and is at it's best when kicking vampire (or reaper) ass. It looks like they've kicked up the CGI effects a bit (this is probably one of the few movies that actually benefits from the Matrix ""Bullet Time"" effect). The plot isn't the most intricate and some people here REALLY need a few acting lessons, but all in all it was definitely worht my money, and I will definitely line up for Blade 3!",Blade II

I don't think the director could have casted an actor more suited for the role!Blade II involves Blade fighting against the vampires again, however, he soon realises that the old adage ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is true when a new monster stalks the streets, known as Reapers. These creatures feed on vampires, and then humans, so Blade is forced to align with the vampires in order to fight against the Reapers.From the start of the film, the adrenaline is pumping with Blade fighting multiple vampires, and coming to the rescue of an old friend whom is still alive!Once again, the movie is excellently filmed with the different angles to capture the fight scenes and the music is amazing. Every fight scene is once again filmed perfectly, and this film contains one of my favourite ever action-movie fight scenes when Blade and the vampire council fight against the Reapers in a underground nightclub called 'The House of Pain', the name itself is epic!Amazing. Only criticism I had of this film is that it ended.",Blade II
219,CC_The_Martian,Just what this franchise needed,10,4 April 2016,"Guillermo Del Toro. I am a HUGE fan of this guy, he is a creative force and one of the most versatile creative directors working today. After the success of the first Blade film a sequel of course got under way and the studio hired Del Toro to helm it, this was an odd choice at the time since Del Toro wasn't a household name but in retrospect it was a genius move because it took an awesome movie hampered by a cliché mythos and gave it over to a director who thrives on mythos. Before I can talk about the rest of the movie I have to talk about my favourite aspect of it. The Reapers. Good god I love these things; I love how they're look is inspired by Nosferatu, I love how their lower jaw splits open to became a bug like mouth, I love how they feed on both Vampires and humans, I love how they run sideways and on all fours like old Hollywood gorillas, I love the only Vampire weakness they retain is their weakness to sun, and most of all I love the scene where actually dissect one and we are allowed to see what makes them tick. Del Toro goes out of his way to make these things as alien as possible, not just in the way they look but in the way they behave, as one of the Vampires remarks ""they're as different from us as we are from humans"", in typical Del Toro style there's something beautiful about them and yet profoundly disturbing at the same time. Everything that was good about the first film is here and better, the action is better, the story is better with higher stakes and all kinds of fun twists and turns, the acting is phenomenal; Wesley Snipes has allowed the Blade character to loosen up a bit and the other actors are all fun especially Ron Perlman, I also love the Elder Vampire Eli Damaskinos who is a classic monster inspired again by Nosferatu, a welcome change from the cliché 'vampire council' from the first film. This movie is great across the board, a great film for superhero film fans, action movie fans, sci-fi movie fans, fantasy movie fans, horror movie fans, Del Toro fans and fans of good cinema in general.",Blade II
220,Dukes_Sheep,Just another Sequel,3,5 October 2002,"I liked Blade.  Blade was another look at the concept of vampirism. 
Blade 2 however was another movie.My wife and I sat around and tried to figure out just why Blade 2 didn't work.  The special effects were good as was the general plot line and script.  We finally decided that was the movie lacked was a good villain.  Blade had Deacon Frost. An execellent adversary with plenty of screen time.  Blade 2 had an adversary who was most noticable for being absent most of the movie.  Additionally the concept of a new species of vampire who's head splits open just didn't work.  If they had left that part out (and saved about a bazillion special effects dollars doing so) we both agreed it would have been a better movie.5 out 10",Blade II

It had a few surprises, the action scenes looked good, the effects were better than expected and the characters were mostly effective.  The plot was a little weak and the story a little uneven, but it kept moving well and everything kind of worked in the end.  Well worth watching.",Blade II
222,Oreolove,Good thing this is a vampire movie... cuz it sucked!,3,15 September 2002,"Ha ha ha! Little pun there. But that's the kind of corniness you get in this movie. Terrible plot and acting! It totally ruined the first Blade for me, which I thought was wonderful, esp. with Steven Dorff as the bad guy you love to hate. But all that was flushed when Snipes actually agreed to do this movie. I can't believe he didn't burn the script the minute he read it.*Spoilers*The absolute worst part was the fact that they brought Whistler back. I liked the fact that he was sort of a martyr in the first movie. Why couldn't they just let that be?
The plot was so utterly confusing and unbelievable... and I'm talking in the vampire world. These things just can't happen. It ruins the entire legend behind the vampire. You can't just change it because you think it will add to your sorry plot! The plot takes so many twists and turns that you have no idea who's good or evil or who's good but pretending to be evil or visa versa. The story begins when Blade must make a choice between taking sides with the enemy to destroy a new breed of killer that's feeding on vampires or just let them wipe out what's left of the vampire race. Well duh! Blade wants vampires dead, right? Why not let the monsters finish them off and then wipe them out? Seems easy enough in the daylight.
*More Spoilers* The absolute worst scene appears when Blade gets into a pretty interesting fight with ninja-like vamps that are trying to stab him to death in his own hideout. But then they take off their ninja masks and... oops... we didn't want to kill you. We're just delivering a message. Well, then why didn't you say that to begin with!!! I'm sorry but stupid writing like this deserves to be criticized! 
Now onto bashing the acting. Where did they dig up the girl vamp? Is she the director's cousin or something, because there was little acting going on when she was on the set. I would like to applaud Kris Kristofferson for giving a decent performance given the circumstances. I'd also like to give Norman Reedus a pat on the back. I'm an avid fan of his and I have yet to see him do badly in a film, although I was a little upset with his final scene in the movie. Wesley Snipes had little acting to do. He was supposed to be emotionless anyway. But dear god, couldn't he have refused to do it until a better version of the sequel was written!? I liked the fight scenes, but the plot is more important. And it was sucked dry. Save this one for a day when you feel like watching a bomb. This one didn't even take 5 minutes for me to dislike. A **/10",Blade II
223,nixar55,Bloody fun!,8,21 June 2003,"I wasn't a big fan of the first Blade, so when I caught Blade II on cable, I was really surprised by how enjoyable it was. It was sharp and gross and very, very violent. The Reapers were fantastic, especially the first time one appears - a nice, nasty shock. Anne Rice this ain't, thank God. I really enjoyed the humor, especially between Snipes and the magnificent Ron Perlman (now I REALLY can't wait to see this awesome actor as Hellboy). The Bloodpack was a good bunch of side characters, and the martial arts were a lot of fun. Not the most original story on the planet, but del Toro does an awful lot with what he's been given. This is definitely one of those rare times a sequel renders its predecessor pointless. And not just because Whistler was brought back from the dead. (Yeah, that part was kinda clunky, but having him in the movie was a good idea, because his character is an important one to Blade's story.) In fact, this should've been the only Blade movie ever made; it's dark, entertaining, and an excellent addition to the vampire movie genre. 8 out of 10 stars",Blade II

Movie sequels always flop in my opinion, not counting those classics like Terminator 2 etc.I was very surprised after seeing this, I thought ""oh great, another excuse to make the big bucks"" on a good solid movie, but no, this is a great movie. I loved the first Blade, it had vampires, they could go out into sunlight wearing sunblock, and there was a vampire council who were all born vampires who were in charge of everything, government, police etc. Blade 2 introduced the Reapers, being who feed on vampires and humans, when vampires are bitten they turn into Reapers, who are immune against garlic, and silver. Only Sunlight can kill them.The Vampire Council enlists Blades help to track down Nomak - a Reaper vampire who is rapidly spreading Reapers across the city, and he must lead ""The Blood Pack"", a group of well trained vampire soldiers funded by the council to track them down. The guy who plays Nomak had his acting done perfectly, Wesley Snipes is good, and Kris Kristofferson reprises his role as Whistler.An Excellent sequel, that offers kick ass martial fight scenes, and CG that is done perfectly and very realistic, you can barely notice it compared to silly movies today like Star Trek and Terminator Salvation, watch this, The story is original and just awesome, I would Recommend!",Blade II

Wesley Snipes returns to the big screen as Blade, half-human and half-vampire.  Known as the Daywalker, Blade has made a pact with the people he has vowed to kill in order to destroy an even more powerful group of vampires. 	The special effects are great.  Snipes' character has become apparent. Instead of him just walking around like the living dead, his character has become more developed.  Kris Kristofferson returns as Whistler, who died in the first, but they brought him back for the sequel.  Besides Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson, the only other recognizable name in the film is Ron Pearlman.  I thought Blade 2 had more life to the movie and I thought Blade was funnier than he was in the original.  The movie took more of a comic book approach to it.

Blade 2 delivers, but on my way out of the cinema I could not rid my mind of emptiness. Maybe it's just the type of mood I was in. Don't get me wrong, I am a big action fan. But, lets stop for a moment and see where it's going. Much like Resident Evil (which is also out at the time of this review) The action and effects deliver, but it just feels empty. Perhaps I could have missed this void if I had watched Blade 1 a few days, maybe even hours before the viewing of the second film. So everything and the characters would be fresh in my mind. Guess I won't know now. I do know one thing however... Blade 2 still kicked some serious butt. Those looking for a good time will not be let down.

230,vladthelad8666,Best of the trilogy.,8,16 April 2020,"Blade II is not your typical vampire movie sequel. Not only does it do things better than the original, but it makes vampires look even cooler than they already did. Guillermo del Toro didn't hold back on any of the action, Donnie Yen's signature fight scenes style is really prevalent in this movie, as he himself plays a role, which can only be described as underused. The cinematography is decent, there are some really cool shots of the Bloodpack while they are heading into the vampire nightclub. The plot is really unique and breathes fresh air into the vampire genre, accompanied by the never ending tension, this sequel really succeeds in making a different movie, even when the story isn't complicated at all. You have vampires versus a new breed of vampires, created from a virus, which makes them even more strong and bloodthirsty, and really really grotesque. The make up and effects team deserve very high praise on their work here, the reapers are truly terrifying.Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, of course, and the new additions to the universe are quite exciting. Young Norman Reedus plays the whacky sidekick to Blade, and Kris Kristofferson returns as Whistler. Del Toro also brings in the Bloodpack. They are highly trained vampires, whose only job was to hunt down Blade, until things went downhill with the arrival of the reapers. They are a cool new addition, as Ron Pearlman, Matt Schulze and Tony all give plenty of personality to the group. Donnie Yen is also a part of the Bloodpack, but as mentioned before, he is severely underused in the movie. None of them really have any backstory or move the plot in any way, apart from a few very cool scenes. The villain of the movie is Nomak, who is the patient zero and carries the reaper virus. He is decent and the opening scenes with him are entertaining, but he doesn't do much from there. The dialogue is simple, but the movie let's its dark visuals do the talking.There are couple of bad plot points, which involve Nomak's father - Eli Damaskinos. He is the weakest character in the film, even though he has more lines and screen time than more of the members of the Bloodpack. The only positive is that it doesn't take away from the overall quality of Blade II.If you are a fan of action packed early 2000's vampire flicks, which include a well known Marvel hero, this is the perfect movie for you. Blade II perfectly captures the gritty and hostile vibe of the cities and makes vampires cool again for a bit.",Blade II
231,*(CableGuy)*,"Ron Perlman is god! Better than the first, terrific direction.",9,23 March 2002,"If nothing else, it is easy to say Blade II surpasses its predecessor in every way.  Guillermo del Toro is a director of unique vision, one who obviously put pride into this work, instead of treating it like a paycheck job.  Sure, there's bad CG here and there, and Donnie Yen was a waste (though he did choreograph the fights too), but what you have here is a solid chunk of entertainment, with well-planned (and more importantly, WELL-EDITED!) fights abounding, no great lulls in the action, and a satisfying ending.  It's amazing they were able to write Whistler back in without it being too ridiculous, and then not wasting his return!  Ron Perlman walks all over his scenes, I really hope del Toro can convince the studio to let him be Hellboy instead of Vin Diesel.

232,strangelexicon,Something to pass time with,6,4 August 2006,"Blade-2 is no where nearly as good as the original Blade movie and it seems to be a lesser effort in the first place. The storyline in this case is nothing unusual but the introduction of a bunch of new characters makes it pretty weird. As usual, there is non stop action and very fast, fluidic vampire ass kicking with little subtlety and plot. Abraham Whistler is also reintroduced, seems he survived being turned before shot and all, but in this movie, he is much more of a loser than in the previous. Snipes himself does'nt seem to respect him as much. There are a few original ideas (concerning action of course) and a few good moments but this movie isn't great.

With the New Breed growing in vast numbers, Blade and the Night posse prepare to dice 'em.This Dark Movie over shadows it's predecessor, the stunning special effects are meticulous to detail that is a feast for your eyes, Stephen Dorff is sorely missed as the original villain Frost, but Luke Gloss has a good chance of a movie career.

235,Kurt-15,By the numbers sequel with few surprises and big plotholes,3,23 March 2002,"Where ""Blade"" successfully pulled the viewer into a very sensual vampire underworld, and maintained that suspension when the film took a super-supernatural turn, ""Blade II"" alienates & insults the viewer with too many Hollywood cliches.  The film's ""surprise"" is too much like the original, combined with the hokey antics of the ""Towelly"" episode of South Park.Tim Burton turned a few city blocks into Gotham City for ""Batman"", Del Toro struggles with constructing an ethos for the film with the entire city of Prague at his disposal.  Del Toro attempted to ""scare"" the audience, but the attempts are laughable, at best.  The elements, apparently designed to scare, are cliche Hollywood slasher.Worse yet, is the hokey ""team"" that partners with Blade.  For the purposes of this review, let's call them ""Fox Force Five"".  The team members looked more like potential action figures than believable flesh & blood characters. For that matter, all the characters in this film remain static.  The first film introduced the viewer to the seedy underworld of vampires, this film is like a documentary of it.  All the scenes of vampire culture are shot from a distinct, third person pov.  This further disconnects the viewer.
The ""love story"" angle is poorly underdeveloped here, especially viewed in comparison with the first film's Oedipal overtures.  Blade's love interest is underdeveloped, and while the actress is stunning, the character falls flat.The highlight of the film, of course, is the creation of the ""Vampire Nation"".  In the first film, vampires existed, and helped operate things from behind the scenes.  In this film, the over the top protrayal of them is just too much - vampires have corporate offices now.Of course, action is the name of the game - but with all the nonsense heeped onto this weak story, there's not much room for it.  The first film's groundbreaking martial arts - backed up by excellent physical acting by Snipes, are sadly mediocre in this film.  The set design for these fights are standard fare - the catwalk, the church, the underground tunnel, etc.

Almost immediately, my heart sank.  The look was all wrong.  Dim and grainy film stock, rock video editing, comic book special effects and more.  And then came Wesley Snipe's first fight with the Blood Pack duo.  As good a martial arts fight sequence as I have ever seen.  Well, almost saw....whoever did the lighting and production design for Blade II obviously wanted to put us in the dark world of vampires.  Only problem is I like details, and only 90% of the fight scene was visible.  Nevertheless, I gradually got over the murky color and breakneck editing and found that, as the Reapers appeared, this movie just kept getting better and better.

Unfortunately, it let me down everywhere.Wesley Snipes is cool as usual and so is Kris Kristofferson, but what the hell happened to everything else? There was no story, no emotion, and ACTION FOR NO REASON. As an aspiring filmmaker, this is one thing i truly hate in movies. Yes, the fight sequences are very well done and the CG quality reaches a nice climax at the end of the movie when there is a death animation.However, Blade 2 is NOWHERE near as good as the original. No story, and loose tie-ins from the original help to ruin this sequel. There are a number of matrix, alien, and jet li inspired shots and in the end, the movie unravels itself. Score: 3/10 (I only wish it could've been better)",Blade II

Good fight scenes, fantastic effects and weapons. Typical blade really.Yeah, the reapers kick vampires arse's and blade comes along and beats everybody up. From start to finish Blade is the super dude. This was just as brilliant as the first one. OK it was similar in ways but why change it if it isn't broken. I loved this film. I will watch it again and I will tell everybody I know to see it too.Its not a perfect score as there are better films, but for me this tops its particular genre. A very worthy 8/10...",Blade II
242,sincitybrant,Great action movie,8,11 September 2002,"Tired, I fell asleep within the first thirty minutes of the originalBlade and never finished it. Now I'll have to go back and see it,because I enjoyed Blade II so much. How much? Tired again, Iwatched it a second time in a row to listen to Guillermo Del Toro'sawesome commentary. This was my first exposure to this newdirector, but now I'm renting all of his other movies. I highlyreccomend this movie to all of my customers as a good actionmovie. Similar to Aliens or Alien Resurrection, it has this cowboy/ hunter/commando squad feel to it. It has just the right amounts ofsuspense, shock horror, and action to it and, in general, thespecial effects do their part well. I particularly reccomend watchingthe DVD for its special features.",Blade II

Now sit back and immerse yourself in this non-stop action movie.The pace at the beginning is Guyver, with a little Fist of the North Star and Tenchi thrown in.  I think it was inspired from Anime.I missed the Tai Chi sword forms in Blade, but we've got some Wing Chun instead.  It's all good.There's no time for romance, or humor, just friendship, moral courage and action.  The lighting, background music, visual and audio effects are all excellent.I've seen this movie on DVD but the effects are diminished.  You really need to see this movie on the big screen preferably with DTS sound.",Blade II
244,kaspen12,"A bloody good action flick, and the best in the series.",8,20 May 2006,"Starring: Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Ron PerlmanLast time we saw Blade, Wesley Snipes's half-breed vampire slayer, his hunting operation had been heavily compromised. His warehouse headquarters had been rushed, his mentor Whistler (Kristofferson) had shot himself to prevent imminent bitings -- no matter, he prevailed, he got his man. In these movies, they always do.Flash-forward a few years later and Whistler is not dead. The vamps have turned him and kept him alive, so they can torture him for all eternity. Blade tracks him down, busts some heads, turns him back and we're back to square one. Of course, the film is not content with closing the curtain at the half-hour mark, so now the story can really begin: The warehouse complex finds itself blitzed again, this time by a pair of super-stealth special-ops vampires dressed in jet-black spy-gear -- one of them a skilled swordsman, the other our leading lady. Blade intercepts and they kung-fu fight. Turns out the battle, flashy and entertaining as it was, was all for naught -- the vampires, members of an elite vamp-squad called the Bloodpack, have come to make a peace offering on behalf of the Vampire Nation. You see, there's a new threat stalking them -- bigger and badder than Blade: Reapers, vicious vampire hybrids whose scarred faces mask their horrific weapons. The vamps don't just want a truce with Blade, however -- they want him to fight the Reapers with them. He faces a dilemma: do nothing and let the Reapers move on to humans once they're finished with vampires, or help the vampires, only to have them try to kill him when the job's finished. If you can't tell which way he finally leans, you've never seen an action movie.I liked the first Blade film if slightly. It was a fun movie with some very cool moments, but didn't live up to the hype. The third, 'Trinity' is a mind-numbing disaster. Oh the difference a good director can make! Guillermo del Toro (Cronos, Hellboy) has the reigns here and clearly had a good time with the movie: it briskly bounces from one energetic action sequence to the next, with a fair number of frightful sights thrown in to liven things up. This is a good thing -- with a wafer-thin plot that takes enough turns to keep your attention, Del Toro knows exactly what kind of movie he's making: a pure action flick. And he delivers the goods. The movie is dripping with cool, and while it may not be a classic, it's a fun flick to throw on and let it suck you in.FINAL SCORE: 8.3/10If you've never seen a Blade movie before, no worries. There's not a lot to catch up on, and you can jump straight to the ""good chapter"" and not miss a beat. If the movie suffers anywhere at all (other than the plot department), it's that the battle sequences occasionally suffer Spider-man Syndrome, wherein the impossible is made possible by some glaringly obvious CGI. Other than that, if action movies are your thing, Blade II is a bloody good show.",Blade II
245,stinger01,awarsome kick ass film,10,24 August 2008,this is just such a kick ass film made by the guy who brought us hellboy so just having his name on there would make anyone want to go and see of course then they'd stay for all the action scenes which are done well in this film wesley does a great job as a much more darker blade then in the first one and all the plot twists are just so great and unpredictable just the overall look of the film is just so much more different and this shows in one of the opening scenes where blade jumps out of a window and the camera follows him down. There is some good humor in there just lighten up the film like were blade is chasing some vampires and stops right before he hits his car and kisses it over all an excellent film made by the Spielberg of fantasy films,Blade II
246,HighlanderArg,Mmmm... I think The Law Of The Sequels apply here...,5,6 April 2005,"There's an unwritten Law Of The Sequels that goes (more or less) like this : ""Seldom shall a sequel be as good, let alone better, as the first film."" This has its exceptions (""Batman"", ""Superman), and tons of examples, such as ""Highlander"", ""Mortal Kombat""... and ""Blade"".The movie takes up two years after the first film. It turns out that Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) did not die when he shot himself, and Blade goes out to the rescue, in order to bring him back to humanity. However, the good old man is only a bait for some vampires to propose a truce to Blade. Why? they need him to bring down an evolved way of vampires that feeds on both humans and vampires.I never actually read a single comic book of ""Blade"". Perhaps the movie goes strictly as the comic and I'm b******tting it, but not doing it consciously, I will continue. I like watching vampire movies, and the concept of an evolved vampire is interesting, but when the creature looks like the son of Nosferatu (the original 1929 film) and Predator, I'm disappointed. Even more when I see Blade uttering things like ""Oooh, how exciting"", or having a romantic interest.The movie also features lots of martial arts, some done by Wesley Snipes, other by CGI, and other by a stunt surely. A good thing is the cameo Donnie Yen plays. Unfortunately, it's too short and he only kicks butts once. The rest of the cast has Ron Perlman (""Hellboy""), the above mentioned Kristofferson and Yen , and large load of people I don't know.In short, it has martial arts, action, but the story (and some performances) is weak. To put it otherwise, reminds me of ""Van Helsing"". You watch it to have fun, vampire fan or not.5/10",Blade II

From the first scene, with its blindingly fast pace and pulse-pounding music, I welcomed ANY excuse for Snipes to kick ass.  And he doesn't disappoint: this movie has more and better fight scenes than the original film!  There is one swordfight scene that is so fast and so impressive, I have seen nothing like it before, not in Blade I, not in Crouching Tiger, not in any of the Star Wars movies.  It will take your breath away.This is the kind of movie The One should have been.  I salute Wesley Snipes--he has outdone himself with this one, and that's saying a lot.",Blade II

Of course, the plot is very weak, but I was expecting that, plus the action is so unrelenting, you don't really have time to think about it.  I saw this movie in a cinema with newly installed Dolby Digital sound, and it put it to good use, the bone-snapping, skull-crunching, gut-ripping and decapitations all had a sickeningly loud noise which completely immerse you into the action on screen.  Just when I thought that comic book adaptations were all doomed to be terrible, this one (although I don't know how faithful it is to the original comic) breaks the mould to be a thoroughly enjoyable piece of absolute nonsense.",Blade II

250,Fifth_of_November,"Equals the first Blade, if not better",7,26 August 2015,"It seems that everything Del Toro touches turns into gold, and the sequel to the surprising and excellent Blade made no exception.The actual filming quality has improved when compared to the first movie, and so have special effects and visuals. Visual style is just a bit more comic-ish than the original movie, and both worked in their own way. The plot is again a great fit for a Blade movie and delivers enough decent twists and turns to make the movie more than just hack and slash.Fightins scenes and choreographies are once again a success. Speed is fast enough to make you realize that the protagonists are supernatural, but not too fast to make you lose sense of what is going on. Wesley Snipes proves that he is perfect for the role and you can sense that he enjoys it.The main villain, Nomak, does not manage to raise to the level of entertainment provided by Deacon Frost but still poses a real threat and generates thrill whenever he is on screen. And the final fight counts as one of the best fight scenes ever filmed that I can remember of.On the negative side, I disliked the scene where the blood pack enters Blade's base. As Blade did not know who they where, it made no sense that he did not dispatch them, unless they could match his fighting skills, which would make no sense either. Long, useless and dumb fight.Also, as this is a Del Toro movie, you can expect a bit more horror than in a standard comic movie. And being no big fan of horror movies, I can say that the horror touches added here and there are very well measured and I thought that they fitted perfectly in. The few jokes here and there were also a nice addition as there were not too many and those present were good. Great directing job.",Blade II

253,sixpack-3,Very Entertaining Action,8,26 March 2002,"I saw Blade II last night and really enjoyed the film.  I was in the mood for a well made action movie after being a bit disappointed by Arnold's last go around, Collateral Damage.  I was looking for a film with enough plot to keep you thinking and lots of exciting action.  Blade II delivers that.The action and fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed with a very frenetic style that makes each scene unique and entertaining.  The film is very stylish and was a bit more dark than the original, looking deeper into the underground world of vampires.  I was impressed with the movie in general.There was enough plot to keep things tied together and the plot holes that do exist can be easily overlooked if you just kind of shrug your shoulders at them.  There is not much suspense in the film and the attempts at twisting the plot are predictable, but acceptable within the realm of the genre.  When the movie was done, I turned to my friend and said ""very cool."" That seems to be a good description for what was a surprisingly entertaining movie.  If you are looking for a visually pleasing, fun movie, Blade II is it.",Blade II

255,SILV3R,breaking rules,8,19 September 2002,"Other than the explanation of where he came from, who he and everyone else is, at the beginning, this film stands nicely on its own. for those of you that know the first one, then this opening explanation will be a little irritating (and a tad confusing, but it becomes clear later). The opening does smell strongly of franchise potential, being repeated in all the inevitable sequels still to come. Once past this though, we are lead through a massive fight and action scene that sets up the whole movie. and warns anyone who can't stand Hong Kong action scenes that they are probably watching the wrong screen.The movie is essentially a platform for Snipes to have fun with his most renowned character. And he does so with very entertaining results. The movie has reasonably well rounded characters, suspicion piled on top of everyone, some amazing set pieces and a good sense of humour. The impact of all the blood and guts is reduced by the obvious fantasy of the fights (wires and SFX a lot of the time), but its still pretty powerful.The lead performances are all very good, although some of the peripheral characters are a little too hammer horror. Luke Goss demonstrates great potential, although you would need to see him without the make up, body doubles, and special effects to really judge. and there is occasionally that urge to shout ""when will I be famous."" and the pure blood female vampire who takes a shine to blade is well worth being bitten by.Overall it feels less like a sequel and more like a stand alone movie. with this in mind, I think its in fact better than the original (a rare example of the exception that proves the rule).",Blade II

This time blade is working with the vampires to exterminate a greater threat: vampires with cool mouths.

257,DamRho,Pure nonsense,4,11 September 2004,"Blade 2 is yet another Hollywood action-packed sequel that manages to both insult your intelligence and bore you to death at the same time. The good thing about Blade 2 is that it's not like other sequels made for money, it's actually not worse than its predecessor. It's just as bad. Realising that the movie doesn't quite try to depict reality in any way, it does have some insulting moments to the average human being that passed Physics class in high school. We are treated to several scenes that surely will go to the hall of fame of insulting science as we know it. As an example for the readers that haven't seen the film, in one particular shot the hero decides that the best way to deal with a horde of foes is to blow up an UV bomb. Unaware that such UV radiation would be deadly for any human being - I'm also aware that he's supposed to be half-human half-vampire but if the UV radiation doesn't affect him the same way it does the vampires then it must affect him like it does to humans! -, whoever decided this scene should be in this film also decides that UV radiation should travel in a purely fabricated way through tunnels and also that it wouldn't travel in water. Of course, one nonsense is not enough, and we're also treated to a couple of vampires spotting the light and managing to avoid being hit by the UV radiation by going underwater. Be aware that light travels at approximately three hundred thousand kilometres per second. Maybe it's the made-up material ""nitro-vacuum"", whose name doesn't even make sense. Blade 2 is cinematic disaster, a film to avoid at all costs. Watch it only if you manage to shut your brain off during the whole duration of the movie.",Blade II
258,russellt-766-50076,A highly improved sequel that provides great entertainment,7,7 July 2010,"Blade 2 is a good improvement over the first installment. It has more action,a cooler style and more interesting characters. Many of the problems that I had with the first Blade(weak characters,bad CGI,thin plot) are mostly cleared up here. I also think that this film puts Weasly Snipes talents to better use. It seems to know that Snipes acting talent is a bit limited(sorry Snipes fans) but manages to make him a bit more of a compelling hero than he was in the first movie. It also introduces more characters,some of which are interesting and most of which are well played(you know,acted) The plot is a bit thin and convoluted but that doesn't really matter. The special effects are good and action is non-stop and exciting. I also think that it was a wise move bringing Guillermo Del Toro in as a director because he adds in a lot of imagination and his own awesome visual style,making this film much more interesting and exciting than the first. Thats all I can say really,Blade 2 just has better acting,better characters,better action,better style and is simply more entertaining than the first installment.

259,matthewshanereaves,Bloody great time!,9,19 August 2004,"I enjoyed the first ""Blade"" flick. I felt it was a moderately entertaining flick that effectively showcased the fantastic screen presence and decent martial arts skills of Wesley Snipes, but this sequel by far blows its predecessor away in terms of good action. Although ""Blade II"" doesn't offer much in terms of story or character development, unlike the first flick, the opening and ending action sequences are stunning and hold up extremely well after several viewings. That being said, although Stephen Norrington's vision worked well for the first chapter in the series, I have to say I preferred Guillermo del Toro's much more gothik imagery this time around. The final showdown between Snipes' protagonist and the film's villain will satisfy even the most ardent action fans, and I gotta say, this movie had me eagerly awaiting the release of ""Blade: Trinity.""",Blade II

Vampires just dont seem very scary here. They are just a bunch ofpeople into heavy metal and goth. I dont know, maybe its me. I just felt like I had seen this moviebefore.

I'm sure many people will hate this, but they should all have known they would hate it before they walked into the theater. This is all you could expect from a Blade movie, and more. My only disappointment were a few cheese effects. That first fight with the bloodpack had to have been done on serious budget constraints. But most of the effects are perfect for the style of the film; and the action caught me up right from the start. And only the before mentioned effects really threw me out of the flow. Most of the rest had me drooling. The whole movie is made in the same cartoonish style on which it is based, and it works perfectly. Even better than X-Men. In conclusion: Blade II does not belong up there with Citizen kane and Schindlers list, but it is solid movie entertainment for a braindead Saturday night.",Blade II
263,suburbannightmare,Fab sequel....but not like the first....,8,4 November 2006,"This is Blade's second outing (nothing like stating the obvious, I suppose). And really rather good, considering it's lack of similarities to the first movie. Blade once again, continues to fight the good fight against creatures of darkness. Only this time, it's not the vampires he's hunting. This movie brings forth an idea about a strain of vampires being 'created'. These 'reapers' aren't what you would call normal vampires, although there are a couple of similarities between the two. They still feed on fresh human blood, sunlight fries them to a crisp, and they have the customary supernatural strength that vampires have. However, they're a little harder to kill than ordinary vampires. And they're spreading at an alarming rate. The vampire nation, disconcerted by this new breed of bloodsuckers need help to eliminate them before they infect and turn the entire human race. So they call in Blade to help them. But can the two races put aside old grudges and unite to destroy this frightening new evil? This film was made almost 4 years after the first movie, and with a different director at the helm so the look of the whole thing is entirely different. Not a bad thing though. I think with sequels a lot of people expect the subsequent films to look and feel exactly like the first one. This doesn't always work. With Blade II, there's an entirely new set of characters, a new race of vampires, new weapons and Whistler undergoes some interesting changes between this movie and the first one too. It all adds up for another serving of deliciously dark action adventure.So we have Blade teaming up with the Bloodpack  an elite group of vampire warriors going after the reapers to destroy them. (Interestingly enough, the bloodpack was supposedly put together to try and take Blade out.) Some of the Bloodpack are a bit laughable though. Priest is just a bad-tempered git with an Irish accent. Lighthammer was obviously cast for his build and not his acting. Verlaine does little other than pout and look worried, and Chupa spends the entire movie having a go at Whistler whilst clad in some kind of weird chain-mail vest. Snowman and Reinhardt more than compensate for the rest of the gang's mediocrity though. Donnie Yen, who is one of the coolest martial artists alive, plays Snowman (and earns his paycheque choreographing the movie's fight scenes), and Ron Perlman (a Del Torro favourite) gives an excellent performance as Blade's nemesis-esquire Bloodpack heavy, Reinhardt. Leonor Varela is quite good as Blade's number two, Nyssa. She's another black leather catsuit-wearing hottie of the vampire-movie universe, and like Selene in Underworld, she looks rather good. Although I'll never understand why women in action films feel the need to spend two hours constantly frowning. Maybe it's the universally accepted symbol of 'hardass female'. Hmm Luke Goss plays Nomak, the lead reaper, and is amazingly good in this film. Even though his accent seems to falter somewhat. He sounds like a cockneyfied Czech which is pretty remarkable. His overall portrayal is outstanding though, he looks dark, grim and murderous  he even gives Blade a run for his money in the fight scene stakes.All in all, the plot line, characters, gore, action and soundtracks are sufficiently entertaining (keep an eye out for an echo of the infamous clubscene from the first Blade movie), and although not as good as some have said, it's enjoyable enough for what it is  an action/vampire movie.",Blade II

Some great fight sequences, especially the opening scene.Watch out for the deleted scenes on the second disc of the DVD release. There's nothing much here at all.

The sequel is better looking and better directed (it is, however, the least involving of Guillermo del Toro's directorial works--everyone looking for a more interesting take on vampirism by him should check out Chronos), and the idea behind the story is interesting enough, but very little plot shows up on screen.

After about the fifth Matrix-style, video-game inspired, rap-scored beat down, I had to keep myself from yawning too obviously.Too bad...the premise of Blade hooking up with other vampires to take out a new bloodsucking mutation could have been decent premise (for a B movie)....if it hadn't have been written to salve the minds of PS2 junkies.Not that there aren't a few bright moments.

269,dzk70,"Simple, yet full of fun and blood",7,24 March 2002,"I have to say that I got what I expected from ""Blade 2"", a fast and fun horror/action flick. To begin with the downside I wish there could have been more of a relationship development with Blade and Whistler. The partial love story was alright but the torment of not belonging to either world wasn't stressed enough in Blade's character. I felt the love story of this movie could have touched a little more on this. Now, to cast doubt on my last comments, Blade does seem to be a character who shows his pain and loneliness on his face, but it is hard to see that pain when he is wearing sunglasses through out half the movie. I also wish that directors who feel ""martial arts"" is the cool thing in action flicks now a days, would stop allowing every single character know martial arts to make the movie look cool. Blade was fighting the head of the ""Reapers"" (new vampires) and he (Reaper leader) seemed to know the same fighting style as Blade. I have a theory for this to argue my last statement but it would ruin the flick for those who haven't seen it. Now for the good stuff, the ""Blade hunter"" vampires were very cool, full of attitude and arrogance. The names the writer thought of for these characters were very cool, almost comic book-like (image that). One character is massive and carries a huge hammer and his name is ""Lighthammer"" I like that name. The choreography of the action scenes had some cg bumps but in the end I really enjoyed them because in the end this is a movie to fully entertain you and not make you think about social issues. Blade was great as usual, he seemed to be faster and stronger than in the first one. They bring back Whistler, who I thought died in the first one, so I was skeptical when I read and saw he was in the sequel but there was a good explanation for it. Finally the Reapers. These vampires look great!!!! They look like zombies (and I love Zombies!!!!)The sounds that were edited for them were superb and there superior strength and movements were awesome!!!The way they look matched with the dark and gritty cinematography enhanced their characters. All in all a good flick for a bunch of friends to see, for a you action buffs, give it a try you might like it. Sorry, the sets for one of the ""Ancient Vampires"" was alright, I don't know if I like old Victorian style (Gothic statues, paintings, etc) in a modern day setting, but just an opinion. Anyway, worth seeing!!",Blade II
270,titan-28,Better Than the First Film!,10,26 October 2006,"""Blade II"" is by far the best in the trilogy. With loads of non-stop great action, and an awesome supporting cast, ""Blade II"" quickly became one of my favorite action films of all time. I can watch it over and over and over and never get sick of it. Wesley Snipes is even better than he was in the first film, and Norman Reedus (The Boondock Saints) does a great job as Blade's sidekick. The movie is about a new breed of monsters, who feed on vampires instead of humans. The vampire community who fear for their own lives team up with Blade to take on these new baddies. The vampire team may be one of the coolest groups ever. Led by Ron Pearlman, you also have Matt Schulze, Donnie Yen, and Tony Curran to name a few in the ""Blood Pack"". There is so much action it is hard to even pick a favorite moment. If you liked the first movie you'll love this one. If you like vampire movies, or action packed movies you'll love this one too. This is definitely better than you average action/horror film. I didn't expect it to be even better than the first Blade but it was much more. It has a good story with a new twist instead of your average vampire thriller. There are even quite a few good plot twist that I wasn't expecting in the movie either. With all the great action it is easy to overlook the story and acting, but I thought each character did a great job with their roles and there was a lot of good dialogue. Every seen had a reason and a purpose and you never get bored once. I can go on and on about it, but I think you guys get the point. The point being this movie will not disappoint!",Blade II
271,iandaemon,Eh. Mostly Action.,6,27 March 2002,"BLADE 2 is nothing like the original BLADE.  This sequel has A LOT more action and A LOT less story.  I mean 'story' in the MOST general sense.The acting is OK, but the actors are under-used.This whole movie feels like it's the last third of a movie.  If you watch BLADE (and BLADE 2 immediately after), you would get all the story and all the action contained within, but as for me, the original movie (BLADE) was incredibly better than its sequel (BLADE 2).Having a different writer and a different director, the sequel seems to resemble the original movie ONLY in the leading actor (WESLEY SNIPES).If you LOVE the movie BLADE, _rent_ the sequel, but if you have any reservations about BLADE's story, skip the sequel and watch TWIN PEAKS.",Blade II
272,ixijimixi,"OK movie, enough action for those with short attention spans...",5,22 March 2002,"I was hoping this movie would have the same depth of plot as the original, but I was mistaken.  The entire movie was almost one giant action sequence. Any fleshing out of the plot was rushed.  It was an OK movie if you're just in the mood to watch stuff explode and watch neat vampire death effects.If you were hoping to see Wesley Snipes act in this movie, you're going to be disappointed.  It's an awful lot like he'd repeated all his character's mannerisms so much, he's become bored with them.The special effects rate very high on the ""ooh, ahh"" scale.  However, any scene where the vampire ninjas are crawling across the ceiling or walls looks very fake.  We're all used to wirework and slow-mo angles of scenes nowadays, but at least in them, gravity and momentum looks somewhat logical. In the ninja scenes, though, they jump and fall with a rushed, unreal look. I kept thinking of Cats & Dogs when I was watching these scenes.  It's sad that in this day and age, they're still making mistakes like they did back in the Mortal Kombat II movie.If you're looking for a good action flick with a unique plot, then pass. This movie was worth matinee price, but I wouldn't waste nine bucks on it.",Blade II
273,frostfang,"Simply stronger, faster, better",9,7 April 2002,"Just SO much better than the first one. I especially enjoyed the improved burning effect when the vampires died. And the Reapers? Just totally awesome. And Blade is just cooler than he ever was. Whistler is back and I think they pulled it off pretty good, though it seemed a bit ""easy"". -SPOILER- ""Well, they made him a vampire, but let's just give him this here stuff and that cure him!"" hehe, see for yourself!",Blade II
274,the cranky quibbler,A far superior film compared to the first...,8,28 May 2002,"The first Blade was a travesty. It was an unexcusable mess compiled together with quick cuts, flashing technology and a never-ending soundtrack of techno music.  It had no sense of joy or adventure; it was just a slice and dice film with no purpose and blood oozing out of every frame. Now, Blade 2 is here with its quick cuts, flashing technology and a never-ending soundtrack of techno music. The only difference between the first Blade and the second is, the second one is good. Blade (Wesley Snipes) is half man and half vampire. He chooses to side with the humans, rather than the vampires. He hunts down vampires, kills them, and they explode like a Fourth of July firework. In the first one, Blade got his weapons specially made from Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), but Whistler met his untimely demise. But, in actuality, the vampires took Whistler's body and kept it and nursed him back to health so he could become a vampire. Blade is searching the entire world and finally he finds Whistler. Vampires confront Whistler and Blade. They don't want to kill him, they want him to help them. There's a new breed of killing machine, which feeds off of humans and vampires. They want to put aside their differences and try and stop these Reapers, as they are called. The Reapers appear to be normal, but they have a `scar' on the chin that opens up to a giant mouth with about nine tounges. The reason Blade 2 is better than the fist is because Blade 2 has a story to back up its action scenes. The first was just an endless killing spree that got boring after about five minutes. Blade 2 has substance to match with its style. Wesley Snipes, who returns in the role, has about a much enthusiasm as a rock. But, he does give Blade the certain edge he needs. Kristofferson has much better material to work with this time and provides a lot of comedy relief when its needed and keeps his mouth shut when the time is inappropriate. Director Guillermo del Toro knows how to mix computer effects when the time is right. The first Blade had an overkill of special effects, but in Blade 2 uses them  to perform stunts the human body is incapable of doing. Del Toro also has a way with the camera. When Blade spins, the camera spins right along with him. Blade 2 will probably be the best popcorn movie of the year. It differs from Resident Evil in that Evil was just an exercise in special effects and zombies. Blade 2 is a smart popcorn movie that knows its audience doesn't always need everything spelled out. Resident Evil, which I did enjoy, had the plot planned out around the action. Blade 2 has the action planned into the plot so it makes sense and fight scenes just don't break out for any good reason. Blade 2 is extremely above average when it comes to popcorn movies. If only Tomb Raider would have been this good.---------8/10",Blade II

Enough is explained in one way or another that I didn't have to see the first one and get lost in this film.That being said, the action scenes were phenomenal.  Lots of, well, blade action you could tell was choreographed well and executed perfectly.  Some of the scenes are a little on the gory side, so I wouldn't bring children to this.  The plotline was ok, but nothing special.I would suggest going out to the theaters and seeing this flick, besides seeing all the action on a large screen, the Episode II trailer is before it.  I always see films during the day so it only costs $4.50.  Would I see this at ""prime time""?  Not really, although all the bangs and stereo sound is used superbly (in some scenes, you could hear stuff happening all around you), you can still get a good experience by renting it.  So, basically, if you can get to a movie theater to see it, you'll like it.  If you have to wait till you can rent it, you'll like it (8/10)",Blade II

The movie has plenty of action, great special effects, and some scary horror thrills.  This movie was 2 hours of great fun and entertainment.  Wesley Snipes is perfect to play this character and I can't wait for the third and final part to this saga.  I recommend this movie to all.  Don't be surprised if this movie is one of the best for this year. Also, I love the fact that it is R - rated, and instead of becoming soft, this story has become even darker.  I give it 10 out of 10!!!",Blade II

I wasn't expecting a stellar, groundbreaking movie, but I was expecting something like the first Blade was: a pretty decent action vampire movie.Sadly, Blade's sequel was absolutely horrible.  The dialogue hit unprecedented lows even for action movies, the plot was rather silly, and the ""thrills"" consisted of mere gross-outs, which weren't even effective. The most disturbing part of the movie was watching Wesley Snipes crack his neck.Don't waste your time with this movie.  Rent the first one instead, or see something else.

Sure, the plot isn't solid as a rock, it's a bit predictable, and it's gory as hell...now to the good...Director Del Toro literally FORCE FEEDS you action in this movie! It still amazes me to realize how much fighting was in those two hours!  Wesley Snipes is his usual bad@$$ self, and Blade's confidence in his skills are comical at times.  The new twist of Blade fighting alongside of the vampires is interesting, since you'll find out *SPOILER* that the group of fighters he joins with were actually trained to kill HIM!  There's a lot more hand to hand combat in this movie...just straight fists, which is alright, but I prefer Blade's sword! haha  There were a couple more downsides to the movie, such as obvious computer animation (but if you take into account the impossible moves, you'll understand), the weak love story, and the moderate villian, who, I'm sorry, but does not compare at all to the slick and crafty Deacon Frost.  However, if you're thirsting for some blood...Errrr...Action...pay the seven bucks because you'll end up getting 100 dollars worth!

To pick between this and the original is a tough decision, but I would have to side with the original. This is because despite the action sequences being fantastic the film lets itself down on 2 fronts for me.1 - Despite being a good character, Nomak is not in the same league as Deacon Frost in the original. The fact that Blade is given only a weak reason to fight Nomak means that there is none of the chemistry or intensity to the battles that the original had.2 - The introduction of the Blood Pack draws attention away from Blade. This is not good, we paid the admission fee so we could see Blade kicking some suckhead ass, not a bunch of vampires.Despite this, the film is fantastic and only slightly worse than the original. it is still an essential purchase for any action fan.",Blade II

All the way through this movie, I was so bored and I couldn't wait to leave the theater! They call this a horror film, well it was the most dull, boring, pointless, and stupid horror movie I have ever seen. And truthfully, I am a huge fan of horror flicks. I've seen almost every horror flick out there and nothing matches up to the horror flicks from the 1970's and the 1980's, in my opinion anyway. I saw the original Blade movie, and I can't remember what it was like. It couldn't have been this awful though. Blade 2 is just a pile of junk and there's nothing, and I mean nothing at all scary about this film. It's just a movie with a very shallow plot. There's no good killing scenes, or no good scenes at all for that matter!!! Extremely, extremely, extremely dull, lame and boring movie!!! Save your money, don't rent or go see this.

Del Toro ups the ante and delivers a movie that grabs you by the eyeballs and doesn´t let go until the credits start to roll. It is impossible to take it all in in the first sitting and BLADE II looks so great and is told so smoothly that you´ll want to see it again and again. And again. There isn´t much to challenge your cerebral cortex but it's good, old and very beautiful entertainment. An absolute must.",Blade II
291,ScarTrek,A live-action comic book,10,14 April 2004,"Of all the DVDs in my collection, there is only a very small handfull that I've watched more often than Blade II. I can explain my love of the movie very simply. It's a huge, over-the-top, indulgent, immature comic-book/cartoon brought into live action, packed onto a rollercoaster that careens along wildly from start to finish.What a ride.The action is the first thing anyone will notice. Mainly because once it starts, it pretty much doesn't stop. Everything is slightly exaggerated, everyone pulls off moves that should be impossible. But the cast pull it off with such style, that you barely need to suspend your disbelief. Snipes is excellent as a physical actor, Perlman has a classy Lee Marvin style to him. Goss, who I'll forever remember as a ""teen heartthrob"" back when I was a kid, surprised the hell out of me with some extremely competent fighting. His brutal, straight-to-the-point streetfighting style impresses, turning the UK's version of Justin Timberlake of the early 90's into one of the most physically threatening antagonists I've seen in the past decade of movies. Even Kris Kristofferson gives someone a good head-stomping. If you're worried this will consist of a couple of vampires standing 10 feet apart and firing at each other, a la Underworld, have no fear. This is far more ferocious and much more entertaining.The special effects are integral to this. For the most part, they hold up. The action looks stylized and unique, not only due to the massive mix of unconventional styles used (listen to Snipes' commentary on the DVD as he reels out a list of 9 or 10 styles he uses in a single fight sequence as they happen), but also due to the ""L-Cam"", which lets the camera woosh around the battleground in a way never before seen (but seen since in Spider-Man, the effect used to follow his webswinging through the streets). The CGI holds up for the most part. In combat, it enables the crazy cartoony action del Toro was looking for, and it really works. It's not QUITE over the top, but pushes it. Monster effects are top-notch though. The Reapers in particular were enough to unsettle even me, a hardened veteran of the worst Video Nasties the 70's had to offer. Many subtle uses of CGI are dotted throughout, and the movie makes no attempt to showcase them, which makes them very effective. There's only one real duff moment, which is a fight scene taking place in front of a wall of lights, a horrible decision, as lighting is one of the main reasons CGI often looks unrealistic.But it's not all fighting. There's a nice dollop of humour, which director Guillermo del Toro understood perfectly, and Snipes pulled off without a hitch. The characters in this movie are ""cool"", they're calm, collected, never have a hair out of place. So when they throw out a witty one-liner at the most unexpected of moments, it plays off the ""straight guys"" perfectly. Yet this doesn't undercut the drama. Admittedly, it's due to the physical nature of most of the drama, but that's a matter of semantics. It doesn't change the fact that the undercurrent of humour fails to lessen the severity of the situation, or three brilliant, emotional deaths (including what is presently my favourite villain death ever).The plot is nice and tight, for the most part. There are definately moments where the more observant will stop to wonder, but there's no time for that, the movie just moves too fast. And that's perhaps the one thing that will turn many people off this movie. If you don't like action, and you don't like fast-paced movies, you'll be in a nightmare of rushed-over plot points and blurred secondary characters whizzing by in the background. For people who just want some fun though, who cares about the backstory of a character who accomplishes little and dies after 30 minutes of screentime? Many characters are there solely to die and further the plot. You don't notice, the rest of the characters are too damned cool to take your eyes off of.Unless you like your movies grounded firmly in reality (if you thought The Matrix was a bunch of sillyness, stay away), or hate action movies in general, hunt this one down. I'd strongly recommend picking it up on DVD in fact, as the two audio commentary tracks are both utterly hilarious, yet highly informative at the same time, a rare thing.",Blade II
292,Mac-Daddy,SOUPED UP SEQUEL,8,5 August 2002,"Consider the original 'Blade' movie as a Vampire, and think of the sequel as a Reaper: better, stronger, faster.

293,alntv,Not as good as the first...,5,26 March 2002,"I have to admit, after seeing ""Resident Evil"", I was really in the mood for even more action/horror, so I figured this would be the film to follow it up with. I really enjoyed the first Blade, and I kinda knew going in that this one would probably be a rehash of that film. And it was.Not a lot of room to develop a serious plot, there is plenty of action and lots of loud music. Kind of like the first. Kris Kristofferson returns (unfortunately), a new ""female"" is added (thankfully), and this time Blade teams up with his enemies to battle an even badder baddie than NORMAL vampires. Unlike ""Resident Evil"", I did have a little higher expectations for this film. I really thought that maybe after the first film, they would lay off Blade's past and focus on just kicking ass. But we are once again forced to sit and watch Blade struggle with his past and who he is and can he fall in love...blah blah blah. Truthfully, I think the character of Blade is very cool! But, unlike Batman or Spiderman, he is NOT human and even if he could be, why wouldn't he, after 20 or 30 years, figure out that being Blade is not so bad! He's not a 100% vampire, so he gets to enjoy being out in the sun. He's not 100% human, so he gets to jump off buildings, leap off walls, and kick everyone's butt! I was really hoping that since Blade got to meet his mother in the first, he would have come to terms with who he is and move on. Oh well...Anyway, on a positive note, the new vampires are very cool. I thought the new villain was more ""cartoony"" than the first film. Of course, he was also done up to look more like Nosferatu, so the costume and makeup were more scary than the actual villain. I did like the new ""love interest"" in this one a little bit more. Being a vampire, she could have been a little harder in places, but at least she had an understanding of Blade.
One negative, the filmmakers create a team of vampires to work with Blade, and then they don't even let us get to know them! Unlike, say ""Aliens"" or ""Predator"", where you get to at least meet the team, thus allowing the viewer to at least care a little bit if they get eaten by the bad guy, they are so underdeveloped that, except for 2 characters, I could have cared less if they got what was coming to them. Too bad...cause they looked pretty cool!This film is no where near as good as ""Resident Evil"". So if you have a choice, you now have my opinion. However, I do think that on some cold January afternoon, when there's nothing else to do but sit at home and watch a couple hours of television, watching both Blade movies one after the other will not be a waste of your time.",Blade II

297,jigglez,Startlingly surpasses the original!,10,23 March 2002,"I had been looking forward to seeing this ever since I heard it was being made.  I was relatively skeptical, however.  Would the villain be as crisp and cool as Stephen Dorff?  Would the fight scenes and gore come in as many amounts as it did in the original? During the first fifteen minutes, one of my questions was answered.  This intense and extremely satisfying action sequence had already surpassed just about every fight scene in the original.  The vampires vaporized into burning dust in a much more glorified fashion, and Wesley Snipes found more unique ways to take them out.  This opening was truly eye-popping, and was a good sign of things to come. In general, the movie stayed that way.  The action scenes were smoothly intertwined with a storyline that had made a good progression from the first movie (Blade must team up with a group of vampires who had originally been trained to hunt and kill him to help them fight a new and dangerous enemy that feeds on both humans AND vampires).  The only thing that this one didn't have that the original had was the cool villain. Stephen Dorff was a more menacing villain than the creepy Nomak.  Not that Nomak wasn't menacing at all, but Deacon Frost had more of an entertaining badass factor.  But other than that, this movie had more action, more gore, and more bite overall than the first one.  Highly recommended!",Blade II
298,ranev,The best comic book movie i have ever seen,9,22 March 2002,"There are two types of sequels it seems: ones that, to put it lightly, aren't all that good and ones that surpass the original (like Terminator II and the Empire Strikes Back). Thankfully, Blade 2 happens to fall in the second category. This is, quite frankly, the best comic book movie I have ever seen mainly because the people who made it knew exactly what they were making. It is true that the plot is not all that much but it is full of enough twists and turns and blood (gallons and gallons of it) and guts to keep us interested. Anyways, compared to the crap we've been getting lately, crap that's even gone as far as to win Oscars (Gladiator anybody?), this is Shakespeare. I mean, I even found one of the last scenes rather genuinely beautiful and tragic (I'm not kidding, please don't throw tomatoes at me 'cause I'm over-sentimental). But anyways, for people who want to see a really gory, action packed movie that's actually good well you really can't go wrong with Blade 2. In fact I think it is the only gory, action packed movie that's actually good I've seen in quite a while.",Blade II

It's violent (very violent in fact)but the pace means you are on to the next bit of action before it all registers. Wesley Snipes is 'perfection' and whilst it was not as character driven as the first, it was fun throughout.  The fight sequences were well choreographed and it was a breathtaking display of skills and martial arts. The 'traitor' was totally unexpected and added an edge to the film.  I can't wait for 'Blade 3'!  Bring on the vampires. P.S. Luke Goss doesn't sing!",Blade II
300,Disco Inferno,Every action fan's guilty pleasure,8,2 May 2002,"Usually I like watching movies with a good story and characters, but once in a while there are times where you say, ""To heck with that, turn off the brain, and lets see some crap being blown up"".  Make no mistake, Blade 2 is one of those movies.  If you take it for what it is (an action/martial arts/horror film) you won't be disappointed.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to watch this movie expecting anything else different, because if you are, this movie would not be worth your time.Hollywood has been quick to mass produce action movies, but even though a lot of them have high production values, few are really good (Con Air anyone?)  I've seen a lot of action movies, and thankfully, Blade 2 is probably one of the better ones I've seen since The Matrix.  I would even say it's better than the Matrix.  Both had a combination of action and martial arts(okay, some might laugh at the fighting in the Matrix) with the only difference was that the Matrix was set in a ""cyber"" setting and Blade 2 has blood sucking vampires as the backdrop.The martial arts is probably the best I've seen in any Hollywood movie. There is never a dull moment in the movie, and the action is fast and furious.  Like every comic book hero, Blade has his trusty Ginsu sword and ""boomerang"" from the first movie, along with some special neat ""UV"" grenades which made for a nice bang.  The gore, surprisingly, was more than I was expecting.  Vampires and victims alike will be devoured, dismembered, sliced, blown up, shot, and impaled in the most creative ways that will make you want to say ""ouch"".  The gore in this film practically makes the chestburster in Aliens seem like Micky Mouse.  The autopsy of one of the Reapers will make you think twice about eating liver again.While it lacked in what little story and character development the first movie had was more than made up by the action and fighting scenes.  There is even a little, unoriginal ""twist"" if you can call it that near the end. There are some funny moments in the film, especially with Kris Kristofferson who reprises his role as the Hillbilly vampire slaying sob.The only turnoffs might be the excessive language in the film and maybe the rap music, if those 2 things aren't your cup of tea.  While not approaching Tarantino proportions of cussing, you'll probably lose count how many times the f-word is repeated.  The rap music gets too annoying.  On the other hand, the movie would seem kind of a lacking in some way if the cussing and rapping wasn't in there.  In a way, they kind of lend to the atmosphere and grittiness of the movie.I've never read the comic book before, but Blade 2 definitely kicks Batman's ass in so many ways and is probably the best comic book movie adaption (well, so far) that i've seen.  If you are in the mood for kick ass marital arts, kinetic action, and aren't offended by gross out scenes or cussing, this movie is highly recommended to be seen on the big screenAction: 8.5/10 Martial Arts: 8.5/10 Gross Outness: 8/5/10 Swearing: 7.5/10Overall:  8/10",Blade II
301,Tundrayeti,Know thy fans.,3,23 March 2002,"This is the first time I have bothered to actually write my oppinions concerning a movie, but I feel it my duty to warn those who loved the first movie as much as I did that this is not anything like the original. Though there are many holes in the plot, and many changes from the original that in my oppinion detract from one's ability to enjoy the show, I will limit my comments to the production and directing choices that have ruined this movie.  Blade II difers most dramatically from Blade in its desire to appeal to everyone.  Blade was made for guys who like vampire movies and guys who like superheroes, period. (Goths, freaks, etc..)  Blade II tries to reach out: Embracing the hip-hop crowd by replacing the techno that the goths and freaks prefer to hip-hop and rap (this is especially bothersome when it is played at an underground rave); embracing the old romantic theatre buffs in its blatent rip offs of the old ""Nosferatu"" flicks; and finally the rednecks get their share in the replacement of cool martial arts with WWF choreography.  The end result of this confused pandering is a movie that doesn't have enough to appeal to anyone that doesn't already like everything.  In short, it SUCKS.  A blatent betrayal of the fans of the first movie.",Blade II
302,kayins,"Great, if you like mindless action.",5,23 March 2002,"Blade had a lot of wonderful action sequences.  The special effects and the creature effects were pretty spectacular except for in a couple of scenes. However, this is where the movie ends.  There's no real story line (very cliche) and the acting in this movie is an exception rather than the norm. You have no reason to empathize with Blade or the characters in the movie. You don't get to look into the psyche of the main character as you did with the original Blade.  Stephen Norrington (director of the Original Blade) painted a picture of a scarred and tragic hero battling the forces of evil in order to heal the ache in his soul for how life wronged him.  Blade II throws that out of the water and is a cheap thrill ride of non-stop action and horrific effects. While I found the action and creatures of the movie particularly pleasing with its graphic nature, I felt the sequel lost some of its maturity from the first film and is a disservice to the franchise. I appreciate it when directors treat comic book heroes as if they are real, with respect, and drama interlaced with action.  I think this is one of the elements that made X-Men so successful.  But I also think it's an element that made Unbreakable and the Original Blade not as successful as they could of been.  In this case, the film makers erred on the side of making money. So if you're coming to see a movie with great non-stop action and horror then you've come to the right movie.  But if you're looking for an intelligent script that pulls you into the world of the lead character, stick with the Original Blade.",Blade II
303,sdsalamida,"Awesome Action scenes, decent plot, and plenty of blood...",7,23 March 2002,"There's plenty of movies out that have to do with Vampires.  When Blade came out, I was hesitant to see it, after hearing about the Vampire's weakness to Silver (which generically isn't true).  After seeing the movie though, I was surprised, it kicked ass. Going into the theater to see Blade II, I was expecting something not as great as the original.  After all, the original was a ""break-out"" hit, like Rush Hour.  Blade II not only exceeded my expectations, it blew me away. The action scenes are on par with the Matrix, and most are better than any in Blade.  The plot isn't great, but it didn't make you feel like they were just trying to make a sequel.  Some parts of the plot and story are spotty, but if you take it with a grain of salt, you should enjoy the film. Bottom line, If you liked Blade, go see Blade II.  If you didn't enjoy the story in Blade, but you liked the action, go see Blade II anyways.",Blade II
304,kyleMetal,Excellent Follow-up of the first Film,10,20 March 2003,"I had to put my 2 cents in on this movie.  I'm a projectionists at a theatre and some nights can be very long having nothing to do up in the booth and having to work till 2:30 am in the morning sometimes,but this movie was excellent as far as a follow-up movies go, where most films fail like the dusk till dawn trilogy. Blade 2 had some awesome fighting sequences at the end unlike any i've seen, great special effects, and it's a damn good movie, i've watched it like 30 times and i never get tired of seeing it. you won't regret buying this film.   trust me, it's well worth it!",Blade II
305,therevue8,Better than the first.,8,28 October 2003,"Guillermo del Toro's follow up to the original movie is not only better in every way than the first movie but is a real splatter classic.

When i watched the first movie, i thought here is the start of a great franchise that has plot, action, and interesting charcters. Blade II is a great continuation of the series.  It's interesting because blade 2 improves on all the spots that blade 1 was bad at, but then messes up the stuff that blade 1 did a good job with.(example, villian in blade 1 is alot better than blade 2, but blade 2 has a much more interesting plot than 1). Anyways, this is a terrific horror/action film. i love both movies and i am greatly anticipating December 10th because that is when blade 3 is going to be released whoo hoo.Blade 1 final grade- A- Blade 2 final grade- A-",Blade II

My wife who didn't particularly like the first one absolutely loved this one.

309,jefferyq,50% more action...almost perfect!,10,23 March 2002,"A step or two up from the first outing.First up, the story is better - some folks are saying there was no story but this one has 200% more story than the cliche that is the first movie's 'plot', that one and this one are really about Snipes fighting vampires, not an in-depth character study. Great plot twists included - there are some moments early on where I was thinking how stupid for Blade to be told and shown so much but later you find out why...now, I wouldn't have told him so much if I was one of those vamps but hey, they wanted his trust right? So, it may have been a bit stupid but it IS possible. Also, not having to set the character up, we get right to business and that equals 40% less exposition.Action is far better. It wasn't bad in the first one but his foes were not too skilled and the fights were not long enough...as a result, the original Blade film couldn't top the opening fight (one of it's few flaws). but here the fights start high, dip to a steady level and escalate to a smashing finale! Lots of things I am hearing about the fights are that they are too similar to Matrix scenes...this makes complete sense seeing as Donnie Yen, who plays Snowman in Blade 2, was the fight choreographer on this movie (the film's credits say he was assisted by Michael Woods, who was in a bunch of Donnie Yen's Hong Kong films). He learned all about fight choreography from Yuen Wo-ping who did the Matrix fights and he (Yen) also did the fights in some of those Yuen Wo-ping Hong Kong films. So now you know WHY they look so similar...they are not copies of the Matrix, more like brothers to that film's fights.My ONLY complaint abot Blade 2 is that Donnie should have been used in the movie more than he was...yeah, they also could have dumped some of those special effects fight bits but they really didnt do it too much for the hand to hand stuff, more for the leaps...so, it doesnt get in the way all that much (even if it does look weird).I'm looking forward to seeing this one again (and still again!) and would tell anyone/everyone to run out and see it.

I saw one critic comment that the plot was ""silly and unrealistic"". I would like to remind that person that this is a vampire movie. I did not think this was a masterpiece by any means, but it was a terrific movie to see with my friends. This was also the first movie I have ever seen an audience clap for at the end.

315,AWitte9144,Very bloody and as good as the first one,7,18 May 2002,For all those people out there who loved the first Blade movie. You`ll surely like this one. It`s plot is as strong as the one of the first part but there is much more action and fighting scenes in it. The effects even if computer generated (what you could recgnize several times) are still great and make this movie more action loaded and give it`s audience some more stuff to look at. The actors are doing a good job while costumes and equipment look great again. The sound and the soundtrack is similar to the one in Blade and fit right to the movie. For it`s genre it`s a well made movie but it might not convince all this movie is watching. Anyway if you like action and fighting scenes this is a movie worth watching.,Blade II
316,martyrff5,"Great action, horrible effects",8,24 July 2003,"The first blade had no computer generated fight scenes. Why did this one need them? To be bigger and better then the first? Other then two sections with horrible effects, the movie was very entertaining. Any action fan will enjoy the fight scenes which don't use an excess of wires. The new director is much darker, and makes the vampire world very brooding.

And don't abuse viewers that much.",Blade II
319,CWagner,Solid horror/action,7,18 March 2002,"""Blade 2""'s biggest weaknesses are a weak plot with a number of holes in it; however, its strengths overwhelm that flaw and produce a very solid piece of horror/action fare that follows the original movie very well.Del Toro's direction is top-notch, with darkness and light playing a much greater role in this film than the original. With character design and art consulting by comic-book masters Timothy Bradstreet and Mike Mignola, and sets taken straight from the decaying inner cities of Eastern Europe, the film has a consistantly strong texture. Of special note are the character designs for the ""Bloodpack"", the group of vampire warriors which Blade must lead. The detail level of their costumes and equipment is phenominal.Ron Perlman's character ""Rheinhart"" will be quite surprising for those of us you who only know the actor from movies like ""The City Of Lost Children"". As Blade's mirror-image (as the former leader of the Bloodpack), Rheinhart shows off Perlman's ability to play villians to the hilt.The primary ""bad guys"" of the film, the uber-vampires known as ""Reapers"", are extremely well-created. None of the trailers show off their most important feature, which will both shock and amaze you when you see it. Similarly, the gore effects are quite amazing, with excellent blending between computer effects and classic methods.That said, there are a number of moments where the computer effects are sub-par; in particular, the scenes where Blade is rendered fully by computers are lacking in believability. Those scenes are short, however.Finally, the action scenes are choreographed extremely well. There are a number of scenes that are deliberately evocative of the original movie, but Del Toro's direction is distinctly his own. My only complaint is that Donnie Yen (the HK film star, known to US audiences for his role in ""Iron Monkey"") didn't get to kick enough ass... but this wasn't a starring role for him, so I guess I can't expect too much.Overall a good sequel. Now I'm waiting for ""Hellboy"" with even more baited breath.",Blade II
320,PsyCody,Extremely over-the-top,7,22 March 2002,"Well, what can I say?  I went to see Blade 2 tonight and I got just what I was looking for.  Over-the-top fight scenes accompanied by gore deluxe. Now, I am not complaining, but when I say this movie was overdone, I mean it.Just watch for yourself, I think you will agree.  It was an exciting thrill ride, with few quiet points.  Bottom line, fun to watch, like the first, but expect to laugh a lot at the corny sections as well.7 out of 10 stars.",Blade II
321,alasdairwclark,Best action movie since The Matrix,9,5 April 2002,"More of the same from the first movie but bigger bolder and better. This time Blade has to team up with his arch-enemies in order to tackle a greater foe. A wonderful combination of action, blood and special effects help drive the simple but satisfying story to a conclusion. Thankfully Wesley Snipes verbal contribution is kept to smooth one liners, allowing him to concentrate on looking cool. Great film....9/10",Blade II
322,bartonfink-1,An improvment on the original,8,22 March 2002,"Not being a huge fan of the first Blade I went to the sequel not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised by this visually exciting action film. Nothing about the plot is that innovative or exceptional, but accomplishes the purpose of driving the audience from one fight sequence to the next without making them groan or lose interest.  The fight sequences themselves are very well done, combining excellent fight choreography, direction, and art direction.  Great popcorn film!",Blade II
323,mahlbowski,Great,9,27 March 2002,"There are some types of movies that you walk into expecting a lot of killing,a lot of swearing and snappy dialogue. Blade II is this kind of movie, and it is great. The plot is great, (albeit a little predictable)and some of the computer graphics are extremely noticeable, but altogether this is a great action movie. So many people die a body count would be impossible. The second to last fight scene is unbelievable. Blade puts the icing on the cake when he vertical suplexes the last security guard through a plate glass floor. The music lines up perfectly with the fighting, and I was very impressed with the way the Reaper looks and feeds. A GREAT SEQUEL TO A GREAT MOVIE!!! Looking forward to a trilogy!!!",Blade II
324,Rockj4b,One of the best movies i've ever seen. It's awesome.,9,23 March 2002,"This movie is hands down the BEST action movie since the Matrix.  The plot was awesome.  Who cares if it was predictable?  It was still a good plot. For those critics who complain about the plot being ""unrealistic""?  IT'S A VAMPIRE MOVIE!  How is it suppose to be realistic?  It's also an action movie!  Critic's review movie's like these like they're suppose to be a beautiful mind or something.  Sit back, enjoy the movie and have fun. That's what movie's like blade are here to do! Blade 2 is an awesome movie.  Along with the plot the action was GREAT and beautifully choreographed.  It's nice and simple; Blade teams up with a group of vampires called the bloodpack to take out another group of bigger, more dangerous bloodsuckers who are a threat to civilization itself.  I loved the look of it.  Blade fans will either like or absolutely LOVE this movies. And yes, i think this movie is better than the original Blade.  If there was one thing negative i have to say about it, it's that i missed Deacon Frost. The main character in this movie was cool but not as cool as Frost.  BTW the last Fight scene is incredible. The final scene is hilarious.  This film DESERVES to make a heck of alot more money than Blade did.  I will definitely see this movie again.  Take some friend or friends, sit back and just have some fun. Blade 2 gets a 9/10.  BTW...WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE RATING?????  People should definitely try to get that up.  A 5.6?? That's pathetic. It should be rated as high or even higher than Blade was. Because it's JUST as Good if not better.",Blade II

Blade II was made with a lot of money and no talent. They've completely, mercilessly destroyed, spoiled a very good thing in a desperate need to cash in, to up profit margins. It makes me sick, makes me very sad. I really want to cry over this. A sequel was cried out, could have been so good. Instead, we get a load of trite, vacuous, rubbish. some of the sequences are quite good, but the whole thing feels like a tired, talentless, unoriginal action sequnce, scripted by the numbers. Slick, supercool badies are replaced by meaningless monsters, an original view of vampire-land given the Buffy The Vampire treatment. Moody visuals and tight scripting are given over to meaningless special effects and Hollywood cliches. An edgy soundtrack is replaced by... nothing at all. Why? Oh, why?",Blade II

I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire movie. I got shushed so many times, but I could not help it! I think the plot has so many holes, there's almost nothing there. David Goyer completely breaks and redefines all rules about vampires at all times. But that is the best part! It makes the movie so humorous! Just watch Blade's glasses. They are indestructible and they don't fall off! That is pure comedic genius. Okay, so I found this move hilarious. It isn't supposed to be a comedy but it is. How about the action? I'm not too big of an action movie fan, but I am a ninja movie fan, and this movie has the best of both worlds. Not only does it have action, kung-fu fighting, but they added professional wrestling to the mix also. The excitement never stops, so most people can look past the terrible story. (But you miss out on the humor!) Plus, the action scenes are breathtaking. They seamlessly put CG in to do amazing visual effects for stunts and camera work that could never be done in the real life. If you want 2 hours of pure escapist fun, then see this movie right away! It has everything! Action, excitement, ninjas, sci-fi, horror, disgusting amounts of gore, lots of comedy, (but unintentional) romance AND drama!

After Blade II, I can definitely say that it is one of the best vampire movies that I have ever seen. Sure, the plot was thin, but Guillermo Del Toro gave the fans what they wanted: blood, fighting, swearing, and more blood. There were even some comedic aspects to it, such as Whistler's one liners.The action and fighting in Blade II were definitely top notch. When you see the Reapers for the first time, you will be stunned. It is unbelievable. I really don't know what else to say without ruining the movie.

Not for the violence - nope thats kind of on track for a sequel to Blade. Nope what is shocking is the story, the acting, the CGI and the film itself.Blade was a good film - not a great one - but a good action flick. This one is awful. Scud is the most annoying character I have come across for ages - and it was with utter relief when he went pop! I could rattle endlessly on about the obvious inconsistencies - like vampires searching in attics with a torch - when they can see in the dark. The CGI is very poor and obviously stands out. The actors are not helped by a see through plot - and Wesley Snipes doesn't get the opportunities to bring the character to life it deserves.The ""twist"" that some people have alluded to is SO obvious its untrue. Its a real shame. The whole film smacks of being a gloriously bad sequel in the true sense of films that go one film to far. MI2 anyone? So its poor. Really poor.

For some people that's a good thing, and if you can look past the poor camera work, the thin plot, and the cheesy one-liners, you might find an earnest attempt at making your skin crawl.There where plenty of times mine did.Between seeing the explicit internals of a new super breed of addict-like vampire, and the final fight scene chock full of bone crunching, snapping, and breaking, I was left hoping for the movie to end.As the movie starts, the Blade character himself reduces him communication to grunts, snarls, and finger points. But as the film requires more dialogue, the audience is blessed with such quality one-liners as, ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"" and the final line, ""You didn't think I forgot you, did you?""And then there's the plot: Blade enlists the help of his former-mentor-turned-vampire Whistler, who was supposed to have died in the first movie. While the Vampire Council seeks the help of Blade and asks him to lead the 'Blood Pack', a tactical vampire team formed and trained to kill him. Can the Blood Pack resist with guns in their hands and Blade in their sights? Can Blade control his need to shoot every vampire he sees as he's lead into their hangout?Ooh, the suspense! Rent it, and find out!",Blade II
337,crazyelwin,one awesome sequel,10,1 April 2002,"i must say they did a fine job on this installment.  being a comic book enthusiast, these movies can be too Hollywood; but Blade II is not. i will have to say that i think this one is better than the first.  after seeing preview stuff on TV about the real/computer fighting, i was intrigued.  i am pleased to say that it was excellent.this was one movie that was true to the comic it came from.  a great action, comic and vampire movie like no other.",Blade II
338,JerichoBSB,"Even better than the first, Blade 2 is the sequel that puts all films in the comic genre to shame.",9,31 March 2002,"Blade 2 was, without a doubt, simply excellent. It did not set out to be an Oscar-contender, and obviously, will not be. What it did aim to do, however, was entertain for a solid 100 minutes, a feat that only a miniscule percentage of films can actually do. This sequel was even better than the first, making it the sequel that Batman Returns failed to be, and the sequel X2 can only HOPE to be. Being a fan of comic books and films based on comic books, I must say that Blade 2 is the true gem of the genre. It is better than Blade, From Hell, X-Men, Batman, and yes, even good ol' Christopher Reeves' Superman. It will keep you on the edge of your seats for the entire ride, and will throw in-your-face action at you from ever angle. The fight scenes are amazing and the characters are excellently done. Right now, Wesley Snipes is sitting atop the mountain of comic-films. The battle may wage on soon, however, when Tobey Maguire web-slings his way to square off against the vampire slayer.",Blade II
339,rv6672,comments,8,31 March 2002,I liked the movie and it is a good horror action film that the fans of the blade would enjoy. Wesley Snipes fits the role so well that you think it was just molded for him..There is plenty of action and the special effects are awesome.,Blade II
340,JEBisZEB,Sequel is pretty DULL...,5,24 March 2002,"Besides that this movie is quite long (or maybe it felt that way..?) and taxes the patience, Blade II has it's good qualities. But in my opinion, this is a film that can wait to be seen once it is out for rent. There is a plot, a simple one. There's plenty of action, too much action that is a result of Snipes' love for the martial arts and control of the movie. The fighting scenes are a big chunk of the film and yeah, I knew that it was basically the movie's basis. But come on...too many becomes really old really quick. The same moves over and over...ugh. Guillermo's vision for Blade's cinematography is said to be the result of studying Dr. Dre and Eminem videos...odd. The special effects and make-up though were top-notch. Yes, there are plenty more good things about Blade II, but the bad really outweighed the good, and that just plain BITES.",Blade II
341,Darkblood1,Vampire action at it's finest,9,22 March 2002,Del Toro's Blade II has all the fixings for a terrific bloody vampire cocktail.  Wesley Snipes returns in his comic book dark hero mode as Blade once again.  Blade II picks up pretty much right after the first film's last point and introduces a new and creepy vampire foes to the mix.  Blade II keeps the action going full blast and the introduction of the Blood Pack adds a new level of character development to the story and a new element for Blade's character to contend with. The story is not the best and some of the plot twists are little contrived by this is not Shakespeare either just a film comic book translation to film. The special make-up FX are wonderful adding a sinster edge to the Reapers that clearly outclasses anything in the first film.  The CGI effects are not nearly as overdone as the first film either which is nice.  Del Toro's direction is solid for the film that he is making here.  Blade II is a much more darker and fun film with a gruesome punch that should please both the horror and action film crowds.  A Definate must see for the year.,Blade II
342,Icudie,Oh My Lord,10,23 March 2002,"I went and saw this movie today and boy was I floored I loved it, not since ""The One"" has there been a movie that used CG/SFX and Wire Fu to suspend reality. Some of the fight scenes in this looked somewhat cheesy (obvious cg) but the overall effect was excellent in context to the film.

344,mferraro,"What a great story, what a crappy movie.",3,29 March 2002,"Blade. The first movie was all in all a good time. Of course that movie was made before the Matrix. Now, every action movie uses that damn bullet time crap. Does Hollywood know that we the public like that great substance known as originality? It was sweet in the Matrix. Blade 2 opens with some narration by Snipes, then busts into an action sequence. I was pumped. Then, the worst happened. Blade fired a gun, and what happens you ask? Bullet timing. ""Damn,"" I thought. Then it went away. The story got good (no spoilers), and then something happened that amazes me made it too the screen. It was a battle between Snipes and a scuba diver outside of water. There were a bunch of flood lights in the background, and they were fighting in front of it. Side note= I saw this movie with someone who couldn't point out a ""fake"" looking effect if it bit her in the nose. During this scene, the camera angle cut to a medium shot and to my surprise... There was a digital Wesley Snipes fighting a digital scuba diver. I held my mouth shut because most folks hate watching movies with me for this reason. It was then that the greatness happened. My fellow movie watcher leaned over to me and said, ""What the hell is that, claymation?"" I was stunned. If this person could point out a bad looking effect, then any mindless movie goer could too. Let me tell you folks, it was all down hill from there. It is a shame too. Good story, bad direction. It is ashame too. I liked the first one.",Blade II
345,rageweaver,Competent film but little else to recommend it,6,27 January 2007,"Blade II is something of a mixed bag, being largely well made, fairly well written and passably acted, but it is in many ways a sequel that was neither needed nor asked for.The beginning of the film contains a lot of what lets this film down, with the rescue of Whistler by Blade within the first few minutes seeming both poorly tacked on as well as unnecessary. The character went out in a respectable fashion in the first film, and to be fair the presence of the character as well as Kris Kristofferson add largely nothing to the film. The film is quickly let down once again by the poor special effects used in the Blade vs Nyssa fight, looking both fake and largely inept. This is the end of the truly cringe making parts of the film, with no real let-downs as far as plot and effects are concerned for the rest of the film.There are the highlights of the film which do however make it somewhat better than average. The costumes are brilliant, the script isn't terrible and the plot allows for plenty of action with very little thinking required. The performance of Luke Goss is brilliant and easily the best piece of acting within the film, Ron Perlman is entertaining as always and Wesley Snipes, whilst wooden, brings the same level of performance as he did in the first film.This film is easily the worst of the trilogy, but it is still enjoyable to watch if there are no better options, and of course is worth watching if you ever intend to watch Blade III.",Blade II
346,Cronic556,Awesome follow up,10,23 March 2002,"Blade 2 was the perfect blend of action, horror, and comedy. With perfectly choreographed fights scenes, and slick directing, this movie definitely tops the first Blade.The plot of the movie is pretty good. The only gripe i had was that doctor Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) from the first movie was not even mentioned. Other then that i really liked the story. In addition to the good plot, the movie also had good character development, and smart dialog.The Reapers are very well done with all the make up and digitzed effects. The make up work is top-notch and the special effects are very slick. The only problem i had with the computer segments is the battle between Blade and Nyssa. A small part of the fight sequence is digitized which made it a little bit unbelieveable. I'm glad that was the only sequence like that or else the movie would have been 2 cheesy.All in all Blade is an awesome movie and a excellent follow up to the first one. Go check it out.........NOW!My IMDB rating 9 out of 10",Blade II
347,raiderfan911,sick movie,9,22 March 2002,this movie was so sick (tight). There was great special effects and this movie had great imagination in it.

348,WapitiKev,A violent work of art! 9 out of 10!,9,26 March 2002,"A perfect amalgamation of Blade I and Aliens, this movie is what action adventure movies should be...A VIOLENT WORK OF ART WHERE THE GOOD(?) GUYS KICK BUT!!!  Gory alien otherness, a handful of (very cool) heroes we love to hate versus hordes of ghouls, and some interesting plot twists and betrayals make for an enjoyable 1 hour and 48 minutes.  While the action was not quite as good as the Matrix it more than made up in quantity what it lacked in quality.  Some minor plot flaws, could have had a bit more character development, but overall very entertaining.  Surprisingly touching ending...or sappy depending on your POV...but I liked it.  Definitely worth a full admission.",Blade II
349,philleas,Overall a good entertaining vampire hunt,8,7 April 2002,"I went to this movie with great expectancy since the first one was IMHO absolutely fantastic. But at first I got pretty disappointed. The movie starts of with a really bad story and some totally exaggerated martial acts scenes. In fact the scenes have been computer supported to much all over the movie. But you get uses to that. And after the first 20 minutes the real plot is about to begin. This is the point where the movie turns to good. Del Torro managed to put the scenes in perfect light and color. Wesley Snipes is again a cool vampire hunter, but he also shows feelings this time.Overall this movie has much more visual effects than the old one. In my opinion it's too much. Other things that made me scoring only 8 of 10 are the martial act scenes and the weak plot. It is quite obvious how the movie ends, and the martial acts dominate the story.If you like Blade I, you probably like Blade II as well and should go for it.",Blade II
350,Braddogg15,You thought One was good.......Ha try this out for size!,8,28 March 2002,I am a true lover of vamps running around killing but on top of that I love it more when there the ones being killed!

351,PR_GMR,"Enjoyable, solid sequel",8,1 December 2002,"Crafted with an over-the-top, stylish visual style, Blade II is a surprisingly enjoyable, solid sequel. In this second outing, the ""daywalker"" Blade continues to hunt the vampires around the world as he tracks down the whereabouts of his turned-vampire partner, Whistler. Soon, he's contacted by the Vampire Nation to lead an elite team in a search-and-destroy mission of a newly fangled strain of vampires known as Reapers, vampires who feed on vampires. But everything is not as it seems. Spanish director Guillermo Del Toro energizes this sequel with a swift use of CGI effects: You've never seen disintegrating vampires as pretty as you'll see here. There are also clever gadgets, such as the UV hand grenade. And the fighting sequences do not dissapoint, mixing furious martial arts moves with CGI-enhanced ""Matrix"" styled effects. Wesley Snipes kicks vampire ass and takes names. And its enjoyable watching him do it. The script by David Goyer never lets up, quickly and decidedly racing forward as a good action film should. This is a sequel that lives up to the original in tone and style. Those seeking depth should look elsewhere; this is a fast-paced 'popcorn' flick done well. Blade II is a good, stylish vampire action fun.",Blade II
352,rjdeklein,excellent,8,25 June 2002,"what i immediately noticed while watching blade 2 was that it was not a weak rerun of the first blade movie, but that it is completely different in style, which is good. sure, the action level is still extremely high, but it all has a distinctly different look than the first movie. it's even more violent (yes, that's possible) and has more grizzly effects, not a movie for the faint of heart! still the combination of action, music, effects and the arrogant jokes of snipes are making it all very worthwhile, i give it an 8 out of 10!",Blade II

They are the best fighting scenes I have ever seen, fast, accurate, and able to make you feel the pain that it causes.  Wesley Snipes is an excellent martial artist and this movie really gives him a chance to prove it.  If there were to be a Blade 3, I would definitely go watch it.",Blade II
354,deaconfan,this movie stunk,1,18 October 2002,i'm sorry but i was very disappointed when i saw this movie.  I was almost excited to see it because i liked the first one so much.

I hope that if they will make a third that it will be much better.,Blade II
355,payback37,"Incredible action movie, but not much more",8,24 July 2004,"If you're looking for a cerebral, smart action movie, Blade II isn't it. However, if you go in expecting to see a very cool action movie with tons of eye candy, a fair plot, and lots of butt-kicking, this is precisely what you're looking for. The CGI fighting mixed in with the normal martial arts fights is excellently done. In this one, Blade is up against a new super-race of vampires, and must make uneasy allies in strange places. As usual, the ""Daywalker"" (as Blade as known by the normal vampires) will go anywhere and fight anytime. Even when you punch him the face, his sunglasses stay on: he's just that cool!In short, another jaunt in the world of the night with the unflappable Blade is just what the doctor ordered for all you action and fantasy junkies.",Blade II
356,borixxx,"Intense action, nice storyline, and a bad-ass hero",9,1 January 2005,"As soon as I saw the trailer for this years ago I knew I had to watch Blade 1 to get to see this thing. I had some sweet expectation for this movie, and guess what, I wasn't disappointed! Some minor spoilers ahead...This movie, starts off with Blade looking for his mentor Whistler who apparently died in Blade but has actually been kidnapped by the vampires and moved around from place to place. With Whistler gone, Blade has a new sidekick Scud, who is witty, smart, and funny at the same time. After the whole whistler thing, Blade is recruited by the vamps because some a new kind of Vampire called the ""Reaper"" is out and must be stopped. He must lead a team of vampires who were ironically trained for two years to take Blade out. The story builds from there with a lot of ass-kicking, feeding, blood, humor, and some intense action.When I first saw this movie I was like WOW. This one had a bit of humor and the action was amazing. Blade somehow appeared cockier, stronger, funnier, and more violent than in the previous Blade movie. The Bloodpack (Vampire group) is not a bad addition to the storyline because they don't take as much camera time as the Nightstalkers in Blade Trinity.The Effects had a bit of flaws but the martial arts make up for it, the acting job wasn't bad except for some of the BloodPack members (e.g Chupa). The villain is completely bad-ass and just by looking at this guy you know he's something.Check this movie out if you enjoyed Blade, you will not be disappointed.9/10",Blade II

One of the most impressive qualities of the original was the soundtrack. In the sequel, it's a really bad taste. The only spot of light was the great song ""I Against I"" in the end titles which just makes you wondering why wasn't it made as the theme song.",Blade II

It was bloody good :P The combat scenes where amazing and the story was amazingly catchingBut still i had 2 problems with this movie The first big fighting, where the messengers visited Blade at his place sometimes it just looked way to computer animated. The second who the f*** are all these guys in black(mostly in the ending scene) are they vampires or some lunatic humans ??????but still thumbs up for Blade 2Ps. From dusk till dawn 2 sucked very BIGtime",Blade II
360,Lenny Bitterman,Sucks!,7,28 March 2002,"I saw this movie last sunday, 2 days after the premier, and is really stupid. I mean, I like the first movie, ""Blade"" have a lot of good fighting, good specials effects, it was fun and I know that the plot wasn't really elaborate, but it worked. Here the plot is so stupid you wont believe it. I don't understand why they have to bring back the character of Whistler, he was great on the first one, but in that movie he died, he commit suicide, leave it dead!!! And if they can bring a vampire back to normal, like they did with Whistler, why not do it with all the vampires????, why kill them???, this was a big plot hole. Scud was a great replacement for Whistler, why make him a traitor????, you really think that Blade is so stupid that is going to leave a traitor working for him for 2 years???, thats so dumb. I guy here said that they should use a big lamp to kill all the reapers in the tunnel, that was the most smart idea, why not do it?????, why use those stupid grenades, and if those grenades worked on reapers and vampires that means that Reinhardt and Nyssa must died too, not only get burned.Another thing that in this movies wasn't fully use was the father-son thing between the really old vampire and the reaper leader, it was a good idea, but the totally blow it. The reapers make up and special effects where great they have a good point there, and the fight where cool too, but the movie sucks.I'am a fun of Guillermo del Toro since ""Mimic"" and ""Devil's Backbone"", he is quite a good director, but here it looks like he get paid and he don't care. Some parts look like ""Nosferatus"" especially the reapers look, I think that that is the directors contributions to the film (If you watched ""Mimic"" you will know that he love ""Nosferatus"") but thats really it",Blade II
361,m99gallows,"It's a white knuckle cracking, head slicing, runaway locomotive. Review by Tim Bradstreet",9,22 March 2002,"Hat's off to Del Toro. Blade 2 left me gasping for breath and wanting more. Don't delude yourself. Del Toro did not set out to make Citizen Kane. Blade 2 may be a bit  short on story but the plot is diabolical and the action almost never stops. It's full of horrific images that are like a grizzly kind of  fine art. The Reapers are both nasty as hell  and yet horribly tragic.  When you are not looking at lush images of  Vampire warriors you are watching them and Blade performing a balletic and crisply choreographed tour de force of violence. Ash flying, bones splintering, bodies twisting. It is like a hyper live action comic book that hit's you like a punch in the throat. From the ghastly sewers beneath Prague to the underground lair of the ancient Vampire lord, the sets blend high tech Vampire technology and centuries old gothic architecture which makes for some stunning eye candy. The colors are lush in their limited pallet, sodium yellows, ambers, greys, greens and subdued blues. There is more to this film than meets the eye on a first viewing. It's horror/action yes, no doubt about it. But it's anything but  a one dimensional vision.  In my opinion it ranks as one of the best comic book movies ever. Is it for everybody? Certainly not. but if the above overview appeals to you, this is your movie. These are my feelings and impressions of the film, to tell more would be to spoil this wonderful danse macabre. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",Blade II

369,brucechimp,not very good,4,3 April 2002,"Went to see Blade 2 last night.  It was average.  It seems that most of the reasons why I liked the first film - brainless action, not much plot etc - were the exact same reasons why I didn't really like the sequel.  The first 20 minutes or so were good.  The Vampire Ninjas were ace. And Luke Goss was awesome as the main baddie.  But apart from that it was just generally a bit poor. The middle section in particular was just plain boring.Like the reason people loved the martial arts in say, Crouching Tiger., was cause you could SEE what was going on.  Blade 2 is full of stupid jump cuts and post-Matrix slow motion, so you end up not having a clue what's going on.And I hate the way in films like this when the good guys have to team up with the bad guys, the bad guys suddenly stop doing whatever it was that made them bad in the first place.  I mean the 'Bloodpack', did they even bite anyone at all? No sir. They just beat people up all the time - totally at odds with all the other vampires in this film. They're supposed to be VAMPIRES, yet they don't come across like that at all.  They didn't even have pointy teeth half the time.  They were like some half arsed 'Dirty Dozen' or worse still the outlaws from Alien Resurrection - the tough one, the mouthy one, the girl, the leader etc - all bickering and posturing with the 'good guy' (Blade).Then they went down in the sewers with their special armour on and it all got a bit too 'Aliens' for me.

Hence we get very little that's new in Blade II, save, perhaps, for the new (and impressive) Reaper strain of vampire.But, if you dug the original, there's plenty more to float yer boat this go around: gallons of O.T.T gore, bone-crunching violence and Snipes's agreeably cool-as-ice, bad-ass superhero, all backed up (natch!) by that incessantly thumping techno muzak.Del Toro is undoubtedly a greater visual stylist than Norrington, the first part's helmer, and you could argue that there's (slightly) more story, but this is still unashamedly one for the popcorn crowd and over-exciteable young men that still think lots of leather and lots of gunplay is 'Way coooooooool, dude!'

Though at times, the obvious computer graphics seemed out of place and unnecessary, they were breathtaking.  Blade's finesse and charm are far from lost or replaced by cheesy and corny lines with this action-packed sequel.  From start to finish, this movie did not fall into the trap of creating an extension of what was before, but instead broke itself off into its own entity that must be recognized with.

Characters die and you just don't care, because they were just 2 dimensional characatures, even Blade himself has no real personality in this movie! I laughed out loud at some of the terrible dialogue. I had the feeling I was watching a Troma movie with a budget. All this is a real shame, because the first film while comic booky was entertaining.

Visually, you can't ask for anything more from this movie...from the great camerawork of the fighting sequences, the nice CGI of the vampires disintegrating, and the gruesome-ness of the monsters mouths and innards...they definitely put in a lot of effort with it, and it was totally worth it. Maybe too much for little kiddies, but if u're an action fan, this is a must see",Blade II
376,greengeek_85,Surprisingly Exhilarating,9,6 April 2002,"What can I say about this movie, other than...stunned silence.  I loved the first Blade movie, the cast, the effects, and the way the characters was brought to life.  Luke Gross was my favorite suprise.  From the trailers I believed that the lead villain in this would be more of a monster physically with no psychological twists.(Stephen 'Dwarf' made up for dimminutiveness in performance) The character of Nomak starts as an unlabeled creature and at times becomes the one you find yourself cheering for.  His character is special effects laden but is performance is great fun to watch, and he seems to really enjoy being bad and exacting his revenge.  I liked the bloodpack but something was a bit neo-stereotypical about the mouthy skinhead leader (played devilishly by Ron Pearlman, this guy owns the screen when he's present.)and the clan of hardly spoken warriors, they reinvent the stereotype that we have all seen.  The individual look for each member was very defining and added a zest to the screen, especially the character of Lighthammer, who's face is highly detailed with hentai-style tattoos.($5 he has or will be a Vin Diesel stunt double) Now lets move on the the reason this movie isn't called the adventures of Whistler & Scud...Wesley Snipes.  I gaurantee he had fun making this because it oozes out of his performance.  His one-liners are heard more often and spoken with more enthusiasm, and his action sequences are jacked up through the roof.  One thing I liked is he smiled a lot more.  Not in a cheesy way, but he is an emotionally damaged character with eyes that could burn through you like UV, when he's not wearing his glasses, but when he smiles or riffs on somebody his exhuberance is very humanizing and brings this tragedy-ridden superhero down to earth for a moment. I thought the movie was excellent, it had humor, eye candy, and suprisingly a plot that came together nicely in the end.  I will not compare it to the original because they are both a hell of a ride, Blade's continuing quest stays entertaining throughout both movies, so I say watch 'em both, don't compare them to each other, just enjoy, cause that's why they were made.",Blade II
377,bigoakland,Total excitement...,10,29 March 2002,This sequal is typical that it is not as good as the first but it still rocks.  I enjoyed the action scenes.  The music was nice and a added compliment.  When you attend this movie remember that MATRIX should not be your expectation to judge.  Many people have asked me how it compares. The action is different but based off the same idea.  Can not wait for Blade 3,Blade II

The only thing that could possibly be worse than the acting was the actual content of the film (blood, guts, more blood, guts).

379,gregorxiv,Boring.,5,12 May 2002,"This movie is full of action and pseudo-horror. The action itself may be well performed and the horror at least well meant, but the fact that there is nothing else beside it makes the movie such a boring one. Furthermore it is full of silly scenes of senseless violence that have been so idiotically exaggerated that I almost started to laugh (Which seemed to be their purpose; While on the other hand nobody in the cinema even snickered) . But in the end it was pity that I felt for this meaningless piece of a movie. It tried to be exciting, it tried to be shocking but having a plot mostly consisting of holes was meant to fail.",Blade II

If so, you've come to the right place. Cool vampire fight scenes, decent action movie dialogue (all you watch for are the one-liners, anyway). Did I mention...vampires?

383,cureton,Doesn't hold a candle to the first one.,6,8 April 2002,"Blade 2 was only a bad movie riding the money-making coattails of its predecessor.  Blade was a fresh attitude and look on the vampire race. Blade 2 was only a chance to see more vampire violence.  Yes, the fight scenes were pretty cool, but the CGI was really bad in places.  And while vampires are supposed to move faster than humans, the speeded up fight scenes just looked hokey.  The one-liners were stupid and out of place. The professional wrestling moves in the fight scenes were only vaguely amusing and entirely out of place.  And I'll not even mention the emotionless, flat, and again out of place attempt at romance.  I like Wesley Snipes, I like the Blade character, I like vampires.  Go see this movie if you're looking for an unrealistic (even for a vampire movie) string of fight scenes.  It's good in that respect.  Just let all your brain cells take the night off and go see Blade 2.  Then you can enjoy this movie.",Blade II

Wesley Snipes is very good as the Blade character and pulls it off well. Some of the concepts were good, like the bloodpack and dna splicing to create reapers, however the bloodpack fails in many regards. Their internal squabbling with Blade is one storyline thumb down; as well two of the bloodpack earlier on in the movie have a big fight scene with Blade and they are super hero like. However, for the rest of the movie, they don't display any of those super hero like talents. They along with the rest of the bloodpack, simply act very unspecial like and are used like extras waiting their turn to be killed.Overall it is a good but somewhat lacking movie 7/10.",Blade II

Great Grphics if gory. (Reaper Autopsy) The music could have been better, especially when the original reaper broke into the Vampire complex, and when Blade rose from the pool of Blood.(There should Have been some Kick-Ass Music) All in all Blade II, personally gets an 8.5.",Blade II
388,akshay_kumar20,Don't Bash this please!! It hurts!!,9,27 August 2008,"Another great action movie facing humiliation in this feminized society. Its really depressing to see such disheartening comments. People who are complaining about this movie being too gory, they have no idea what the word ""gore"" means. Now honestly, if u don't like Wesley Snipes, action movies, violence and blood, why did u choose Blade II? Does the cover of the DVD or the movie posters ever claimed itself to be a chick-flick. I can tell u what the problem is and why people hate this movie. They go to see this movie or rent this movie with an expectation of some movie like ""Spiderman"" where everything is soapy and romantic and the lead character engages in action as if he is doing a favor to this world. Instead, what they get is a tough and no nonsense Anti-hero who means business right from the start. He is not there to fool around with some dumb chick. He never shows too much emotions or any emotion for that matter. He is stone-cold always with a straight face. He has no love interest with anyone, no engaging in tiring dialouge conversation. The dialouge that Wesley Snipes is given matches his characters perfectly, for example, ""Keep ur friends close, keep ur enemies closer."" Just what u expect when a man is surrounded with enemies. Thats what this movie portrayed so brilliantly. He is simply here to kick some vampire as*!!! And boy!! Wesley Snipes is God when it comes to hand to hand combat and sword fights. The director deliberately kept things simple and the story is moved forward with the action sequences. So, in a nutshell, if u r in a mood to check out some unbelievable, over the top, yet well done action scenes, with a lot of blood and violence then this is the movie for u. Otherwise visit the next section in the DVD store which says ""Brain Damaging Chick Flicks""!!! Leave this movie for the fans.",Blade II
389,thefrontlineofall,Superior Sequel To the original.,10,8 September 2002,"Blade 2 is what Empire Strikes back is to Star Wars. A superior follow up that not only surpasses that original in every way but improves on what the first film lacks. It's scarier, bloodier, and a lot more fun. It's also a tragic and deeply moving character piece that really does really sets the mood in its right context.  Wesley Snipes is better here than in the first film, and Luke Goss is menacing as the main reaper, and their final confrontation is not only a crowd pleaser but has to be one of the most brutal cinematic brawls ever put in modern film. If you are looking for a great time, get Blade 2. Can't wait for Blade 3.",Blade II
390,lkbrown,Definitely different than the first...,8,4 October 2002,"Overall B2 is a good movie, some of the C.G. effects were not very polished, hence the far away camera angles.

Lessons learned should make B3 even better or they should stop while they are ahead.",Blade II
391,fitzebwoy,Disapointing sequel to an Amazing original.,4,7 February 2003,"READ ONLY IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILM. MINOR SPOILERS. For all the things that the film-makers got right on Blade 2 it does sadly fall short of hitting the mark. The amazing visuals and sound (I watched this for the first time on DVD with a DTS soundtrack) are a credit to those who put them together, especially some of the CGI assisted fight scenes.The biggest problem is the lack of thought put into the story. Supposedly the new 'Reapers' are very deadly and Blade and the team discover that they can be destroyed by UV light. As the first film had large UV torches you would expect the same or even bigger one's as this is the only weakness?? No. The team choose to have the smallest UV lamps avaliable! Maybe they wanted a challenge! There are so many plot holes it's unbeliveable. Two big ones are how one of the vampires managed to get bitten by a reaper but not change for over 6 hours and that the Vampire family are very confident that Jared/The Reaper won't be able to find them when they are at home. Surely he would know where they are as he was one of the family and used to live there.It seems that a structured plot has been put second to a visual treat. And a visual treat it is. One note for the fight scenes: It rather clear that Snipes isn't the fastest fighter on his feet when they have wide shots of him fighting the masked vampires who deliver him a message. Knowing this fact, why did they make him move very fast during the CGI parts? It goves away what's real and what isn't. Either slow down the CGI or teach Snipes to dance fasterOverall: Not awful but seems dumbed down too much",Blade II
392,nikolasbelmont,"Topnotch action, great entertainment.",10,15 August 2004,"I would like to express my bewilderment towards people who do not enjoy, or even like, the action genre, yet choose to see these movies just so they can criticize them for their shallow plot lines and general brainlessness. Moreover, it greatly annoys and perplexes me that these people then use their ""expertise"" to rate these movies poorly, and thus enforce the impression that we are, in fact, dealing with a lousy piece of movie-making, when the actual truth is that these people prefer films of completely different genres. It should be a no-brainer that if the only movies you can appreciate fall into the category of films such as ""Vertigo"", ""Citizen Kane"" and the like, you're not going to have fun watching ""Blade II"". But then, you should know that, and not spend your hard-earned money on simple entertainment such as this! When one rates films such as ""Blade"", ""Blade II"", ""Van Helsing"", ""Bloodsport"", ""Kickboxer"" etc., one should consider how they perform in their own respective subcategory, that is, entertainment! It is neither appropriate nor is it productive to place these films on the same line with ""artistic movies"" because they simply weren't made to serve the same purpose; when one watches ""Yojimbo"", Kurosawa's masterpiece, for example, one needs to concentrate on the film fully to truly experience it. This rule does not apply to pure entertainment, because the general idea is that one can check one's brain at the counter and simply enjoy the ride; I can think of few pieces of work that provide the setting for action as efficiently as the presentation of Blade II does. After this, a rather lengthy (but desperately necessary) foreword, I will now look at this film and consider its merits against other movies in this subcategory of films called ""action/entertainment"". In ""Blade 2"" the protagonist, Blade (Wesley Snipes), finds himself up against a new, deadly adversary and, needless to say, there's a lot of topnotch action in store for the entertainment-junkie. In terms of the visual style of the film, ""Blade 2"" fares even better than its predecessor; with its dark and stylistic presentation, this movie certainly is a treat for the eyes. In fact, it is hard to come up with any flaws as far as the presentation goes, because audiovisually this film is brilliant! Wesley's performance, can be summarized into one word; bravo! - he manages to be even more convincing with his one-liners than he was in the first movie, and certainly delivers in the action department as well! All in all, well worth your time and your money...that is, if you enjoy action films!!-Nikolas Belmont",Blade II

Ron Perlman was a sensation...He truly made me hate him! and last but of course not least...Blade himself..truly perfection...Every thing about his portrayal was perfect. The tattoo's, the hair, the shades and of course the car. Kris Kristofferson was a major treat as well..And what CAN one say about Scud.. He totally tricked me out..dirt bag that he was..The woman who played Nissa was fabulous! She is gorgeous and I was kind of hoping that she would live and stay with Blade. There was one or two foul words that didn't need to be included. Hollywood writers: you don't need to go over the top in that area..kids would be allowed to watch far more if the language content were a bit better.Being the most vulgar and crude does not make you the winner, it just makes you the most vulgar and crude.",Blade II

When it comes to kill the mutated creature that came from another vampire he is the man for the job. When he needs the blood he jumps in and starts kicking butt. I recommend that all people own this movie and watch it every day for the rest of their lives and live by it. It is the best movie of all time to where I would make it my last wish to see Wesley Snipes in full costume. There is a line between good movie and great movie and this movie was so great that I almost peed my pants. Then the third came out and then i nearly pooped my pants.,Blade II

A little less empasis on story than in the original Blade, but the action is stepped up several notches.  Wesley Snipes is fantastic as Blade, as are the rest of the cast in their roles.  Ron Pearlman is a particular standout as one of the ""Blood Pact"" vampies.  There's also an element of dark comedy here, which helps to keep the gore from laying in too heavy. :)Bring on Blade III!",Blade II
399,grottoboy40,One Vampire Film That Doesn't Suck,8,23 March 2002,"Blade II starts off with a bang and never lets up for the complete 2 hours it is on the screen, and you can't ask for much more then that from a comic book adapted, vampire action flick.The film is better than its predecessor in many areas and weaker than it in others, but the pros far out weigh the cons in this case.  This is one of those rare sequels that manages to better itself upon the original overall, but doesn't forget where it came from in doing so.Guillermo del Toro's direction is well done, and he allows the film to develop its own distinctive look and feel much like he did in his previous film Mimic'.  At times it may seem as if the gore is a little over the top, but isn't that the entire point of a movie like this?  He also knows how to film an action sequence, shying away from the hyper editing techniques that have infiltrated so many action movies these days.  If there is to be a sequel, as is almost assured, I can only hope that he once again at the helm.Snipes delves a little deeper into the character this time as well, and injects a nice sense of humor into the mix at just the appropriate times, mostly consisting of constant barbs with the vampire Reinhardt, masterly played by character actor Ron Pearlman.  Unlike the first movie in which Blade's character is all doom, gloom, and kick ass, we get to see another side of him.  Snipes seems more comfortable in the character, and is able to better portray a conflicted soul, even adding a bit of warmth to his leather clad exterior.One thing that can ruin a film like this though is the absence of a good villain, and here Blade II does not miss it's target.  The mutated vampires known as Reapers(imagine Nosferatu with a steam shovel for a mouth and you are fairly close) in the film are one of the better and original film villians in recent memory.  They are totally unrelenting and evil, exactly what a film like this needs and a major improvement over the main villian from the last film, which was one of the first film's drawbacks.Having said earlier that the film starts off with the action right away and never lets up, I will say that this is the film's major weakness as well.  I was impressed though at how well del Toro was able to establish fairly good character development for the major players in the movie at a breakneck pace.Sure the film is silly and has a few plotholes.  Sure the film doesn't have a really complicated, enthralling plot.  But the film delivers what it promises, a great comic book adapted, vampire action flick.  And if that is what you are wanting to see this weekend, you can't go wrong here.8 out of 10",Blade II

402,VangelisVoltaireValdemar,A lot of fun.,8,24 March 2002,"Blade II isn't a cinematic masterpiece by any means, but it's certainly a fun film worth checking out.  The plot is somewhat convoluted but the action in the film can't be beat.  Blade II compares favorably to the original and actually has more action and even has some funny one-liners.  The film also seemed to be more gruesome and the reapers were almost scary at some parts of the film.The action in Blade II seemed to be mostly based upon Jujitsu and Pro-wrestling.  Some of the action sequences were improved via the use of CGI and resulted in some cool and impossible moves such as the elbow drop off the wall in the final Blade/Nomak fight.I can't recommend Blade II to somebody who wants to see a revolutionary and realistic film with an amazing story, but I strongly recommend this film to anybody who wishes to see a cool film with a lot of great action.  I give the film 8/10.",Blade II

Yes the CGI was ropey, though only once in my opinion - I mean a totally fake blade in front of the lights, does Wesley need to be seen Crouching Tiger Style? I think not... Ha aha it was great all the same.Really I can't fault the film but I like to be balanced. And who would have guessed that was Luke Goss under there - maybe he's found his calling - ""When will I, will I be famous?"" ring any bells...?Mr Del Toro, fantastic, very very slick. And finally yet another sun glasses moment. Gotta run, need to find that plastic sword in the attic...",Blade II
404,Sebastian_C,Definitely worth watching!,8,23 March 2002,"﻿This film went above and beyond my expectations for a sequel. I watched the movie on the principle that Blade was so amazing, but to be honest, I wasn't expecting much. I was wrong.This film, like most action movies, is undenyably fun to watch. It is not however like most action movies- Wesley Snipes is in rare form, both in the attitude of the character he portrays and is physically at his best. Director Guillermo Del Toro is at an all time high, especially when stacked next to ""Mimic"". Some may criticise this movie for it's terribly unrealistic fighting scenes. This, however, is not a fair criticism since the action sequences in question are between supernatural creatures- anything is possible. The final virtue in this movie worth noting is the ending- similar to the first, it ended very well.
Problems with the film? The gore was perhaps a tad excessive at times, and there was a plot hole.Overall, a solid 7.5/10",Blade II

Sure there's a few scenes in part 2 that made me went ""OOOH and AHHH"" (cause of the wicked FX), but that's about it. I expected to see the mean, don't give a crap about anybody, Blade. But instead i had to see a caring and happy Blade. Bleh i don't know what i'm talking about anymore, anyway good movie. Worth $12 CDN and a ID Check?? Um... tough",Blade II
414,novicius,Martial Arts + Swordplay + Gunplay = Solid Sequel,8,23 March 2002,"Just a quick note here: I am a cheeseball.I dig Blade, and not just because he drives a mean-as-hell primer black Charger (for that, I *love* him ).Back in '98, I remember wondering if the first movie ""Blade"" was going to be as dull as ""Money Train"" or ""Drop Zone"" -- but hey, he drove a cool car, so it can't be all bad, right? Well, watching it I was pleasantly surprised to find myself guiltily enjoying it, rap music and all (and let me tell ya, I *despise* rap music).Fast forward four years later and I'm watching previews to ""Blade 2"". I'm looking at the absolute over-the-top stunts, vampires in body armor, and bad bad-ass puns being dropped, and I'm thinking to myself, ""Heh, I bet this will suck worse than 'Highlander 2'"". But hey, he's still got that bad-ass black B-body Mopar, right? How bad can it be?Well, let me just say that I am extraordinarily surprised and pleased to report that ""Blade 2"", while graphic and at times gory, is a great thrill ride -- just flat-out fun. Snipes shows he's still got the moves (man, does that guy even have a stunt double?), and the director Guillermo del Toro raised himself in my eyes after directing the somewhat predictable movie ""Mimic"".The fight scenes are not only fast, sharp displays of martial mastery and acrobatic artistry, but there are a *lot* of 'em. There's plenty of gunplay, swordplay, with extra helpings of fist- and foot-play, too. Capping off all of this excellent Eastern fighting fu is a bit of the egregious West that caused the audience that I was with to bust out and cheer (and I clapped with them -- damn me to redneck hell!).While weak plot-twists do funk up the pacing a little bit, the cast soldiers on through with straight faces -- but let's be frank here: this is not Saving Private Ryan. If you want Academy-level performances and story, go check out E.T., it opened this weekend also.If, however, you want some *serious* don't-mess-with-me vibe to go with your put-a-boot-in-someone's-ass appetite, I can't think of another movie out anytime soon that will come close to satiating your thirst, as it were.Blade is a baaad, bad man...novicius -",Blade II

Not only are there more/better fight scenes, the plot of the film actually improved (unlike Mission Impossible-->MI 2). Depsite my great feelings of this film, if you felt that Blade was slightly to violent or bloody, I suggest that you steer clear of this film.",Blade II
416,donkeykong92,FTL Vamps,6,24 March 2002,"I liked Blade 1, and I know sequals are usually weaker than the original so I wasn't expecting as much from this film.  And it was worse than I thought. The fight scenes were good, the plot was shaky, reminded me of Vampire Jurassic Park, but the part that got me was the complete character stupidity.   Spoiler....  When the characters say, only UV Light will kill them, then why not just have Blade walk through the tunnels with big UV lights strapped to his body?  The Vamps were told to cover up, so they do, EXCEPT FOR THEIR HEADS!!!!!!  Why couldn't they use the same uniform they used to go into Blade's hideout and use big huge UV lights???  Sorry, I can accept some character stupidity but when the characters themselves say UV lights can kill them, then they use tiny little lights and 10 second delay bombs, please, that's insulting to me.  And did anyone else notice that when the UV grenade bomb went off in the tunnel, that the main female vamp either saw the light coming, or heard the explosion of the light bombs and DODGED THE LIGHT????   I understand vamps are fast, but she was able to move FASTER THAN THE LIGHT???  Just too silly.  One cool thing, the preview for Jason X. Did it remind anyone else of Leprechaun in Space?",Blade II

418,nicksteier,Set your standards low and you'll be impressed,6,24 March 2002,"I can't say I was disappointed in this film- my expectations were low at best.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie, but sequels to these types of movies are motivated by money, and are traditionally best left unmade. The story was fairly solid, but like so many trashy vampire movies as of late (i.e. ""Queen of the Damned,"" the 'worst-movie-I've-ever-seen-save-Battlefield Earth ""John Carpenter's Vampires"") it focused on action, mindlessness, and gore rather than character development and/or plot.The correlation between the original ""Blade"" and the sequel is shaky, but they at least make an attempt to bridge them together with an opening monologue (these never usually work- this was no exception) and several flashbacks.  Surprisingly, the flashbacks actually add flavor, especially if it's been a while since you've seen the first movie.The sound was solid, both musically and effects-wise, but the visual effects appear as if they were done on some college kid's Macintosh: they looked pretty much like one of those Jeff Goldblum-endorsed home movies.  The supernatural-like abilities, such as quick swordplay, towering jumps, and kicks that knocked the opponents back 10 meters, were incredibly cheesy at best.  A big disappointment compared with the quality of the effects in ""Blade.There were some highlights however.  Kris Kristofferson was miraculously decent, not so much in his portrayal of Whistler as in his overall acting ability.  But I guess anything is an improvement from the 'zero' of the first movie.  Wesley Snipes proves that Blade is his character and nobody else's.  The surprise was in the appearance of Danny John-Jules (the memorable ""Cat"" in TV's ""Red Dwarf"" series)- his first big screen appearance since ""Lock, Stock...""  It's cool to hear him with his accent.  And no one plays a cocky a**hole like Ron Perlman, and he doesn't fail in this role.These high points were quickly absolved however with the ""elbow drop from the top ropes"" scene near the end of the film.  This scene was probably elaborated with the fact that the film opened with a preview for ""The Scorpion King.""  Nonetheless, it ruined it for me.  If you're into the WWF, it'll probably make you go ""whoah"" like you did in 3rd grade when that sort of crap might have been cool.If you're in to these types of flicks, you'll be entertained; like I said, it was better than ""Queen of the Damned.""  Heck, if you go in with the lowest possible expectations you might even be impressed.",Blade II

421,h_klohn,Great Movie! Lots of action!,10,26 March 2002,"Alright I have been waiting a long time to see this movie and i finally did. If you like action movies, you will love this one. From the opening scene till the closing credits every minute is action packed. This movie is the best sequel i have ever seen since ""The Empire Strikes Back"".If you do not like vampires, blood guts and gore, or killing then you will hate this movie. I found one the films best attributes was that you didnt even have to see te first one to understand it. The story of the first one is explained in the credits.The movie also has a very cool look to it and dark lighting is used throughout the film with the exception of ""explosions"" of lights to kill vampires. The movie was very well written in my mind and was quite entertaining. If your looking to be entertained it is defiantly worth the 10 bucks. Go see it!",Blade II
422,E-we,Kick-ass action! It's groovy baby!,10,25 March 2002,"This is a splendid peace of art action movie. Even though the script might be a litle lame, the special-fx and the stunts make this irellevant. If you even looked at Blade you will love Blade II!",Blade II
423,Blue_Eyez,Auchuitz was more humane,1,28 March 2002,"Let's face it, after the first ten minuites of the movie, ther was nothing new.  They had already exhauasted every visual effect that they had lined up.  The first ten minuits were like the entire rest of the movie.  It was horrible and inhumane.  In the first movie you saw vampires go up in flames from a distance.  This was a full 360 degree shot around a body being encased in flames, and then turing into hardened ashes of a skeleton gently glowing with embers.  It might as well have been a body that was stuffed in a Nazi oven, and this was ""cool"". It was horrific.  I am not condeming violent movies.  The ""Die Hard"" Trilogy is one of my favories, and I never hesitate to see action/horror films, but this particular film was gruesome, and grotesque.",Blade II

Its fast and non stop action will keep you captured through out the films length, never pausing long enough for you to get bored at any time. Luke Goss (from 80s boy band Bros) makes a suprise and worth while appearance as Nomak. The CGI is sometimes a little weak and the plot is a bit rubbish but enjoy the film for what it is, it's 2 hours of non stop entertainment, it doesnt pretend to be a classic.",Blade II
426,saschabooker84,Wow! Better or worse than the original?,10,30 March 2002,"I saw this movie just a few minutes ago....Personally, I thought it was better than the original. I like the director (Guillermo del Toro) far more than Stephen Norrington (the director of the first part). Also, the fight scenes were longer, more violent (with is, in such kinds of movies, a better thing) and better choreographed.The acting was not superb, but what do you expect of an action/horror movie? Ron Perlman was surprisingly good! Wesley Snipes as Blade was of course again the coolest of them all. From this movie on, ""Blade"" can be a symbol for coolness!The directing was very good, especially the camerashots and the fight scenes. I gave it a 10, because ""Blade II"" has everything you wanted in a brilliant horror/action/gore movie. The plot was better then the first one, but still had some big plotholes.Go see this movie! It´s worth it!!!! c-ya",Blade II

This is one of those sequels that makes the series just ""that much better"".  I'm talking about T2, Aliens, Empire Strikes Back and maybe one or two others out there.  I liked the first Blade.  I knew I'd like the second one more (just from the praise it was getting).  What I did not know was how MUCH more I'd like the second one.  This was one of the best movies I'd seen in many moons.  For me, I can say that in the past ten or eleven years only The Matrix (before the hype wore it thin) could stand toe to toe with Blade II for pure popcorn excitement.",Blade II

434,may076,"Awful, pretentious and silly",2,24 December 2002,"Having rented Blade II, me and my friend both agreed after it was over: This was bloody awful! I had rather high expectations upon renting the movie, I was certainly in the mood for an action movie - but after watching Blade II, the need for action was no more there.A truly awful movie, which reminded me more of a videogame than a serious movie. The musical score immediately made me associate to XBOX games like Splinter Cell, and the feeling of the movie was just the same. Exagerrated special effects, high-tempo hand-to-hand combat and all that jazz. Impressive? Nope. The computer effects might have been fancy looking for some, but to me they just looked silly. Too many computer-animated scenes. And the fights? My god, talk about overkill. Sure, fighting scenes can be really entertaining from time to time, but in this movie.. my God, they were so over-elaborated that they simply stunk.Wesley Snipes is no great actor, and he knows it. However, it easily becomes a bit ridiculous when all he does is drop one-liners and try to look cool in his sunglasses. If I want that kind of stuff, I'll much rather go rent a Schwartzenegger movie. Thank you.",Blade II
435,Dark_Force_Crow666,My Personal Favorite Movie Yet,10,9 February 2003,"A really fun action packed movie! The only problem was the copy of ""The Matrix"" & ""The One"" style moves which when Blade did it, it stretched his body out, in a bad way, like he was elongated.One thing I liked about it was it was fast paced & pretty forward (I HATE THINKING!) I also liked how they used horror type ideas & instead of making it at all scary they made it action packed so it was a total conversion from scary to suspence. Suspence is good. I give it an 8.0",Blade II
436,vjlgerv,Almost!!!,7,24 November 2009,"Blade nears vampirifection. Blade II could have been that impressive too, if the limping Whistler did not flee away from savage Reinhardt, all the guards and high security systems to help his protégé free, which is hard to swallow and screw up the movie which was so good so far. Blade should have been helped by Nyssa instead whose live he just saved twice, or Scud role should have been a little more extended. Another thing that really irks in the closing of this movie in this sequel is the thrashing that Blade gets from the half vampire killer and half failed Damaskinos experience, Nomack! In the case of Frost, in the first movie we understand that 'The Magra' has been awaken after the blood rituals and sacrifice of the pure bloods, including the unwilling contribution of Blade himself. But not the sick Nomack, it does not make sense really: when he should have delivered Nomack the death dance, Blade gets the worst beating of all the three movies, which is again counter flow to the movie. I think they should have made the most of the confusion that the daughter of Damaskinos was going through at that very moment: that is the turmoil from the growing gratitude & appreciation she started to feel for Eric her savior though her established enemy and the fresh discovery of her father's betrayal and mercilessness towards his own flesh & blood. Of course, the movie would have been fifteen minutes or so longer but Blade escape would have make sense with the movie flow so far, which like I said was as captivating as the first one. But, sadly they made a mess with that very part of the movie and we the Blade fans we have to make with our disappointments. Some viewers blame it on Leonor Varela, Nyssa, but i think she plays her role very well and never infringes on Blade authority like Nomack, but brings the necessary contrast without excessiveness to the plot.",Blade II

438,richard_hayden,style of substance wins again... gah!,2,10 October 2003,"Okay, so the original Blade was a highly entertaining film. Not great by any stretch of the imagination, but nevertheless enjoyable.Blade 2 is not.No wonder the movie is about vampires, you can tell because it really sucks. (My apologies for this terrible pun... I couldn't resist).I have forgotten how many times now I have hoped and prayed that such sequels fulfil their obligations and our desires to be thrilled and entertained, only to wind up leaving the cinema disappointed, dejected and depressed that you have irretrievably lost another two hours of your life.Blade 2 is an example of Capitalism at its worst. You can see how the producers thought about it: Blade made us a shedload of cash, lets make another!Okay, I think you're getting a pretty clear idea of how I stand on this. So lets expose something of the movie-making frailty that Blade 2 embodies....Pretty much any scene, by itself captures something of the essence of the first film (and tortures it). No, thats harsh. The scenes individually are okay. Some pretty spectacular fight-scenes, well choreographed and generally well conceived. The trouble comes when one tries to view the film as a continuous narrative. It's as if the film was written by about 7 different script-writers, kept in separate rooms, and not allowed to communicate with each other.Plot-developments and devices used in one scene, are not carried over to the next, exposing poor continuity and one begins to see the movie for what it actually is: A series of disconnected fight scenes which begin to look more and more like a particularly violent hour on MTV.The film has one redeeming feature which I was quite surprised to discover: Luke Goss played his part superbly, stealing each scene, and making Blade look like a lunk. Which is essentially what he is. (I'm looking forward to seeing what Luke does next....)All in all Blade 2 is another classic example of lowest-common denominator movie-making. I've had more fun extracting bee-stings.A shame, because I love vampires. But I hate Blade 2.",Blade II
439,mr-s_saunders,Quick Review of Bladde II,7,24 January 2012,"Right, this is my first IMDb review, I hope you enjoy it. Blade II has been sat nestled into my DVD collection for a few weeks now, so, I thought it was about time I put it on. Now I know the film was released in 2002 so I'm a little late to watching the sequel to Blade, a film I thoroughly enjoyed. I found that at first the obviously low-budget special effects started to put me off, but then realised being 2002, the graphics weren't going to rival James Cameron's ""Avatar"" and that I wasn't watching for CGI brilliance, but instead for a bit of an action thrill, and for this, Blade II didn't fail to deliver. Wesley Snipes bringing action fight-scene after fight-scene. Shortly into the film Blade is contacted to help the ""Bloodpack"" a group of vampires who have spent years training to defeat Blade. Each member of the Bloodpack fits a different action group stereotype, which when they meet the all have animosity towards Blade. The story following their meet and the plot twists throughout the film are nothing spectacular, but like the special effects, I don't always watch action films for the gripping story telling abilities. The only problem I truly found with Blade II was Norman Reedus's character ""Scud"" constantly playing on the cliché of his character as a the cocky stoner who spent the time since Whistler had been taken helping Blade out, and getting a little to proud of what he's been doing. Some of the gadgets he's created seem quite good but, he still doesn't take over the general bad-ass character that Kris Kristofferson portrays as Whistler. Altogether, I think if you've not seen Blade II you should defiantly think about giving it a watch.",Blade II

442,fanplastica,Seriously lacking something?,4,4 March 2005,"Well....what can I say about this one? A real let-down of a movie....what I would expect of a sequel which is upsetting considering just how excellent the first movie was. The special effects were excellent, as ever, but the acting seemed rather apathetic and the story was somehow flimsy. It left me cold, lacking the original thrust and 'Matrix' style techno feel of Blade. Such a shame when a change of director completely changes the feel of a theme. Luckily I stuck with it and was more than pleasantly surprised by Trinity....a most excellent movie with the best comedy lines that I've heard in a long time. I await the fourth with bated breath....",Blade II
443,jamesbeeching_1,The Best Of The Bunch,9,3 November 2006,"Blade (1998) will without doubt be remembered for that awesome opening sequence in the 'Old Meat Factory' club with New Order pumping furiously out of the sound system. This was an opener which epitomises the unadulterated satisfaction of watching Blade in action.For me though, Blade II (2002) is the pick of the bunch. Special effects were now fully realised, the story line was definitely appropriate and there were some classy one liners from Blade (Wesley Snipes) and co. Such a shame then that Blade: Trinity (2004), seemed to think that the whole film was based on these as the main form of entertainment. This contributed towards the downfall of the final Blade film which for many including myself, was easily the least satisfying of the trilogy. How did they get it so wrong? I will let it rest one day.In all, Blade II is an excellent sequel, hitting all the right notes, full of action, atmosphere, and an excellent soundtrack, which leaves you with total viewer satisfaction, even if you have seen it before.

As it is a sequel the film creators knew (apparently) they couldn't have the same success, as Blade 1 was almost perfect, they turned to more characters, new enemies, a different storyline and a new feeling overall. It worked great. The sequel is not better than the original, but it's close. And for a sequel this is saying a lot. After all we have three great actors: Wesley Snipes, Kris Krisstoferson and Ron Pearlman. There's action, great visual effects and an awesome soundtrack. What more could you want from a sequel. There are just two things that REALLY bother me: 1) near the end of the movie, i don't quite remember, but i think Ron Pearlman's character was shooting with a rifle at Whistler and sparks appeared on the metal rails. This is simply laughable. How come NONE of those pellets hit Whistler? I know it's a movie but come on... 2) few moments later when Whistler throws Blade's sunglasses to him. Blade catches them perfectly. That's another moment for 10-year-old children to be happy about saying: 'Wow, maaan, look at how Blade caught his glasses, maaaan! So cool!' Besides these two moments i find this movie to be one of those REALLY successful sequels. 8/10 is a fair mark as far as i'm concern._RaziBG",Blade II

Every studio making comic book movies need to take a lesson from this movie. Great hero, great villain and Proof that that a movie can be dark without being depressing and more importantly Proof that a movie can be great fun without ever being silly (looking at you Marvel) Definite Classic! It's almost funny how well received this movie is. I recall seeing a documentary (it may have been on the DVD) where the director said something along the lines that they had nothing to go on and was pretty much making things up as the movie progressed. Turned out Stephen Norrington did a very good job. Also, I was a bit disappointed knowing that most of the Blade action wasn't Wesley, but his stunt double.
