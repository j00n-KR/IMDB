0,MartinHafer,A terrific film but probably NOT for all audiences!,9,10 August 2011,"I will be the first to acknowledge that although this is a terrific film, it will certainly NOT appeal to everyone. When I watched it with my wife, she was pretty disgusted by the plot (it is pretty adult and pretty creepy) but I wasn't. I was actually fascinated how the film violated many of the unwritten rules of film--especially the amazingly non-traditional ending.The film concerns a group of city folk who head to the Appalachian wilderness to hunt and canoe. Unfortunately, a group of man-rapin' hillbilly trash attack--and the group members are forced to take the law into their own hands. This makes for a very creepy film (don't even get me started about Ned Beatty's big scene) as well as a suspenseful one--very suspenseful.Overall, the film has a lot going for it--a terrific soundtrack, a 100% original story and an ending that just blew me away! Well worth seeing...if you can take the very adult plot.",Deliverance
1,bkoganbing,An Unforgettable Rafting Vacation,9,11 April 2011,"Watching Deliverance tonight put me in mind of the great Elia Kazan film The Wild River which was about the Tennessee Valley Authority building a dam that would bury a certain island under water in the middle of the Tennessee River. On that island was a clan that was headed by Jo Van Fleet. In the end all they could do was move and Van Fleet die as the water swallowed up their homes and way of life.The same thing is happening in Deliverance as four executives from Atlanta decide go on a fishing trip one last time two a river that's about to overflow its banks when a dam is being built. A whole town and a way of life is to be summarily wiped out and the locals aren't taking to kindly to city folks even they're from Atlanta and talk kind of like they do. These people might as well be from Mars. In fact in Georgia a certain governor named Gene Talmadge encouraged that kind of division with his county unit rule so that one had to get a majority of counties including the hillbilly ones in order to gain state office. The poor white trash that dominated in these counties had a stranglehold on the politics of Georgia for a generation and a half.The four vacationers, Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox get put through all kinds of hell by some of the locals when out on the river. It gets good and personal and draw your own conclusions there. In the end it's a fight for survival.Director John Boorman wisely chose to opt for realism in telling this savage tale. He shot Deliverance on location in the wilds of rural Georgia and used some of the real population as extras to give it a proper flavor. The four leads all perform well and Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty made great big screen debuts that insured both long careers.And there's that Dueling Banjos theme which is actually a guitar and a banjo and once heard will reverberate forever.",Deliverance
2,Leofwine_draca,"And still it shocks and disturbs you, even to this day",10,17 January 2011,"I first saw DELIVERANCE during my teenage years, which is around fifteen years ago. The only thing I could remember about the film were two scenes: one involving a duel between an inbred kid on a banjo and a guy with a guitar, and the other you can guess. I knew the film was considered to be a classic by many, but I was interested to see whether it held up at all in the light of modern cinema.It does, and then some.This is astonishing, ahead-of-its-time film-making and quite possibly the first man vs. nature movie. Since then, our screens have been deluged with endless backpackers/hikers/teenagers on a camping trip get lost in the woods with psycho rednecks for company-type movies, but DELIVERANCE is, as far as I know, the first and best of this cycle (although there are many other low budget gems, like the 1977 film RITUALS).The movie begins deceptively ordinary, with a group of guys going on a canoeing weekend and bantering together. Not a great deal happens until the infamous, still shocking sequence, which is all about power and degradation and still leaves a deeply unpleasant impact on the unassuming viewer. From this second in, the tension is riveted up and the film becomes chilling, disturbing, and to my mind, utterly frightening. As director, Boorman is at the peak of his game, shooting his rugged locales with an expertly eerie eye and making excellent decisions during the storytelling (I loved the uncertainty surrounding the fate of a central character).Four well-known actors were picked for the film and boy, do they give fine turns. Burt Reynolds is the typical stock macho guy he's well known for playing, but he gives him warmth and a likability that shines through despite his hard-ass, egotistical behaviour. Ned Beatty starts out as a rather unlikeable chap, but our opinion of him changes once he undergoes a terrible ordeal and he becomes the most sympathetic in the film. Ronny Cox (best known as the bad guy from ROBOCOP) is the straight, out of his element guy, and Jon Voight is the film's hero – a man who must delve inside himself to rediscover his primal instincts.The film is superbly shot throughout, the sense of menace is overwhelming, the plot is thoroughly engaging and the twists and turns always surprising. The ending is full of a different type of suspense and doesn't disappoint either, while Voight gives what I consider to be his best turn as the ordinary guy who becomes a hero. A quite wonderful movie.",Deliverance
3,SnoopyStyle,Two iconic scenes,8,30 December 2014,"The Cahulawassee River in Northern Georgia is being dammed for its electricity angering some of its residents. Four Atlanta city boys, leader Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds), Ed Gentry (Jon Voight), condescending Bobby Trippe (Ned Beatty) and banjo playing Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox), decide to take a canoe trip before that happens. The group gets separated. One canoe with Bobby and Ed gets stop by two locals who then abuse them. Lewis kills one of the rapist with his bow but the other gets away. Lewis is unwilling to go to the local police with a hostile jury. The men continue on their journey while fearing retribution from any hillbilly locals.This has two of the most iconic movie scenes ever. The banjo scene is fun. The kid is creepy looking and very memorable. The scene sets up the movie perfectly with a sense of foreboding. The squeal-like-a-pig scene is just disturbing. It was unwatchable the first time I saw it. The movie is uncomfortable, gritty and raw. This is not a fun thriller.",Deliverance
4,Hitchcoc,Taking Us Where We Shouldn't Be,9,30 April 1999,"This is a movie that makes the idea of threat as thick and tangible as anything ever done.  I feel sad for the people who find the opening sequence of this film boring.  The sequence when the guys drop off their cars and find themselves in alien territory ranks in suspense with the greatest films ever produced.  Ned Beatty begins by insulting one of the hillbillies who puts him in his place with a cold, ""You don't know what you're talkin' about.""  Then comes the ""Dueling Banjo"" sequence where the very talented guitarist, Ronny Cox, is totally done in by that boy. That grotesque, inbred creature, who is in his element, even if they are not.  The last human they see as they move away is this confused looking urchin, watching them, that puppylike puzzlement.  There is also the beautiful (at the beginning) river, where the men paddle their way to what they see as paradise but don't recognize the venomous serpent whose back they are riding on.It's too bad that the first thing everyone thinks of is the sodomy scene. This was unsettling, but necessary, to show the enemy at his disgusting worst.  But there is so much more to this movie.  After the hillbilly is killed, the river becomes the archtypical path to salvation and the road to death.  After all the events of the disposing of the body, the further threats to their existence, the terror continues.  I think the most frightening part of this movie comes after they return to get their cars. Because the river is being rerouted, a cemetery has to be moved, the bodies removed. This is what they have come to. The sheriff is on to them.  They are emotionally wrecked.  The scene as they sit with the locals and eat their dinner, is so full of tension and despair.  Even though they are saved they will never be saved.  As I walked out of Sunday afternoon matinee of this movie I couldn't form words to talk to my friends.  This movie isn't for everyone's tastes, but it certainly is as gripping as anything I have ever seen. Performances are wonderful.  It's too bad Ned Beatty is so sensitive about this because I found his character magnificent.   I've never cared much for Burt Reynolds, but this is perfect casting.  John Voight can show fear like no-one I know; sometimes I wish he could show other emotions.  It's really surprising that none of the cast received an Oscar nomination.  And then there are those mountain men.  Where did they come from?",Deliverance
5,classicsoncall,"""Sometimes you have to lose yourself before you can find anything.""",9,19 August 2012,"I didn't go to very many new releases in the Seventies, and those I did see were usually driven by media buzz. Many of them managed to push the envelope in some way that made them controversial for the era. There was ""Joe"" (nudity and casual drug use), ""Little Big Man"" (portrayal of gay characters), and ""Looking For Mr. Goodbar"" (promiscuous sex). You only needed to see ""Deliverance"" one time to be affected by it forever. No amount of time can pass that will allow you to forget it's most memorable scenes - Dueling Banjos, THAT scene with Ned Beatty, Drew's horrific drowning and the dislocated arm, and finally Ed's nightmare hand coming up out of the water of the newly formed lake.I just watched the film again and the passage of time has not diminished it's forceful impact. The picture has a unique ability to put you in a canoe right alongside it's principal players and force one to react to the events on screen as a participant. It sets up all sorts of moral dilemmas regarding a reaction to Lewis's (Burt Reynolds) shooting of the mountain man, the hiding of the body, and of course the forcible rape of Bobby (Beatty). The reactions of the four principals run the gamut of emotions, and it's an uncomfortable prospect to determine which of the adventurers one identifies with most.The way director Boorman works with nature also needs to be commended. The rapids scene in which the men capsize and fight for their life is extremely well staged and is executed flawlessly. On the matter of Drew's (Ronny Cox) death, the picture sets up a myriad of conflicting opinions on how he fell into the river, leading to a unique topic of discussion all by itself. Personally, I've come to consider that he simply blacked out over his participation in the hiding of the mountain man's body, although the idea of suicide crossed my mind as well. The suspicion of a gunshot was a variable to add another layer of complexity to the men's plight, all occurring in rapid succession to make their situation all the more bewildering. This whole sequence was very finely crafted.There's another aspect of the picture worth mentioning as well, that being the unlikely manner in which Ed (Jon Voight) becomes the leader of the survivors after Lewis's injury. Recall that earlier scene in which Ed has difficulty in bearing down on a deer with his bow and arrow. This sets up the later scene in which he must find the fortitude to shoot the mountain man before he himself is killed. When I first saw the picture back in the day, it immediately brought to mind a similar scene in ""Straw Dogs"" (another groundbreaking film for it's use of violence) in which Dustin Hoffman's character agonized over shooting a bird, then wiping the blood off his hands in an effort to cleanse himself of an awful deed. Of course, Hoffman goes on a rampage to close out that story to protect his wife and property. Similarly, though to a lesser degree, Voight's character calls upon his remaining wits and strength to save the remainder of his party.There's one thing though that I would have changed in the story to make the ending more powerful. In Ed's nightmare, Drew's hand comes up out of the water and Ed wakes up in a cold sweat. I would have preferred an ending in which that actually occurred, thereby adding one more element of ambiguity to the story whereby the potential for discovering Drew's body along with the two dead hillbillies is left an open question. Even so, there's still enough here to marvel at in terms of conflict and suspense. It's a film worth watching for all of it's discomfort.",Deliverance
6,gavin6942,A Classic,8,25 February 2015,"Intent on seeing the Cahulawassee River before it is turned into one huge lake, outdoor fanatic Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds) takes his friends on a river-rafting trip they will never forget into the dangerous American back-country.This film is a classic and needs no praise from me. The ""Dueling Banjos"" song and the ""squeal like a pig"" scenes are part of popular culture, even for those who have never seen the film. Indeed, they were something i was well aware of before seeing it the first time. But, once put in context, the film goes above and beyond its notoriety.Fans of the film with an interest in its development absolutely need to listen to the audio commentary. Some commentaries are better than others, and this is among the best ever recorded. Great stories, explanations of how production works... how casting was done, and the need to keep the budget low. Brilliant.",Deliverance
7,lee_eisenberg,It's a jungle out there!,10,16 September 2005,"With our urban decay becoming prominent in the early '70s, there had to be at least one movie about bringing out man's inner beast. There were two famous ones: ""Strawdogs"" and ""Deliverance"". When they were released, there were complaints that they were glorifying machismo (I didn't interpret them as such). But anyway, the latter has Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Ed (Jon Voight), Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Drew (Ronny Cox) going on a canoing trip that turns into a nightmare. You may have heard the famous line about squealing like a pig (I prefer not to describe it here). Anyway, after watching ""Deliverance"", you may decide to think twice if ever you plan to do something in the wilderness.",Deliverance
8,jboothmillard,Deliverance,7,17 March 2008,"I tried this film twice and only got past about 15 minutes, and when I decided to give the whole film a try, I suppose it is a must see. Basically four city men: Ed Gentry (Golden Globe nominated Jon Voight), Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds), Bobby Trippe (Ned Beatty) and Drew Ballinger (Total Recall's Ronny Cox) are hoping for a great adventure canoeing down the river. It starts quite well when they have some excitement getting down a waterfall of rocks, but this fun is to change. Soon enough Ed and Bobby are encountered by two hillbillies, (Bill McKinney, the normal one, and Herbert 'Cowboy' Coward, the toothless one) and at gun point are abused. When Lewis and Drew eventually arrive they kill the normal one, while the toothless one gets away, and they know they have to bury the body. They then carry on down the river, and Drew is the next victim, possibly because of the toothless guy who has a gun above them, and Leiws gets a wound. Ed goes up above to kill him, and the three men also find Drew's body. In the end, they do find civilisation, but obviously all of them won't forget (and have nightmares about) the incidents. Also starring James Dickey (the film is based on his novel, and he himself writes the screenplay) as Sheriff Bullard, Ed Ramey as Old Man, Billy Redden as Lonnie, Seamon Glass as First Griner, Randall Deal as Second Griner, Lewis Crone as First Deputy and Ken Keener as Second Deputy. The two scenes that stick out in my mind from this film are the disturbing male rape scene, but more prominently the Golden Globe nominated ""Duelling Banjos"" scene just after the opening credits. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for John Boorman (also nominated the Golden Globe), Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Burt Reynolds was number 97 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 15 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",Deliverance
9,ccthemovieman-1,'70s Shock And Sleaze,3,22 March 2007,"A big-name cast, nice photography, a great theme song (dueling banjos) and yet, so disgusting a movie that when I watched it on video 25 years after first seeing it upon its release in the theater in '72 that I tossed this VHS tape in the garbage can halfway through.When fat-boy ""Bobby Trippe"" (Ned Beatty) gets literally screwed up the you-know-what in the woods by some perverted hillbilly, who also forces him to squeal like a pig during the sex.....that was enough for me. What kind of people enjoy seeing stuff like that? That, and over a dozen abuses of the Lord's name in vain was enough for me at that point. It once again reminded me how sick some of the movies in the early 1970s were. What's really sick was that this film was a hit, at least with the critics who love evil people.The fact that rape scene was done just a couple of years after Hollywood ditched its moral codes probably made this movie more noteworthy than it deserved. Back then, it was a total shock. Nowadays, we've seen a lot worse and that scene wouldn't make this film as famous.Burt Reynolds, the star of the movie, however, is still playing sleazy roles today. Some things never change. At least Jon Voight has gone on to some classier roles and Beatty has proved he has comedic talent as well as being a good dramatic actor. To be fair about it, if ""disturbing"" stories don't bother you, or if you are not titillated by sexual-deviant scenes and just appreciate a film for its acting or its photography or its suspenseful, entertaining story: fine, because this film offers all of the above. It also will leave you emotionally worn out and you certainly will empathize with Voight's character at the end.To me, however, this film may have all the above, plus a fine director in John Boorman (see ""The Emerald Forest""), but I found it just too depressing and sordid. There is a definite audience for depressing stories, but I am not in that group. Also, you have to care about the characters to some degree. I couldn't find myself doing that in here. These guys seemed more annoying than anything else.",Deliverance
10,Tweekums,A pleasant weekend canoeing turns into a nightmare,9,17 July 2017,"Four men from Atlanta, Lewis, Ed, Bobby, and Drew, have decided to canoe along one of the last unspoilt rivers in the state before the entire valley is flooded as part of a hydroelectric scheme. When they get to the place they want to enter the river they pay a couple of locals to drive their cars to the town they are heading to. Once they are on the water in their two canoes they enjoy the wilderness but not for long. The two parties are separated and Ed and Bobby wait on the riverbank; here they encounter a pair of less than friendly mountain men. Ed is tied to a tree and Bobby is brutally raped. As they prepare to assault Ed, Lewis arrives and dispatches one of the assailants with an arrow. The other one escapes. The four friends discuss what to do with the body; Drew things they must inform the authorities but Lewis is convinced that it would be far better just to bury him as they probably wouldn't be believed. When they continue they must pass through some particularly dangerous rapids. One canoe is destroyed and Drew disappears; Ed, who now has a broken leg, is convinced that Drew was shot. Believing that the shooter will pick them off when they move Drew climbs the wall of the gorge and in the morning encounters a man with a rifle. He kills the man but isn't absolutely certain that he had actually being shooting at them. As they approach the end of the journey they must concoct a believable story.This is a famously disturbing story; largely due to the infamous rape scene even after forty five years that is a memorably shocking moment. It isn't the only disturbing moment; when they get on the river everything looks beautiful, totally unspoilt, but soon there are things that are just a little off. After the encounter with the rapist and his friend the tension is much higher; it isn't just the fear of more unfriendly locals. The rapids become more dangerous making it seem as though nature itself doesn't want them on the river. The scenes of the men going through these dangerous situations feels very real; I was not surprised to learn that the cast did their own stunts. The four leads; Burt Reynolds, John Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox, as Lewis, Ed, Bobby, and Drew respectively, do an impressive job making the viewer believe in them and their situation. As things happen to them their characters develop nicely. The supporting cast are impressive too. Overall I'd definitely recommend this classic film but understand that it won't be for everybody.",Deliverance
11,ma-cortes,"John Boorman's disturbing hit movie plenty of thrills , chills and wonderful outdoors",7,8 April 2013,"Good film about a canoe voyage down a dangerous river which starts as a holiday but soon becomes a weekend of sheer terror . Intent on seeing the Cahulawassee River before it's turned into one huge lake, outdoor fanatic Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds) takes his friends (John Voight , Ned Beatty , Ronny Cox) on a river-rafting trip they'll never forget into the risked American back-country filled with rare and violent hillbillies .This interesting picture contains intrigue , action , violence , marvelous landscapes and a strong ecological denounce. This trilling film was based on an exciting novel by James Dickey . At the time this motion picture was rated ¨R¨ for its excessive violence , sex and profanity ; nowadays this dangerous standard is underrated . To minimize costs, the production wasn't insured - and the actors did their own stunts , for instance, Jon Voight actually climbed the cliff and to save costs and add to the realism, local residents were cast in the roles of the hill people. Very good cast as John Boorman discovered both Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty working in theater , neither had substantial film experience previously. The notorious rape scene was filmed in one take, largely at the insistence of Ned Beatty who didn't want to film the scene repeatedly . Billy Redden plays the role of The Banjo Boy , he was hand-picked from his local elementary school, largely due to his ""look"" , his large head, skinny body, odd-shaped eyes and moronic grin , he was discovered by director Tim Burton in 2003 working as a dishwasher . Top-notch acting from John Voight and Burt Reynolds . Author James Dickey gave Burt Reynolds a few days of bow and arrow lessons and by the end, Reynolds was quite accurate and proficient with the weapon . Both Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda turned down the role of ""Lewis"" before it was offered to Burt Reynolds, who took it ; also Donald Sutherland turned down a role in this film because he objected to the violence in the script , he later admitted to regretting that decision . This movie is considered to be the ""breakthrough"" film of Burt Reynolds , it marked his transition from acting and starring , this film reflects the start of the period of Reynolds enormous star power and box-office pulling power, his machismo persona being mixed with a critical recognized serious dramatic performance . Gorgeous cinematography by an excellent cameraman , as John Boorman wanted Vilmos Zsigmond as his director of photography as he had famously filmed the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary ; Boorman reckoned that anyone who had filmed under the threat of Russian tanks and guns would be ideally suited to such an intensive and grueling shoot as Deliverance promised to be. The motion picture was very good shot by John Boorman , though originally, Sam Peckinpah wanted to direct the movie ; when Boorman secured the rights, Peckinpah directed Straw Dogs instead . John is a real professional filmmaking from the 6os , though sparsely scattered and giving various classics . John started as an assistant direction and his friendship with Lee Marvin allowed him to work in Hollywood as ¨Point Blank¨ (1967) and ¨Hell in the Pacific¨ (1968) from where he returned to the UK and directed ¨Leo¨ (1970) , a rare Sci-Fi titled ¨Zardoz¨ (1974) or the ¨failure Exorcist II¨ (1977). His films are without exception among the most exciting visually in the modern cinema . He became famous for Excalibur (1981), the best of them , ¨Emerald forest¨ (1985) with a ecologist denounce included and his autobiographic story ¨Hope and Glory¨ (1987) and which brought him another Academy Award Nomination after ¨Deliverance¨ . Rating : Better than average . Wholesome watching .",Deliverance
12,BA_Harrison,An excellent backwoods horror with an ecological edge.,10,5 August 2010,"Outdoor fanatic Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds) convinces pals Ed (Jon Voight), Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Drew (Ronny Cox) to join him on a canoe trip down the Cahulawassee River, before the area is turned into one enormous lake by the construction of a dam. Their trip turns into a nightmare, however, when Ed and Bobby are assaulted by vicious hillbillies, and the friends are forced to kill to survive.Not only is John Boorman's Deliverance one of the finest examples of back-woods survival horror ever made, it is also an excellent cautionary tale for anyone planning to exploit the great outdoors. Screw with the environment, the film warns, and the environment will screw you right back (most likely in the ass, and without the aid of lube).Deliverance's four suburban adventurers symbolise civilisation itself, and are content to use and abuse the wilderness to their own advantage while they can, but fail to understand the importance and potential danger of the terrain through which they are travelling. Although Lewis and his pals aren't particularly destructive themselves, they do display a lack of concern about the terrible fate awaiting the Cahulawassee River, and show little respect for the area and its inhabitants, bragging about 'beating' the river, and mocking the locals for their simple ways.Conversely, the river and the indigenous folk that inhabit the surrounding hills are representative of nature as a whole, and both have a hand in dishing out savage retribution to those outsiders who dare to mess them about.Unflinching, brutal, tense and exciting, Deliverance is a masterful exercise in storytelling from director Boorman, who achieves a gritty realism through his genuinely untamed locations, bravura performances from the film's incredible leads (who clearly canoe the river's rapids themselves), and the unconventional decision to cast 'locals' as secondary characters. The film also features a couple of iconic moments that have become synonymous with the whole murderous hillbilly backwoods sub genre: the brilliant scene that sees Drew and an inbred youth participating in a musical duel armed with guitar and banjo respectively; and the harrowing rape of poor Bobby by a hillbilly ('Squeal like a pig, boy!'.... Weeeee..... weeeeee!).In fact, my only real criticism of the entire film is a touch of ropey day-for-night photography during Jon Voight's climb up a perilous cliff-face, but this minor technical imperfection ain't going to stop me from awarding maximum marks.",Deliverance
13,moonspinner55,Plays its best cards too soon,5,21 August 2005,"For the first-half, an eerily raw, surrealistic look at a rapids-ride down South that turns tragic for a group of businessmen. Director John Boorman creates scary, ugly tension and appropriate dread, but the thing could've finished at least thirty minutes sooner. There's really nothing to keep the viewer around after the first hour. It's gripping, yes, but it's all atmosphere and exposition(with a long-winded wrap-up and shock climax that is muffed by Boorman). The film has solid performances(even by a swaggering Burt Reynolds, who does manage to create a character, albeit not a complicated one), but I didn't feel much was happening after a certain point and felt the tension eventually flag, giving way to a meandering narrative. ** from ****",Deliverance
14,dbdumonteil,never turn your back on Mother Earth,8,11 July 2011,"One of the most famous works made by John Boorman, Deliverance is also one of the most momentous movies shot in the seventies. Its reputation comes from the fact that the director chose to take the opposite view of how nature was commonly perceived in American cinema. Indeed, many films showed a positive view of it and showcased it as a happy refuge where man could find relief and strength from a stressful civilization. In a way, this is the goal that the four main protagonists in Boorman's film indirectly try to reach. They decide to go down the river in a canoe to go back to their roots and to take advantage of a rural place that is bound to be swallowed up by a dam. At first, Boorman seems to be on their side. The film depicts numerous shots of a gorgeous river and imposing landscapes. Details reinforced by a slow, contemplative rhythm and a discreet editing. Moreover, Drew (Ronny Cox) tries to communicate with a muted peasant through music.But little by little, Boorman reveals to the audience that elements of these beautiful landscapes make nature dangerous and hostile to the four adventurers. One can note down that before the apparition of the two silly peasants, Lewis (Burt Reynolds) had animal instincts in him. After the killing of one of the two men, he chooses to bury the corpse and not to call the police. From this watershed onwards, Boorman manages to create an intense tension that won't subside. On the contrary, it will increase with the other misadventures endured by the four men. None of them will be spared and all of them will keep physical or moral scars from this sad trek. The message conveyed by the filmmaker is clear: man must accept society and his return to nature can only damage his personality. A must see film.",Deliverance
15,Quinoa1984,One of the most amazing films ever made,10,24 April 2001,"Not too many films are as tighteningly frightening and exquisitely exciting as this.  Deliverance tells the story of a quartet of southern men who decide to go on a canoe trip in a hillbilly river.  But then come a series of events that match the Mansons madness.  The squeal scene is almost fokelore at this point, and the two villains, mountain man and toothless man (McKinney and Coward) are two of the most horrifying ones of all time making yankees squirm in they're seats.  The dueling banjo scene is also memorable with Hoyt Pollard (I think) memorably playing the kid plucking the banjo (that song will be stuck in your head for a while).  If the film teaches anything though in it's whirlwind of excellence it's this- 1) make sure to wear your lifevest and 2) DO NOT INBREED!

16,tavm,The late Burt Reynolds did one of his best film performances in Deliverance,10,12 September 2018,"Before I review this movie proper, let me reveal that I previously saw an edited version of this on a WB station in Jacksonville, FL, though I had actually seen part of the rape scene earlier as a clip on ""Later with Bob Costas"" (I can't remember who the guest was that night but I don't think it was anyone from this movie). So now that I've seen this uncensored online, which I decided to do after Burt Reynolds died, I'll just now say: This is a pretty intense film, that's for sure! It starts peaceful enough with Lewis (Reynolds), Ed (Jon Voight), Drew (Ronny Cox), and Bobby (Ned Beatty) going canoeing down the rivers before they experience the excitement of the rapids. But later on, Ed and Bobby encounter a couple of men who have designs on them...That scene that one of those men does to Bobby was indeed quite intense though subsequent events weren't any less effective. This was quite a career move for Reynolds whose previous films weren't as ground breaking as this one was. It proved, once and for all, how fine an actor he really was when he was willing to take chances. I also loved the bluegrass music especially that ""Dueling Banjos"" number at the beginning. Fine direction by John Boorman as well as an excellent screenplay by James Dickey based on his novel. He also appears as the sheriff here. In summary, Deliverance was one of the best films from 1972 and is perhaps one of Burt Reynolds' best performances.",Deliverance
17,Coventry,Nightmarish!!,8,18 January 2004,"Deliverance is the fascinating, haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by James Dickey, turned into a brilliant movie by John Boorman. It's about four businessmen, driven by manhood and macho-behavior, who're spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains. Up there, they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery...poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain-land, completely estranged from all forms of civilisation. All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I've ever seen. Just about everything that happens to these men, you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation. Pure talking cinema, Deliverance is a very important movie as well. John Boorman's best (closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies.

19,hitchcockthelegend,"Brutal, Beautiful and Brilliant.",10,24 September 2009,"Four Atlanta friends - Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Ed (John Voight), Bobby (Ned Beatty), and Drew (Ronny Cox) – decide to canoe down the Cahulawassee River out in the Georgia wilderness. They see it as a test of manliness whilst also wanting to experience this part of nature before the whole valley is flooded over to make way for the upcoming construction of a dam and lake. But the perils of nature are not the only dangerous things in their midst, unfriendly wood folk are about to bring another dimension in terror.Deliverance is one of those films that sometimes suffers by way of reputation. Much like Straw Dogs and 70s films of that type, the hype and promise of unremitting hell often isn't delivered to an expectant modern audience. Which is a shame since Deliverance is one of the finest, glummest, brutalistic and beautiful films of the 1970s.Adapting from James Dickey's novel (screenplay duties here also), British director John Boorman crafts a tough and powerful film of men out of their environment, thus out of their league. As each man sets off initially, it's a test of manhood, but each guy is forced to deconstruct their worth, and it soon becomes more about survival as this deadly adventure proceeds. Boorman, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, has painted a raw and treacherous landscape, unconquered by city slickers but dwelt in by inbreds who don't take kindly to the city folk showing up with their machismo attitudes. From the first point of contact with the strange locals, where Drew goes ""duelling banjos"" with an odd looking child, the film doesn't let up, much like the locals themselves, the film also is remorseless. Some critics over the years have proclaimed that Deliverance is too pretty, mistaking lush physicality as something detracting from the dark thematics at work. Not so, the Chattooga River sequences are electrifying, the rapids scenes (brilliantly filmed with Voight and Reynolds doing real work, and getting real injuries) are merely setting up the unmanning of our ""macho"" guys just around the corner. It's a fabulous and potent piece of ""beauty"". With the four cast leaders absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. In fact there are few better casting decisions ever than that of Reynolds as Lewis, one can only lament that he didn't have more hard edged serious roles in his career.Minor itches exist, metaphors are heavy (Vietnam a 70s staple it seems) while ecological concerns are hinted at without being as prominent as they are in the novel. Surveying the landscape during the opening of the piece, Lewis reflects that man is going to rape this land, rape it, it's stuff like that that is not totally formed, given way to abject horror and survival, Lewis again noting that survival is the name of the game. A game of life and death, where man's primal being means violence may indeed beget violence. Boorman clearly agreed. 10/10",Deliverance
20,Doylenf,Disturbing film stays in the memory years later...,6,4 October 2006,"DELIVERANCE is one of the most chilling stories of the '70s from a novel by James Hickey about four business men who decide to take a camping trip through woods and across a lake before going back to their own civilized turf. What they don't realize is that halfway through their trip they're going to be traumatized by an unfortunate incident involving some hillbilly types who don't cater to strangers that don't belong in the wilderness.The feeling of unease is only gradually developed, although you can tell that something is about to happen that will change the lives of these men and their relationships to one another.JON VOIGT, BURT REYNOLDS, NED BEATTY and RONNIE COX are the four men, ranging from the more machismo to the timid bookkeeper type--at least two of whom you wouldn't want to row across Central Park Lake in a canoe. What happens is an awakening for all of them and a sad fate awaiting one of them.Under John Boorman's direction, it's sometimes hard to watch their ordeal become worse in time and it comes as a relief when the trip from hell is over. Not for the squeamish, nor do I think it's one of the great films of the '70s as a few have said here. It's a dark, disturbing look at men facing their survival in a strange land not far from their own backyards.",Deliverance
21,preppy-3,Very good,8,13 February 2004,"Engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river. They are pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), obnoxious Bobby (Ned Beatty) and nice guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minute are great--there's the incredible dueling banjos sequence, interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobby...and the trip becomes a nightmare.Just unbelievable. The scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place. To be truthful, Beatty's rape has never bothered me--I'm very aware it's being faked despite the good acting. This movie also shows how the characters change--Ed has his pacifism tested, Lewis becomes weak, Bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and Drew tries to keep himself sane. Direction by John Boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely.The acting is mostly good. Voight is just OK in the lead--he's been better. Beatty is also just OK--but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role. Cox is very good especially when things start falling apart. And Reynolds is just superb--one of his best acting jobs EVER! How this wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award escapes me. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are way too believable as the hillbillies.A powerful film--NOT for children. Try to see an uncut version--the TV version is butchered. Also letter-boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images.",Deliverance
22,poolandrews,"""If you hit any rocks don't hit them with your head."" Very disappointing.",5,20 July 2007,"Deliverance is set in the back woods of Georgia as nature survivalist fanatic Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds) wants to canoe down the Cahulawassee river which is going to be flooded & turned into a lake. Lewis along with three friends, Ed Gentry (Jon Voight), Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox) & Bobby Trippe (Ned Beatty) all travel down to the river & intend to canoe to a small town called Aintry at it's end where their cars will be waiting. However while en route Bobby & Ed stop off for a breather & are held at gunpoint by two local psychotic hillbillies (Bill McKinney & Herbert 'Cowboy' Coward) one of whom rapes Bobby up the bum, nice. Luckily Lewis & his trusty bow & arrows come to their rescue as he kills the rapist although the second hillbilly gets away, decisions need to be made as the men have to work out what to do with a dead body & the potential threat of more rapist hillbillies on the way...Produced & directed by John Boorman, originally Sam Peckinpah wanted to direct it but Boorman brought the rights to the novel before he had the chance & made Straw Dogs (1971) instead, & I have to say I was incredibly disappointed by what is regarded as some sort of classic. The script by James Dickey was based on his own novel of the same name & he also has a role in the film as the fat Sheriff at the end, personally I think it's far too slow, it's just too ambiguous & simply not enough happens over it's 110 odd minutes. The thing takes forever to get started, virtually nothing happens for 45 minutes at which point Bobby is made to squeal like a pig while raped in the films most notorious scene but it lasts for a few seconds isn't exploitative enough & not enough emphasis is put on it while after that the rest of the film is just the men canoing down the river before an incredibly long drawn out & throughly unnecessary ending which lasts for about 20 minutes too long. Deliverance might have been watchable if it had a bit of pace & had some sort of twist ending but it doesn't & in the end it isn't. This is an OK way to pass the time & you always have that feeling that something might happen although ultimately it never does. Then there's the scene with Drew just falling out of the canoe, the makers wanted the reasons behind this left to out imaginations but without knowing why he died or how you can't feel anything for him, well I didn't anyway.Director Boorman does alright even if the day-for-night shots are amongst the worst I've ever seen. I think it was a bad decision to completely sideline Lewis from the second half of the film, he was the only decent character in the whole thing until that point & we are left with the dull Ed & the squealing Bobby who gets over being ar*e raped quite quickly. Not much really happens & I never felt they were in that much danger either, as long as they followed the river they would be safe. Apparently Burt Reynolds broke his coccyx going down the rapids when his canoe capsized, now that's suffering for your art. The famous 'duelling banjos' scene (even though one is a guitar) was the very first scene shot & apparently the rest of Deliverance was shot almost entirely in sequence as it would appear on screen, amazing eh? Forget about any violence or gore as this is really rather tame.With a supposed budget of about $2,000,000 the production apparently wasn't insured to cut costs, a somewhat dangerous thing to do since Reynolds broke his leg. Deliverance was shot on the Chattooga River which divided Georgia & South Carolina, amazingly the following year apparently 31 people drowned trying to travel the stretch of river featured in the film, isn't that the stupidest thing you've ever heard? Serves them right I say. Anyway, it's well made with some nice 2:35:1 scope location photography. The acting is strong from a good cast who all went on to achieve success in their own rights.Deliverance was a huge disappointment for me, it's watchable I suppose but it's just too boring & uneventful for me to really like it. I didn't find it exciting, disturbing or thrilling so there you have it, lots of people do seem to like it & that's fine with me but it's not anything I have any great fondness for.",Deliverance

The reputation of Deliverance has painted it as a horror film; the father of the modern ""backwoods brutality"" horror flicks. It's not a horror film, though, at least not in most ways you could define the genre. Only a small part of the film has to do with the attack by the hillbillies.

It was man versus nature and man versus the unnatural. If it wasn't enough that these men had to brave the rushing river, they also had to contend with loco local yokels. I would prefer the untameable river anyday.This movie is probably the most hated movie in Dixieland and it cracks me up. Oh, the movie isn't at all funny, just the thought of rural southerners cursing this movie for its incredibly accurate depiction of them. LOL! I'm only kidding.

An everyman - and therefore the eyes through which we experience the events of the film - he is called upon to find strengths within himself which he does not believe he has, in order that he and his friends might survive.

26,evanston_dad,A Terrifyingly Disturbing Man Against Nature Tale,10,21 May 2007,"""Deliverance"" is the kind of movie that gets in your mind and stays there forever. I will never forget this movie, nor the haunted feeling it left me with after seeing it for the first time.Four men from the city go on a fishing trip somewhere in the wilds of Appalachia, and are attacked by a couple of psychotic hillbillys. The men's vacation quickly turns into a hellish ordeal, and the sense of adventure offered by the challenge of navigating the tricky rapids of a raging river becomes instead a Darwinian lesson in survival of the fittest. This movie is blunt, brutal and intensely affecting. It's a clenched gut of a film; the sour smell of fear and exhaustion that bathes these men by the time the movie is over practically comes wafting from the screen. Jon Voight is the nominal star of the film -- if the movie is about any one of the four men, it's about him. But to single him out is to do a disservice to Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox, all of whom do smashing work and create full-bodied characters in whose lives we become utterly invested.Of course the initial confrontation with the hillbillys and the notorious rape scene are what this movie is remembered for now, but I think in this day of global warming and environmental crisis, it's interesting to re-watch this movie and see how much in tune with environmental issues director John Boorman was when he made it. Through plot exposition, we learn that the river these man are traveling down is being dammed and redirected to make way for development. The men's callous disregard for the natural world comes back to haunt them when the natural world ceases to be a friend and becomes instead an enemy.There are not many films like this one, and certainly few that are as chillingly disturbing.Grade: A+",Deliverance

28,Wuchakk,Disturbing 1972 adventure on the Chattooga River,8,31 December 2016,"Released in 1972 and directed by John Boorman from James Dickey's novel, ""Deliverance"" is an adventure thriller about four guys from the Atlanta area who take a canoe/camping trip in the Georgia wilderness. When they run into a couple of violent hillbillies their fun adventure turns into a disturbing test of survival.I didn't see ""Deliverance"" until almost two decades after its release. I didn't know anything about the film or anyone who had seen it, but it looked like a potentially good adventure story so I finally decided to rent it.The first Act plays out as you would expect, four guys escaping the shackles of urban life enjoying a canoe trip, and then -- WHAM -- Act 2 hits you like a ton of bricks. When I first viewed the movie I wasn't braced for this scene. In fact, it was so disturbing that it pretty much ruined the rest of the picture for me. I watched it until the end but - that scene - left me dazed and detached. Viewing it again recently I was fully braced and was therefore able to appreciate the film.MISCELLANEOUS THOUGHTS: Burt Reynolds is great as the macho protagonist Lewis, but he's largely missing during the third act and epilogue. The unassuming Ed (Jon Voight) takes the reigns as deliverer, with Bobby (Ned Beatty) lending a helping hand.The film was shot on the Chattooga River in NE Georgia, which borders South Carolina. The gorge is located in Tallulah Gorge State Park 15 miles West of Walhalla, SC (you can actually see it via satellite on Google maps). The dilapidated town in the epilogue is Sylva, NC, 45 miles north of the gorge. Needless to say, lush Eastern locations.After the disturbing scene a moral crisis takes place in the remote forest where the four members of the party must vote on a decision. Lewis (Reynolds) and Drew (Ronny Cox) make their cases and the other two must choose. Count me with Lewis. At first glance it would seem that Drew is arguing the side of the wimpy moralist, i.e. contact local law enforcement and allow the courts to settle the matter. Is this the real reason he takes this position or is it simply because he doesn't want to risk becoming an ""accessory to a crime""? Actually, Lewis is no less the moralist -- after all, he makes a moral judgment and unhesitatingly acts -- it's just that he refuses to risk allowing the local authorities and a potential inbred jury (likely related somehow to the hillbillies) twist his just and necessary actions into a crime.Writer James Dickey effectively plays the towering Southern Sheriff in the epilogue.The Deluxe Edition DVD includes an excellent 4-part documentary that runs about 45 minutes. All principle cast members are interviewed, as well as director Boorman and the son of James Dickey. By all accounts Dickey had a forceful personality and intimidating presence. He kept calling the actors by the names of the people they were playing even while not filming. One night in a pub he kept referring to Reynolds as ""Lewis"" from across the room and Burt refused to answer him. Dickey came up to his table and got in his face. Angered, Burt cussed at him and told him to quit calling him Lewis. Dickey paused for a moment and responded, ""That's exactly what Lewis would have said"" and walked away.""Wrong Turn"" (2003) is a modern horror film that, generally speaking, tackles the same subject as ""Deliverance."" The problem with ""Wrong Turn"" is that it's full of horror clichés and cops an unrealistic vibe. Don't get me wrong, it's an entertaining film for what it is but I was never able to buy into the story as a potential reality; hence, I didn't find it horrifying at all. ""Deliverance,"" on the other hand, is totally realistic from beginning to end and is successfully horrifying precisely because it COULD happen.Speaking of realism, Roger Ebert heavily criticized the scene in ""Deliverance"" where Ed (Voight) climbs up the rock gorge, arguing that it was totally unrealistic. Is he serious? He needs to get out more. I'm older than Ed in the film and could climb those rocks fairly easily (I'm not bragging, just pointing out that Ebert's criticism is not valid for anyone who's in remotely decent shape).Also speaking of realism, if you suffer from ADHD and need constant (unrealistic) action scenes and goofy one-liners to maintain your attention, skip this one.Lastly, ""Deliverance"" is about 45 years old and hasn't dated at all. This is a timeless picture.The movie runs 110 minutes.GRADE: A-",Deliverance

I heard Ned no longer talks about the scene, and I can imagine why. I wonder if one day there will be a reboot of Deliverance.

33,JamesHitchcock,A Thriller with Something Worthwhile to Say,8,28 November 2005,"Four middle-class Atlanta citizens travel to a remote, hilly and densely wooded part of Georgia for a canoe trip along the Cahulawassee River before the area is flooded by a dam. The first half-hour or so of the film is peaceful and pastoral in character, with the scenery of the area lovingly photographed, and the friends spend their time hunting, fishing and shooting the white-water rapids on the river. Then the tone of the film abruptly changes when two of the adventurers meet two unfriendly locals. They are threatened at gunpoint, tied up and one of them is subjected to a homosexual rape. Just when it seems that they are about to be killed, they are saved by the arrival of their two companions, who kill one of the mountain men with a bow and arrow and drive off the other.What had started off as an adventure now turns into a nightmare. The four have to try and escape, terrified that the surviving mountain man will return seeking revenge. The river, once their playground, now seems like their prison. The rapids mean that they cannot return upstream, so the only way they can get out is by climbing the steep cliffs of the gorge through which the river passes or by pressing onwards though even more dangerous rapids. (A more recent thriller, ""The River Wild"", has exploited a similar situation).Tensions arise within the group as they quarrel about how best to proceed and whether to report the man's death to the authorities.This was one of a number of films that were made possible by the relaxation in the sixties and seventies of the cinema's strict code of morality but which seemed deeply shocking. What caused the controversy here was not so much the killing (there is less bloodshed than in the average Western, and certainly less than in the average war film) as the scene of the homosexual assault. Until the sixties any direct mention of homosexuality was virtually taboo, and a scene like this one would have been unthinkable. Many of those films seemed ground-breaking then but look very dated today, generally those which were deliberately made as erotica (like the ""Emmanuelle"" series) or for their shock value (like ""Caligula""). Some directors, however, including John Boorman, used the freedom given by the liberalisation of censorship restrictions for serious purposes.In some respects ""Deliverance"" is similar to another controversial film made the previous year, Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"". In that film too there is a clash between urban and rural lifestyles, a confrontation which turns violent as the city-dwellers defend themselves against hostile rustics, and a controversial rape scene. Both Peckinpah and Boorman intended their films to make a statement about violence, and both looked at the subject not from the viewpoint of the original perpetrators but from the viewpoint of victims who themselves resort to violence in retaliation or self-defence. ""Deliverance"", however, is in my view the better film. Whereas the battle between Dustin Hoffman and his attackers in ""Straw Dogs"" always seems implausible, Boorman makes the four men's predicament seem frighteningly real.Another reason why ""Deliverance"" succeeds is the excellent acting of the four principals, especially Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight. This is important because the four main characters are all individualised. Reynolds's character Lewis, self-assured and confident, starts off as the leader of the group, but can be complacent and self-satisfied, underestimating the potential dangers of their situation. He is strongly against to informing the police about the killing, and in this he is opposed by the more liberal Drew who believes in sticking to the letter of the law. Bobby, the victim of the rape, is traumatised by his experience. Voight's character, Ed, is initially reserved and timid, but emerges as the leader after Lewis is injured. At first he is either too compassionate or too timid to kill a deer, but later finds himself capable of killing a man. (Reynolds's performance came as a revelation to me, as previously I had simply regarded him as the mustachioed embodiment of seventies machismo).On one level, ""Deliverance"" is an exciting and very tense thriller (and a very good one as well). There is, however, more to it than that. The film is also about character, a study in leadership, of the changing dynamics within the small group, and of how men react to danger, whether that danger comes from others or from the forces of nature. It touches on themes of the male psyche, of violence in society and of man's relationship to nature. A very good film indeed. 8/10",Deliverance

36,MovieAddict2016,Perfectly directed and led by strong characterizations,10,27 March 2003,"""Deliverance"" is a twisted and stomach-turning tale of four city slickers (Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty) who take a canoe trip outing into hillbilly town. After setting out on a lake and heading downstream, the four men encounter two hillbillies in the woods who tie up Voight to a tree and then sexually assault Beatty.

But their worst nightmares are just around the corner. Soon, the men must fight for their lives to get back to civilization alive.I saw this film at a very young age and almost definitely should not have as the rape scene really disturbed me. I stayed up to watch it late-night on television (an edited version) but I could still tell what was going on, they just cut the nudity.By today's standards the scene might not be as explicit as films such as ""Irreversible"" and ""Baise-Moi"" bu particularly when the hillbilly tells him to ""squeal like a pig,"" it's quite stomach-turning, especially to see at a younger age. When I was older I discussed the film with my father, who isn't much of a film fan. He would not watch it. I remember he told me that he thought the only reason people were still talking about it twenty years later was due to the fact that it had a rape scene. He considered it to be a sick movie that was trying to be controversial and explicit just for the sake of being so.I don't agree. Now that I'm older and have seen the film again through adult eyes I view it as a classic. One, I like it because it is deep, compelling and engaging. The characters are introduced expertly and we get to know them. Two, the whole paranoid and fear of being stranded in the middle of nowhere in an unfamiliar environment is freaky.

Ned Beatty in a role that will define his career. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight in seriously dramatic and warped reality.Tough guy drama that goes beyond the edge of safety and into an uncomfortable zone.

38,Red-Barracuda,A place where cultures clash...horrendously,10,27 December 2013,"This is an adaption of a great novel by James Dickey. It's pretty close to the book as well, probably as a result of Dickey writing the screenplay. John Boorman takes up the director's duties and needs to be given considerable credit for ensuring the feel of the novel is kept intact, while still making sure this is a very cinematic experience. The movie is about what happens when men are pushed simultaneously to the extreme of their psychological and the physical limits. Although it is about a whole lot more than that. It also is about town vs. country, where civilisation ends. And it is underpinned by the social situation where an impoverished people are forced out of their homeland to make way for a dam to service the city folks. With this in mind, it's unsurprising that it contrasts the city people's rape of the mountain peoples land, with the physical rape carried out in the story by the mountain men on the city slickers.The setting of Deliverance is one of its chief strengths. The Georgia backwoods location and the hillbillies who populate it make for an unforgettable backdrop to the narrative. The wild beauty of the landscape and river contrasts jarringly with the poverty stricken locals. The hillbillies are extremely authentic, making their later aggression all the more frightening of course. The story itself is pretty simple. Four city men go on a canoe trip down a river before a dam floods the entire area. Half-way down one of the party is assaulted by hillbillies, leading to the killing of one of the assailants. This situation leads to a moral dilemma and ultimately more violence.The cast is excellent. Burt Reynolds plays Lewis, the alpha male of the group, Jon Voight is Ed the meek everyman, Ned Beatty is Bobby, the slightly obnoxious one and Ronny Cox is Drew, the man of principle. The way that the story pans out results in strong characters becoming weak and vice-versa. The men are left forever changed by their experiences on this river trip. The violence is ugly and realistic throughout; and when Ed finally kills the murderous hillbilly on the cliff it's achieved in a very clumsy manner and is pretty far removed from typical film violence. The horror of the story is contrasted quite a bit by the beauty of the natural world where it happens. The cinematography is excellent throughout and the acoustic music has an organic feel. The latter, of course, peaks early on in the unforgettable duelling banjos sequence which remains one of the best moments from any movie, not only just Deliverance. The inbred boy Lonnie is a character that is impossible to forget once seen and the scene as a whole is an inspired way that music is used to highlight the culture clash about to happen. Later, the horrendous scene on the riverbank, illustrates the extremity of this cultural clash. It's a testament to the power of Deliverance that both the phrases 'duelling banjos' and 'squeal like a pig' have seeped into our culture to the extent that virtually everyone knows what they refer to.A film of ideas and contrasts, and one that captures a people and place that probably don't exist anymore, Deliverance is a bona fide classic that deserves its reputation.",Deliverance
39,Rainey-Dawn,An All Time Favorite!,10,25 June 2014,"One of my all time favorite films that was made the year I was born! I did not get to see Deliverance until I was older - I'm not sure of my age, maybe 10 or 11? But I've seen it a few times since then and will watch it again in the future I'm sure.The whole movie is eerily creepy - and not just the one famous pig scene. This group of men went through more hell than they ever bargained for. All they wanted was a nice all-guy camping trip together: to relax, maybe drink a few beers, canoe down the river and enjoy themselves. It turned out to be the most brutal and unforgettable experience of their lives.The movie falls just shy of being a horror film - but not by much - it is that spooky, terrifying! If you have not seen this movie and want to view it - I recommend you proceed with caution! It is graphic with some violence and rape. But it is one of the most exciting thrillers you will ever see! 10/10",Deliverance

41,sddavis63,One Powerful Scene Does Not Save A Movie,3,11 May 2010,"Aside from one scene (almost in the exact middle of the movie) there really isn't much to this movie. Four city guys go on a canoe trip in the wilderness, and they run into trouble - real trouble as it turns out. It has a few things going for it. There's some spectacular scenery (it was shot on location in the Appalachian Mountains of northern Georgia), it has a pretty decent cast, headed by Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds and backed up by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox, and it has ""the scene"" - a brutal, painful to watch scene that I'll speak more of in a moment. Still, I found this movie lacking. Almost an hour goes by with nothing really happening except watching these four guys on a canoe trip. Then, after ""the scene,"" while they're a more desperate bunch, it's largely the guys on the canoe trip again. Yes, there's a bit of suspense, and we don't really know what happened to Drew (Cox). The guys think they're being stalked (understandably) but that wasn't entirely clear. No doubt, though, they believed they were fighting for their lives. Still, just as the movie opens with little fanfare - little to draw the viewer in - it essentially fizzles out at the end.And yet, there was ""the scene"" - that brutal, painful scene I spoke of. After beaching their canoe, Bobby and Ed (Beatty and Voight) encounter two obviously inbred mountain men. The whole ""inbred mountain men"" thing was introduced at the beginning of the movie; it's a bit too cliché for me. The difference between these and other depictions of ""inbred mountain men"" is that these guys weren't cannibals - they were rapists. After tying Ed to a tree, they humiliate Bobby in every way possible - verbally, physically and ultimately sexually by raping him. I have to agree that this scene is disturbingly powerful and ugly even in 2010. By the standards of 1972 it's actually quite shocking that a scene of a man raping another man would even have been included.The problem here is that one scene - as powerful as it may be - and a bit of suspense afterward isn't enough to make up for an almost completely uneventful opening hour that does make you wonder if anything of interest is ever going to happen.",Deliverance
42,thesar-2,Deliver Them from Eerie Guys,8,14 June 2013,"Real. Raw. Revenge. Reynolds.Those four R's were my first impressions of my first viewing of this almost 41-year-old cult hit, Deliverance.Backing up, I had actually tried to watch this movie many years ago, and was put off on such disgusting actions from the backwoods hillbillies. I knowI should've finished the movie because, even though the movie was decent up to that point, it gets a lot more real and interesting following the rape.Whoa, I think I need to back up a bit more. The ""rape"" isn't really a spoiler – and even if it was, again, this is over 40-year-old, so shame on you! – but it is the entire basis of this movie. Four men set out on a rafting adventure weekend by following one of the men's need for excitement/risk.Now, these aren't the greatest guys in the world. This is made very clear in the first act of Deliverance. So much so, I didn't know if I would make it through this viewing as well. I mean, who could I cling to when I hate these dudes? But, I did carry on and during their rafting fun, two of the men get attacked, bound and ultimately raped.In comes to the rescue is another of the men and a decades-before-its-time, male-Thelma & Louise scenario ensues. Now, in these types of movies and adventures, we – me, included – think we'd know how to handle the challenges and cat & mouse situations or even feel how the movies should fictionalize the heroics of the film's protagonists. With that said, I thought it would be more exciting for our ""heroes"" to do this or that and yet, the end result, or the film at hand, is much more fulfillingand real.Surprisingly, the movie doesn't feel all that dated, and is interesting and suspenseful to the end. I really had a great time here, despite the subject matter and highly recommend it.Also, I simply couldn't get that banjo music out of my head for a very long time Creeeeepy!",Deliverance
43,Robert_duder,"The ""disturbing"" classic didn't really hit home",7,21 April 2007,"It took me a long time to get around to this pop culture classic that I had heard so much about. The infamous reputation of Deliverance preceded it and perhaps was too talked about because the film did not live up to it's reputation in my opinion. While decently acted, and with terrific cinematography of the Cahulawassee River the film deals more with the guilt and cover up of friends protecting themselves from a pair of insane mountain men who stalk and harass them. I thought the film would be far more dark, gritty, gory and disturbing and I know it seems as though many people look at me with shock and dismay and say 'are you kidding?' Maybe I'm warped and worn by the modern day gore of shockers and horror films but I didn't find Deliverance all that disturbing. I understand where it was trying to go psychologically but I found Burt Reynolds' more disturbing than any other character and the film was just average over all. I had heard about the sexual 'heinousness' of a particular scene involving Ned Beatty and of course the scene was humiliating for him but far from sexually deviant as the man is killed before he performs any travesties. Overall it was just an average adventure film with a decent story about a horrible experience than the friends work to cover up.Jon Voight plays Ed Gentry, the very soft spoken but strong member of the team. Voight's performance was decent but nothing stand out about it I didn't think. He was in the background most of the time defending Reynolds and never really did anything truly spectacular with the exception of the scene where he scales the rock wall to take out their would-be killer. Burt Reynolds was really the only stand out performance as boisterous, loud, and masculine Lewis Medlock who is the experience of their group. Medlock is firey and almost obsessively compulsive after he is forced to kill a man to save his friend. His performance is one of the best in the film. Ned Beatty plays the weaker and more manipulated Bobby Trippe who finds himself the worst of victims out of all of them. Beatty is very good in the role, especially given his usual comic performances but nothing stand out in his character either. Ronny Cox rounds out the foursome playing the voice of reason Drew Ballinger. A family man who finds himself in a situation he doesn't want to be in and causes him to almost break sanity at one point. Cox is very good and does a good job in his character and it was only unfortunate that he didn't get a bigger role. He also gets to take part in film history by performing the famous 'dueling banjos' scene at the very beginning of the film.I guess the artistic flavor of the film just goes over me. I don't see Deliverance as the dark and torturistic vision that it claims to be in history. I don't understand the guilt and fear that the men feel having killed a man who literally physically stalked and harmed them and was preparing to rape and kill them. No one in their right mind would have accused of them anything more than self protection and preservation. As stated before the story is good and the characters are watchable, I just wasn't blown away or mentally disturbed by the content of this film like so many people claim the film is. Still it is a classic and by right you must see it...the good news is the infamous dueling banjo's is almost right off the bat so you can get the joke any time any one hums the tune. 7/10",Deliverance
44,ElMaruecan82,Nature is what we are put in this world to rise above ...,10,21 April 2011,"It's a fight, it's a masculine fight incarnated by this eternal struggle that men have to endure against nature  it's nature against culture, culture as civilization, this assemblage of whatever rises us above the bestial state. And ""Deliverance"" is about this fight, in three rounds, ending with a split decision.The first round is won by men, those politicians and businessmen who decided to terminate a natural setting for improving the lives of some bourgeois citizens. A beautiful river condemned to become a common lake, for no other specific reason than to assess the almighty power of men on the face of the Earth. This project scandalizes Lewis, Burt Reynolds, who takes his friends to a last canoe ride, to celebrate the swan song of a natural setting. A setting raped by men, but that these men will try to honor with respect, like three civilized men. But this is nature, not civilization, and nature is about survival and doesn't give a damn about respect, honor, or dignity. And the natural setting will become their hellish nightmare, and if men rape nature symbolically, unfortunately, nature doesn't give a damn about symbols Lewis, is the one who enthusiastically embraces the call of the wild, like a fish in water, and the same can't be said for Bobby, Drew and Ed, Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox and Jon Voight as the straight men of a tragicomedy where nature has the good laughs and where Bobby will pay the most humiliating price. These men are so normal, so indeed civilized, that we do feel they will have to face a natural adversary incarnated by this wild river. And the iconic beauty of that film is that nature will be incarnated in its most savage and bestial way, through a population that lived in a world so closed, that it inspired the lowest instincts, starting by the most blasphemous one: incest.It's not surprising that the movie indirectly features incest in its first scene: through the unforgettable hybrid hillbilly who plays one of the most memorable cinematic instrumental duets ever  The 'Duelling Banjos' still resonate in my mind as the hymn announcing a coming battle of men against the elements, against God, nature, give it a name  but the scene is so cheerful, so full of joy and energy that you forget its most important aspect: a warning, a warning about a population where common laws are not respected; after all, isn't the incest, the cardinal sin on which the whole human civilization was based? The first setting is obviously made of doors that open the gates to hell, a hell where there's no God, no rules, except the one of the strongest.And this is how the D of ""Deliverance"" became the epitome of cinematic ""Disturbingness"", because it depicted one of the most difficult scenes to watch but still extremely eloquent about the  ways, bestiality choose to assert its power. The way these hillbillies acted had nothing to do with sexuality, it's a rape yes, but more a disgusting affirmation of power that puts men at the same level of animals, even lower. Animals prove their power by the same act, the hillbilly did, and it's not a coincidence that he wanted him to imitate the sound of an animal during that moment. Nothing sexual, no fantasies, living like an animal is acting like one, and the only way to get rid of this scum, was to ruthlessly kill him. Natural selection, an eye for an eye. At the end of the second round, it's a tie.And to understand the beauty of civilization is to understand its weakness. Despite all the pain, Ed and especially Bobby went through; they were still debating about the gravity of killing. Ed, who couldn't kill a deer, climbed a dangerous cliff to kill the bad guy, but still couldn't shoot him at the crucial moment. Because 'an eye for an eye' is still nature talking and the law is here not to comfort this nature, but to correct it. Lewis asks if someone knows about the laws, this is an important scene, because it means that for these men, killing still means going against their nature, they have to respect some rules and act only in self defense. Nature affects their acts but not their reactions.It's a pity that the film is only remembered as the one which features a male rape. This rape is not gratuitous, it's a powerful and meaningful scene that illustrates our whole fears, as civilized men: meeting nature in its cruelest and less empathetic form. And this is why ""Deliverance"" is one of the greatest thrillers ever produced by the 'New Hollywood' wave (no pun intended), because it explores one of our deepest fears : being men in a hostile environment that wouldn't even care if you were a hopeless child, and encountering the nightmarish incarnations of soulless humans. ""Deliverance"" warns about the death of nature, but also the death of humanity. Both are in danger, and both help each other. Men can still respect nature and win over the elements, and nature can inspire men some instincts that save them in extreme situations. Not a pessimistic film, and what a thriller! And more than a thriller, ""Deliverance"" is just one of the 'great films'. I don't necessarily know what a great movie is, but if I consider Howard Hawks' definition : it's a great film if you can think of three good scenes and no bad ones  well, we have the mountain climbing, the disturbing ""squealing like a pig"" scene, unforgettable, and the sumptuous and exciting 'Duelling Banjos'. The sound of the banjos that immortalized the symbiosis of men in nature and nature in men. Because the relationship between these two fighters can also be made of male camaraderie, and a complementarity that leads from hell to deliverance.",Deliverance
45,g-bodyl,Haunting!,9,27 April 2012,"Deliverance is one of the best movies to come out in the 1970's. I really like this film not only because this movie could end up as a reality for some people, but it possesses what most modern films don't have: character development. The opening scenes and the dueling banjos scenes really told us which personality each of the four main characters have.This movie has a simple storyline. It is about four guys who take a canoe trip down a Georgia river before it is turned into a reservoir.The acting is just brilliant. I can't say anything bad with Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox. They certainly delivered the goods.Of course, I know everyone has heard about the ""abduction"" scene. It is very well-made and would invoke terror into the audiences of the 1970's. That and the dueling banjos scenes were my favorite of this film.Overall, this a very good, haunting, mesmerizing film. I must also mention this has very good cinematography and good camera shots. I rate this film 9/10.",Deliverance
46,CuriosityKilledShawn,Deliver us from evil,7,23 April 1999,"This film is probably notorious, or infamous rather, for one scene only. It's one of those movies that is always followed by a bad impersonation upon the mentioning of the title. Perhaps like Dirty Harry and 'Are you feeling lucky punk?'. I will try to avoid using the line 'Squeal like a pig' in this review, even though I just did. I should also mention that the film is also forever associated with the Duelling Banjos scene with just about every generation. But I must stress that those who often try to be clever by mimicking both these unique, little features have probably never even scene the film.Four naive city boys take a break from playing golf and decide to canoe down the Cahulawassee River before the valley is flooded into a huge reservoir. It's not their territory, but their leader Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds, looking like Steven Seagal's long-lost twin brother) arrogantly assumes that he can deal with any challenge that comes his way. His friends Ed, Bobby and Drew (Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox) reluctantly follow him, despite having their own doubts.The first day of the trip goes fine, but on the second morning Ed and Bobby stop to rest by a small stream. There they are approached by a couple of disgusting mountain men, that are not quite as close to the mutants seen in Wrong Turn but are grotesque nonetheless. Despite their attempts at keeping the peace, the yokels strap Ed to a tree and force him to watch Bobby being raped. Even though I have never witnessed something like this, it's a horribly realistic scene and Ned Beatty does it very well, he must have some guts to do a such a scene in this; his first movie.Lewis shows up in the nick of time and kills one of the yokels but the other escapes. Drew is the only one who thinks that they should take the matters to the police and ends up having a sort of breakdown. In their attempts to escape the scene they crash the canoes and Lewis ends up with a nasty compound fracture. This leaves Ed as the only one capable of hunting down the remaining hillbilly who is preying upon them from the cliff-tops.It's a slow moving film that doesn't focus on the action so much as the horrors taking place in such a tranquil location. John Boorman's widescreen photography beautifully captures the Southern wilderness and comes across as rather haunting without resorting to cheap, slasher movie techniques. Boorman has spent half of his career on a high and the other half languishing in crappiness of Zardoz, Exorcist 2 and the horribly misjudged Excalibur. He has left a lasting impression filmmakers despite his failings.Deliverance is not for everyone and I certainly cannot recommend it to those who are only used to quick-fix MTV movies. But it is still a carefully measured, thought-provoking film.",Deliverance
47,ironhorse_iv,This movie truly delivered. A masterpiece of a thriller.,8,6 June 2017,"It was shaping up to be the perfect weekend for a group of friends from Atlanta. Not only, they get to see the unbelievable natural beauty of the Cahulawassee River before it's turned into one huge lake, they also will get to canoe in it. However, things took a horrible wrong turn in the riverside, as the peaceful natural visit, turn into a deadly game of life or death, when the group find themselves, face to face, with a few unwelcoming locals, mountain men. This is the story of 'Deliverance', a movie that will leave you, with goosebumps. Without spoiling the movie, too much, you would think, a movie like this would stop people, from ever go river-canoeing in the American back-country, ever again. However, surprisingly, this wasn't the case, as the movie had a mostly positive effects on communities in Rabun County, where most of this film was shot. Local sites like Clayton, GA saw an increased in tourism by tens of thousands, just to go river-canoeing. Some tourists even built vacation and second homes around the area's lakes and riverbeds, just take in the beautiful sights. I can see, why, the movie does have gorgeous shots of the location from cinematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond. It even, make me, want to move there, at one time. I doubt the country people, there would complain. For the most part, the majority of locals around there is happy for the film, bringing businesses to their small towns, yet there is others, that still find resentment at how they were portrayed in this movie. I don't blame them. I would, too, be, a bit angry, if my neighborhood was portray as stupid, inbred, rapist, hillbillies. However, I would also be bit cheerful to see money, being pour into my communities, than nothing at all. It's a double edge sword. A Catch 22. Another thing that, probably made the locals, really happy, is the environmental protection message of the film. The opening text, really spells it out, on why author James Dickey was upset, with the lack of conservation in America in the 1970s. Still, it doesn't explain, why, during production of the film, James Dickey showed up inebriated and got into a bitter argument with producer-director John Boorman, for rewritten Dickey's script, when barely anything major was change. In my opinion, the film seem, very accuracy to the source material, but somehow, Dickey didn't see it, that way. It's suck to hear that both men got in a brief fistfight, which cause the director to have a broken nose, and four of his teeth shattered. Thank goodness, the two reconciled before the end of production and became good friends. It even cool to see that Boorman gave Dickey a cameo role as the sheriff. That was pretty nice for him to do, seeing how they hate each other, months earlier. Anyways, the film was a critical success with viewers, even being nominated for awards, despite having a notorious rape scene. Yes, I know, that this is a tough film to praise to anyone, due to the subject matter; and I wrestled with my own feelings for it long after seeing it, but I believe 'Deliverance' is still a movie, worth seeing after all these years, even parts of the film is a bit dated with its depiction of 1970s southerners. After all, it's still is a gripping, absorbing action-adventure film, full of fine actors, whom, for the most part, did one hell of a job, making the nightmarish sequences of the film, seem really intense. As much as I love Burt Reynolds, badass, presence as outdoorsman, Lewis Medlock with him, doing his own stunts. Mad props goes to Jon Voight for similarly doing his own stunts, but also portraying the everyman, Ed Gentry, in this encounter. The struggles of him, having to kill, is, a wonderful depiction, that most people would have, if face, with survival. Also, I have to give credit to Ned Beatty even if his character, was somewhat of a jerk. The viciously targeting and humiliated that the actor has to go, through for his film debut, was courageous. He also almost drown in other scenes. Most actors at the time, would had turn down the role, as a defenseless coward. Likewise, I have to say, Ronny Cox as Drew Ballinger was also good, even if he's not that memorable, outside of the famous ""Dueling Banjos"" moment. Just the sheer fact that both the hillbilly kid, (Billy Redden) & himself made it seem like they can play the banjo, when in truth, they couldn't play a tune, was impressive on its own. Honestly, I don't care, if there is a copyright dispute on how, originally, create the song. All, I know, is that it's one of the best tunes in American Cinema. Even today, when I hear banjoes. I have to think, about padding faster. That's how much of an impressed, that tune, has on people. It has often be looked upon as a philosophical or mythical allegory of man's psychological and grueling physical journey against the unknown, both within the conflicts of man vs man, and man versus nature. Overall: I love that this movie tests the character's personal values & exhibiting the conflict between country & city. I also like how the movie ends with the flooding of the valley. It alludes to the bible, when it comes to the purification and cleansing within of the sins of the world. Only to find out that not all sins can be washed away. It's a very powerful message. I also the movie leave open questions, like whether or not, they did the right thing. Did they kill the right person or not? Did one of them, really got killed? In the end, it's left to the audience to decide. Overall: while, this movie can be slow at times due to pacing. It's one film, worth paddling to. Its need to be seen. It's that damn good.",Deliverance

49,slightlymad22,Burt Should Have Won The Oscar,10,5 October 2019,"I have restarted rewatching all of Burt Reynolds movies in order, and I just watched Deliverance (1972)When Burt Reynolds died, based on the reports, you would think he only made 3 movies. Deliverance, Smokey & The Bandit and Boogie Nights, as they were what was all that seemed to get mentioned in reports and social media posts.Filmed on location along the Chatooga Rivet, with a budget of $1.8 million dollars.
Deliverance is not only one the of the 1970's best movies, it is an absolute classic, a damn near perfect movie. Almost 5 decades later, it still holds up as a challenge to a man's thoughts about survival and his theory of masculinity.It is beautifully filmed, all of the actors are amazing and the score is eerily haunting!!A great movie for me is one that does not end with the credits, but stays with you, and I'm always haunted for a while after watching Deliverance (Joker recently had the same effect) too many movies these das are designed to amuse or entertain for 90 minutes then leave you unmoved, uninvolved and unsatisfied. This one poses deep and moral problems for each of its 4 central characters as from the action. Deliverance does not attempt to answer questions. The right or wrong of what the 4 city boys do is left unresolved.Burt did not bat an eye lid when he was told he would be second billed, and Jon Voight would be paid double what Burt was, and received top billing. For his part, Burt was paid $50,000 (much less than the $26,000 per week he was receiving for the TV show Dan August at the time) for three months work, but he knew what an opportunity this was for his career, which he referred to at the time ""3 steps below actually mattering"" he knew that his performance here, would expose his talent to the world and change his career forever.Look at the scene where Lewis saves the team from the mountain men. He takes command of a dangerous situation and delivers a powerful monologue in the middle of the woods. It is a sensational piece of acting. All of the actors are great, but Burt really rose up and dominated every scene during the first half of the movie.The success of the movie is not all down to Burt of course. The story is compelling and the filmmaking superb, but the key ingredient in Deliverance is Burt Reynolds. I personally think he should have won the Oscar that year.Deliverance was only nominated for 3 Academy Awards. Best Editing, Best Picture and Best Director losing all 3 to Cabret, The Godfather and Bob Fosse respectively.

53,poe426,Backwoods bromance: when Homer met Gomer...,10,2 July 2013,"Before BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN or JEREMIAH'S JOHNSON, there was- DELIVERANCE. Like both BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and JEREMIAH'S JOHNSON, DELIVERANCE is a backwoods bromance that was well ahead of its time. Four city slickers- the ever-so-Butch Burt Reynolds (who was a PLAYGIRL centerfold), Ronnie Cox (who sports the manliest monicker of them all), Ned Beatty, and Jon Voight- head into the mountains lookin' for Love. They find it when they run into some head-huntin' hillbillies, but not before they stop at a roadside zoo and Cox engages in a duet with a cute little in-bred porch monkey. They push on, stroking their way downriver until Beatty and Voight hook up with a couple of good ol' boys looking for a quick shotgun wedding. Beatty and one of the crackers engage in a bit of mountain man foreplay and are just about to consummate their relationship when they experience a bit of Burt Reynolds interruptus. The second cracker, who's tied Voight to a tree (we'll call this one Oddest Tool, because he not only looks like the cannibal necropheliac, but also sports only 5 teeth- 2 in his mouth and 3 in his pocket), parts company with them at this point. Later, he and Voight get together again, whereupon Oddest cries, ""Thou hast cleft my heart in twain!"" (That's from Willie Shakespears's OMELET, by the way.) In all seriousness, though, DELIVERANCE is a powerful piece of work and the performances to a man are award-worthy. The lament of the Burt Reynolds character echoes to this day. From James Dickey's novel: ""The world is easily lost."" Truer words were never spoken.",Deliverance

57,Anonymous_Maxine,"`Whar you goin', city boy!'",10,7 August 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Packed with memorable moments (such as the quote above, immortalized by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four guys who take a trip to the wild woods to go white water rafting and get away from the big city for a while only to find that their fun soon takes a bad turn. This is not a Hollywood film. There are virtually no special effects whatsoever, the setting is extremely realistic, and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made pretty. The city boys look like city boys, and even the tough guy Louis, portrayed with precision by Burt Reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip. This is a perfect example of a what-if film. What if a few friends went river rafting in an area of the woods that none of them were familiar with, and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted for murders that they were forced to commit to save their own lives?There is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with societal and class structure and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. When the four guys arrive in the woods early in the film, they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live out there, and they speak to them as though they are unsure whether they will understand or be able to communicate. This communication block is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene, in which they are trying to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downriver for them. While Drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis is having some difficulty buying the gas, and Bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is. When the boy turns away from Drew, who had offered to shake his hand after their stupendous jam session, Bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks, knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react.
This is the kind of thing that we see in Deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow. This great scene where a lot of fun was had (including the funniest 'redneck dancing' scene until O Brother, Where Art Thou?) ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do around each other. These people are apples and oranges, and they live by completely different rules of life. The people that Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed encounter in the hills grew up separated from modern society and modern laws, and live by the rules of nature, which do not include thou shalt not kill. Confused by their awkward behavior, the four friends set out on the river, hoping for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin.(spoilers) When they are briefly separated from each other and Ed and Bobby run into the hillbillies beside the river who quickly turn unpleasant, the uncertainty about the way that these people live - which was established by the scene above - comes into play to create the most tension during the scene. I think that a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film, namely the assaults and actual murders, takes up a very small amount of screen time but remain some of the most memorable parts of the film. There is no gratuitous violence here, it's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a startlingly powerful effect.
The move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people, and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other. The trip down the rest of the river after the assault, which takes up the majority of the film, delivers some spectacularly effective tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so much happening that you become numb. It is surprisingly effective when we find out that Ed may very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff, and the tension in the film doesn't even let up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river, because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law is missing.This is a very disturbing film, which is a testament to its success, because it's pretty obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people up a little bit. The hillbillies are the human (i.e. more realistic) version of the sub-human rednecks seen in childish but fairly similar films like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, neither of which could possibly ever be compared to a timeless film like Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods, the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and in such a subtle fashion that it's almost like we, as individuals of the audience, are really a fifth member of the team. It's not often that a film is able to come across that way.",Deliverance

True to life characters struggle with dignity and loyalty in this story, when they are put under pressure, losing their last bit of civilized behaviour.You wont feel cheery after watching ""Deliverance"". It is definitely NOT your standard ""fun"" thriller. Hardhitting and gutwrenching at times, sad and repulsive at other moments. There is one particularly repulsive male rape scene that I just cant stand to watch. I skip it, because that particular rape scene is portrayed so accurately and viciously, that even after having watched this movie numerous times I still get sickened by it.The overall feeling of this story is one of increasing despair and grief, although there is some uplifting struggle for survival at the core of this story to be found as well. That uplifting struggle to survive, is what makes this story so thrilling and attractive to be watched again and again. Very impressive movie, with great acting performances.

59,videorama-759-859391,Deliverance delivers,9,17 June 2014,"Here was a film where action spoke louder than words. Yes I know the dueling banjo's is the highlight of this movie. So we got that out the way. What was surprising, was that this was Beatty's first movie, and the performance he delivers at the wincing pathetic overweight coward, of the four friends was so believable, and colorfully creatives, the makings of a true actor. The other three of course, who of course aren't nobody's deliver good performances too, but it was Beatty's here that stayed with me as one of the humiliated and raped victims of two rednecks yokels having some fun, which soon backfires nastily, yet really the violence here was kept to a minimum, it almost had me pi..ed to be honest, which as revenge fare, with more blood, it would of been better, as from the viewers point, to really see these fu..ers get what they deserved. Yes, I'm saying these two really deserved to die, for what they did as fun loving friends, Reynolds, Beatty, Voight, and Cox, the not so fortunate one, who I liked too, weren't hurting anybody and were just out to have a good time. I've read the script, which I must say, you should look up, as just for description. The movie moves at such a nice (some impatients out there, would say a grinding) pace, which I liked, though I guess evben I was slightly irked at this factor, but it made the film more real. What also impressed me was the aftermath, after committing the murders of the yokels, how they dealed with it, and conspired to cover the truth, where in the real world, is how you do it, or how you answer under pressure, when faced with authorities. Yet, still in this situation, I don't really think you could get away squeaky clean, and too these two these creepy yokel cops smelt a lot of suspicion. The last scene with Voight, lying next to his wife on his return home, was almost eerie, in light of what he's been through.

However, its elevation of a classic stereotype-that of the hillbilly (or, if you prefer, Appalachian American) it cheapens itself even further.I don't know which I dislike more about this film; the veneration of a bad stereotype, or the graphic way in which this movie tries, but fails, to shock its audience. The tactics are cheap, the set up is obvious, and the ending is completely predictable.Frankly, I have never understood the draw this movie has, except for the homo-repressed nature of most white bread over christianized American males. They WANT to see this movie, and like to watch this type of antics.Oh, there are stunning visuals, some beautiful scenery, and it was directed quite well, but it's crap, and always has been.It rates a 2.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Deliverance
61,freemantle_uk,A darkly good film,8,14 April 2013,"In the late 60s and early 70s there was a rise in dark and gritty cinema tackling the grim subject matter and themes and did not pull their punches. The 1972 John Boorman film Deliverance was one of them, a horrifically interesting film.Four friends, Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Ed (Jon Voight), Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Drew (Ronny Cox) go to the remote wilderness of the Deep South to canoe down the Cahulawassee River before it flooded by the construction of a dam. But in the sticks the men meet very hostile hillbillies, leading to a horrific sexual assault and all four men to explore their dark sides.Deliverance is a very atmospheric film and it is done by the simplicity of Boorman's direction. He uses plenty of long shots and single takes, letting the power of the acting do the talking. Music is kept to a minimum and it adds to the atmosphere as most of the sounds we hear are nature, making you feel like you are in wild forest and it added to the horror when we see the infamous rape scene. It gave the moment even more power.Deliverance has an great cast and all four lead actors give excellent performances as they play some difficult roles and situations. Lewis is a macho man, a survivalist who is the most independently minded and the man who shares the hillbilly view of independent and love of wildness of the area. Ed is someone who ends up having to explore his dark side during their journey and Drew tries to be the conscience and rational of the group. All four end up having a dark bound, knowing what happened in the woods and their relationship had a very Stephen King esque feel to it.Deliverance was made in the early 70s, a time where hostility to the Vietnam War was high but it was unpopular in American culture to criticise it in film or books. Like a lot of good storytelling a story can be used as a way to subvertly talk about a subject through a different and you can see the Vietnam parallels in this film. The group of men are city men who suffer a culture crash and hostility from the locals, going into a hot forest area with an enemy around them as they try to survive in an onslaught and the war atrocities before the suffering the aftermath on the home front.Added to the Vietnam theme there are themes of manhood, the dark side of human nature that inhabits men, especially when they are alone in the woods and far away from civilisation and even a look at the nature of these communities who isolated and hostile to authority. But the film does have a surreal look to the hill folk with all their deformities and go through the old clichés that everyone in the rural Deep South is inbred. Finally there is even a slight environmental message about the destruction of the dam would course to the valley.Deliverance is an interesting film that was well paced and the dark nature was clearly following the hallmarks of cinema for the period. It is certainly worthy viewing.",Deliverance

I think that Deliverance is quite possibly the original backwoods survival horror/action thriller, many more were to follow, often in the form as slasher movies. This movie is famous for two scenes in particular, firstly the duelling banjos at the beginning, then the notorious male rape ""squeal like a pig"" scene. The banjo duel is fantastic, only thing I felt that was that having one of the best parts right at the start set the bar too high for the remainder. Burt Reynolds is great as the macho leader of the group and the actors did their own impressive white water rapids stunts. I'm scoring this 7/10 because I felt that the film was a little too long, I found the last part rather slow, and I watched it on VHS, given a better quality print I would most likely have scored it higher.

Answer: Yes. It would seem so. And proof of that is here in one plain fact - Deliverance was made on a modest budget of just $2 million and yet it grossed over $46 million at the box-office in its first year, alone.I guess its phenomenal popularity all came down to Deliverance being the very first mainstream film to ever show a homosexual (a hillbilly homosexual, that is) being killed.And that, I guess, gave many movie-goers the greatest pleasure and satisfaction in being witness to that.I mean, otherwise - What else could it be that attracted such a large audience to sit through this tiresome picture and then, afterwards, praise it with glowing approval? *Note* - Deliverance also lost some significant points for exploiting ""real-life"" human deformity (aka. the inbred hillbillies) solely for the sake of idle entertainment.

64,ianlouisiana,If you go down in the woods today..............,8,21 August 2006,"Together with the mighty ""Sharky's Machine"",""Deliverance"" marks the highpoint of Mr Burt Reynolds' career.He is - as someone once rather unkindly said of Miss Diana Dors - forgotten but not gone. As Lewis,the All-American outdoor man he takes on a role that is meat and drink to him,he does all his own stunts and would probably have had his own leg broken if the director had asked him nicely. ""Deliverance"" tells the story of what happens when he and some friends take a trip to a remote part of the American wilderness.But beware, ""Three men in a boat"" it isn't. If I was a Hillbilly I would be unhappy about the way my community has been treated by Hollywood over the years.When did you last see a Hillbilly with gleaming white teeth for instance?When I see yet another Billy just a pickin' and a grinnin' the message it gives me is that stereotypical racial images are not helpful.If Mountain People choose to live in totally separate communities isolated from the rest of the U.S. and obeying no laws but their own then that is their right under the Constitution.Burt and his friends should have stayed in Atlanta because getting off the beaten track in Georgia can be a pain in the arse.

65,dee.reid,Not too many like it,8,31 March 2005,"""Deliverance,"" seems to me, to be a movie that audiences and critics may surely avoid today, based on that scene. Yes, that scene I'm talking about where Bobby (Ned Beatty) is forced to strip down to his underwear, and shortly after, is raped by a snarling, toothless hillbilly who seeks to dominate the cowering and frightened city man (""I'm gonna make you squeal like a pig. Weeeeeeeeee!""). This scene and others like it make up one of the most disturbing films about human brutality ever captured on celluloid. The plot: four Atlanta businessmen (Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ronny Cox, and the aforementioned Beatty) take a canoing trip on the Appalachian river. Things get ugly when that scene rolls around, when the four men encounter two bloodthirsty backwoodsmen, and it quickly evolves into an experience none of the men will ever forget. It's a daring feat that John Boorman (who followed this up with the superior 1981 fantasy adventure, ""Excalibur"") was at the helm of this violent, disturbing thriller that dives deep into what makes man the way he is, and in detailing the line where civilization ends, and ""reality"" begins. Boorman's film, adapted from James Dickey's novel of the same title, is savage and definitely not for the faint-of-heart.8/10",Deliverance
66,runamokprods,A nightmare made real,9,16 November 2012,"Amazingly made film, this keeps a strong sense of tone and foreboding going from the first frame to the last. Beautifully shot by Vilmos Zigmond (although a few manipulated day for night shots look a bit wacky). The film moves at an even, moderate pace, without ever hurting the tension or drama. Thematically, it is an examination of the destructive nature of male machismo, the price of survival, the darkness of the human heart, the lies we're willing to tell ourselves and the world to get on, and the split between those of the land and those who use the land. These are not small themes, and sometimes they're a little too on the nose (e.g. dialogue like 'sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself' – although I'm not sure if the film is embracing that platitude or making very dark fun of it). At other times exactly what it's saying seems a bit fuzzy, or like it wants to have all its thematic cakes and eat them too. (Men need to be challenged to find their real self, but – on the other hand – trying to find your 'real self' may be an illusory path to your own destruction, literal or metaphoric). Also, I could see the people of Appalachia, who already carry understandable anger as being constantly portrayed as stupid, inbred and violent, taking offense to the film, and they'd have a point. Yet all that said, this is a movie that's more about a visceral experience than a collage thesis dissection, and that is where 'Deliverance' excels. It takes us to hell, and only partly back, and we get immersed in the journey in a way all too few films pull off. It is quite like being lost in a bad dream. And I mean that as a compliment.",Deliverance
67,robfollower,Deliverance (1972),8,18 April 2020,"Director: John Boorman
Writers: James Dickey (screenplay), James Dickey (novel)
Stars: Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty , Ronny CoxAdapted for the screen by poet James Dickey from his own novel, the picture follows four city-slicker Southerners during an ill-fated trip down a (fictional) River in the dense wilderness of rural Georgia. Lewis (Burt Reynolds) is the leader of the group because he's a veteran outdoorsman, Ed (Jon Voight) knows his way around the woods but can't match Lewis' wild-man bravado, Drew (Ronny Cox) is a soft-spoken urbanite more comfortable with a banjo than a rifle, and Bobby (Ned Beatty) is an overweight every man along for the ride. Spurred on by Lewis, the men decide to take a canoe trip before the river is dammed to create a lake; for Lewis, the challenge is conquering a disappearing wilderness, and for the others, the kick is escaping the urban grind.Right from the opening frames, Boorman creates an ominous atmosphere, best exemplified by the legendary ""Dueling Banjos"" scene. Deliverance is hard to watch given the intensity of what happens onscreen, but the acting, film making, and writing are so potent that it's impossible to look away. Accolades showered on the film included Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Editing.",Deliverance
68,Lechuguilla,Excellence Delivered,10,8 October 2005,"In what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time, four city guys confront nature's wrath, in a story of survival. The setting is backwoods Georgia, with its forests, mountains, and wild rivers.The director, John Boorman, chose to use local people, not actors, to portray secondary characters. These locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history. No central casting ""actors"" could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces, voices, or actions. I don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. As much as anything else, it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing.Another strength is the film's theme. Nature, in the wild, can be violent. How appropriate that the setting should be the American South. Very few places in the U.S. are, or have been, as violent as redneck country. In a story about Darwinian survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature, not separate from it.""Deliverance"" is very much a product of its time when, unlike today, Americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness. The film's magnificent scenery, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets, and the roar of the river rapids, combined with the absence of civilization, all convey an environmental message. And that is another strength of the film.At an entertainment level, the tension gradually escalates, as the plot proceeds. Not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme, and then never lets up, not until the final credits roll. Very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot.Finally, the film's technical quality is topnotch. Direction and editing are flawless. Cinematography is excellent. Dialogue is interesting. And the acting is terrific. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film, it is the music, which strikes me as timid.Overall, ""Deliverance"" almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure. Even for those who don't, the gritty characterizations, the acting, and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film, one of the finest in cinema history.",Deliverance
69,jimbo-53-186511,The first thing I thought to myself when this ended was 'That's it',3,29 September 2015,"Deliverance is another one of those 'classic' films that I just felt no real love for and although it isn't the most overrated 'classic' I've seen and certainly isn't the worst 'classic' I've seen either it still fell well short of my expectations...This film bills itself as a Thriller and therefore I expected a film that provides thrills, tension, intensity and suspense and the reality here is that Deliverance 'delivers' none of these things. The build-up at the start is particularly tedious with Ronny Cox having some weird guitar off with a creepy looking kid - not only was it pointless, but it also went on for far too long. I could have also done without all the nonsense regarding finding people to drive their cars to the other side of the river. It all amounted to unnecessary drawn-out filler which started to get on my nerves.At this point I was still prepared to forgive the film and hoped that it would be a slow-burning film that would become something magnificent, but sadly this was not the case. The first encounter with the hillbillies was quite good and was what I would call mildly suspenseful, but after this scene Deliverance never really became the exciting and tense picture that the film poster suggests it is. In fact, the only really interesting part of the film was the moral debate that the group have about disposing of the body or turning themselves in. This aspect was quite interesting, but perhaps it stood out more for me because of how poor the rest of the film was as a whole.I think the main reason I was disappointed was that I hoped it would be more of a cat and mouse film or a hunt or be hunted type affair, but it doesn't offer the viewer this experience. Rather than being on the edge of my seat, I found myself close to nodding off. It doesn't even work when looked upon as a character building experience as the characters are never really given any development meaning that this film really failed from pretty much every angle.The only good thing about this film were the performances from the four main players (with Ronny Cox and Jon Voight being particularly good) and it was also nice to see Ronny Cox playing a good guy for a change. The acting was very good here and did elevate the film slightly. As a whole though, this film is slow, boring, and basically lacks any real suspense and tension.

71,barnabyrudge,The most frightening non-horror film ever made.,10,13 September 2005,"Deliverance is a stunning thriller, every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach-churningly frightening. Though it is not a horror movie, it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film. The very thought of being a normal red-blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation, only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies, is surely the worst nightmare of 99.9% of the world's population. It would have been easy for Deliverance to slip into exploitation territory, but John Boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores, questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity. With so many films, you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero's shoes, performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl.... but with Deliverance, you come away praying to God that you'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through.Four city guys - Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty) - head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon-to-be-dammed river. The guys are riding the rapids in pairs, and Ed and Bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland. Here, they fall foul of two local woodlanders (Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward), who tie Ed to a tree, while one of them strips and rapes Bobby instructing him, perversely, to ""squeal like a pig"". Lewis and Drew arrive unseen and Lewis, being a fair archer, kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest. Under great emotional stress, the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area. But they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream, and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river.Deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale, but even more powerful (and disturbing) as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters. Though all the performances are remarkable, one must take particular note of Beatty's efforts in a role that many actors would've turned down. The film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film Straw Dogs - both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales, and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction. The backdrop of the rugged countryside in Deliverance is beautiful to look at, but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape, with nobody to rely on other than themselves. This truly is suspenseful film-making at its finest.",Deliverance

Burt Reynolds R.I.P is fantastic as the tough hunter of the group ""Lewis Medlock"" a performance that made him an even bigger star back in the 70's!!! Also of course the legendary John Voight gives one of the greatest performances in movie history here as mild mannered ""Ed Gentry"" who has to overcome his own fears & become a basically a warrior & find his primal rage side to get his revenge on the evil rapist Hillbillies, it's a perfect piece of Acting, an outstanding performance & one that is iconic now.
But all four guys give superb performances & show what happens to men under extreme pressure in an extremely dangerous situation, Ned Beatty gives a heartfelt & extremely terrified performance as the fun loving chubby guy of the group ""Bobby Trippe"" who becomes the victim of the depraved Rednecks & his rape scene is still so shocking & so disturbing even today, & then there's Ronny Cox as the more timid & tame guy of the group ""Drew Ballinger"" & these men & there Adventure of Horror will stay with you well after it ends.
The cinematography is gorgeous & we see the backwoods & big waterfalls & the music is excellent, also it's expertly Directed by John Boorman & he's crafted an intense & suspenseful gritty tale of survival that is scary & is pretty much a Horror film really!!!
""DELIVERANCE"" is not only one of the best films of the 1970's but it's also one of the greatest movies ever made & is one of the most iconic films in Cinema history, a true CLASSIC.",Deliverance
73,joiningjt,Extremely overrated and boring!! Another movie that's dated and overrated!!,1,15 January 2021,"Burt Reynolds was surprisingly decent in this film but its extremely overrated. A 7.7 REALLY, it has a horrible negative rape scene and then we get a whimpy pay back. The end is ok but extremely predictable. Have no idea why this is rated so high, its probably the old 1 says it's great so everyone follows so they dont look stupid. In reality you look stupid for saying great film, it's a VERY basic movie with basic acting performances. Watch taken, or murder in the first or green mile skip this bore ass overrated film.",Deliverance

The movie dragged at the beginning and I wasn't really invested into it until that moment came and I was like what is happeningggg??? Then I loved everything after that, especially the whole cover up. Also, all of the performances are really great!",Deliverance
75,dworldeater,"Great movie, a classic",9,20 March 2018,"Deliverance is an excellent outdoor thriller about survival directed by John Boorman, of which is one of my favorite of his work (along with Excalibur). This film has a great ensemble cast of fantastic actors that includes Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. The film has these dudes going on a canoeing/camping trip in the soon to extinct Cahulawassee River, intact before it gets expanded and turns into a lake. However, these ""city boys"" did not make a good impression with the locals, in which provokes an unpleasant confrontation between our main characters and backwoods hillbillies. One of which is played by Bill Mc Kinney who is an excellent villan and also will go on to play as Captain ""Red legs"" in one of my favorite westerns The Outlaw Josey Wales. The outdoor locations are photographed beautifully and the film is tense, violent and handled in a very realistic and gritty manner. Acting performances are second to none, Burt Reynolds in paticular was awesome. He is criminally underated as a actor, as much as I like Smokey And The Bandit, he should have made less movies like that and more movies like Deliverance. Anyways, Deliverance is an excellent film, that all the way around is very engrossing as a story and very powerful and well made.",Deliverance
76,MarieGabrielle,Visit Georgia!!!; John Boorman's best....,10,23 August 2006,"and this IS a very disturbing film. I may be wrong, but this is the last film where I considered Burt Reynolds an actual actor, who transformed the role, and delivered a message.Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They are unassuming and unaware; businessmen wanting to enjoy the country. Little did they know what would happen next.The photography and sets are realistic and natural. This was before the days of Wes Craven.What is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist. In America, country folk still detest city people; it is almost a century and a half since the Civil War.You will enjoy this film. It was filmed in the rural sections of South Georgia, which still exist. Just don't drive past that to Mobile, Alabama; That area still has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.addendum: This is also a rare film that stands the test of time, watch it again, you will be interested in the subtle message.",Deliverance
77,Jonny_Numb,"a different kind of ""male bonding"" film",7,2 April 2003,"""Deliverance"" is a rollicking thriller, an absorbing moral drama, and an effective commentary on man battling technology, nature, and very real human monsters.  It's the story of four relatively well-adjusted suburbanites who go on a canoe trip out in the boondocks one weekend, only to be accosted by a duo of inbred sodomites who quickly turn their relaxation and peace into a quest for survival.  The idea of humans being degraded to the level of savages, and man battling to survive in a world that's being overtaken by technology are just a few of the poignant themes contained within James Dickey's script.  ""Deliverance"" isn't for all tastes, but those looking for an intense, well-directed drama will be taken on an unforgettable ride.  And don't forget to ""put on your life jacket!""7/10",Deliverance
78,Steffi_P,"""The vanishing wilderness""",8,5 October 2011,"The 1960s and 70s saw a lot more wild, outdoor pictures, partly because of improvements to cinematography and more mobile equipment opened up greater possibilities and lessened the need for studio shooting, but also partly because the hippy era resulted in a lot of movies with a ""getting-back-to-nature"" vibe. But this was also an age of questioning and uncertainty, and the wilderness could also be turned into a place of terror and mystery. This mixture of yearning and fear provides the backdrop for 1972 thriller Deliverance.Deliverance was the breakthrough movie for English director John Boorman. Boorman's earliest pictures had been very overtly stylised, with lots of zooms and rapid editing. For Deliverance he has a more subtle approach, but still with that strong sense of rhythm and atmosphere. Of especial note in Deliverance is his use of space on the river. Every shot shows a tight bend or is part obscured by the trees – we never really get a look at the way ahead. This is not an Aguirre/Apocalypse Now vision of the river as a road wending its way through the forest. This is the river as a maze where every part looks the same and there doesn't seem to be any way out. This greatly helps to fuel the sense of confusion and paranoia that permeates the whole thing. But Boorman further remembers to keep this a human drama, staging a lot of the action in close-up with the background an unfocused blur.This is all the better to capture some fine acting. Burt Reynolds is, at first glance, simply a macho poser, albeit a very charismatic one. But there is more going on in his performance, with hints of disturbing capabilities just below the surface. Ned Beatty impresses in his first screen role, allowing himself to be totally humiliated and still appearing believable in his reactions. On the downside Ronny Cox is hammy and Jon Voigt is a little overwrought. Towards the end there's a neat cameo by source novel author James Hickey, giving an understated but menacing turn as the local sheriff.Like so many pictures of this era, Deliverance states its themes boldly. There is the conflict between progress and rural simplicity, and the need for men to prove themselves in an age where technology has made everything easy and comfortable. Such statements seem a little trite, but in the case of Deliverance they are forgivable because they are presented in such a taut, compelling thriller, with layers of ambiguity that are cunning yet never convoluted, and certainly never pretentious. It is neither as grandiose or other-worldly as Heart of Darkness or its many adaptations (including Apocalypse Now), but is instead close, gritty and uncomfortably lifelike, even when at its most nightmarish.",Deliverance
79,rbverhoef,Haunting,8,9 April 2003,"Shot in the beautiful nature this tragic story passes us. Four friends go on a canoe trip deep in the woods. On their way they have some trouble with locals and what was supposed to be a beautiful and exciting journey turns out to be a disaster.The four friends are played by Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. They all are good in their roles, especially Burt Reynolds as the cool guy. There are some very disturbing scenes, one with Ned Beatty in particular, but they work the way they were meant. A haunting but very good story against beautiful nature, even more beautifully shot. Only the cinematography of the river and the woods is worth the watch, if you can stand the violence that does occur.",Deliverance
80,truemythmedia,A Lighthearted Fun Romp With Georgia's Finest People,10,17 September 2019,"Deliverance not only stood the test of time, but it conquered it, and with a good restoration that is much needed (come on Criterion!) this film easily earns its title as a classic movie. It's a disturbing and anxiety ridden survival adventure story, filled with excitement and horror, a movie that will linger in the minds of viewers for as long as this film has been around. It's truly sensational when a film that's in it's fifth decade can still form a lasting, haunting impact on the audience, showing man facing the horrors of nature, themselves, and deconstructed masculinity, Deliverance opened the door for many writers and filmmakers to explore these traits and environments, but none can match the evocative atmospheric intensity as Deliverance.",Deliverance
81,a_chinn,A harrowing and still one-of-a-kind meditation on civilization vs. primitive human instinct,10,17 September 2018,"Director John Boorman's cinematic masterpiece is at once an exciting and harrowing thriller, while also a fascinating meditation on the nature of civilization and human nature's more primal instincts. Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox plan to get back to nature by canoeing down the fictional Cahulawassee River before it's damed up and flooded, marring it's wild natural beauty. These four cityfolk run the spectrum of macho outdoorsman Reynolds to the soft ""born salesman"" Beatty. On their trip, the four find themselves running afoul some seriously creepy hillfolk (which is putting it mildly if you've seen the film or know what happens). Without spoiling anything, the four are pushed to their limits both by nature and the menacing mountain men. ""Deliverance"" was based on a novel and adapted by it's author, James Dickey. Thematically, the film most interesting in that it doesn't solidly land on one side or the other when it comes to whether civilization or the primitive is more superior to the other, but instead the story finds it's strongest character in Voight, who falls solidly between not being too civilized or too primitive. The theme of encroaching civilization weakening our stronger primal elements is something that would have been perfectly aligned with director Sam Peckinpah, who was Dickey's first choice for director for this film. Boorman is an fine director (""Point Blank"" ""Excalibur"" ""The Emerald Forest""), but I can't help but image what kind of a viscerally resonant film Peckinpah would have made, combining the most interesting elements he explored in ""Ride the High Country,"" ""The Wild Bunch,"" and ""Straw Dogs."" Also of note is the gorgeous photography by Vilmos Zsigmond (""The Deer Hunter"" ""Close Encounter"" ""Blow Out), outside of some poorly done day-for-night-photography during a cliff climbing sequence. Overall, ""Deliverance"" is a smart film that engaging on both a entertainment and intellectual level. A true classic, even if it might have been better with Peckinpah at the helm.",Deliverance
82,raulfaust,Amistad,9,29 January 2014,"The movie begins with four men planning to go for a trip in a ravaged river, considering the river is on borrowed time. Main characters, in a first sight, aren't anything special or remarkable from each other-- maybe with exception of Lewis, who seems to be an aggressive man. Once they enter the river, they face two local inhabitants that feel like raping them for no apparently reason-- which was probably an inspiration for Wes Craven in 77's ""The Hills Have Eyes"". After the raping indeed happens, lots of bad things happen to the main characters, making it hard to not feel impressed with those scenes. Most of the tension is created by the strong direction John Boorman gives us; he focuses on the character's feelings, followed by a bunch of unforeseen situations they've been into, like the leg breaking, the dangerous escalade, among others. After they talk to the police, it seems like they're all going to be caught by the cops, since they are all lying. Those scenes were also tense, and I'm very thankful they finally got away with murder in the end. ""Deliverance"" is one of the most tense films I've seen, and probably one of the best of the 70's. It's well worth your time, believe me!",Deliverance
83,justin-fencsak,It's more than just the theme music...,7,6 September 2018,"In honor of the late Burt Reynolds' passing today, it's time to revisit some of his classic films, starting with Deliverance, you know, the movie with the famous banjo tune. Released during the new hollywood era, this film became a huge success for Warner Bros and its parent company, Warner Communications, which was formed in 1972 after former parent Kinney sold off its entertainment assets after a parking scandal.",Deliverance
84,Sandcooler,Worth it for the banjos,9,2 October 2011,"""Deliverance"" is often seen as a shocker, but that's really sort of a hasty conclusion. Yeah, at one point Ned Beatty gets savagely raped by some rednecks, but that's one brief scene in 110 minutes. The rape is entirely implied anyway (thank God), so the uproar when the movie came out was sorta ridiculous and makes me wonder if the protesters had even seen the movie. ""Deliverance"" is actually just an entertaining adventure movie with a solid story, great actors and some really beautiful scenery. Some are destined to make it into a groundbreaking classic, some are destined to pass it of as a one-dimensional exploitation picture, but really it's neither. For a movie that's still often marketed as disturbing, I really found it remarkably inoffensive. Maybe inoffensive isn't an incredibly positive quality, but ""Deliverance"" isn't an incredibly good movie either. I still like it though, I just don't love it.",Deliverance
85,philip_vanderveken,"Watch it for the excellent acting, the great story and the nice photography...",8,20 May 2005,"Only a couple of weeks ago I saw ""Without a Paddle"". Now you probably ask yourself what that has to do with this movie. Well, a lot more than you might expect because ""Deliverance"" isn't a comedy like the other one is, but the entire story is pretty similar. Both are adventure movies in which a couple of friends go on a canoing trip in the middle of nowhere, where they will find themselves in some dangerous situations. But the main difference between the two is that this one was made for an adult audience and that ""Without A Paddle"" is intended for teenagers. And it shows. While ""Deliverance"" is a very nice movie, ""Without a Paddle"" certainly isn't...Deliverance tells the story of four men from the city who want to canoe down the Cahulawassee River, which soon will be lost because the entire surroundings will be flooded once the construction of a nearby dam is finished. At first it all seems to be an idyllic and adventurous trip through some magnificent landscapes, but soon they get more than they bargained for. They already met the local population at the village where they started the trip and at first they all seemed rather retarded, but nice. But once they are in the middle of nowhere, the locals become more and more of a threat...I've seen about four hundred movies the past 10 months, but I don't think there is any movie from which I'll still recognize the music after a couple of weeks, except for this one. The song 'The Duelling Banjos' in the beginning is not only very captivating and hard to resist, it's probably one of the best known movie songs ever. But not only the music is nice, so are the entire story, the acting and the photography...The story is so good because it is plausible. It isn't difficult to make an overly dramatic, but unbelievable movie with this story line, but the makers have avoided that trap perfectly. What they have done is portraying a threatening situation in such a good way, that you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat from the moment all misery starts. And when it is all over, you're glad that you weren't the one that had to deal with it all. That's of course also thanks to the excellent performances by the four leads. Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox all play their roles so well that you immediately forget that you're watching some well known actors. I might even say that these were probably the very best roles of their lives. Especially Burt Reynolds has never been better than in this movie.All in all this is a classic that shouldn't be missed. In these days you get to see such bad movies that you start wondering if Hollywood has always made such awful things. The answer is no, just check movies like this one and be convinced that they once used to make some very classy productions that are able to keep you focused from the first moment till the last. I give it an 8/10.",Deliverance
86,Chase_Witherspoon,Down in the boondocks,10,30 September 2012,"I'm surprised this film averages a relatively paltry 7.9 on the rating scale; it's just about peerless in my opinion as a horror movie, with the ill-fated quartet (Voight, Reynolds, Beatty and Cox) canoeing down a river marked for imminent landfill whose idyllic sojourn turns to chaos when Beatty is violently attacked by a pair of mountain men.Voight is established as a bit of a fence-sitter, essentially living vicariously through the macho Reynolds, an abrasive if likable rogue living dangerously for kicks. The naturalist Cox - the solitary figure - laments the industrialisation of the planet and representing the industrialist, Beatty struggles to adapt to the demands of the wild without civilised boundaries for protection. McKinney and Coward in brief but terrifying roles are the epitome of the outback villain, their opportunistic crimes brutal and merciless.While its easy to focus on the film's immortal scene, the pig reference from which is now oft quoted, for me the penultimate moment in the film happens when Voight attempts to shoot a deer, revealing the innate weakness he's subsequently compelled to overcome in the true test of survival. Great atmosphere, score (""Duelling Banjos"") and several chilling moments guarantee a classic that should transcend time and imitations (""The River Wild"" comes to mind). It's just a shame that director Boorman didn't do more in his sparse career.",Deliverance
87,screenman,Still A Match For Modern Psycho-Thrillers,9,14 November 2011,"A comparatively old movie, now; originating from way back in 1971. But 40 years have hardly phased its capacity to make viewers shudder.Comfortable urban America seems to harbour some dread of things going haywire in the wilderness. Probably a hang-over from the days of Indian conflict. Here its the white tribes: isolated hillbillies and their inbreeding, and a complete absence of civilised conduct. Our four heroes take the adventure holiday from hell, as their sojourn in the wilds takes on a very grim aspect indeed.The movie stars Burt Reynolds in an unusually straight role, played with a very keen edge. Jon Voight, soon after his success in 'Midnight Cowboy', still manages to look outwardly vulnerable, but is ultimately proved to be the real survivor. Ned Beatty always gives an excellent B-list return, whilst an unassuming Ronny Cox makes up the quartet. They really do look like 4 mix-n-match friends out for a good time that never happens.Filming highlights the wilderness to amazing effect. It looks gloriously expansive, violently dramatic, and frighteningly claustrophobic by turns as the story moves forward from fun adventure to bitter survival. The sense of loss and isolation is perfectly realised. The comfortably familiar becomes strange and threatening.And whilst all of this is going forward, there is the idealised evaluation of minds raised to comply with rules, accept moral tenets, and endeavour to see a broader responsibility beyond the immediacy of survival that raises 'Deliverance' above the similarly themed 'Southern Comfort'.Well worth a watch, though at times it still makes very uncomfortable viewing. It was nominated for 3 Oscars, and was probably denied them on account of its subject matter. Horror-thrillers tend to be dismissed by academic and art-house selection.One thing's for certain; you'll remember this minutely-observed small cast of characters and their complex plight, long after the CGI hoards of epics like 'Rings' have become an incomprehensible montage.",Deliverance
88,sme_no_densetsu,Delivers the goods,8,12 November 2009,"""Deliverance"" is one of those films that is mainly remembered today for one particularly iconic scene. The 'squeal like a pig' scene does for hillbillies what ""Jaws"" did for sharks but the film has more depth than this infamous scene might lead you to believe.The story is based on the best-selling first novel of James Dickey, who was already a renowned poet. The story sports a certain poetic flavour with the exploration of themes such as the glory of nature and man's attempted conquest of it.The plot concerns a group of four friends who embark upon a canoeing trip down the Cahulawassee River in the Georgia backwoods. While the wild river poses a certain degree of danger these men soon find that the locals are more dangerous by far.The cast is a pretty good one with the best performance coming from the versatile Jon Voight. Burt Reynolds is a good fit as the leader of the group while Ned Beatty & Ronny Cox make convincing everymen. Special note goes to the actors playing the various mountain men since they manage to give the film an air of authenticity.John Boorman's direction is well-handled and was rewarded with an Oscar nomination. The film looks attractive throughout and also features some memorable music, most notably ""Duelling Banjos"".Ultimately, I consider the film a well-executed thriller with plenty of depth. The notoriety of the film's single most famous scene may lead you to believe that it is otherwise unremarkable but that's not the case at all.",Deliverance

And turn into your best friends. You can put them on when you have a bad day. And they talk to you if you are a guy like me. A guy who has no friends and depends on art to keep him going.Three squares led by a survivalist heads to rural America in search of adventure. They get more than they bargained for. But in the process, some of them become better men. Deliverance is one of the best survival flicks of all time. Yes, greater than Alien and The Naked Prey.It is amazing how American movies speak to the whole world. They speak everyone's language and appeal to people from all cultures. I am sure movie fans from all earth alienated countries would be able to identify with Deliverance.I recommend the book by James Dickey. It is amazing how John Boorman added elements to Dickey's novel to convert it into a novel. The guitar duel scene must rank as one of the greatest scenes ever put on film. Marlon Brando must have kicked himself for turning down Reynolds role. I thought Ned Beatty was excellent in this film.",Deliverance
90,Cosmoeticadotcom,Overrated and dull,4,10 September 2008,"New on the Fox Network: When Good Movies Go Bad!Or, a review of John Boorman's 1972 film Deliverance, which he produced and directed, based upon James Dickey's 1970 novel of the same name. Dickey also wrote the screenplay, which explains a lot, especially if you are familiar with his 'poetry.' The actual look of the film, however, is sensational. The cinematography of nature, by Vilmos Zsigmond, is still stunning after thirty-five years- especially those scenes shot in twilight, dusk, and night, and the first forty-five or so minutes sets the basis of a good tale which could have been something really special. Then, Dickey digs into his own personal bag of fetishes (his most famous poem is The Sheep Child, about bestiality) and latencies and the film becomes an almost nonstop stream of a narrative propelled by the Dumbest Possible Action theory of film.Although the coinage of that term arrived a few years later than this film, Deliverance is as fine an example of that genre as there is. The term arrived in the early 1980s, when a spate of slasher films from the Halloween to the Nightmare On Elm Street to the Friday The 13th series, to their even cheaper knockoffs, were always dependent upon the early success of their villains stemming from the utter stupidity of their victims, to wit: big breasted cheerleader is alone in a dark house, hears a scream from down an even darker hallway, yet rushes headlong toward the scream, all the while knowing that a serial killer is lurking about. In similar fashion, this film goes from a realistic portrayal of masculine mores to a silly, unrealistic, A to B to C pointless film. The turning point comes when one of the four male leads is sodomized forcefully by a hillbilly and his toothless gun-toting crony. the film finally founders because it lacks real situations, characters, and philosophy. After all, it's difficult to get truly philosophic after a character's been torpedoed by a hillbilly, and so a film that could have been a realistic and philosophic exploration of characters, and male character, devolves into a ridiculous melodrama of revenge, deceit, and perversion. Boorman is a noted filmmaker, but he's never been considered one of the great auteurs, and a film like Deliverance shows why. Some have accused me of gleeing in bad art. I don't. But needling the bad is a palliative over the depression bad art brings. This is especially true when a work of art could have been good, even great, but actively chooses to demean itself and its audience. This film proves that while James Dickey's body died in 1997, something far more essential died long before, or was never birthed; and in that I'm not talking about anything to do with morality. When you've figured out what that was, you'll understand Deliverance a whole lot better.",Deliverance

Four Atlanta businessmen decide to embark on a canoe trip vacation that eventually turns into a nightmare. This powerful adaptation of a novel finds the director establishing a sense of threat from the start and the ""squeal like a pig"" scene keeps on haunting viewers decades after the fact. In one of his best parts Burt Reynolds excels as a rugged athlete understanding the milieu's ""survival of the fittest"" code, while John Voight scores as a mild-mannered man discovering unexpected reservoirs. The ""Dueling Banjos"" sequence has also become a classic in its own right. The film earned (and deserved) Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Director and Film Editing.",Deliverance

When locals along the way decide to ""have their way"" with the interlopers it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors. Each of the travelers is outstanding, although Voight gives the lead and strongest performance. The rural scenery and culture is well-captured, including the breathtaking dueling banjos sequence. I saw this on a date when it came out, not exactly the perfect date movie (although we both enjoyed it).

93,lambiepie-2,A Human Nature and Nature Study,9,28 December 2006,"I was a toddler when this film came out in the 70's and didn't get to see it until I was over 21 in the 80's - on TV. Then, I didn't understand it. A few years later it turned up on one of the Cable movie channels and I watched it uncut.After seeing it the way it was intended, I found this to be a film of human nature against nature plunged to the very depths of horror. Four men who wanted to go on a innocent canoe trip before the stream became home to industrialism, endure the worst weekend of their lives.First of all, I've gotta comment on Burt Reynolds as the Alpha male. He was perfect for this role - his manner, his dress, his style. Ronny Cox seemed to be the one who strategized his horrors by having the law outside of where they were take care of the problems. Jon Voight proved to be more than the fair haired boy, the family man who had to reach deep in his soul to make decisions and survive, and Ned Beatty was obviously the weakest and got the worst of the ordeal - on the trip and after.Second there is John Boorman, the director. Everything he directs has a backdrop of nature, environment and humans interactions in it. This piece is no different - but it's something you wouldn't know unless you watch other John Boorman films, and you should. Then go back and watch this one uncut. He has a knack for exposing the deepest darkest roots of nature and man's fascination with it.Third, there are the quotable phrases I heard for years and had no idea they came from this movie. ""You gotta real pretty mouth"" and ""Squeal like a pig"" are in the top 10 of quotable lines. And music? Well, I used to like ""Dueling Banjos"" but now I've got this image in my head so now when I hear it, I get chills now that I know where it got it's popularity and I laugh earnestly when I see comedians and writers use this in their spoof skits.Here is a film that is violent, sexually explicit, makes you question the depths of humanity - the law - a call of adventurism - trying to rule nature - makes you wonder what would YOU do? - makes you think about how much can you take and remain ""normal"" after trauma - and will have you questioning your next weekend canoe trip with friends to ""parts unknown"".",Deliverance
94,brchthethird,Man vs. Nature in this solid wilderness thriller,8,14 November 2014,"DELIVERANCE is a solidly written, gripping movie about man versus nature (Mother Nature and human nature). Sometimes the point was a little too on-the-nose, but it raises interesting questions about modernity, masculinity and survival. Also great are the four central performances by Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. Each of them inhabit their character completely and fully immerse themselves in their roles. Even more incredible is the on-location shooting in Georgia which results in some beautiful images and taut thrills as the four men make their way down the river. The only complaint I really have is that towards the end, it slows down a lot and the way some of the story is wrapped up drags on for a few minutes too long. Still, this was an unforgettable journey that was worth the trip. You also might not look at pigs or ""purty mouths"" the same way again.",Deliverance
95,classicalsteve,Pulp Fiction in the Appalachian Rapids--Burt Reynolds Best Performance,9,25 March 2012,"If some of the elements of 1994's ""Pulp Fiction"" were set in the Appalachians, you might get some idea about ""Deliverance"". By the same director as ""Excalibur"" and ""Emerald Forest"", ""Deliverance"" concerns four city-slicker types who decide to take a canoe trip down a river which is going to be flooded in order to pave the way for the construction of a dam. The city-slickers believe it will be the last time they will be able to experience the river as nature intended. They foresee the trip as simply a weekend of white water rafting, fishing, camping, and becoming one with their natural surroundings. Their experience eventually becomes an ordeal of survival and moral dilemma.Their first stop by car before they head to the river foreshadow some of the events which will follow. To get gas and ask for assistance, our four travelers stop at a village (I hesitate to call it even a town) made of shacks and broken-down cars. They get gas and ask the locals to drive their cars to the end of the river so they won't have to walk back the many miles from their departure point. Drew (Ronnie Cox), the one musician among the group, engages a youngster in a famous scene in which they play ""Dueling Banjos"", which brought back this memorable instrumental blue-grass riff originally written in the 1950's. (It topped the charts as a result of the film.) After the piece is finished, Drew attempts to shake hands with the youngster who seems disturbingly aloof and almost not quite aware of the strangers in his midst. We then notice the other locals acting ""funny"" toward them. They are even warned not to go the river. Of course, we know right off they should have listened.The vacationers finally make it to the river and begin their journey. At first they engage in what seems nothing more than a scenic ride along the rapids with Lewis (Burt Reynolds) using his modern bow and arrow to snag game fish. They set up camp at night. But the next day, their journey escalates into something far more sinister and life-threatening, involving sexual assault and murder. The story twists into an ordeal in which we learn how each character deals with the dramatic, traumatic and tragic circumstances which become their experience. The journey is a flight into an entirely new world of existence.What makes Deliverance compelling is not simply the circumstances faced by the characters, but how the characters in turn deal with their situation. Each actor is right on the money, living in the skin of their characters, including Jon Voigt as Ed who seems ill-at-ease with hunting and rafting, Ned Beatty as Bobby nicknamed ""Chubby"" as the salesman who seems like a fish out of water, Ronnie Cox as Drew the musician but the most unstable of the group, and particularly Burt Reynolds as Lewis, the unofficial leader of the group who seems the most at-home. Later, Lewis is forced to relinquish his decision-making power and must put his life into the hands of his less-experienced colleagues.A film which is not for all tastes but makes you think, much in the way ""Pulp Fiction"" does. After the premier of ""Pulp Fiction"", Tarantino said that not all audiences necessarily liked it, but they came away discussing it. I think ""Delieverance"" has much of the same impact. While this is not escapist entertainment, it is a film which will challenge your perceptions about survival versus law. Overall not to be missed if you're up for a challenge. But if your favorite movie is the ""Sound of Music"" or ""Lassie"", you may want to pass on it.",Deliverance
96,aciessi,Wrong Turn,10,5 May 2019,"Four men spend a weekend whitewater rafting in the deepest depths of Appalachia. They thought they would take it easy. They thought it would be fun. They were never the same again.Deliverance is a film about fear, horror, survival, justice, retribution and remorse. A man's personal reckoning, in ways many people never thought of. It's also about a loss of innocence, one that many Americans felt during Vietnam and Watergate. A sense that you can never really trust your neighbor and never walk through life wistfully unaware of the evil that lurks in the most unsuspecting of places.John Boorman, in real time, explores a camping trip from hell. Every last excruciating moment of it. The bare naked wilderness, surrounded by toothless, inbred hicks that want to do some very bad harm to innocent city folks. To those who know of that famous scene, you know better than to assume it represents the entirety of the film, but you also know that it's horrifying nature makes it impossible to think of this film without thinking of it. To those who don't know what I'm talking about, consider this your trigger warning.John Boorman is a filmmaking realist. He chose Deliverance to represent a moment in cinema where the intimate fears of the average man can be screened for the first time. The fear of the uncivilized world, and how it can bring you face to face with death. Reynolds, Voight, Beatty.. acting perfection. I cant say enough good things. Deliverance is an all-time classic. The 70's at it's best.",Deliverance
97,CharltonBoy,Deliverance didnt deliver what i was expecting,7,25 March 2004,"I suppose ,Deliverance at the time of release in 1972 would have been seen as one of the most violent films seen at the cinema but 30 years on it seems quite tame. I was expecting a Southern Comfort type of film only better but it didnt really happen. In fact you could say that apart from the first 45 minutes nothing really happens at all! The acting is good and the film looks good but where were the Hill Billies chasing the men? Still worth a look though. 7 out of 10.",Deliverance
98,khanbaliq2,One of the best stories about men pushed to their physical and emotional limits ever put on screen.,10,1 July 2010,"Four businessmen spend a holiday weekend canoeing down a dangerous river, but find that the real danger to their lives comes from themselves and other humans.Deliverance is a nerve-shredding, almost apocalyptic vision of man's inhumanity, disguised as a thrilling adult adventure. This remarkably well-made, intelligent work caused controversy, which might have been foreseen, because of a jaw-droppingly violent rape scene. Unhappily it also inspired several low-budget horror films about city types tramping through the backwoods and being accosted by voracious mountain men. In 2008, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".",Deliverance
99,krorie,Paradise Lost,9,4 February 2006,"Before this movie was released, backwoods America was usually depicted by Hollywood as innocence incarnated filled with uneducated yet hardworking, moralistic, God-fearing people with common sense solutions to everyday problems. They only became violent to protect their families or to have a friendly fisticuffs with a rowdy full of moonshine. ""Deliverance"" showed rural America differently, rather than mean streets there were mean dirt roads and cold-blooded killers. Deformities brought on my poor diets and such taboos as incest practiced for generations led to a perversion of the entire community. In reality neither stereotype is correct. But that's the way the big screen depicted it. What caused the change? Possibly the permissive sixties and the national trauma of the Vietnam War. The four main characters of ""Deliverance"" each has a story to tell. There's the amoral adventurer who likes to kill for sport giving Burt Reynolds has best screen role. Reynolds makes the most of it and does a magnificent job. Too bad dry rot set in almost immediately with Reynolds making some very bad career decisions. Though he made a lot of money in such popular films as ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" his artistic potential was squandered. Then there's the sensitive poet musician played by Ronny Cox. His world is composed of sweetness and light. There's no room for imperfections, certainly not for evil. Ned Beatty shows his amazing screen talent for the first time as the obnoxious good ol' boy who's more at home in a cocktail bar than in the primeval forest. Jon Voight, who had a few years earlier been nominated for an Academy Award for ""Midnight Cowboy,"" plays the most complex character of the four. He's a wannabe but what does he want to be? He seems to emulate Lewis (Burt Reynolds) yet at the same time not wanting to be like him. This ambivalent attitude is further twisted by his hesitant attempt to kill, first a deer then a man. He also tends to be the actual leader of the men rather than Lewis, who seeks that position but doesn't have the leadership qualities necessary. All four men journey into the wilderness to canoe down the Cahulawassee River believing that this last vestige of the frontier before the dam waters cover it is a personal paradise far from the madding crowd of the big city. Soon the trip turns into a nightmare. The paradise becomes at best purgatory.The music adds so much to the film yet in reality it's just one song--although Drew (Ronny cox) does sing an old folk song in camp the first night. ""Dueling Banjos,"" originally ""Feuding Banjos,"" has just the right tempo and pitch to highlight the events of the movie. It starts off slowly, builds to a fast dance-type melody, then ends at a feverish lope, so fast the music seems to run away with itself. A bluegrass revival (if that's the right word since bluegrass was never a mainstream art form) was taking place in the United States due to the popularity of such shows as ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" both featuring the fabulous bluegrass team of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs. Virtuoso banjo picker Scruggs had almost single handedly revolutionized banjo playing with his own tuning methods. He had also written several songs especially for the instrument. Eric Weissberg took an old banjo piece from 1955 called ""Feuding Banjos"" recorded by Don Reno and Arthur ""Guitar Boogie"" Smith (later changed to ""Dueling Banjos"" by the Dillards)and played it for Lonnie (Billy Redden) and Drew (Ronny Cox) in the film. Today it is possibly better known than Scruggs' ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown.""The first half of ""Deliverance"" seems to crest when the brutal sadistic rape scene occurs. Following that horrendous part, the film slows down somewhat and becomes a bit disjointed. There are a few memorable images during the second half, the confrontation with the hunter on the mountain top, the dining interaction when Bobby (Ned Beatty) breaks the ice by declaring, ""this corn is special,"" the car pulling over so the church could pass, moving the graves, and the terror of the hand, but this is still the least satisfying piece of the movie. Director John Boorman had arguably already done his best work with ""Point Blank,"" a still under-appreciated cinematic creation. But ""Deliverance"" is certainly one of his triumphs. James Dickey did a commendable job adapting his book to film. His acting adds a bit of authenticity to the goings on, unlike Ken Kesey who refused to have anything to do with the screen version of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.""Though not without its flaws, this is one of my favorite flicks from the 1970's. In its own way it helps define that rather confused decade.",Deliverance
100,gab-14712,I'll Make You Squeal Like a Pig!,9,18 October 2017,"Let me open this review with a little history lesson. (I know, sooooo boring right?) My hometown of Lebanon used to be a bigger town. But in the 1970's, part of my town was leveled in order to create a reservoir. So people living in the area where the reservoir was being built had to leave their homes. So a part of our civilization vanquished for a manmade body of water. There is a similar theme in this film, Deliverance. The film takes place in the mountains of Georgia and a river which is very dear to our main characters is about to disappear because of a dam building which would flood the area. Like in my area, people have to leave their homes to escape the flooding. It is a very sad situation all around, but that theme makes this movie all the more better.I enjoyed Deliverance very much. It has been regarded of one of the best films of 1972 and I think I can agree with that. This is just a simple adventure of four men traveling the rapids in pursuit of some adventure, but of course problems will arise. The movie works very well as a adventure film and it was interesting to see how each character develops with some of the action that goes on. This film delivers on its promise of characterization. Each of the four men bring their personality to the trip. One dude is a macho man named Lewis (Burt Reynolds). He is the tough guy of the group and this expedition was his idea. The other main character is Ed (Jon Voight) who also exhibits some toughness skills (just watch that cliff climbing scene). Then we have Bobby (Ned Beatty) who is an overweight man that is afraid of many things it seems. Finally, we have Drew (Ronny Cox) who took part in my favorite scene in the movie- ""The Dueling Banjos"" Scene where he squared off against a mentally-challenged boy in a contest between a banjo and a guitar before the group began their journey.The scene that everyone talks about and that gave awareness to the movie is the scene where mountain men raped poor Bobby. It was a very well-made scene with such powerful lines of dialogue such as ""I'll make you squeal like a pig."" Regardless, it is a very brutal scene and it's incredibly hard to watch. The sequence was a pretty long one, but it showed an example of how men can survive in a harsh, primitive environment. Kudos to Jon Voight's character, Ed exacting revenge against the two men who raped Bobby. The film may seem like a quiet adventure film, but it becomes instantly loud the moment this scene appears. Director John Boorman does a wonderful job in creating tension and thrills setting up the scene before it actually happens.The acting is very good and I could expect no less for a film that features wonderful character development. Burt Reynolds plays a man with a machismo personality (no surprise there), but he does it very well. Jon Voight impressed me in this film. He was so great in 1969's Midnight Cowboy and was the best thing about 1970's mediocre Catch-22, so he really comes into his own here. The way he scaled the cliffs in order to kill those men showed what a brave man he was. This film was not insured and to save costs, each of the actors did their own stunts. If you saw that cliff, you would be very surprised. Ned Beatty gives a wonderful performance and a pained one. That scene where he got raped (and you see all of it on screen) is a powerful, intense scene and he gave such raw emotion. Ronny Cox arguably had the smaller role, but his scene where he is playing the banjo sticks out to me. His character seemed to be the most moral guy of the group.The film makes good use of its cinematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond. He was the man who filmed the gorgeous 1971 movie, McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Now he delivers great camera-work in this movie. It was a tough shoot because of the location of the movie set against rapids, but Vilmos really made it work and the picture is gorgeous set amongst the American wilderness.John Boorman delivered an exquisite adventure film in the form of Deliverance. It is a movie about survival and how men from the city can survive in the wild using their primitive instincts. The movie gained some controversy because of the squealing pig scene, but it remains a very powerful scene that is hard to watch. The other scene to keep an eye on is the banjo scene. That is essentially all of the music the film has, but it is quite worth it. The film has a gorgeous, naturalistic look and it is very well-acted. If you are looking for an adventure story, look no further than Deliverance.My Grade: A-",Deliverance
101,SmileysWorld,It all seemed so real.,9,12 March 2002,"The makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters,as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.The horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors,playing parts.I have never gotten so immersed in a film as I have this one.Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on screen,as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty,Ronny Cox,Bill McKinney,and though he appeared only briefly,James Dickey,the man who authored the book upon which the film is based,as the sheriff of Aintry.It is somewhat disturbing,and kids,of course,should be shielded from it,but this is great,dramatic cinema.",Deliverance
102,tonypeacock-1,Reynolds is the man. Squeal like a pig!,8,6 September 2018,"A thriller from 1972 that had escaped my viewing attention until last night but proved thought provoking and at times quite shocking.It follows in the vein of other thrillers of the era such as Straw Dogs (1971) and Last House On The Left (1972).Basically it follows four city guys who go on a 'country' trip to a fictional U.S. river, the River Chattooga that will shortly be no more because of the construction of a huge man-made dam.The four plan to canoe down the river past several rapids in glorious scenery of the river, the river banks and the woods that accompany them.The four are quite varied. Ed (Jon Voight) is quite quiet and more sensitive, the survivalist is Lewis (Burt Reynolds) the other two are Bobby (Ned Beatty (who I remember as Lex Luthors partner in crime in the Christopher Reeve Superman films)) and Drew (Ronny Cox).The film actually starts pretty slow for the first twenty minutes or so and struggled to keep my attention. What follows is a shocking scene of the assault of Bobby by a couple of locals and the murder in self defence of the attackers by Lewis by arrow.What follows is an hour or so of Survival Of The Fittest scenes as the group contemplate their next moves in disposing of the body, covering their tracks and getting back down river to the 'safety' of their cars and home!
Of course it isn't as simple as that what with some questionnable locals who are set to lose their land and towns because of the dam project.The film features a musical score reminiscent of Ennio Morrocone's themes from the Dollars Trilogy, an unforgettable ""feudin' banjos"" scene as Drew duets with a local blind boy with a banjo.The sexual assault of Bobby is of course shocking but the resultant story is edge of your seat stuff.""Squeal like a pig.""",Deliverance

Deliverance has a ton of memorable moments, and though it may leave you not ever wanting to see it again, its still a good movie that stays with you, even if you try to get rid of it.Deliverance is about four friends(played by Jon Voigt, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox) who go on a camping trip that they immediately regret. What they don't realize is that the territory they've stepped on is inbred territory, and after a member is raped, and an inbred is killed, they have to fight back and defend themselves.Deliverance has the same effect on you that Jaws has.

Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox portray four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before it is dammed up into what Reynolds calls ""one big, dead lake.""But the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these ""city boys"" carousing through their woods.  And the following day, continuing on down the river, Beatty and Voight are accosted and sexually assaulted (the film's infamous ""SQUEAL!"" sequence) by two vicious mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert ""Cowboy"" Coward).  Thus, what started out as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism.James Dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book, and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker.  Often known for its ""SQUEAL!"" and ""Dueling Banjos"" sequences, DELIVERANCE is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal, with the four leading men superb in their roles, and McKinney and Coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times.

I wasn't expecting the famous banjo scene to happen so early in the film - it was brilliant. The other infamous ""rape scene"" was just as disturbing as I imagined. Maybe even more so. The shock value was not bad for a film that came out in 1972.

111,asda-man,A squealy good trip,8,12 January 2012,"""Deliverance"" isn't strictly speaking a horror film, it's more of a sinister drama with seriously horrific moments and themes. Now that may seem obvious to people, but after seeing it being referenced in so many horror films, I was sort of expecting a 70's styled slasher films, but actually what I got was a lot more. ""Deliverance"" has a harrowing realistic atmosphere that gets lost in most films today. It's that atmosphere and realism that makes ""Deliverance"" quite a disturbing and frightening film, even for todays standards.Thinking back, not that much happens four people go off on a canoe, two hill billies arrive and they go off to kill the hill billies and the hill billies go off to kill the foursome. It doesn't seem like a lot, but it's the long drawn-out scenes and clean directing that makes ""Deliverance"" an extremely mature and unique film, especially for when it was made. Some scenes are extremely shocking for todays standards, the ""squeal like a pig"" scene is very disturbing, and the little banjo boy is very unnerving thanks to his lack of dialogue and unnatural responses. The duelling banjo scene is also quite electrifying, in just the way it's composed and executed.Conclusively ""Deliverance"" is a slightly different fright film, that has some fantastic directing and a great maturity that seems way ahead of its time. It's not a naff 70's horror film with piercing music and bad special effects. It's a very memorable tense drama with an unnervingly realistic atmosphere and intimidating cinematography. Its effects are also really good and so are the performances. Give ""Deliverance"" a go, I'll certainly be revisiting that canoing trip.",Deliverance

The movie is well acted by Mr. Beatty, Burt Renyolds, Jon Voight, and Ronny Cox. And the outdoor cinematography is breathtaking. But there's two things that stand out in this movie that make me love it. One is dueling banjos. The scene between the kid and the guy playing is one of the coolest songs ever. It rocks. I love when the kid breaks into warp-speed ho-down mode. The second thing I love is Ed O'Niell's first ever screen appearance. Being a huge Married With Children fan I have come to regard anything with Ed O'Niell as worth watching. And this being his first time in front of a camera is well.......Awesome.

113,MichaelMargetis,The Reason I'm Afraid of Rednecks...,8,14 August 2005,"I finally saw the controversial-for-it's-time 1972 motion picture 'Deliverance', and I have to tell you I still have that banjo tune stuck in my head. It's the the kind of hillbilly sounding one, Ronny Cox's character, Drew, plays with the mentally-challenged looking kid in the beginning of the film, which sets the unsettling mood 'Deliverance' possesses throughout it's entire runtime. I found 'Deliverance' to be a great film that will go down (if it hasn't already) as a classic. It wasn't as action-packed as I expected, but more dramatic which is probably why it won three Academy Award Nominations including 'Best Motion Picture of the Year'. 'Deliverance' is a great, intense and memorable film, that doesn't move very fast but it really doesn't have to.The story follows four friends from the city of Atlanta: Ed (Jon Voight - Midnight Cowboy), Lewis (Burt Reynolds - Smokey and the Bandit), Drew (Ronny Cox - Beverly Hills Cop), and the fat little piggy, Bobby (Ned Beatty - Network). To get away for the weekend, Lewis takes the three on a canoe trip in the creepy backwoods of Georgia to a lush and beautiful river that will be destroyed in a week's time to make room for a huge lake. They are having a fun and exciting getaway in the woods, when suddenly everything goes to sh*t. The four come across crazed in-bred butt-raping violent mostly-toothless locals that threaten the band of friends' lives. The movie then shifts from fun and happy to the intense and thrilling adrenaline rush that is 'Deliverance'. Jon Voight is spectacular as the lead character, Ed. Ed is a unsure of himself kind of guy, who when put into the frightening situation they are put in, has to pull it together. Voight provides such depth and passion to his otherwise kind of bleak character, it should have gotten him an Academy Award nomination for Best Lead Actor. Burt Reynolds is marvelous in one of his finest performances, as the tough, brave and outgoing Lewis, who is the natural leader of the friends. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast as the token fat little guy, and Ronny Cox is actually quite good in his role as the guitar strumming nice guy, Drew. The actors who played the crazy rednecks succeeded in creeping the hell out of me, also. John Boorman provides incredible direction to an incredible script, and I also loved the wondrous scenery that 'Deliverance' had.All in all, 'Deliverance' is a good cult film. If you don't find it too disturbing (that 'squeal like a piggy' scene really got under my skin), I think you'll appreciate the crafty film-making that 'Deliverance' is. In conclusion, 'Deliverance' has top-of-the-line directing, writing and acting, and it is important because it serves as a warning to those who view the film not to go camping in places you don't feel 100% comfortable in. I think the film spoke volumes to me because I've always been spooked of in-bred/redneck people. Grade: B+",Deliverance

Wow, was I wrong!The story is good, but I found that there were moments where it felt a little dragged out. It was filmed in 1972 and it has that great b-movie 70s feel to it. It was raw and harsh in places. One of the characters really goes through an experience that no-one should ever go through... it was filmed very well and was really horrible to watch.

115,AKS-6,Quite brilliant,7,25 March 2001,"I haven't seen this movie for at least ten years. I was probably around twelve or thirteen years old when I saw it for the first time. After that I always thought of the ""squeal like a pig""-scene as soon as someone mentioned Deliverance. But the film is so much more, and much better, than to have to be associated with that particular scene forever.Deliverance is about thirty years old, but according to me it does not feel or seem dated at all. It could have been made in the middle of the 90s, as far as I'm concerned. Jon Voight is great, the other actors are good as well, but Voight is quite brilliant. The film itself is also quite brilliant: great story and script, great acting and fantastic directing. Much better than I remembered it to be.",Deliverance
116,romanorum1,A Grisly Canoe Trip,9,10 July 2014,"On a weekend, four Atlanta businessmen of different personalities plan an adventure by canoeing the Cahulawassee (Chattooga) River in northern Georgia before a new dam turns it into a lake and floods much of the area land. The idea of the trip is really that of the leader of the group, rugged outdoor macho man Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds). Along with him are married, meditative, pipe-smoking art dealer Ed Gentry (Jon Voight), family man and guitar-playing sales supervisor Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox), and chubby bachelor insurance salesman Bobby (Ned Beatty). The last two are out of their element, and there is an eerie feeling all around. A major factor is the cultural clash and hostility of the mountain people; the film shows the effects of inbreeding among them. Sensing a perilous omen, Ed urges early on, ""Look, Lewis, let's go back to town and, ah . . . play golf."" As it turned out, it would have been better for the four men had Lewis heeded Ed's advice.The ""Dueling Banjoes"" scene featuring Drew with the deformed albino youngster (Billy Redden), which occurs less than ten minutes into the film, is a classic. After that the first day of paddling is quiet and unassuming: two men in each of two canoes. Later, on land, Ed takes aim at a deer with bow and arrow but misses. The problems begin on the following day (less than forty minutes into the movie), when Bobby and Ed canoe ahead and land, and soon are assaulted by two armed hillbillies. They have many missing teeth. Bobby is sodomized and only Lewis' timely arrival stops further damage. Lewis shoots one of the hillbillies (Bill McKinney) through the torso with a deft arrow; the other escapes (Herbert ""Cowboy"" Coward). The four men argue how the handle the tricky situation: bury the hillbilly or notify the authorities. Lewis' idea wins out over Drew's after he claims that all of the locals are related, and a later trial will not be a fair one. So the corpse is buried. But disaster, in the form of nature, strikes again. When the men resume paddling they hit a stretch of rapids. Suddenly a shot is thought to ring out, spilling Drew into the drink. While Drew disappears below the waterline, the other men are dashed against the rocks. Lewis breaks his right leg as the men come to rest in a gorge against a cliff where a hillbilly armed with rifle waits above. Now Ed must become the leader of what's left as Lewis' role is minimal for the rest of the feature. Barely able to speak, Lewis urges Ed to climb the cliff to go after the hillbilly. With much difficulty Ed scales the cliff and dispatches the mountain man, but also wounds himself in the process. Upon closer examination it is not entirely clear that the second dead hillbilly was indeed the surviving perpetrator. Anyway, the latest corpse is tossed into the river. After recovering Drew's body, weighing it down, and sending it back under the waterline, the three survivors struggle to make it back to a local town (Aintry). They have to get their stories straight and then notify the local authorities. Their dilemma is a moral one. The visual effects of ""Deliverance"" are stunning, the acting superior, and the narrative gripping. The story is a disturbing one, in which the author of the book, ecology-minded James Dickey, sees a wild nature turning on a civilized but tactless man. Characters are developed, and we experience how each one reacts to his own personal situation. By the way, author Dickey is investigating sheriff Bullard; a young Ed O'Neill plays a police officer in the hospital at the end. This feature represents one of the best films of 1972.",Deliverance
117,rdoyle29,An amazing film full of crockpot nonsense,10,7 June 2017,"Here's an example of a film that's greatness seems to transcend it's own bad ideas. Seen as a statement about the importance of survival and meeting challenges in being a man, it's really not very good, and doesn't really manage to deal with these ideas in the way that a film like ""Straw Dogs"" does. Reynolds's character is sort of the film's mouthpiece and he's frankly a bit of an idiot. But viewed as an action film, it's incredible ... one of the best ever made. It's a finely tuned machine with almost no spare parts and features some truly incredible cinematography from Vilmos Zsigmond and at least 5 incredible performances.",Deliverance

Voight deserves special commendation: from the moment the story takes its extremely violent turn, his eyes express everything you could ever want to know.There's a sense in which we've been here before: the imagery of the river journey into human degradation is reminiscent of Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS. The extra stuff we get here - scaling the rockface, the imminent inundation of the land - makes for good pictures but I'm not sure it adds much else. The thing about this sort of fiction is it doesn't go beyond the statement of what I regard as a fact: we're all a step away from savagery. Compare and contrast that real masterpiece, Croenenberg's A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, for a more profound examination of the human condition.",Deliverance

Burt Reynolds plays Lewis, the ""leader"" if the group who uses his ""nature instincts"" to guide them. Ned Beatty plays Bobby, the klutz of the group. And Ronny Cox plays Drew, the nervous man who obviously isn't cut out for this sort of thing.I love the shots of the water in this movie, and some of the hillbillies were very well portrayed.

121,Lebowskidoo,Merciless Wilderness Nightmare,10,22 February 2021,"""Dn't ever do nothin' like this again! Don't come back up here!""Deliverance is one of the most brutal adventure movies of the 70's. It hasn't lost any of it's power over the decades since it first came out. It's not hard to picture yourself in such a tense and terrifying situation while watching this, wondering what you would, or could, do.Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox all went supernova in Hollywood after this came out and was a huge success. Director John Boorman discovered Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox both doing theatre and cast them both in their movie debuts. Beatty was the only actor who had any experience in a canoe prior to filming. Ronny Cox was the very first person cast in the movie due to his guitar ability and his acting too.Bill McKinney became one of Hollywood's most popular villains in other movies and TV shows after his portrayal of the mountain man rapist. He even scared his costars with his method approach, Beatty would only film the rape scene one time and no more. Obviously, McKinney's performance struck terror into the hearts of many men who had never considered such a thing before, and had never seen it depicted in a movie until Deliverance.People are naturally curious about the banjo boy from the movie, played by Billy Redden. He was hand-picked at the local elementary school because of his large head, skinny body, odd-shaped eyes and big grin. All of this unfortunately branded him for life as the poster child for inbreeding.Author of the book, James Dickey, plays the intimidating sheriff at the end of the movie.

124,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Impressively visceral.,6,30 December 2011,"Deliverance sets itself apart from thrillers of a similar vein in the way that it totally subverts the genre and the types of men portrayed in this. The premise starts off simply, with a group of alpha males going for a canoe ride in the woodlands, but things take an expectedly dark turn. The narrative plays out in a standard way, but it goes to such deeper and more intricate lengths, particularly in it's display of violence. Here violence is taken to a level of brutality and shown in it's full glory, sinking deep into the brain and residing there.I think the film unfortunately peaks too early, with the infamous pig scene coming around the forty minute mark and that dug itself so deep inside of me that nothing that came after it could really compare. I think that the film really deconstructs these alpha male types and throws them through the ringer, pushing the audience through it with them. Particularly in the Jon Voight character I admired the way that they brought a lot more depth to him than I would have expected. There's this pacifism to him, where even in a kill-or-be-killed situation he's still hesitant to commit an act of violence, that I think spoke a lot truer to humanity than most thrillers do.After that infamous scene, though, it becomes kind of a standard thriller until the final act. Which was a good idea but given how brief the final act was, it didn't have as big of an impact as it should have. I think the film would have benefited from at least another half hour or so of the aftermath, instead of just a few quick scenes before disappearing. The ending though, is genius and at first felt a little too typical but the more I think about it the more I appreciate how simple and bluntly they let the audience know that this experience is never going to stop haunting these men.",Deliverance

126,jayjaycee,"Shattered my expectations, but Reynolds is brilliant",6,21 May 2020,"""Deliverance"" is a 1972 adventure thriller directed by John Boorman starring Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Upon the passing of the legend that Burt Reynolds is, I became aware of the existence of this film, as it is not only cited as his breakthrough role, but also as one of the best films he has ever starred in. For a long time that film faded from the spotlight and I wasn't able to get hold of a copy of this film and never thought I would be ever getting it, but then, earlier this year, it was all suddenly recommended to me and since it was on sale, I purchased it. I was extremely stoked to finally see what everyone was talking about and to see if the high ratings on several platform actually hold up to the quality of the film. In my case, I was severely disappointed by the final outcome. Do you know this situation when you come along a movie that is completely different to what is said about it in advertisements and other forms of summaries? It is not quite different with this one. For example, I previously read about it and found out that this classic is one of the biggest influences for the British horror gem ""The Descent"" and even though I of course didn't expect to witness the same kind of gore fest that this film is, I hoped to at least see the ""realistic horror"" this classic film is praised for and that it would at least shock me in this context. Sadly, it didn't and that isn't the only thing that didn't resonate with me. First of all, it was almost impossible for me to find some sort of connection to any of the characters at all, as most of the shots in the beginning, the most ideal moment to introduce your characters to the audience, mainly consisted of wide shots that literally made it hard for me to get close to them. It is such a pity, as I like ""Midnight Cowboy"" Jon Voight as an actor, but I simply could not find sympathy to them at all. The only one that genuinely had me curious was Reynolds's Lewis. Not only was he in an extraordinarily good shape, with the vest and the bow he also was an extremely charismatic and iconic character that I immediately began to like. Furthermore, I felt how a conflict-laden interdependence between him and Ed began to develop and that this film would put their weird friendship on a test quite frequently, I mean, one is a city person to the core and the other is an outdoor fanatic and a nature boy who loves the extreme. There could have been a lot of conflict potential in the air and this could have been one of the biggest strengths of this flick, but as you can guess from how I phrase this sentence, this really didn't happen. After playing a more or less significant role in an early scene he then is incapacitated and thus degraded to a useless side character who doesn't add anything to the plot anymore. This wasn't only heavily disappointing to see in general, it simultaneously shattered my expectations to see some tension between the two. Instead, the focus lies on Ed from there on and how he puts on a one man show, but this doesn't change the fact that as a character, he still is underdeveloped and uninteresting. The only thing that gave him some personality was being the total opposite of Lewis, but since this bond is broken like a bone quite quickly, there is nothing left that made him interesting to follow in any way. Another thing that heavily displeased me was the experimental score. Except for some banjo tones and the famous duel in the beginning, the film refrains from using any from of sound score. While I do understand that this was a stylistic device to underline the roughness and tantalizing mercilessness of nature, it was extremely irritating to me personally. Sounds and any form of background music are there to create atmosphere in a film and support the tension. It is a common fact and there are only a few exceptions were the procedure of omitting it works out, but in those cases, it is only for a few sequences, not the other way around. So, who the hell thought it was a great idea to follow this strategy for a whole feature film? Not only was it almost impossible for me to perceive any form of atmosphere, it on top of that appeared uncomfortably soporific to me. In case of a film that promised to depict an adrenaline-fuelled white-water rafting per excellence, this is nothing but a shame. The plot of the film doesn't make it any better. What is said about this film on the summary on the back of the physical copy makes me assume that I would witness a cruel fight for survival, the ultimate battle of man versus nature. Well, aside from some minor obstacles and an altercation with some backwoodsmen there wasn't something I would consider to be an immense and life-threatening danger. To be honest, they all got out of the situation surprisingly easily and almost unharmed. Of course one of their friends was killed (although it obviously looked like suicide to me), one was raped by a hillbilly and another broke his upper leg along the way, but aside from that they are neither lost nor did it in any way seem that they wouldn't make it out alive. I was sure from quite early in the film that they would all get out of there and that predictability made it boring rather than packing. Also, after some time, it was just annoying to follow the remaining guys, as the scenes only contained of them shouting each other's names continuously. In the end, I knew their names, but still that wasn't enough for me to like them, nor was it enough for them to have a personality. Even when the film tried to focus more on the moral dilemma after they killed two men and on how they cope with this delicate topic, this actually interesting aspect wasn't elaborated well enough either. Oh, let's also not forget about the intended social criticism on how humankind destroys nature that was implied right in the beginning. The biggest problem of the film is how it wants to include all of those said aspects but doesn't manage to find a main focus. Instead, all of them are lighted only half heartedly and get lost along the way. Also, the final twenty minutes in which they try to cover up their crimes and try to deal with their guilty conscience just lacks the intensity that is required in an extremely emotional sequence like that. All in all, this film heavily disappointed me and my high expectations, as it wasn't either packing nor in any way threatening to me. Too many things just didn't resonate with me and too many decisions were questionable in my opinion and in the end, I was mainly bored than actually excited. The characters had no personality and the story was way too tame to be called a wild ride. It didn't impact me in the slightest and in the end, was forgettable rather than a cinematic masterpiece as apparently everyone makes it out to be. When I watch a film that is supposedly bad and I end up disliking it, it of course is still a bad film, but not surprise at all. On the other hand, when I hope to see brilliance and prepared myself accordingly and the film ends up being bad, it is a different and more shattering kind of disappointment. The only thing I praise in this film is Burt Reynolds's great but way too short performance, but that's already all. In the end, this film is the cinematic equivalent of a tranquil creek, rather than rapid stream as it is said to be. Shattered my expectations like a canoe on a rock.",Deliverance

131,Jacques98,Please deliver me from this cliché storyline.,6,22 January 2009,"With a plot synopsis that is literally a single incomplete sentencefour guys go canoeingand an execution of that synopsis that is even less attention-grabbing, I fail to see why Deliverance was even made. Because of its age, it's pretty much inevitable that it would be hyped up to oblivion by all the self-proclaimed film experts, but that's to be understood. When you're at a formal dinner, sipping fine wine, saying 300 is your favorite movie is going to get you awkwardly stared in the same way a kindergartener would get stared at if he said he was wearing underwear with Isaac Newton on them, not Dora the Explorer (or whatever kids watch these days). In that situation, it's best to say something from the 70s because, by God, every movie from the 70s is gold and everything from the 2000s is crap. It's understandable. But what I don't understand is how Deliverance can be so acclaimed within the casual crowd. I simply can't picture either a teenage kid listening to screamo or a middle aged man who's cheating on his wife finding enjoyment in Deliverance. It's the positive reviews from those people that disturb me. In fact, I'm going as far as to say the amount of positive reviews from the casual crowd disturbs me infinitely beyond that of the supposed ""brutal"" content of this movie.I'm a sap for slow-build movies. If you can grab my attention with a slow, atmospheric buildup, I'll be just as interested as if you bashed me in the balls with a god-awesome action scene. Deliverance knows how to do an effective slow build flawlessly. For the first hour I so interested in Deliverance I thought to myself: ""This movie could do absolutely nothing to earn a bad score. Nothing."" The buildup involved very well shot scenes of extreme canoeing, and the naturalist part of my mind was ready to have an orgasm from the awesomeness. (Okay, okay. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little for the melodramatic effect of my next sentence.) So there I am, on the edge of nirvana, andBOOM!out of nowhere the cliché ""conflict"" hits the plot and every good thing I had to say about this film went to hell. Not because the conflict was disturbing or gave me, the viewer, the feeling of desperation, but because it was so cliché. As I said, the movie is about nothing but four guys going canoeing: who would have guessed something bad is going to happen to them? Really? As if I didn't see that coming. I just wish for once a movie would be realistic or edgy enough to have NOTHING bad happen to the characters. At least then it wouldn't be so ungodly predictable. You say, ""But if that happened, then there wouldn't be a plot!"" And you'd be right. But you're forgetting one small detail: Deliverance had no plot to begin with. ""Four guys go canoeing and something bad happens . . ."" is as much of a plot as, ""Four guys go to Wal-Mart and they can't find the brand of toothpaste they wanted . . ."" So how can you argue with me when I say Deliverance would have been better if it had just stuck with the buildup, rather than add some cliché bad situation into the mix? At least that way it would have at least had entertainment value, and sacrificed nothing the actual movie has now except a few clichés.Without spoiling anything, the oh-so-bad events that happen aren't even that bad. The scene that seems to upset everyone was really almost comical. I actually laughed. The bad events all generic for 70s films. You've seen one 70s walking-down-the-street-and-then-bad-stuff-happens film, you've seen them all. They do nothing but copy Straw Dogs or A Clockwork Orange, or copy each other, and then they get acclaimed for being so original. It's ludicrous. There is nothing original about Deliverance, nor is there anything disturbing about it. It's typical in every single aspect. And if there is a moral point, I missed it because it was so cliché I couldn't tell it apart from the countless other clichés. What is the point of watching a movie for the moral point if it has no impact on your life or how you think? The only sole good thing I can even say about Deliverance is that it does have some very good directing scattered throughout. There are one or two scenes that are really some of the most effective nature shots in cinema history. But they last a whopping 20 seconds, and then the movie is back to its boring clichés and predictable story, so they're not worth watching the film for.Really, there isn't anything in Deliverance that makes it worth watching whatsoever. I've seen countless reviews use the term ""this film insults my intelligence"" because of some plot twist they were too dumb to see coming in modern movies. But here I am to use it against them: Deliverance insulted its own intelligence. It started off with perfection, then it collapsed in on itself because the director thought he needed to insert some cliché plot/moral to be literary. He failed to have the intelligence to understand literary isn't always best. And, more importantly, he failed to have the intelligence on how to make a good movie.2/10",Deliverance

135,fimimix,..one of life's frightening sides..,10,7 July 2006,"""Deliverance"" is a dead-on example of what wonderful movies came out of the '70s. While your jaw is dropped during a ""Terminator"" movie, are you really sacred? I don't think so, because you are there to see what new CGIs have been strung together - plot matters not.So many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all, because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market.....or a walk down a dimly-lighted street. ""Deliverance"" is SO frightening, because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart-beat. Venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun? Anyone who has that notion does not read the papers, watch the daily news, nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of ""trespassing"" into territories where outsiders are not welcome. It is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on ""Deliverance"" didn't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic, and ""squeal like a pig"" wasn't a part of ""Deulling Banjos"".I hate the term ""hillbillies"", because - as some ""users"" wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life. Much is made of ""inbred"" - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods. ""Chinatown"" should teach us that lesson. However, city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude. I know lots of ""hillbillies"" - they are moral people, when left to themselves. Their ""justice"" can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated, just like the ""justice"" in city streets. They don't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites.""Deliverance"" was the last film I found Jon Voight to do any real acting - I hope I'm wrong. He was extremely underpaid for ""Midnight Cowboy"", because he was unknown, but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat. His acting in ""Deliverance"" was superb. It gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains, if it's necessary - but who wants to be thought-of as ""ordinary"" today? His stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant. Wow! for Burt Reynolds !!! One must ask what led him into those other tacky films? His manliness, although misguided, in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods, but the wilderness of everyday-life. Ned Beatty was stellar - his underwear may not have had ""Versace"" stitched on it, but his shell-shocked performance was perfect. As noted, he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie. Ronny Cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have his determination to do what is right. Several ""users"" have theorized he was shot, or lost his balance when he pitched-into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey, he committed suicide. No gunshot was heard during the scene and Voight and Beatty did not find a wound.James Dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale, and was great as the sheriff - it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day. His character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving, but also knew they didn't stand a chance against a jury of the local people, no matter how kindly they were treated in ""Aintry"". He was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel. Justice ? - ""don't come back up here again"". Not many ""users"" knew ""hillbillies"" were used in the film where ever it was possible - what actors could portray them better? The ""mountain-men"" WERE actually mountain-men.......Every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in. Play in? Better ""fight-for-your-life"" in. I've experienced some near-dangerous incidents, and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part.That we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable. To be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling, but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it. Los Angeles, where I live, is a perfect example: it's built-up right into the territories for wild animals, and steadfastly believes humans come before animals. Those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that. Any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods? They're theirs.In some less threatening way, we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from ""Deliverance"" - to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy. I thank all those city-slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic, so that it can scare the heck out of me when I watch it. You can have the thrill of danger - I'll stick to the TV. 30-out-of-10.",Deliverance
136,frankwiener,Enter With Caution,8,15 February 2017,"At the risk of triggering the possible removal of my own reviews, which are far from perfect, I wish the editors of IMDb would be more selective about the ""user reviews"" that they pass for publication here. More selectivity would upgrade the website immensely, especially the elimination of the nonsense that sometimes accompanies films that have achieved commercial success. While most of the user reviews here are seriously written and therefore worthwhile, even when I don't agree with them, a minority of writers, many of whom can't even properly put two full, English sentences together, ruin it for everyone, as has become all too common on the Internet in general. There. I finally got that off my chest.The much discussed confrontation between the local mountain men and the characters of Ed (John Voight) and Bobby (Ned Beatty) was not merely placed in the original book for gratuitous or sensationalist purposes. Although it is a very graphic and disturbing scene, it exists to illustrate one of the book's most important themes. While the group of adventurers seeks ""deliverance"" from what might be overly restrictive and even oppressive rules and conventions of modern civilization, they are totally unprepared for the absence of such restrictions in a world that they obviously do not know. Instead of being liberated from the confining norms of urban existence, they suddenly find themselves as endangered victims of a world where such social rules and regulations no longer exist. To me, there are some similarities of the ""horror"" the men find here to the theme of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", which was adapted to the screen as ""Apocalypse Now"".Similarly, the writer does not exploit physical deformities for purely sensationalist purposes. These are conditions that are plainly visible in the rural world of the remote mountains rather than being kept hidden as they are in the ""civilized"", middle class world to which the urban adventurers are accustomed. The disfigured locals therefore serve as a forewarning to the visitors that the world they are about to enter is one that is very different from the one that they know. Accordingly, they need to apply, with much humility, the caution that they never exercise before it is too late for them. This film beautifully captures not only the natural sights of the river but the sounds as well. In general, I thought that the direction by John Boorman and the performances were excellent, including those of the lesser known actors who play the two menacing mountain men, Bill McKinney and Herbert ""Cowboy"" Coward. I am very impressed by the fact that the four leads risked doing their own stunts, including the swift water sequences. Accolades especially go to John Voight for scaling the gorge and to Burt Reynolds for quickly learning how to use a bow and arrow on short notice.My only problem was with the often hokey and hackneyed dialogue, especially at the beginning, but that seems minor in comparison to the highly suspenseful and thought provoking action that follows.",Deliverance

Not a Burt Reynolds fan, and having only seen two other works by Boorman (the great 'Point Blank' and the not-so-great 'Exorcist II: The Heretic'), I wasn't in a huge hurry to rush out and see the film. BIG mistake on my part, to be frank.Probably the gifted 83-year-old, Surrey native and five-time Oscar nominee's best work (only an outsider could film America from this angle)--and easily the finest work ever done by Reynolds, shortly before he simply rested on his laurels and became nothing but a caricature. THIS at the very least was proof that he at one time actually had chops and could act.The scariest aspect of all is that this goes on all the time and we just don't know about it. Hundreds of people go 'missing' every day.

As for Burt, well he exuded masculinity and confidence and his acting chops were up there with the greats.I read the book after I'd seen the movie and it was a masterful screenplay adaptation, I would call it a precursor to the Coen Bros movies that we all love.My very favourite scene, though, is when the Sheriff appears at the end and tells them they'd better ""git!""

I mean it is one of Sterling Archer's favourites, so that should be enough said.In all seriousness though, Deliverance has a few of those scenes that will never be forgotten such as the banjo duelling, and the infamous 'squealing' scene. With that disturbing scene, you could say it was way ahead of its time, as I don't think many people who watched it when it first came out would have expected that; talk about shock value. Props have to be given to Ned Beatty's character considering what happened to him, he handled it like a champ the remainder of the story.

I'm also in total adversity towards those who think its a sickening display of human nature. Deliverance is a masterpiece. Never before have I seen a film that captured the survival spirit under nightmarish circumstances and left you limp with realism. It's a harrowing account of what could possibly happen in these kinds of situations. This movie is not only macho guy heroism with vulgarities. It had to be believable and real and it succeeds on all levels of artistic value. James Dickey's novels were about men battling with the wilderness and being forced to test themselves against others and nature. John Boorman's direction raises the stakes by showing the dark side of human nature, revenge, survival and explores the beautiful natural world which can be gentle as well as cruel. Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty all give admirable performances. John Boorman chose real mountain hillbillies for the minor roles to add authenticity to the environment and uses them with discretion and appropriate subtlety. The duelling banjo sequence is a highlight that serves as a precursor to the horror that thus follows. All guys should watch ""Deliverance"" with their girlfriends.

145,deacon_blues-3,Feeds paranoia about the wilderness,8,30 April 2012,"I give the film high marks for acting and cinematography, but this film did more to feed paranoia about the evils of the American wilderness and its people than any other. It is true that one should not venture into the wilderness without being prepared and know what you're up against, but the great outdoors is not the home of a bunch shiftless, genetically inferior perverts who want to hear strangers squeal like a pig while they're being sexually abused. I would much prefer relying on the hospitality and friendliness of most of the people you meet in the wilderness than on most of the people you might encounter in a big city! As Dirty Harry Callahan used to intone, ""A man's got to know his limitations."" These guys didn't. They were led by an arrogant hot-shot who took foolish risks from the inception of this fictional adventure, and they ended up just like one would have expected, minus the stereotypical retards and perverts that the countryside is purported to be teeming with according to the writers of this script. The fictionally soon-to-be-no-more Cahulawassee river, which was really the Chattooga river, is still intact as a scenic wilderness area, and will remain so for a very long time into the future.

It's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie. People tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene.The acting, plot, cinematography, and soundtrack of Deliverance all lend a hand to it's brooding charisma. The backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter. The actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them. The thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires. Not many films can make you feel this creeped out. Bottom Line: This movie is a classic.

What I loved about the directing is that he doesn't give anything away. They stop of for fuel at an station owned by hillbillies, in fact the whole place is swarmed by hillbillies. Despite this, you never get a sense that anything terrible is going to happen . Just like the four lads, all you know is that your going on a nice , peaceful canoe trip.

The brilliant camera work on both the peaceful and chaotic canoe trip was that good that I wanted to go out and start canoing. I never thought of that before but it was so fun watching them steam down the river . This was also helped by the engaging characters which all actors portrayed brilliantly .The ending was directed with perfection.

This film was made in the early 70's, decades before the Bechtel test and the PC police. If this were made today they would show the men obsessing over their wives and kids constantly , if they were even ALLOWED to go on a trip without them. In this piece they barely mention their families, and when they do they question how worth it they are; just like guys do in real life....Four guys go on a trip canoeing down a wild river. Only one, Burt Reynolds, is a very experienced outdoors man, and one of them , Ned Beatty, is totally out of his element. They encounter trouble early, with difficult rapids they have a tough time getting through. In addition, some of the local Hillbillies assault them at gunpoint, and they narrowly escape with their lives.The story is good in it's plausibility, and the acting competent. The reviews I read that didn't like it seem to miss the point of the realistic encounters these city boys have with the difficulties of nature, a harsh environment we are all only a few generations removed from. Most who enjoy the film will probably be those of us who have dabbled in the rough outdoors, and seen how mismatched the fight was between us and nature.The famous scene in this film is actually only a footnote, the real point is spinning a yarn about survival , and how it would look if most of us tried to, without the modern convinces of modern life we all enjoy today, to survive in the wild.

A dam has been constructed that will create a lake out of most of the river, so this is their last chance to experience this adventure.
In one of the best scenes ever in a movie, early on one of the men plays the instrumental song ""Dueling Banjoes"" with a local boy. All of the local men are portrayed as mentally weak and backward and treated as such by the four men from the city. The boy on the banjo is portrayed as an idiot savant in the area of music.
What seems to be a pending duel between man and nature quickly becomes a battle between the four men, nature and two very rough men of the mountains. When the two teams of two are separated, one of the teams encounters two local men that are portrayed as being slightly above animals. One of the businessmen is sexually assaulted and when the two locals start planning to sexually assault the other, he is shot dead by a hunting arrow.
This increases the tension as the four men debate what to do with the body. They eventually decide and continue on their trip. However, all is not well within the group, and when one appears to passively just fall out of the boat and drown, they believe that he was shot, even though no one heard the sound of a gun.
After one receives a serious injury, the three remaining men finally make it back to civilization and tell their made up story to local law enforcement. While there is no hard evidence that they are lying, the deputies do not believe them.
This movie was groundbreaking in the sense that it portrays some types of sexual content that was generally taboo in the mainstream movies. It is an action/adventure movie that is harsh and unpredictable. One most significant fact about the movie is that the four male actors did their own stunts, when the canoes are going over the rapids, it is the actors that are riding the waves.",Deliverance

154,wandereramor,"Squeal like a pig, etc, etc.",8,11 August 2014,"Deliverance is one of those movies that's defined by one scene (you probably know the one) in a way that really doesn't do justice to the film as a whole. Its central thematic concern is the changing relationship between the urban American and the wilderness. Deliverance smartly makes its protagonists Southern urbanites to mitigate the kind of cultural biases that a story about murderous hillbillies calls up, although it's still not exactly a positive portrayal of the Appalachians community. As much as our quartet of hikers profess a love of nature, their relationship with the interior is profoundly antagonistic, a mixture of antagonism and a desire to conquest. Their interaction with the locals is a synecdoche of the larger geological transformation hanging over the whole film: the destruction of a complex wilderness to meet the water needs of growing cities.What's so refreshing about Deliverance is that it flatters absolutely no one. Burt Reynolds plays a primitivist alpha male, a role he would spend the next couple decades misinterpreting, and while his steely nihilism is attractive at first he is ultimately rendered useless. Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox are buffoons of entirely different stripes. Jon Voight plays a civilized man whose descent into savagery is never made heroic. Despite being famous for a scene of violence, Deliverance never revels in its depravity in the same way that some of its contemporaries do. These characters have some surprisingly philosophical debates, debates that are ultimately rendered meaningless as they scramble for pure survival. And as for the much-vaunted interior, it's represented by a pair of rapacious monsters who are just as intent on reducing people to animals as the city-dwellers are.John Boorman is a competent director but has trouble livening up the scenes that take place outside of the main action. The opening dueling banjos scene is brilliant, and basically sums up the entire film, but the initial rafting and camping is a slog and the epilogue stretches on too long. The lack of strong direction stops Deliverance from really being among the elite of the New Hollywood films, but it's a respectable entry into that tradition nevertheless. In terms of both its politics and its art, Deliverance captures a moment in time that was already vanishing, and does so in vivid and unforgettable fashion.",Deliverance

156,GMJames,The movie still holds up,10,10 January 2001,"After seeing ""Deliverance"" for the umpteenth time, I still amazed at how credible the situation is as presented by writer James Dickey and director John Boorman. It's a contrived idea that's based on reality not fantasy. What would I do if I was in that situation? That's a very terrifying thing to consider. That's why ""Deliverance"" holds up very well since its initial release in 1972.Burt Reynolds gave what is arguably his best performance (with the possible exceptions of ""Starting Over"" and ""Boogie Nights""). His character Lewis was the ultimate macho man at the beginning of the film but in the end, because of the incidents on the river, is knocked down a few notches literally and figuratively.Jon Voight's character Ed was certainly the heart and soul of the movie; Testing himself to the limit to survive a very extraordinary situation. Voight gave a very multi-layered performance.Ronny Cox's character Drew seem to be the most rational of the four characters. He wanted to do the right thing. He was able to communicate with the banjo playing kid at the beginning. Cox made me care about Drew and his character's fate. Although he's been in a number of movies and TV shows since ""Deliverance"" (notably, ""The Onion Field"" and the final season of ""St. Elsewhere"") I don't think the roles that Cox has performed has had the same type of quality in his debut performance.Bill McKinney and Herbert ""Cowboy"" Coward are only in the movie for about 10 minutes. They are two of the most terrifying villains in screen history. (It was nice to see McKinney in ""The Green Mile"" as a prison guard who's responsible for the operating the levers for the electric chair.)As for Ned Beatty, i've been a fan of his for many years. (Of note, ""Network"", the first two ""Superman"" movies, the great TV movie ""Friendly Fire"", ""Homicide: Life on the Street"", and others.) It's a shame that some moviegoers still tease him about his character's compromising situation. Do some people realize that the movie is very faithful to the novel? It certainly doesn't hurt that James Dickey wrote both the novel and the screenplay.Having read the novel, I wondered how they were going to handle the scene when Ed and Bobby were held at shotgun point. As I mentioned before, I believe that the situation is not as impossible as some insensitive people might think. Didn't anyone realize that just like Ed, Bobby is a survivor? He may have been victimized but with the help of Ed, and prayer (he whispered ""Oh God, deliver us from this...) but he did survive. Beatty's performance has stuck with me since I first saw the movie in the early 1980's.Director John Boorman has had his ups (""Excalibur"", ""Hope and Glory"") and downs (""Exorcist II: The Heretic"") in his career. I believe ""Deliverance"" is his best film.",Deliverance

Priceless.The mountain folk look the part and have become what we compare people to that look a little rough around the edges.What music this movie has is brilliant and has become iconic.Who hasn't hummed the theme from this movie once or twice when they've found themselves in a questionable spot with some locals while visiting an unfamiliar place? After battling the mountain men and the river to get back to town the surviving city men then have to endure a sheriff(wonderfully played by Dickey himself) who tries to find out what exactly happened up on that river.This is one of the all time classic movies and is masterfully directed by John Boorman.After watching the great acting in this movie you can only wonder what happened to the careers of Reynolds and Voight after this movie and why they both only made one or two decent movies in the 35 years since this film.But in this film,they and everyone else, are absolutely perfect.",Deliverance

The problem that I had with it was that I spent most of the second half of the movie yelling at the characters to take other, more rational, more obvious actions than the ones that they were taking. It was as if I was watching a cheesy horror movie and the group was about to split up rather than stay together. Also, I was not overly impressed with any characters or performances. They were good, but nothing special. The plot was good enough. The situation was interesting and definitely kept me interested. As I said before, the suspense factor could not have been better, but the movie as a whole could have.

Dickey states in his novel that one day, the American wilderness will soon expired because of the technology that we have today. He states that the rivers and streams in the wild is very useful to our environment. Even after Dickey's passing, we still today struggle through this hardship. The fact that in today's world, the environment is still hanging in the balance.The movie version of the bestseller is a perfectly great example of his theory. Four Atlanta businessmen, Ed, (Jon Voight), Lewis, (Burt Reynolds), Drew, (Ronny Cox), and Bobby, (Ned Beatty), are spending their weekend canoeing down an Georgia river that will soon turn into a lake, thanks to the local power company damming the river. The four men all come from different backgrounds and perspectives. Ed is a mild- mannered everyday man who has a wife, a kid and a profession he enjoys. Lewis is a outdoors-man. He is very concerned by the fact that the river is turning into a lake. He even has his philosophy about machines taking over the land that America sits on. Drew is a very deeply moral person. He doesn't seem to bother anybody since he spends most of his time playing his guitar. Bobby is a lovable, sometimes clumsy person who seems to have a big heart. In the beginning of their canoe trip, the group tries to communicate with the locals by telling them that they want someone to drive their cars down to Aintry, which is the closest town near the river. The folks, however, are not very friendly. Some are inbred, while other suffered from the living conditions.After settling in, the boys decides to canoe down the river and along the way, they run into a pair of backwoods men. One of them is a mountain man, (Bill McKinney), who turns the movie into a very sinister adventure film. As the canoe trip becomes more and more dangerous to handle, the boys find themselves in constant danger after committing an murder in the woods since one of the mountain man raped Bobby. The cinematography of the movie is very beautifully done by Vilmos Zsigmond. He does know how to photograph unfake shots of the mountains and especially the white water. The whole movie is very well- photographed since the movie has a very deceiving look of the wilderness. It also as if there's something evil lurking under something beautiful. It always nice to see a movie where there's an authentic look and feel of nature itself. Even though some people never went canoeing down a river, this is a perfect example what could happen when you travel through the rapids and the jagged rocks that are in the river.One of the best scenes in Deliverance is when Drew and a local boy feud against each other with their musical instruments. Drew is strumming his guitar, peacefully. The local boy, with a very dark look on his stoned face, plucks on one of his strings on his banjo. This scene is famously called ""Dueling Banjos"", since the music involves shows the contrasts of city life and country life. Of course, that is very significant in the movie. But never done quite like this before. The attitude that the boys have on the locals is another example of the city life/country life contrast. Lewis seems to taunt the locals by instigating them. But, even with his wisecracks, Lewis doesn't seem to realize that he could wound up being hurt if he doesn't close his mouth.Ever since Deliverance was released, people had mixed feelings toward the way the locals were represented in the movie. Billy Redden, who plays the banjo player, said that he enjoyed working on the movie and said that it is just a movie. Yet some locals thinks the movie is an insult to those who live in deep Georgia. In my opinion, a movie is a movie. I doubt that the makers of this movie were creating a land that was slipping away at the time. In fact, there are a lot of ideas that Deliverance has to offer.Several critics stated that the movie is an allegory of the Vietnam War. To some, that is a very interesting point because according to Lewis, the boys, not knowing that they going into uncharted territory, are raping the land. They have no idea what they are about to get into. That statement can be made about the ongoing Vietnam War that was going on at that time. And besides, the unforgettable climax of the movie is a example of what the American soldiers experienced while coming to America. The fact that Ed, suffers from what happened on the river. Not only Ed, but Lewis, Bobby and even Drew.Out of all of the movies that Burt Reynolds starred in, this is his best. This movie is long before he starred in Smokey and the Bandit in 1977. His performance in Deliverance is great and also interesting because you think that they would hired an different actor to play Lewis. But, Reynolds is outstanding. He doesn't grandstand or overact his part. He plays Lewis very sharp. Jon Voight, who at the time was struggling to become a serious actor is very well-casted in this movie. To me, Voight plays Ed in a very mild-mannered way. He is very open- minded especially in a scene where the boys talk about what they are going to do with the body. Voight in that scene holds himself back while the others try to figure out what to do. The two lesser known actors, Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty, did a very good job. Beatty is perfect as Bobby, the clumsy and always cheerful businessman. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Deliverance
160,Hawkensian,Deliverance is one of the great films of the 1970s that molded my love for film.,9,25 September 2014,"My first viewing of Deliverance occurred a long time ago; it left a large impression on me, so large in fact that I wrote a review for IMDb on August 28, 2005 at the age of only 12.The header for the ten star review was simply 'Atmopsheric'. For some reason, I immediately compared the film to Predator – 'I thought the surroundings in Predator were good, but Deliverance beats it by far with the beautiful untouched countryside and the Cahulawassee River that runs through it.' I continued, saying that Deliverance is a 'masterful portrayal of each man's change of character under stress'. I was initially surprised by the maturity of that comment, but I'm fairly sure I copied it from the DVD case. I rounded the review off by naming it a 'real treat' and a 'top notch thriller'. Despite its plagiarism and mere 110 word length, I agree with the little I wrote 9 years ago. The film was 33 at the time; it is now 42 and as good as ever.The film, which is based on the book by James Dickey, follows Ed (Jon Voight), Drew (Ronny Cox), Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Lewis (Burt Reynolds). The three men are contented, middle-class executives who would gladly play golf in lieu of hunting, climbing and rafting. The only reason the trip happened was because of Lewis, a competitive, playground bully and some sort of survivalist. Unlike the others, he has no time for humour in the Georgia wilderness; he takes himself and the trip very seriously, appearing to consider it a spiritual exercise akin to the Aboriginal tradition of walkabout.The unlikable Lewis almost immediately takes a churlish disliking to Bobby, addressing him as 'chubby', barking orders at him and interrupting him with smug, portentous monologues about his ostensible understanding of their majestic, harsh surroundings. Before the relationships between the four men can be explored in a normal fashion, they are thrown into an extraordinary situation in a scene that has since become infamous for its line 'squeal like a piggy'. What follows is a thriller that achieves an uncommon resonance because of the everyday, almost banal qualities of its characters; they are real people in a real situation rather than stock characters being assailed by monstrous caricatures.Like I said in 2005, it is indeed a beautifully verdant film. The 'Cahulawasse River' isn't a real river, the turbulent rapids and beautiful surrounding forests that we see are that of the Chattooga River in Georgia. The landscape and their traversing of it is well captured; I shared the four men's expressions of wired engrossment as they negotiated the dangerous rapids with the utmost concentration, and I felt their elation too when they reached the tranquillity of the calmer waters. The excellent Blu-Ray surround sound places you there, it enveloped me with the interminable sounds of buzzing insects and rushing water. Despite everything that happens in Deliverance, the film certainly makes me want to travel.The wild local people were well cast, they were seemingly picked from some West Virginia backwood, providing the film with a morbid authenticity. Perhaps the most memorable villager is the teenage banjo virtuoso played by Billy Redden in the famous Duelling Banjos sequence. He was picked from a school in the local area and isn't actually playing the banjo, the arms and fingers we see actually belong to a musician sitting behind the bench with his arms through Redden's sleeves. While the film is best known for its plucking banjos, it makes great use of a synthesiser in a few instances, producing this chilling monotone hum that works particularly well when Ed become entangled underwater.The performances are good, but they aren't given that much dramatic range as there isn't much dialogue, for large portions of the film the performances rely on physicality. I am nit- picking here and not entirely decided, but with his wide-eyed expressions and animated ungainly movements, I felt that Voight was at times rather exaggerated in his conveyance of being a city slicker unused to the rugged Appalachian terrain. It is perhaps Ned Beatty's assailant Bill McKinney who deserves the most praise, because as Burt Reynolds points out during the 40th anniversary reunion of the four men, he kept his eyes open without fault for a quite remarkable length of time, anyone who's been locked in a bitter staring competition can attest that it's no small feat!I haven't read James Dickey's novel, I have found it quite a difficult book to find, but I have heard that, unsurprisingly, the characters are given a more detailed backstory. I would have welcomed a longer film with greater character development, but it works admirably as a stripped down survivalist thriller.Deliverance is one of those films that I will always be fond of. My first viewing came at a time when my cinematic horizons were rapidly broadening along with my prized DVD collection, which I proudly ordered and compartmentalised in rectangular shelves across my bedroom walls. I'm glad that I can say without reservation that one of my favourite films still holds up.92%www.hawkensian.com",Deliverance
161,unclesamsavage,Effective Writing and Storytelling Create Chills,8,29 March 2019,"This film stands out in its purpose as a thriller, maybe even as a warning to those traveling to parts unknown. There is a sincere message that lies under the surface of the whole plot. It's very clear in some of the dialogue between Jon Voigt and Burt Reynolds. ""Then why do you come on these trips with me?""
While I denounce the harsh stereotypes imposed upon the hill-folk of Southern Appalachia, I think the dramatized and exaggerated portrayals of them only serve to show how displaced civilization has become of them. I truly think the onus lies on the rich, ""cultured"" city folk who have lost their survival skills. Having been to these places very many times hiking and camping, I know the people there are very nice and hospitable.
This movie is extremely engaging and involving. It will ignite discussions like this one. How far have we strayed from our former selves? Would we survive without our ""system""? I particularly liked the sound mixing and editing. Everything was nice and crisp. Something about the way films were made in the 70's just tickles my fancy. This movie is a must watch.",Deliverance
162,Ajtlawyer,you're not likely to find a better movie,10,5 October 2009,"""Deliverance"" is just about the best outdoor adventure movie ever made, period. The movie is very faithful to the book, not surprising since James Dickey wrote both and also played the part of the Sheriff in this movie. The movie was filmed on location and because it was considered so risky, the production couldn't get insurance for the project. The actors, all excellent, had to do nearly all of their own stunt work. I've done a lot of whitewater rafting and have had to swim through some very dangerous rapids after falling out of the raft once or twice---believe me, it is not something you do for fun. John Boorman's movies usually have the theme of man versus man and man versus Nature and ""Deliverance"" is no exception. The four city businessmen are out to canoe down one of Georgia's last wild rivers before it is dammed up and flooded. They find themselves in a totally alien world of backwoods hillbillies such that you can scarcely believe that the city men and the country folk are from the same country. The story of course is familiar to everyone. The city men enjoy their trip down the river until the second day when, separated on the water and stopping to wait for the trailing canoe, two of the men, Ed and Bobby, are confronted by two hillbillies who are intent on brutally raping them. The rape scene is still harrowing and I would suspect was the first male/male rape scene in movie history. Given it was Ned Beatty's first movie role, the man should've merited some Oscar consideration for taking that risk with his career. The actors playing the hillbillies are amongst the most frightening characters in movie history.The second canoe arrives just after the assault on Bobby ends and the mountain men turn their attention to Ed. Lewis, one of the other canoeists, kills one of the rapists with his bow and the other rapist flees into the hills. The four city men then debate what to do next, take the body with them downriver and report it to the authorities, or just bury the body and get out of there, knowing that the river is going to be flooded in a few weeks. This scene is also powerful because they have to decide where does the law abide? Is it imposed on us and therefore can be discarded as circumstances demand, or is is within ourselves and must be followed regardless of the repercussions? Drew, who is conscience-stricken, is outvoted by the other three.The rest of the trip involves more death, possible murder or killing in self-defense, more lies, more evasions until the survivors are finally able to make their getaway, but are haunted by their consciences. And what would you do in that situation? Everyone who watches this movie will ask himself what he would do if it happened to him. . .Oh, and by the way, the movie of course lent itself to a standard joke amongst whitewater rafters---we're not stopping for any hillbillies we find on the riverbank!",Deliverance

164,nixskits,James Dickey was a mountain of a man,10,10 December 2009,"The late Mr. Dickey was 6'7"" from what I've read. So when he appears in the adaptation of his own book as a sheriff, it isn't like some tiny, unintimidating author playing a part for a laugh.""Deliverance"" is as deadly serious a 70s hit as anything before or since. The fear factor, before that term invoked images of silly people eating insects on primetime TV, rises like the violent waters about to break a levee once and for all. The great John Boorman directed this. And to a large extent, Dickey was an unofficial (and unwanted) assistant to Boorman. Or rather, a competitor. I can only imagine how an author reacts to anyone taking their creation from the page to the screen and all the struggles involved with that. Apparently, Dickey would address the four main actors by their character's name. Burt Reynolds says in his autobiography that he finally told Dickey off and the big man replied, ""That's exactly what Lewis would say!"" And later on during the shoot, before departing, he also said, ""I understand my presence would be more efficacious in it's absence!"" The four men on this trip into the horrors of confronting dangers both in Mother Nature's and deranged human assailant form find out what real fear is all about. Life in the city didn't prepare most of them for the moment when they'd have to fight for their very lives.Ned Beatty was probably the most visible of the rape survivors in film history, at least in North America (Sophia Loren in ""Two Women"" would be the international candidate for that, I guess). Certainly as a man attacked by another man, he tapped into an energy most males didn't want to acknowledge. But females watching him struggle know what that distress is really all about. Domination and a perverse, insidious display of power corruption in the human soul and society at large are the key components of sexual assaults.Until Jodie Foster starred in ""The Accused"", Beatty stood almost alone in representing a person violated who found the courage to go on despite the trauma the attack unleashed. How many major stars would play this part, then or now, without wanting to compromise at least a little bit in the extent of the scene? Reynolds also said that during it's filming, the action went on to the point where he couldn't take it anymore and tackled Billy McKinney off Beatty and demanded of the director, ""Why the hell did you let that go on so long?"" To which Boorman replied, ""Because I knew when you reached your breaking point, that's when the audience would reach their's!""",Deliverance
165,Det_McNulty,When We're Free To Roam,9,13 July 2006,"Deliverance is mixture of drama and horror. The film manages to show how a group of ordinary men who are just taking are short break can get wound up in such meaningless acts of terror. The first half hour of Deliverance is like watching a different film to the one that comes out latter. The first scenes show these normal men just having a good time and some beautiful imagery of the American land that surrounds them. The scenes after this are very different, the film all of a sudden turns out to be very dark and asks the viewer ""What would would you do in this situation?"" This is disturbing and shows just how when people are not around the cops become cruel and meaningless. This all leads up to showing how human nature can be so evil when left to it's bitter beginning.The film is definitely not one of entertainment value and is a film a film to be studied and thought about long after the chilling and depressing closing credits. What makes the film so depressing is that the action that causes everything to kick off is meaningless and so immoral that it is heart wrenching. You also feel as though the film is teasing you with the purposely inappropriate banjo music as the soundtrack. Deliverance is very different to most films, it's not afraid to put the viewer through such tense and nail-biting situations. Not only is the film disturbing, it is also very sad. It shows how a group of innocent men's lives are changed from something so pointless and pitiless. The atmosphere creates a real feeling of menace and lurking evil.Through all this the film is one amazingly harrowing experience and really does make you think about the ideas of how men can change when put through life and death situations. The men's stress makes them turn into something different to their normal self's, they have to become almost in-human to defeat the threatening evil that hangs over them like a shadow. Every single one of these men's lives are automatically altered through such a terrifying experience. You never know what's round the corner and in the end the men are fighting to survive.The acting by the cast is tremendous and Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds show very intense attitudes and you really know the kind of people they are by the end of the movie. The film is a character study, it's a real life horror movie and a great image of isolation captured on lens. The direction techniques are very precise and capture the beautiful American landscape where this terrible journey occurs. The film also perfectly displays a culture that is in isolation, most often called ""hillbillies"". The film for sure makes you have a real fear and loathing for the kind portrayed in the film. Of course not all of them are crazed loonies, but the film does put that attitude across. The techniques of camera shots used show the stress, anger, destruction, terror and beauty wonderfully.The scripting for the film is perfect and is filled with so many memorable scenes and imagery. The image of Burt Reybolds holding up the bow and focus on his dilated pupil, is a very cold image. Deliverance is certainly one of the best films ever made, it mixes so many techniques to create a masterpiece.

Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on canoing down the Cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of events that transpires upon them all. The character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend. The acting, dialogue is very very real, as close to reality as you can get for Hollywood acting. Reynolds character ""Lewis"" was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and broken man (I was impressed with his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the character thats on the spotlight the most, the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and caste him into a different man at the end (his character transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really seem like the silly lunkheads that just like to joke around and don't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too, and they did...

168,KyleLicht,Very Uncomfortable Film,8,7 January 2021,"9.5/12This was certainly an uncomfortable film. The whole thing makes you feel uneasy. Not much really happens here. But, the things that do happen are all or nothing. This movie can perfectly embody anxiety and the throbbing existential fear of being boorishly raped and killed by hillbillies, lost in the middle of nowhere with constant eyes on you, and the fear that no one can be trusted, especially authority. I feel like this film had the same creepy effect that ""The Hills Have Eyes"" had, but far succeeds the filmmaking techniques, production value, acting, and overall visual style.I'm not going to go incredibly in depth but there are a few points. Part of the fear in this movie is the misdirection. It leads you to expect more, but not a lot happens. The initial scene with the creepy townsfolk create an uneasy, unfriendly feeling and the rape scene explosively unleashes our fears and anxieties and the rest of the movie just plays off our post-traumatic expectations. But like real life, there isn't another explosive incident. It's just constant fear and PTSD that something will happen.
The other point I wanted to raise was that this film gets props for including a scene about male rape, which is typically too taboo and repressed in society. It's very bold and graphic and I'm glad it was represented as so. Men get raped in real life. It's not always in the middle of the woods at gun point. But, it's very real and unfortunately, the character who was assaulted didn't have much about it afterwards. He seemed to repress it and move on. I would've liked to see more of his trauma and how he deals with this moving forward.This review has gone on long enough. I could write an entire analysis on those topics or even touch on the cinematography, the sexual psychology of the film with masculinity and frustration, the depiction of hicks and the stigma around it, the music with the banjo and choice of Yankee Doodle, and the environmental importance of the dam, the town, and the river itself.",Deliverance

170,robertmaybeth,"A remarkable achievement, and among the most dramatic American films ever made",9,7 December 2020,"Coming as it did during the dearth of really great films in the early 1970's, ""Deliverance"" is a modern classic of dramatic terror.I mention the big reveal - Ned Beatty's rape scene by the ""hillbillies"" - since after 5 decades it is an open secret. Playing as it does on many men's latent fears of homosexual rape, the graphic parts of this film were actually shocking to many of the more ""innocent"" audiences of the day and did cause a certain amount of controversy. This film is much more than the sodomy scene of course - there is at least one trait in each of the four male characters we either strongly identify with or strongly deny. We envy Lewis his decisiveness and courage, his willingness to overcome his wish not to kill as much as we quickly deny Drew's passivity as NOT the answer here. We cheer Ed when he overcomes his own passivity to save Lewis. And I kind of found myself admiring Ned Beatty (Bobby) most of all, for having the guts to film his very demeaning scene in an era where sexuality was much more fragile than now.In fact, in real life as in the movie, all four actors show real bravery, for shooting a movie with some quite dangerous stunts where they faced very real dangers: drowning, hypothermia, falls, I doubt a man in the cast emerged uninjured! All done on next to no budget, without even taking advantage of stunt doubles. This was from a different era of Hollywood movie making, where movie stars were ""real men"" instead of pampered divas, and their toughness and grit shows clear through to the finished film.
As a true classic of American suspense/drama movie making, ""Deliverance"" is a movie not to be missed, although it does have that almost iconic 1970's American movie trait of being front-loaded with a little too much characterization before the movie takes its inevitable dark turn - although much of it is a slow building of tension to set the scene for the rest of the movie, it might seem dull for the first half hour, unfortunately.",Deliverance
171,Mike_Yike,Exciting and Scary If Not Somewhat Imperfect,8,8 February 2017,"I first saw Deliverance when it was in the theaters what seems like a million years ago. Burt Reynolds became a big start and Jon Voight received another big boost in his career thanks to the film. The only real problem I had with the movie was when I stopped and thought about the general plot line afterwards. It isn't exactly airtight.The boys killed a mountain man, justifiably. One of two mountain men roaming the woods together. The other ran off. They decided to bury the corpse and forever after remain mum about it. Then Drew, played by Ronny Cox, was killed though no one knows whether the death came at the hand of the river, or a gunshot presumably by the second mountain man. Injuries were inconclusive on the dead body. The fear was that it was a gunshot by the second mountain man stationed high on the cliffs overhead. Voight ends up climbing the cliff, finding the mountain man and killing him. As far as anyone knows, the second mountain man, now dead and hidden at the bottom of the river, never disclosed the fate of the first mountain man. Yet the boys felt compelled to make-up a story even though there was no evidence connecting them to anything. But probably more odd was the local sheriff suspected the boys of wrongdoing without any evidence suggesting they even saw the mountain men. It would seem more plausible that the sheriff would have taken a report on the death of Drew and then asked the three remaining boys if during their travels they had happened to see the two mountain men. ""No, can't say that we did,"" would have been a reply and that would have been that. I guess that would make for a short, boring movie.",Deliverance

173,Erewhon,Classic gets better with each viewing,9,4 June 2000,"I hadn't seen this movie in at least 20 years, but in the last few, it had started to itch away at my mind.  I thought it terrific when I first saw it, but had I missed something even so?  Was it more than just a disturbing adventure movie, in which city people run afoul of backwoodsmen?      So as soon as I saw the DVD, I bought it, even though it was obviously another Warner Bros. rush-it-out, never-mind-the-extras job. 
      The movie isn't as good as I remembered -- it's better.  Those who are looking for a RIVER WILD thriller, or a SOUTHERN COMFORT (a DELIVERANCE imitation) suspense movie, are already looking in the wrong place.  This movie is about what goes on inside people much more than it is about what goes on >around< them.     I've seen comments here suggesting that Ned Beatty doesn't show enough reaction after being brutally raped.  Huh?  He's stunned for ten minutes, then tries to attack Bill McKinney's >corpse<.  He's still rattled the last time we see him in the movie, when he tells Jon Voight that they won't be seeing each other for a while.  (Which clearly means forever.)  Beatty's life has been changed; he'll never get over it.     So has Voight's, but in a different way.  For the first time, I noticed that >three< people get into the tow truck when Reynolds hires those brothers to drive their cars to the canoeist's destination.  Sure, that's logical -- there are three vehicles to drive initially, after all.  But why does Boorman take pains to avoid showing us the face of the third person in the tow truck, but does show him fingering the gun in the rear window of the truck?       Could it be because this guy turns up later?  Is he Bill McKinney's character?  Or the Toothless guy?  Or the guy Voight kills?  Which of course raises the most important questions in the movie: WAS Ronny Cox shot?  And if he was, was the guy Voight kills the one who shot him?  (And was Voight's victim the Toothless guy?)  On an initial viewing of the movie, all this seems pretty obvious: yes, Cox is shot; yes, Voight kills the right person, the Toothless guy.       But then what about the man we later learn has gone hunting but who hasn't returned?  Why is Voight so shocked when he looks into the mouth of his victim?  Boorman and Dickey give great weight to the scene in which Voight fails to kill a deer.  (Even if he had, it would have been a foolish, wasteful act.)  The interplay between Voight and Reynolds is also very interesting; Voight clearly admires Reynolds on some levels, while finding him disgusting on others.        Dickey is primarily a poet, secondarily a novelist; it's not hard to believe that he intended all four men to represent different aspects of the human condition.  DELIVERANCE is one of the most intricately ambiguous movies of its type ever made; it cannot be pulled apart into easily-understood sections, and where our sympathies should lie is never obvious.  Even the sheriff, played by Dickey himself, has darker shadings that are partly inexplicable.  And there is that shot of the removal of the graves; it's not in there by chance or for local color.

174,Krug Stillo,A great film about humanity,10,31 May 2003,"Although this cannot be classified as a horror film, certain aspects of Deliverance are truly disturbing and frightening. It deserves the award for depicting the most horrific male rape ever committed to celluloid.For those who still have yet to experience this classic film, the plot concerns a four man group heading into the wilderness for a canoe trip and what happens when they're threatened in alien environment. Lewis, Ed, Bobby and Drew (macho, pensive, amiable and humanitarian) are attacked by two back woods red necks. Cue the unforgettable - `You look just like a little hog. Squeal piggy!' line. Each man has to confront his own demons and needles to say the film ends without the typical Hollywood end, bit on a grim note.With great direction from John Boorman (Exorcist II, The Emerald Forestetc.) James Dickey's screenplay is based on his own novel, and he even makes an appearance in the film among a whole cast of true professionals. The score is also unsettling and the Dulling Banjos scene is superb and unforgettable. I don't want to say anymore, but this is a 'must see classic'.",Deliverance
175,~AleXa~,"Good effort, but left something to be desired",6,18 May 2005,"The Pros: Started off well, appropriately paced and realistic dialogue. I really believed straight from the beginning that these characters were real people. The minimal music contributed well to the feeling of the film, and the credibility of the actors was largely enhanced by the fact that they really did everything in this movie--they actually navigated the river much as their characters did, Reynolds learned to shoot a bow and arrow, and Voight really scaled that 200-foot-tall cliff. That being said, I felt there were many things that left the film lacking...The Cons: Firstly, I believe a true wilderness film should encompass only challenges of the wilderness. Boorman (the director) even stated that the movie was ""a story about man testing himself against nature and discovering the hidden forces within himself that he never knew existed,"" but this is a blatant lie. Homosexual country hicks hardly qualify as 'nature'. That's nothing more than a severely overused stereotype at best, and a cheap way to introduce conflict into an otherwise decent wilderness movie. Another problem I had was when Drew was supposedly shot...to me it looked as if he was so stressed that he passed out and fell overboard. I thought the other three men were just panicking...I mean the guy had a shotgun--you should've heard the shot echoing across the rocky embankments. But okay, so then Ed climbs up the cliff, but instead of searching for the assailant and attempting to kill him under the cover of darkness before he gets a chance to kill his friends, he takes a nap. When he awakens, low and behold, there's the hick with the shotgun. So then he has his chance, but he freezes, even when his and his friends' lives depend upon him. This is not true to the character Boorman claims him to be--Boorman stated Ed was a ""mild-mannered businessman...with the instincts of a natural born killer."" I mean, where is he getting this from?? The guy couldn't kill the deer, and he couldn't kill a man who potentially was going to kill him and his friends. He draws the arrow, aims, and then quivers till his muscles give out, fires and misses BOTH times. And Boorman calls that ""the instincts of a natural born killer""?? I think someone should give Boorman a dictionary. And who exactly shot the hick with an arrow *right* before he was going to shoot Ed? Lewis and Bobby were 200 feet down. Yet another unsolved mystery I guess...Overall, my main complaint is that this movie is not true to what it proclaims to be about, which reprehensibly discredits an otherwise realistic movie. This is not man against nature, this is man against man that just happens to be in the wilderness. The only credibility comes from the fact that the actors really embarked on this journey in the back country of Georgia and really performed canoing, archery, and rock-climbing, with no insurance no less. However the plot had several flaws. I feel that this movie could've been more naturalistic and less stereotypical, however I did find it entertaining.5.5 out of 10",Deliverance
176,chuckrules,I must have missed something,5,28 January 2003,I remember reading the book years ago and finding it to be pretty thrilling. I can't say as I found the same in the movie.  There were some suspenseful moments but overall a great amount of tedium.  The characters were strongly lacking in anything of interest most especially that portrayed by Burt Reynolds.  The scenery on the other hand was fantastic.  Best I can say for this one is I managed to stay awake the entire time it was on.,Deliverance
177,lawrence_elliott,"Unsettling, Disturbing, Frightening! Powerful FilmMaking!",9,10 March 2015,"I saw this film as a young man when it first came out and I am now reviewing it 43 years later with a different perspective on life. This film was scary and unexpectedly shocking in 1972. In hindsight I feel it has as much meaning symbolically today as you care to discuss. At the time I thought Burt Reynolds would become one of Hollywood's great dramatic actors but instead he meandered into comedy and superficial roles. I believe he became somewhat of a wasted talent. In this movie, however, he shines. The acting all round is stellar. The storytelling and direction flawless and powerful. Nature is pitted against man. Man against Nature. Man against Man. It is loaded with social and moral issues. The destruction of a virgin wilderness by a dam. The issue of murder, self-defence, escaping from the law but not being able to hide from your conscience (the nightmares of Ed - Jon Voight), the homosexual rape scene, the burial and dumping of bodies, the stills for moonshine in the backwoods, the ""duelling banjoes"" - brilliant scenes that make this film memorable while set against a backdrop of raging rivers and pristine wilderness. The filming of going down river is incredible. No insurance company would get involved in this one so perhaps Angelina Jolie would not be here today if Jon Voight had slipped climbing that cliff.The ""Church of Christ"" confronting them on the road at the end, the sense of relief out of the water, the genial dinner with the gentle town folk, the shimmering light in the faces of Jon Voight & Burt Reynolds when they first see the river, the nightmarish image of the rising hand out of the water in Jon Voight's dream at the end - haunting images that will last a lifetime.

There is, after all, no way to adequately convey the feeling the film creates.  It has to be seen and heard.  Everyone involved here does some of the finest work of their careers, especially Burt Reynolds in a not entirely sympathetic role.  Sadly, many viewers, after having been told how effective and harrowing this film is, are disappointed. Maybe it's been built up too much, or maybe modern film has prepared people to expect Voight to go into the woods kicking ass with an automatic weapon.

Great story, solid acting, real-filmmaking and stunts, creepy Appalachian hillbillies, gorgeous scenery, and a morality play.

183,tvspace,an American myth,9,29 August 2001,"Well, I just bought and watched the DVD to this movie. Since I'm in my 30's I'm just old enough to remember when it was relatively new when I was a kid; it's one of those movies that I never got around to seeing.I was expecting it to be interesting, but was surprised to find it to be a real classic; it's a great American movie...minimalist, raw, painted on a big canvas.Even though I had never seen the movie, except for the dueling banjos scene (they showed it in sound class in film school), it was interesting how much of it I had picked up via osmosis with American pop culture over the years. I felt like I had seen it before, but only in a dream. An interesting phenomenon.I can remember kids in grade school talking about the ""Squeel like a Pig"" scene; I wasn't sure what they were getting at; I didn't know what regular sex was, much less rape, much less male-on-male rape. Finally seeing the scene after all these years it was both more comical (I mean come on, look at those awful briefs they put Ned Beatty in) and more bizarre than I could have imagined. The way it all climaxes (no pun intended) with the hillbilly squeeling, twisting Ned's ear, Ned squeel's at a lower pitch, and then repeat, over and over again, is just disturbing and very funny in a freaky kind of way. It is almost a reprise of the dueling banjos scene, except now it's dueling pigs. I think the fact that the hillbilly has this very alarming, high-pitched, intense squeel, while Ned Beatty's is kind of half-hearted, broken, and pathetic shows the attention to detail in the movie that makes it so effective.The key to this movie is that it is tapping into our primal fears. It has the quality of Greek Tragedy, mixed with a documentary-like realism. That combination is extremely satisfying and must be difficult to achieve. That is, the movie is full of startling moments of realism (i.e. the great moment at the gas pump when Ned Beatty is ribbing the old guy about the way he wears his hat, and the fella takes off his hat, looks at it, then deadpans, ""You don't know a damn thing"") but the realism is always in the service of the mythological tale of the journey down a strange river into darkness. It is a very similar movie to Apocalypse Now; less dreamy, more real; less horrifying but more intense. I think I like Deliverance better but I haven't seen Coppola's movie recently. An interesting couple of films nonetheless.I especially like the character of the banjo-picking boy; he truly serves the role of some mute Old Testament prophet. Somehow the entire disaster about to unfold is contained in the disturbing, long, and penetrating look he gives the travellers from the swinging bridge as they pass under him into unknown territory.I figured there would be a few reviews on here by folks getting all self-righteous and politically correct about the depiction of hillbillies. I'm from Kentucky originally myself and kind of take to the weirdos at the gas station more than Burt Reynolds in a rubber shirt, but, you know...get over it.",Deliverance
184,Austin_Powers-1,A true horror classic,10,12 June 2006,"Right the first time I ever saw DELIVERANCE, I was terrified. This is a truly roller-coaster ride of an unpleasant and creepy film. Why is it SO scary? Because it could happen to anybody! There are no monsters (so to speak) or green ooze which attack people, this is the naked brutality of man! I simply LOVE the acting from our four main characters, Jon Voight as Ed the nervous but yet violent family guy, Burt Reynolds as Lewis (in one of his best roles ever) a tough and untamed son of nature, Ned Beatty as Robert (or Bobby) the choppy and (annoying?) guy, and finally Ronny Cox as Drew, the cozy and nice family guy.I can't think of any scene in this movie, where I don't feel entertained.

185,nuhc,Excellent and scary,9,16 April 2008,"I think the best thing about this movie is that it is certainly very plausible. It's not hard to believe that four guys going on a canoe trip in the Deep South can easily find themselves out of their element and end up in trouble. If the river doesn't kill them, the inbred hillbilly folk certainly will try. And having been in parts of the country that remind me of this movie, it's scary to think that it really could happen.The other good thing about this movie is that, with the exception of the vehicles used in the movie, it could be timeless. You can picture this movie happening today or 30 years ago. Replace the vehicles in the movie with a couple of modern SUV's and it would still work. However, that's not really necessary since who wants to drive their brand new Hummer into hillbillyland? You'd take your old vehicle.Yes, the ""squeal like a pig"" scene is scary & brutal, but of course it's supposed to be. The film wouldn't have that scary quality if it was just a couple of hillbillies robbing two of the main characters at gunpoint. Add some forceable sodomy and the situation the two characters find themselves in is far worse than they could have imagined. Thinking about something like that happening to you, and you get the feeling of urgency why they want to get the heck down to Aintree & get out of there.To see this movie properly, you have to rent it. When they show it on TV, it's always so heavily edited that it just looks like four guys going camping.",Deliverance
186,henry-girling,Still stands the test of time,8,7 June 2004,"Despite our modern violent and visceral cinema, this film stands the test of time as a harrowing and compelling film of four men taken out of their world and plunged into another one, where beauty and excitement are blotted out by death and destruction. Yet it is more than simply that. The men of the mountains do prey on the men of the city but in the end are destroyed themselves. The flooding that will come anyway will obliterate everything, the dead bodies, the scene of the crime, the wilderness itself. There is a strange melancholic and apocalyptic feel to the film. 
It is filmed brilliantly. There is nothing unreal about the canoeing scenes. The actors are there fighting the currents and the rocks. You can feel their exhilaration as they paddle along. Then it all comes unstuck and each man reacts accordingly. The four male leads, John Voight. Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox,  are all solid and believable, possibly Reynold's finest screen performance. The music is sparse and based on the 'Duelin' Banjos' theme that is as memorable as the zither tune from 'The Third Man'. The scene where it is introduced is rightly hailed as a classic.

188,stewiefan201,Deliverance is a well made and disturbing thriller. Although I'm not sure what its point is.,8,22 December 2007,"Deliverance is about 4 men who go canoing on a river that is soon to be flooded out. All 4 seem to be trying in their own way to get in touch with nature, especially the macho and strong-willed Lewis (Reynolds). Along the way they encounter tragedy and horrid adventure in the form of rape, murder, and survival as they try to get out alive.Deliverance is well written and acted. It is also contains a disturbing, but terrifyingly memorable, rape scene. The film induces genuine panic, terror, and somewhat more-or-less believable characters. It starts off slow but once the tension accumulates, Deliverance never looks back once.Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight may be at their finest here as two harrowed and injured men trying their hardest to survive. Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox are also excellent as two of the four friends that are each either physically or mentally tortured, or both. For the side characters the filmmakers decided to use town locals from where Deliverance was shot. This injects a huge touch of realism and naturality into the movie, making it all more scarily believable.Now for the one and only flaw of Deliverance: It never ""delivers"" a clear message or statement of what it's trying to convey to us. Is it supposed to be about masculinity vs. the wilderness, living with the regret of murder, or is it about survival. Personally I believe the movie is about the human survival instinct, and also how far one may go to cover up a past mistake that could severely detriment their life. But who the hell knows, I guess it's all up to the viewer to decide what message they got out of the film.Overall Deliverance was a strong and powerful film, although I was never truly moved by it. It is very adventurous and heart stopping at times, and of course well acted and written. I give Deliverance a 3 out of 4.",Deliverance

The acting excels, the scenery is superb and the drama and tension over the top. The torturous debating about whether they should tell the police what happened is so intense and plausible and it's entirely believable that the one guy couldn't handle the stress and effectively tried to kill himself in despair by not putting on hit life vest. In fact the first couple/three times I watched I did think that's how he died but now I realize he was actually shot by one of the hillbillies taking revenge. Interesting twist, either way.All the actors are great, including even Peckinpah as the toothy sherriff.

190,DavidLindahl,A fantastic portrait of terror in mind vs terror in reality,10,27 May 2016,"To try and explain the greatness of Deliverance, you must first understand the impact this film had when it came. Most of us have probably seen a horror film about a gang in the woods that gets harassed and stalked by people. Deliverance is the father of these films and an original that stands really well to this day as one of the best films ever made in the genre. A gang of four guys ventures out in nature to paddle canoes along Cahulawassee River before it gets flooded into a lake. However their boat trip does not turn out the way they had hoped for when they suddenly gets stalked and harassed by the locals. Burt Reynolds plays the outdoor fanatic Lewis who brings his friends on the journey, Jon Voght, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. The film is directed by John Boorman from the novel by the same name from 1970.What is it then that makes Deliverance so incredibly good. At the beginning of the film the gang is traveling by car, the mood is good and very typical for guys. After having a short break to fill up the cars with petrol and listening to the famous banjo duel ""Dueling Banjos"" between Ronny Cox's character and a local boy, they head for the river. What happens next out on the river is like a nightmare and also very psychologically demanding. Deliverance always feels so real and genuine that you truly become frightened. How would you yourself react in a similar situation so far away from civilization? After the gang starts to get harassed in the woods, the panic and fear increases. They all react differently, and rightly so, no human being is the other alike. That is just what makes it so good, the characters' different personalities. The film then sort of becomes a psychological mind game, perhaps mostly taking place in their heads. Are they being followed, how will they get out of the situation they are in and what will they say when they return?Besides the psychological aspects of Deliverance, it is also incredibly beautiful to watch. It's completely filmed on location out in the woods with actors willing to perform the different stunts themselves. As I wrote when I reviewed The Revenant, this is also a man vs wild film. In the beginning we experience nature as incredibly beautiful and stunning but later it quickly turns to become your worst nightmare. Incredibly well done by the director. The absolute greatness in Deliverance lies according to me in the end and the summarization of the film. What really happened and what didn't happen. How do you react to these kinds of situations out in the middle of nowhere? Can we return with our senses intact and how do you change as a person after experiencing something like it? Without spoiling the story too much, I've here tried to review and explain what Deliverance is to me. I recommend everyone to watch it and it is very high up on my list of the best films ever made.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",Deliverance

Gives you a sense of the Deep South.
Built suspense very well.
But a lot of long and dreary shots that prolonged the momentum and kept showing off the terrain as if we didn't get it.
Then there was an unclear moment when Lewis repeats ""Drew was shot"" which could possibly be connected to the reason why drew jumped off the boat.

The moment that you hear Bobby's (Ned Beatty's)chuckling over the Warner Brothers logo there is a sense of foreboding. From then on the film never relents as the overconfidence and naivety of the city boys is juxtaposed to the sights and sounds of the wilderness - its beauty and its terror.The film's famous scenes have been well documented and critiqued in other reviews but it is also some of the subtle touches that I have come to appreciate. Bobby mocks and dismisses the rusted old wrecks that litter the yard of the hillbillies at the beginning of the film but almost embraces the wrecks that are the first sign of civilization and salvation from the horrors and dangers of the wilderness at the end of the trip. Later Bobby gladly eats dinner with the locals and displays no sense of the superiority he felt at the beginning. In fact he enjoys their hospitality and down home conversation. A lesson learnt the hard way.The acting by the four leads is brilliantly real but it is the locals who lend the film such a heightened sense of reality. They are physically and emotionally detached from the city boys - this is their world.Lastly - nature doesn't play favourites.

Martin Heidegger said that the real art opens the reality. The directors and film stars disappear and you are observing the being as it is. Hence, with strong presence of nature and torturous plot Deliverance does not feel a movie at all.

'Deliverance' is a tale about four well-to-do Atlanta business men who decide to go on a weekend long canoe trip. All four men are friends with very different personalities. There's Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds) the survivalist and the authoritative leader of the group. Ed Gentry (Jon Voight) is the easy going family man. Bobby Tripp (Ned Beatty) is the sarcastic pampered insurance salesman. Drew Bollinger (Ronny Cox) is the banjo playing voice of reason and moral compass of the bunch.The foursome decide to do their extended trip in a very remote part of rural Georgia. This will be the group's only time ever to enjoy the Cahulawassee River. Soon, a local power company will complete a dam for a power generator. It's only a matter of time before the river is gone and the forgotten community of Antry will be replaced by a lake. The town and it's residence will be re-located to higher ground.The inhabitance of the rolling hills of the Cahulawassee are poor rural folk who've never seen civilization. They are highly mistrustful of outsiders and just as soon keep to themselves. These people are poverty stricken, have little to no education and many are the products of inbreeding. Truly, the people that time forgot.There are subtle signs at the beginning of the expedition that the four river travelers may have been better off staying in Atlanta and playing golf. Nevertheless, they press on to their fateful trip. It starts off fun and adventurous enough. - Then the unthinkable happens. It's one of the most disturbing encounters in modern movies. After that, all bets are off . . .'Deliverance' is skillfully directed by John Boorman. He creates wonderful characters, creates a sense of awe, tension and dread. This is a taunt drama about the worst camping nightmare come to life and how to deal with it. Boorman would later go on to direct 'Excalibur' (1981) and 'The Emerald Forest' (1985).""Deliverance"" is a great sociological commentary on cultural values and differences.

195,zippyflynn2,Powerful and Real Deliverance Delivers,10,29 October 2006,"Perhaps there are other movies that so painfully, accurately portray savage violence and the impact it has on the individual but I don't think I've ever seen any. Deliverance is one of the most powerful movies I've seen, haunting me with its nightmarish imagery and forcing me to ask myself the question ""How far would I go in a similar situation? And what effect would it have on me?"" A rarity for a film, it does not soften the blow of the original story, its meaning nor the questions it raises for the viewer. People complain about violence in movies but that vast majority of violence is nothing more than glorified cartoonish fiction, a testosterone release for boys of all ages. It's false and one dimensionally clichéd, usually written by arm chair warriors who get their notions of violence from tall tales others have told them, usually in the form of more bad fictional violence they have seen in other movies, comic books, etc. For anyone who has experienced it or honestly evaluated it, real, brutal violence is not fun nor a cause for celebration for those that survive or ""win"". The swaggering, ""good guy"" hero may be fun to watch in the western movie, and I enjoy a good vicarious release film as much as the next guy, but these heroes don't really exist, certainly not as the brash, righteous hero they're colored as. Real, brutal violence is just that, real and brutal. There aren't any ""winners"" or ""heroes"" when it comes to savagery and killing, just survivors who are profoundly impacted, irrevocably changed in a harsh and painful way. If you're unsure of this fact, just ask anyone who really has experienced it, not the teller of tall tales as most are but the veteran who lives next door but came back strangely changed and won't discuss the nightmares he's living. Survivors of real, savage violence don't brag about it in bars and wear it as a badge of courage. They seldom or never discuss it, so unfortunately the naive think the liars who spin tales of false bravado are real. We need real violence in movies, the impact it has on the soul of a person. For once I'd like to see when someone gets hit on the head in the film hard enough to be knocked out that almost a third of them will die from their injuries and the remaining survivors will not jump up, perfectly fine when it's advantageous to the story but come to and pass out repeatedly, experiencing searing headaches unlike anything you can imagine, vomiting and unable to stand for hours sometimes days due to their severe cranial concussion. If there were more movies like Deliverence that deliver a real story, powerfully and unapologetically, violence in movies would become a powerful tool for education, very probably reducing its frequency by those who shockingly discover being involved is nothing to be proud or righteous about, a lesson learned way too late by so many walking wounded, often living right next to to you.As a side note, I was told by a literary friend that James Dickey wrote this over the course of a manic weekend on a bet. He was a poet who at a cocktail party on a Friday argued with an acquaintance that writing fiction was much easier than poetry. He set out to prove it and the novel Deliverance was the result. Certainly, the novel follows the weekend time line exactly. Great story, but I have yet to be able to authenticate it.",Deliverance

I managed to rationalize the horror of other films -- after ""Jaws"" I reasoned that sharks could endanger people only if they enter the water and only at certain ocean beaches; and after ""Saving Private Ryan"" I decided that WWII ended long ago and that the armed forces didn't recruit people my age anyway -- but I couldn't think myself through the depression I experienced for 2-3 days following the night I watched ""Deliverance.""The poverty of the people living above the Cahulawassee River, the hostility of some of them towards outsiders, their overall social and emotional limitations, as underscored by the banjo playing boy's autistic-like detachment as he looked down at the canoeists from a foot bridge, had me unnerved before the real adventure began. Looking back, I not only owed my fear to a well written story, but also to a wisely chosen and ably directed cast.Burt Reynolds did a very believable job in his portrayal of Lewis Medlock, the lone physical, backwoods smart, outdoors man of the foursome. With his self-assertive personality and confrontational style, Medlock seemed to know that a show of vulnerability does not gain respect from a mountain man. He aroused my anxiety in the process, however, because I couldn't imagine myself approaching those people in the same way.I saw myself much more in the other three men, Bobby Trippe, Drew Ballinger (Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cox), and especially Ed Gentry, Jon Voight's character. In fact, I identified so much with them, as they dealt with their fear by attempting to ingratiate themselves with the utterly unsophisticated people they encountered in the Appalachian wilderness, that I felt personally very threatened when Ballinger's, Trippe's, and Gentry's patronizing behavior seemed to work against them.",Deliverance

199,john_vance-20806,Genuinely disturbing.,10,12 March 2016,"This came out when I was in college but I didn't see it until 40 years later. I had heard so much about it I figured I wouldn't be impressed. I was wrong.Everyone knows about the superb direction and production values, but what I saw was one creepy scenario that was entirely plausible. Having grown up in Kentucky, I'm more than familiar with isolated locations where the old inhabitants never leave and new ones never arrive. Living in such conditions can lead to the kind of mind-set where predation on other unsuspecting, innocent humans can become a form of exciting entertainment. Where hatred and evil contempt become the default emotion towards anyone who has a different world view and life experience.The cold, violent aggression exhibited by the 2 ""mountain men"" was so well-portrayed I was physically upset. The thought of how easy it would be to find oneself trapped in such a location completely at the whim of sub-human personalities was chilling. It was like a nightmare directly extracted from the mind and placed on celluloid for perfect recollection.I'm not timid, I have viewed many other movies that offered more graphic violence and responded with a shoulder shrug. But in my mind none has created such a genuine fear that it could really happen to me.",Deliverance
200,MountainMan,What else can you ask of a movie? GREAT,7,8 November 2003,"I watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when I should have been asleep.  This, in itself, was testimony that Deliverance was a spell-binding movie.  I think Boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film.  How expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done. It showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were.  Case in point - near the end of the ""duel"", the banjo-playing boy was smiling (loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the ""duel"", the kid was too reserved to respond. The river trip never left you bored, for sure.  The rape scene was brutal, but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of Georgia.  I think Beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done. Some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal.  I disagree - if you really payed attention, he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following, in which Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy.  It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff.  It almost appeared that the arrow was shot while Ed was curled up and expecting to die, but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect.Anyway, a great movie, and I was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote, but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a ""1"", I gave it a ""10"".  This individual's reasoning seemed based on personal bias, rather than an objective viewpoint, and his vote was obviously a non-correlating attempt to lower the rating.",Deliverance

202,BlueFairyBlog,Backwoods Bonding,9,19 November 2014,"This thriller concerns the exploits of four good old Southern boys trekking down a huge, thrashing river. Set in a very incestuous, back-hoe section of Georgia, the film becomes unsettling as soon as they venture into a small town in search for drivers. The infamous dueling banjo/guitar scene occurs right away, putting it in the forefront of your mind. In this perturbing setting the characters move around easily, stretching out their legs and hamming it up with one another. Though it's masked by the sexual assault and nature vs. man narrative the real theme of the film is the state of manliness and its cousin, machismo. Personified beefcake Burt Reynolds, provides the perspective of pure manliness in the character of Lewis: he hunts and fishes with a crossbow, sleeps under a ramshackle homemade tent, sloughs through mansplaining monologues about his intrepid wanderings in the wilderness, and revels in his absurd testosterone fueled opinions on manhood. The other three are there to watch him boast and bray, themselves trying to find their manliness amongst the rushing rapids of the river. The story concerns the four men, but it's really the story of Ed (Voigt), who fails to live up to Lewis' expectations: he can't hunt, can't protect himself and Bobby (Beatty), doesn't argue with Louis, and can't save Drew (Cox) from the river's wrath. Near the end of the film he is tasked with defending them and this time he succeeds, to his detriment. Everything serves as a metaphor in this film, including, unfortunately, the infamous piggy scene. Beatty is the only one of the four to eschew traditional roles of masculinity, and so he is the one who is victimized. Near the end of the film we think that this film has been about hillbillies threatening four men on the river, and when the second murder occurs it seems obvious that everything has been righted for our heroes. In fact, it serves as another metaphor, which shows that relying on animalism for decision-making incurs violent, and deadly, repercussions. The ending of the film dragged far too long, as this message is waylaid in order for guilt to be shifted between the remaining members of the troupe, belying the point of the rest of the film. Otherwise this was a thoughtfully crafted film about the role of manhood and how it denigrates men, making them murderous brutes.",Deliverance

Stars watch a kid play banjo (really well, probably the most interesting part of the movie). They camp and go canoeing down a river. Run into two stereotypes of rednecks, who inexplicably attack two of the stars sexually. One redneck gets killed. Then Ronny Cox falls out of his canoe for no reason. Then lots of boring yelling on the river. Jon Voight climbs a cliff. We watched him fall asleep (yawn). He wakes up and encounters the other still-living redneck, then kills him. They fall into the water. Lots of yelling. Overacting screaming by Burt Reynolds as they canoe forever down the river. Nobody ever really talks about what happened. They get out of the river and there's more really boring stuff with doctors and sheriffs.I still don't understand what the big deal is with this movie.",Deliverance

He stood on a corner of the stage looking every bit the part of the Aintry Sheriff he plays in the movie. His insight into the depth and breadth of the novel Deliverance made my first viewing a memorable one. Every time I see this film, I get chills down my spine. The sheer terror, and total believability of the situation that the four men find themselves in makes for scary moments. In spite of the cuts and edits the film has suffered in the intervening years, the movie still stands as a great action epic, set amidst the raw splendor of a raging river, a backward people and a dying landscape.

I've still never gotten around to reading it, but the film itself is one of the most powerful pieces of modern film making in the history of cinema.Leaving the book on the back burner, 'Deliverance' is a movie in which a group of men find out what they're made of. The primal urge to get away from city life and, join nature at its most coherent level, ultimately ends up being their worst nightmare. The very thing they were trying to get away from confronts them right in the place where it was never supposed to happen.Not only does the film commentate on risky subjects such as homosexuality, bestiality, and rape, it actually entwines the three into one big ball of shock. A film on survival, will, determination, trials, tribulations - and the heart it takes to overcome them all. Some groundbreaking movie making - not only with the location and casting, but with the true depiction of deep backwoods types.The banjo scene goes down in history as one of the most memorable. Ronnie Cox and the 'banjo boy' playing 'Dueling Banjos' is probably one of the most sketched scenes ever.Aside from being groundbreaking on a number of different levels, the modern backwoods slasher film owes a helluva lot to 'Deilverance'. Such films as 'The Final Terror '83', feature a backwoods killer in a remote area alongside a river. The Canadian film 'Rituals', also owes a lot to 'Deliverance'- as a trip in the woods goes horribly wrong for a group of hunters. 'Deliverance' set the stage for a number of cash-ins that still ride its coat tails until this day.In a nutshell, 'Deliverance' 'delivers' - and it delivers big,",Deliverance

214,chain67,Brilliantly Harrowing Film,9,24 December 2000,"After having seen Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction don't seem so extreme. Maybe by today's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy, but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently.When I started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until I got to the ""Dueling Banjos"" scene. In that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible. As I watched Drew(Ronny Cox,Robocop)go head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get. When you think that the kid has a small banjo, which he could of probably made by hand, compared to Drew's nice expensive guitar, you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are.
As the plot goes it's very believable and never stretches past its limits. But what really distinguishes this film, about four business    men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip, is that director John Boorman(Excalibur) breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes. So as the movie goes into full horror and suspense I really cared about all four men and what would happen to them.The acting is universally excellent. With Jon Voight(Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds(Boogie Nights, Striptease) leading the great cast. Jon Voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable. Unlike Reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start, Voight's character transforms over the course of the movie. Ned Beatty(Life) is also good in an extremely hard role, come on getting raped by a hillbilly, while Ronny Cox turns in a believable performance.One thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any I had ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert ""Cowboy"" Coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly's.
Overall Deliverance was excellent and I suggest it to anyone, except for people with weak stomachs and kids. 10/10. See this movie.",Deliverance

You would take whitewater rafts or kayaks built for the rapids. Running a difficult river takes skill acquired by training, which these characters did not have.Second, river running takes advanced planning and once on the river, scouting the rapids. River runners have to scout the tough rapids ahead of them before they run them. If the rapids are too difficult or unrunnable, the water craft have to be lined down the rapids with ropes.Third, river runners need a shuttle waiting for them at the end of the trip to return them to their vehicles or they need people to shuttle their vehicles to the landing. You must have the utmost trust in the shuttle drivers and pay them well.Watch Deliverance for the drama and suspense; watch The River Wild for white water realism.",Deliverance
218,mercuryix2003,"Roger Ebert, Once Again, Out to Lunch",8,25 February 2007,"Roger Ebert, the film critic most palpably in love with his sense of perceived intellect, once again proves the phoniness of his objectivity as a reviewer by slamming movies like this one. There are some film critics like Ebert that when they are made uncomfortable by a movie, dismiss it without examining it, and call it sensationalistic. Mr. Ebert has done this with this one, which means this movie has done its job. The critic is too uncomfortable to examine the emotions this movie evokes, and uses pseudo-intellectualism to insulate himself from it. (Particularly in his hackneyed statement that the writer of the book made up contrived ""statements"" in the movie, instead of being real ones.) POSSIBLE SPOILERS: The premise is simple; four businessmen leave the safety of their urban environment to go water rafting; they encounter a world outside their safe haven, that they cannot control. They eventually run into the wrong people, who despise them for simply existing and invading their territory, and their journey becomes a nightmare. The movie is a study in how alienated man can become from his own species, how superficial the trappings of civilization are, and how civilized behavior will not help you survive when encountering simple animalistic behavior. The moral of the movie seems to be, there is no morality in survival, there is only survival. The men are graphically tortured, one raped, one murdered apparently by a hillbilly sniper trying to cover their tracks, and forced to commit murder to simply survive. Or is it simple self defense? They then realize that if they are honest and report the attacks that were made on them, they will be tried and executed simply for defending themselves. They are therefore forced to lie, cover up and hide their experiences for life, even from their own families if they are to survive in the artificial ""civilized"" world they return to. The movie places the characters in unfair circumstances they must survive in, and then further unfair circumstances as they must hide what happened to them to escape a place that will execute them if they tell the truth about defending themselves. The unspoken message ""stay in your own backyard or you'll be killed"" is very depressing. But then, there are residents in Los Angeles that cannot even go into a different neighborhood without gangs targeting and killing them for no reason. When a critic like Roger Ebert is too afraid to really examine the dark statements this movie makes emotionally, you know you have a movie that will move you and disturb you. The ironic thing is that now we have movies like Chain Saw Massacre III, Devil's Rejects, Friday the13th 1-9, etc, that make this movie's violence seem mild. However, the hatred, alienation and cruelty it examines will haunt and disturb you for years afterwards, long after meaningless drivel like the other movies mentioned are forgotten. In this day and age, that is no small accomplishment. Eight stars for me. (cue banjo music....)",Deliverance

Was it the too-peaceful mountain setting? Was it the banjo music? I decided that I should just wait and see...and inevitably, I saw! The scene in the woods between Jon Voight, Ned Beatty, and the two homosexual mountain-folk was one of the creepiest scenes I've ever seen in any movie. Could any of you imagine yourselves canoeing downriver in the mountains and being confronted by two violent-minded hillbillies? Just imagining myself in that situation makes me cringe. As the film progresses and the characters' plights become more and more life-threatening, I became more and more intrigued. It was fascinating how John Boorman used settings that reflected what was happening in the story, and the acting (especially Jon Voight) was fantastic.

This movie would not be what it is though without ""the scene"" which is so disturbing but which is necessary in making this movie so good.Also, this movie would be nothing without its fantastic performances, especially by Voight and Burt Reynolds.  Voight turns from mild mannered, passive city slicker to a take charge guy who saves his buddies lives. Reynolds gives one of the best performances of his career.  He is very virile, and has a dominating screen presence.  Also it's pretty cool that he is so gung ho about going down the river, that he wears a wet suit during the whole movie.So many other things contribute to the greatness of this movie.

Eventually, they begin their journey, but a horrific, unexpected event leaves them with a body to hide, shed-loads of guilt/disgust/pain to try and shut away and a long, arduous journey down the rocky river back to the brink of sanity. It's intense, disturbing and heart-pounding for a long duration of the film, but the real horror comes from the pre-insanity section of the film, where the character's isolation from familiar forms of humanity and clear lack of enthusiasm or knowledge of how to canoe down an incredibly wild river in an unknown land is truly unsettling. I didn't quite believe one or two scenes (Jon Voight's sudden and near impossible rock climb) and the pacing was a bit too messy but overall this is an incredible experience. Looks beautiful, brilliant performances and I've already said this once, but is absolutely shocking and disturbing to this day.

A movie that has been influenced many times since its incarnation from book to movie in the year 1972, this is a movie that fully deserves a spot in the Top 250.Plot: The movie is based on the James Dickey novel of the same name. While I haven't read Deliverance, it is one my list of books to read because this movie's story was great and history has taught us that books have better stories than their movie. This is the movie that has given people the fear of wilderness, stereotypical rednecks and mountain people (no offense), and the idea of rape. This movie is scary without being a horror film and using realistic ideas. That makes it scary.Acting: When the Academy Awards came around, Deliverance was definitely overlooked when it came to acting. Yes there was Marlon Brando for The Godfather but it didn't even get nominations. Jon Voight gave a fantastic performance as a man who is going along for the ride and helps his friends. The real show comes from Burt Reynolds who plays a wild adventurous risk taker who can at times be very reckless. This is where the nomination should have come in.Genre/Quality: This fits an adventure film as well as a scary thriller. As I said earlier this is one of the few non-horror films that manages to scare almost everyone who watches it. This movie's quality shows to anyone who knows a good film. This movie has great cinematography and uses the environment as a great advantage. He takes a hostile environment and makes it look very beautiful and it is very deceptive which is exactly what we want to see in a movie. Some of cinema's greatest scenes in history took place in this movie such as the world famous, ""Dueling Banjos,"" and the famous ""assault"" sequence. Camera angles were fantastic with great views of everything that is going on and great rafting sequences.Overall this is one of the very best adventure movies I've ever seen. I'm still amazed it doesn't have an open spot in the Top 250. I'm hoping that it will soon find a throne.

The idea of living the Chulawasse river before it's turned into a lake comes from Burt Reynold's Lewis, who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie, the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story, with our men forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In very bad ways. At the end of the movie, each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week-end on the river but muted into a fight for survival. The movie (except some pretty evident goofs) is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath. The photography is excellent as well. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake.",Deliverance
229,Fenrir_Sleeps,What happens in Cahulawassee stays in Cahulawassee,7,30 May 2015,"'Duelling Banjos' and 'SQUEAL!' are the names by which the two most famous scenes of 'Deliverance' are known. The first one depicts an amicable musical dispute between one of the main characters (Drew) and a local boy, the second a scene where other main character (Bobby) is humiliated and sodomized by another far less amicable local. Both scenes (in very different ways, that's for sure), convey human interaction in pre-Babbel form, two scenes that don't lean on language and make us feel good and evil in their purest form, in this tale where Men returns to the Wild and, therefore, must be confronted with it.'Deliverance' is a downbeat adventure drama film directed by John Boorman in 1972, starring Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox as the four city men who trade their golf weekend for a canoe adventure down the Cahulawassee River in Southern U.S., before this last piece of native, wild America disappears underwater after the construction of a dam. But things start to unravel for the four adventurers, who soon find themselves fighting for survival on a land where civilization laws are not applicable.Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond does a tremendous job capturing the beautiful wild, landscape in tones of green and smooth gold. The four main actors are all up to the characters they play, as proved by the scenes when moral discussion arises and each of them must make their point on the subject. The soundtrack is minimal and mostly replicate the Nature sounds that surround our four men on their adventure, with some keys of banjo here and there, which really helps to delve in the story.In sum, 'Deliverance' is an effective adventure film, which counts with great photography, interpretations and soundtrack to convey a story of instinct and survival over civilization, where good and evil are shown in their most raw form and every major plot event is pondered and brings irreversible consequences for the future. So it is the way of Nature.",Deliverance
230,Jephy1,Still Disappoints,2,4 July 2021,"When I was 16 back in '72 my pals and I heard this was the 'must see' movie of the year--so we went--and I was less than impressed. But fifty years of hype and accolades for this one made me wonder if I'd really missed something at that age that I'd appreciate now. On re-view that is not the case. The picture suffers from a poor, screenplay that moves too slow at times, too cliche' at other times, and just nonsensically most of the time. The yelling and constant pseudo-pickering between the characters makes it hard to swallow they'd ever plan a coffee shop meeting together, let alone an extended camping trip. At every turn I found myself thinking, ""You've got to be kidding me!"" This doesn't even work as a period piece other than to note many films in the early 70s seemed to feature peculiar if not inappropriate laughter at times by the protagonists that has thankfully disappeared from Hollywood since.

Three big city hotshots and one unlikable fat man decide to embark on a coming-of-age canoe trip in some shithole in the backwoods of America and encounter a bunch of zany characters who give our heroes a rich lesson in the culture and traditions of a lesser known area of world. Such encounters involve a banjo lesson from a child of the local gifted and talented school and a game of shotgun hide and go seek, which Jon Voight wins albeit unconvincingly taking advantage of a gentleman who appears to not be completely in control of his faculties. Speaking of hiding things, there is a great wrestling scene between two men, which really encapsulates the essence of masculinity and human triumph, who decide to sort out their stark contrasts in socioeconomic status and cultural beliefs like true men, Mano a Mano.

Deliverance delivers!Some have commented that Ned Beatty's character doesn't react strongly enough to his brutilization....but I think he plays it to perfection. His stunned humiliation says it all.The lack of recognition of the canoeing party by the banjo-playing boy as they pass under him on the river is one of the best moments of foreshadowing ever on film.I believe that the best movies leave a lot of unanswered questions, or at least things to ponder. Why does Ed check the man's mouth after killing him? What's with the removal of the graves? Whose arm is it in Ed's nightmare?This is the stuff of legend!",Deliverance
233,dinaia,This film has a present-day feel to it,9,17 January 2010,"It was made 38 years ago, before I was born and yet I felt I could immediately relate to its themes. First we have, as a character put it, ""man raping nature"" with the progressive industrialization of the wild areas. We have (urban) people trying to rediscover a sense of purity and nobility within nature and away from the increasingly urban confinement. Then there's people living at the outskirts of civilization, in misery and poverty, like animals in human form, with basic emotions and instincts. One of these basic instincts is that the stranger is the enemy. Any manifestation of kindness and familiarity vanishes the next second as if it was never there. And we see the terrifying spectacle of all those emotions we dread: fear, pain, humiliation, uncertainty, guilt. Oh, yes, all this still feels so real.The actors' and non-actors' performances, the actions, the situations are realistic and believable, it's like the whole thing actually just happened.The message is dark and grim. The title should have been ""(There is no) Deliverance"". I want to believe in a sense of humanity and friendship and universal justice. This film has the guts not to provide that. Although my soft nature requires of a film deliverance a la ""Shawshank Redemption"" I feel equally impacted by it.",Deliverance
234,mellowinman,Sometimes You Gotta Lose Yourself Before You Find Anything,10,13 October 2008,"This is one of the greatest films ever made. It's an all-time classic. The character played by Ned Beatty undergoes one of the greatest on screen transformations ever portrayed. He is a shallow, almost useless, overweight insurance salesman. He is proud of his ignorance, and yet judges the ""backwards hicks"" to be the ignorant ones. When he compliments the old man on his hat, and the old man responds, ""you don't know nothing',"" the tone is set. It's true. He really doesn't ""know nothing'."" But one backwoods anal rape later, the man is practically a warrior. His shallow fake bravery is toned down into serious resolve. The old self is forever dead, left in some far off woods, soon to be under hundreds of feet of water. And what of Lewis, our intrepid guide? Lewis is a philosopher/hunter/warrior, and he's just about nuts. Burt Reynolds proved himself as an actor way back in 1972 in this film, completely giving himself in to this wonderful role. Who wouldn't want to have a friend like Lewis if one was to venture into the dangers of a forgotten/soon to be left behind world like the one our hapless travelers find themselves in. This film speaks to us on so many levels. The story feels real. It works as a complete action/adventure, with wonderful cinematography, and deliberate, grinding pacing. It works as a bit of a horror film, with the danger and almost surrealism of the encounter with the vile rednecks who objectify their ""sow"" Ned Beatty. But it also works as an art film, using incredible amounts of symbolism to convey truths that go to our very core. I have seen this film at least fifty times, and every time it comes on, I find I have to watch it. You have to watch it quite a few times to even begin to comprehend it. This is one deep movie. This is one well-acted movie. And this is one hell of a story. I gave it a 10 out of 10, and put it in my 10 all time greatest films ever made, along with Schindler's List, Casablanca, Taxi Driver, and Sling Blade, among others. Movies that make you think. Movies that take you beyond having to think. Movies that use a STORY to make their point, without trying to preach to you. If you think you know Deliverance, you might, but again, you might not.

For those of you who don`t think that Burt Reynolds can act, I disagree. He is great in Deliverance, and he is great in Boogie Nights, The Longest Yard, Smokey and the Bandit, and in The Cannonball Run(Yes, I really enjoy Smokey and Cannonball!). Deliverance has a strong cast, along with a good script and directing from John Boorman. I guess it`s not a movie for everyone`s taste, I did see it again with a friend, and he did slaughter Deliverance and gave it 2/10. Anyway I like it a lot, and recommend it.

The seemingly ordinary but translucently unparalleled plot tantalizes the viewers by adding tension as it progresses. The fact that the plot is so plausible and so believable adds to the complete awe viewers feel while they are watching this brilliant film. The director manages to deliver a fresh and interesting movie and the actors play their roles with extreme believability, particularly and most certainly Jon Voight.

Burt Reynolds is the alpha male in his most iconic role , Jon voight as the Everyman who uses a horrible situation to show what he's made of , Ned Beatty who I'm sure will never want to film on a canoe again and also Ronny cox as the kind banjo playing one of the group .

240,eastie,One of the most disturbing films of all time,8,13 September 1999,"Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance shocks by its plausibility. Certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. The movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better. The film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent of itself, Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.",Deliverance
241,scipio7,A refreshing perspective,8,4 September 2001,"So many movies today have bodies dropping left and right with little regard for the deceased.  Without giving much away, I can tell you that the body count in Deliverance is low.  The extreme detail that is given to each death is what makes this film unique.  Despite what Hollywood may tell you, there are consequences for murder, no matter what the circumstances!The film is incredibly realistic in the aforementioned aspect, as well as in its characters and setting.  The Georgia countryside looks downright lush as the cenetral characters canoe past.  Another unique film about this film is that the characters change, much like the rapidly moving current.  So many films have stagnant characters that are the same from beginning to end. These 4, though, are irrevocably changed by the events in the film.  Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give oscar-worthy performances!8/10",Deliverance

Burt Reynolds is great - a cool dude, even when he's hurt. Jon Voight is also excellent. The whole plot, storyline and ending is really good. There aren't any other words to describe it. If you're not a fan of movies like this, you'll still keep watching it until the end, and really appreciate all the good film-making aspects.

Surely films should attempt to show a fully rounded view of an area rather than stressing the negative images people have of the South. I am English and have never been to the American South but I refuse to believe that it exists as it is portrayed in this film. I can find nothing of worth or interest in this film.

When one reads ""Deliverance"", one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the Deep South. When one watches John Boorman's film version of the book, one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narration. The characters are fully realized, and the portrayals are fantastic. I first saw this movie in 1992, after my freshman year of college. I was in a phase where I was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973. Among them were ""Patton"", ""Papillon"", and ""All the President's Men""; fine films, all of them. This one was easily the class of the group. That says a lot.",Deliverance

Deliverance contains something simplistic that never fails to shock, excite and horrify altogether. Yet even since 1972 it is a testament to the golden oldies that never diminish from the audience's mind. It is very fast paced and aggressive from the start, something you can watch in an hour and a half, yet still the naturalistic approach of director John Boorman remains true to the original story; it is not over sensationalised with music or flimsy acting, or under achieved in any way. It is an account of the terrors that lurk in the backwater, small country towns where strangers are neglected, threatened, terrorised. Much of the movies' story balances on the horrific male rape scene; perpetuated with slow burning use of editing that builds up the tension to danger levels. It's a modern classic; the year of Clockwork Orange; ultra violence at it's best when it seems to come true. Yet still, Deliverance remains even after the land is gone beneath the raging waters.",Deliverance

This is one of the most ambiguous movies I've ever seen because it seems as if the director intentionally leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I guess that is the beauty of the film though, that we're right there with them; seeing everything through their eyes. We know as much (or as little) as they do and therefore never really learn the truth about anything.We never really discover whether their actions in this movie were right or wrong but that's the whole point, the question of whether they deserve 'deliverance' from their sins is left open for the characters in the film and us, the viewers, to ponder and decide.I don't want to give too much away but this is a film that deals with serious thought-provoking issues including rape, murder, death, sins, the law and morality and really lays such important issues down and questions them. It's an raw and intense roller-coaster and I can definitely see where films like 'Wrong Turn' got their influence from.This movie is an absolute must-see, it's gritty, realistic and intense and shows just how easily sheer bliss can turn into sheer hell whilst questioning morality, conscience, human nature and the society we live in along the way.",Deliverance

I love canoes, and was hoping for some decent white water action. Instead I got wooden acting, dull dialogue, a pointless plot and a dirty little scene that got more laughs than shocks when I saw it. Long boring scenes of near drowning took away any chance of my appreciating the progress/nature debate or the concept of civilised man's descent into barbarism when faced with barbaric situations.

Today I've seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is. It's exciting, frightening, shocking and in it's own unique way disturbing. But the best thing about it is the ending where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lifes. It'll torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their lifes about the bodies being found in that river. And there is nothing they can do about it, it's something they have to live with. This ending is one of the most unhappy endings in movie history and very smart, brilliant and horrifyingAnd the acting is also great, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds.

254,The Mogul,A Potent Portrait Of Man In Extremis. Highly Recommended.,9,1 February 2006,"A potent film. Four characters are developed, subtly and succinctly, and then, just as deftly, pushed over the edge. They set out to experience the wilderness of the Cahulawassee River and find it both wonderful and dangerously wild.Patient cinematography captures the river's beauty, isolation, and, later, its ominous force. Crisp, unhurried, often stationary shots let the Cahulawassee's rapids speak for themselves, but equally let the threat of the river's silent stretches resonate.The burbling, roaring, quiet water is this film's soundtrack. This lack, by and large, of extra-diagetic music perfectly suits the material; the audience never gets to experience everyday movieland. The one exception to this rule is the 'Duelling Banjos' theme, which, while initially forming part of the story, later echoes down the river to great effect.The song, as first exchanged between one of the canoers and an autistic hillbilly, is a deservedly famous showstopper. However, this film is far more than a song.The thrill and terror of exploration; the disappearance of wilderness; the light and dark sides of both nature and man; loyalty; faith in others and in society; democracy; the morality of killing; the clash of urban and rural culture; prejudice; notions of justice; the capacities of man in extremis; the consequences of secrecy; man 'after the fall'  this film touches upon many complex and powerful themes, yet this richness is rarely conspicuous and never belaboured.Performances are universally excellent. John Voight's understated showing hypnotises: looking into to his eyes we experience the film's trials, and on the other side we feel changed as he feels changed. Burt Reynolds and Ned Beatty are also convincing in their more exuberant roles. The secondary characters that populate Deliverance strikingly transport the film to the edge of civilisation. The lingering peep-show shots of Lewis's search for a driver are a disturbing portent.Highly Recommended.",Deliverance
255,dchristrev,Still Creepy After All These Years!,9,14 June 2004,"Those who are disappointed that this fine film is not more violent, or whatever it is that you think is missing, you probably do not have the attention span necessary to enjoy most films, like Deliverance, that are more subtle in their delivery. The creepy quotient is high in this and I think it is partly because it is driven by the sense of isolation and not necessarily by the level of violence. And who cares if the canoing scenes sometimes don't look altogether realistic. That's hardly the point. One of the other reviewers makes a good point that the scene of the crime will soon be wiped out by flooding, which I think is one of the creepiest aspects of the film. Besides, the actors took some tremendous risks in filming some of those scenes, so I think that kind of criticism is unfair to say the least. Also, this film was nominated for Best Picture in 1972, but the Godfather won that year, so no chance there, although the other pictures nominated probably were not the equal of Deliverance, so if the Godfather had not been in the picture, who knows? It would be difficult to argue against the nominees for Best Actor that year, but perhaps they could have nominated Reynolds for Best Supporting? Of course, then he would have been competing against Pacino, Caan and Duvall from the Godfather, who cancelled each other out and Joel Grey won for ""Cabaret"" Tough call.",Deliverance

The pacing and built up anticipation of this film is awesome, I'd almost put it right up there with the shining. You constantly get the feeling that something terrible is going to happen. At the time it was released it must have shocked audiences as its pretty extreme for back then but nothing as graphic as we have now. I kind of like that about it though because it sticks to the classic form of horrors while mixing it with a newer more extreme style. Its also it's realistic quality that makes it particularly scary, it feels as if it could happen to anyone. It was strange to see Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds so young they're both almost unrecognisable from how they look now. I really liked the way the camera stopped and focused on people's faces and expressions throughout the film making them even more creepy. The people in the town at the end were just as strange as those by the river. With the title being 'deliverance' it was clever the way they got out of the river by the church. The only thing I didn't like about this film was the ending. It kept you feeling like something more was going to happen but it just cut out with him waking up from a bad dream.

Aside from the main players, the 'mountain men' are amongst the most sinister villains in film history, and the banjo playing boy is coldly sinister in two of the best moments.As always the infamous rape scene must be mentioned.  In short, it is horrible.  Not for the immature, nor those seeking entertainment and nothing else.  Deliverance demands to be watched.  Those who consider themselves film fans must do so.

Seeing it now, at the age of 46, and with half a (or a whole) lifetime behind me, the movie is still ""cool"". But it is so much more also. It's a comment on the pros and cons of ""the system"", the evolved society of man.

This river don't go to AINTREE.,9,12 August 2006,"I am a member of a canoeing club and I can tell you the truth that Deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience. As we put our boats into the water, banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind. This movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human's place in nature and technology's effect upon man's relationship with nature. We see it in the bow fishing. We see it in the home made tent. There is also city man's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman ""cracker"". The fact that the Banker from Atlanta (Ned Beatty) has ""bad teeth"" is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the struggle of life and death supersedes ""civilized man's"" suppositives about ""The Law"".

This film is one of a good number of examples of the fact that a tense, disturbing story does not need a huge budget. Naturally, the film is now dated in many ways but the period feel adds to its appeal now and the events could occur as easily today as in their early 70s depiction.

The great irony is that these city boys get nailed by the wilderness that their brethren are about to erradicate.  The movie is one of the great icons of the last 30 years - jam packed with chilling moments, funny bits of guy talk, as well as campy scenes and dialogue.  I think the film making is in fact remarkable - the cast was on their own on the river (get the dvd for details); some beautiful scenery was captured as backdrop, and eventually we go along on a Disney ride gone wrong - a hair-raising adventure.  Burt Reynolds, playing Lewis, by far the most intriguing character, peaked in this film; the rest of his career unfortunately has been pretty much exploitation (well, till Boogie Nights).

With no clue where they are, clueless in what they are doing. They involve local strangers who look barely human after generations of inbreeding, they get hunted, and one raped because they were too stupid to leave crazy people alone. The river kills Drew, Lewis (Burt) nearly dies, and if he only died for real in 1972 then the cinematic world would be better for it. The hillbillies try to kill them all themselves, but the canoe dummies manage to kill two of them. It's a depressingly creepy town, so bad I had to wonder why anyone went to the lengths they did to try and save anything in it. The survivors evade the law (which again seems out of place where they are), go home and cry, end of story. Altogether it's twice as long as the story requires, an extremely depressing story, and at least two hours which would be better spent soaking your head in the toilet, or running around naked in the woods while squealing like a pig. SQUEEEEEAL!!! Did I mention the acting was terrible? I know this was a horror movie, but the acting in itself was the most harrowing part of it all, save the hillbillies who deserve Oscars for convincing portrayal of craziness. The very worst of the acting, and ranking among the worst I've seen anywhere was between Reynolds and Voight.The only worthwhile scene in this whole movie was the duet of Drew's guitar with Creepy, Dead-Eyed Hillbilly's banjo in Dueling Banjos.

272,darien3,"Maybe not a ""shocker"" by today's standards ...",10,7 August 2000,"I've just been reading all of the comments about this movie and was interested by the different points of view of those submitting them. I have to say, first of all, that I totally agree with the person who said that you SHOULD ALSO READ THE NOVEL. Like any other story, all of the various elements within it can NEVER be transferred to the screen - novels are just too long and involved. I totally DISAGREE that Boorman did a crappy job of directing or that this film in ANY WAY stinks. The first time that I saw this is when it came out in 1972. In ""judging"" this picture, you need to remember that societal expectations were a LOT different (in America) than they are today. EVERYONE was talking about the ""rape scene"" in this movie. NO ONE had filmed something like that, that I know of - or that I remember anyone else ever having heard of being in a movie at that time. Most probably, the issue hadn't been addressed within a novel, either - until Dickie wrote this. I was 14 when I snuck in to see this - and it had an impact even though I knew what was coming. I'd read the book right after seeing it - and, again, it's MUCH more involved and dramatic. A few years ago, I took a course called ""The Male In American Literature"" and was surprised and pleased to find that ""Deliverance"" was on the syllabus as one of the stories we'd be studying. In re-reading this as an adult (and after a higher education) there were many things I had never noticed before. Dickie uses a LOT OF ""foreshadowing"" in the story - right down to something that no one else in the class noticed, but I did: the color orange is often associated with ""caution"" and he mentions it a whole lot of times. I went back and watched the movie again, as well - it had been many years since I had first seen it. I did notice what another reviewer mentions here - that you never do see the identity of that other person in the tow truck - and I mentioned to my friend that for the first time I thought it was those same guys who were involved in accosting the canoeing party further downriver. Someone else mentions here (in these reviews) about how the kid who had played ""Dueling Banjoes"" with Drew doesn't even acknowledge him when they are passing under him, under the bridge. Again - foreshadowing - another subtle hint that something terrible is about to happen. I don't think that this story - whether the book or the novel - is a ""bad"" one at all. I agree totally with the person who said that there are much deeper elements at work here. If you thought the movie stunk, read the book - then go back and give the movie another chance. You'll understand the story better and will see it in a totally different light. It is also interesting how in this story, like in Harper Lee's American classic ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" the author raises the question if killing another human being is ever ""justified."" I don't think that any of can really say, with complete conviction and assuredness, that we ""never could."" I sure as hell wouldn't have wanted to go through something like that canoe trip. But we all have our own ""baggage"" in life, don't we? All have our own stories to tell - if not about ourselves and things that have happened to us, then certainly about horrible things which have happened to someone we know. In closing, I'd just like to say that whoever compared this to ""Blair Witch"" ...  Well, let's just say that I think any 5-year-old could have made the latter. There's NO comparison in ""literary value,"" so to speak. I debated asking for my money back from renting the tape. Had I spent the extra money to see it at the theater, I definitely would have walked out half way through, and would most likely have demanded my money be returned. ""Deliverance"" is NOT trash. The characters are VERY realistic, the story line is haunting in subtle undertones, and the acting is nothing short of EXCELLENT. Personally, I can't see how anyone would think any different of it, but we're all entitled to our opinion.",Deliverance

Deliverance has one foot in this camp.  When I saw it in 1978 I thought it was genuinely disturbing, and kept me on the edge of my seat.  Watching it last night, for the first time since then, I enjoyed it, but not as much as I was expecting.Some parts just didn't ring true.  After Burt Reynolds shoots the hillbilly, Ned Beatty makes a very half hearted attempt to grab the dead man, the others restrain him, and not a word is spoken.  That didn't seem to work for me.  Then why did John Voight climb the cliff to kill the hillbilly?  They weren't even sure that Ronny Cox had been shot.  Just get in the canoe and scarper who heaven's sake.  If the hillbilly had been trying to get them he could have picked them off as they sat about, and Voight would have been very vulnerable half way up a cliff.That said, it is still an iconic film.  If you are ever in some spooky woods in the middle of nowhere just say ""deliverance territory"" and everyone knows what you mean.  That, I suppose, is a test of a good film after all.",Deliverance
275,treybott85,"Disturbing, yet thought provoking",7,1 March 2002,"This was, undoubtedly, the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen.  The first part of the movie, though strange, has a light and amusing quality to it.  The journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of Appalachia. But that is misleading beyond belief. The obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the countryside's inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie.  I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain, and I shudder at the thought.  Lewis's leg made me wince.  Yet, while the movie was, on the whole, very disturbing and distressing, it posed some interesting questions. When is it moral, or right to take another individual's life?  What can morality drive us to do, or not do, in some cases?  And are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever conclusions one may draw from the film, it is an achievement in its own right (despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome).",Deliverance
276,titan000040,I was shocked at how old this movie was.,7,2 November 2008,"Deliverance, staring John Voight and Burt Reynolds, was a very entertaining movie to watch. There is a lot to like about this film. It really draws you into the story, as four men from the city decide to venture down the Cahulawassee River before the government tampers with it. Not too long into their journey, does their nature trip turn into a vicious fight for survival. What was great about this film was the editing. It was paced very good as director John Boorman really let his scenes play out perfectly. To a viewer who knows nothing about this film, there are a bunch of surprises in place that will really make them squirm in their seat. The film looked fantastic, to the point that its really hard to believe how dated this film actually is. It's thirty six year old movie that looks like something that could be aired in theaters today. There is though, a few things that I didn't like. It's hard to determine if the character Lewis was supposed to be that strange and awkward or if Burt Reynolds just did a horrible job in his role. He's the cool guy of the group, who knows how to survive in the wilderness, who knows how to handle every situation perfectly. However at times he just seemed like an idiot, who has absolutely no idea what he's doing or talking about. It's easier to say that Reynolds botched up his role, being that he was never really considered that great of an actor. John Voigt, on the other hand, was superb. With the exception of the scenes where he's talking to himself on the mountain, he does an amazing job as the character everyone's supposed to relate to and feel for. I felt this movie was enjoyable ALMOST the whole way through. It could have ended a good twenty minutes before it did. Overall though, I really liked it.",Deliverance
277,filmfanfilmfanfilmfan,oppressively chilling to watch and very thought provoking,10,13 December 2014,"SPOILERS! My review is mostly meant for examination by those who have already seen the movie!As others have said this is a truly chilling and sinister film, many so called scary films lose their edge over the years by becoming dated, but this film feels sinister from the beginning and becomes almost unbearably oppressive to watch. Probably what makes it so chilling is the terrible events are entirely plausible.One reviewer here said that this film was about how violence (real violence) affects people, I won't repeat his review because he explains it more eloquently than I, but I totally agree.But interestingly enough as a woman it seemed to me that this movie was also examining masculinity but none of the male reviewers here have mentioned that, so I may be wrong. But I feel this way because it is noticeable to me how differently the men react, compared to women, to trauma. After the male rape not only is it never mentioned again but even initially when Ned is rescued it is not mentioned. I feel women would at least have a cry and hug each other first, but I may be wrong, because shock can manifest in different ways. However all of the men react in the same seemingly unemotional way, of course it is obvious that the men are traumatised by the event but their reaction is to protect their friend and fix the problem. And their way of fixing the problem is by not talking about it. Of course, part of the reason this event can't be discussed is because it is so emasculating. But their caring is obvious in little vignettes, for instance when Jon Voight helps Ned dress after the rape. Why men suppress emotions is something I have not always understood and at times has annoyed me, but this movie was such an insight for me, as I finally got it. We women know how to let out emotion safely, but men are so trained to suppress it that when it does happen it is often like a dam bursting then they can't control it, so it's safer to bottle it up.But the sad thing is though that their suppression will have terrible effects on them, this is one of the reasons therapists often say people shouldn't ""bury"" their problem (never was a metaphor so apt as in this film), however letting it out will make them crack, so they can't win, if they talk about it or suppress it, either way it will affect their sanity.Mind you even as a woman I could understand that many women would want to bottle up an event as traumatic as this one.Depressingly enough most movies when women get raped there is often something still ""sexy"" about the way it is shot but the male rape scene here is so sudden and so chilling you feel their helplessness and you know that if they aren't rescued that they will be killed and horribly, and you know they know this. Often rape reports deal with the violation but this scene really brings home to you the thought of not just the violation but the sheer terror that victims must feel, so I think this scene would be equally illustrative of what both men and women would experience.Even before the rape, it is obvious to me that all these men feel inadequate as men. Macho Lewis is over compensating, whiny Ned boasts about sexual conquests because he knows how unmanly he seems.So they want adventure (ie violence) so to transform themselves into real men, but ironically they don't understand that real violence isn't an adventure. Weirdly enough what should be considered emasculating, the horrible rape Ned experiences, is actually what transforms him into a real man, one who is scared but determined to survive and help his friends.Lewis almost does the opposite he goes from being the strong survivalist (though who undoubtedly saves them) to being terrified and in visible distress from his injury and helplessness.But I don't think the movie is saying that he is a coward. I think the movie shows them all as true human beings, they all show great courage at times but are also reduced to absolute terror at other times as anyone experiencing such horrors would. But that's part of the point is that you can not have true courage without real fear.So unlike the comic book heroes that they wanted to emulate, true heroism evolves from enduring terrible trauma.And it makes me wonder if perhaps one of the reasons that war veterans do not speak of war isn't just because of the horrors they saw but perhaps they are also ashamed of the times that they showed fear, no matter how courageous they may have been, deep down they may feel like cowards.The sad thing is that I think that the characters here will be forever traumatised and feel emasculated by what happened to them but the events were also the making of them as courageous heroes but they probably won't see it that way, but I had no doubt that Ned would go away being stronger, kinder and less brash to others and that Lewis would become more humble and that Jon Voight would appreciate his family more.This is one of the few movies I've seen adult male rape in, and society rarely mentions it too. I think issues such as this should be explored more in cinema, so that men who have experienced such terrible trauma can at least feel that the issue is being addressed in some way. Because let's face it part of the reason why Ned and the other characters can't speak about the rape is because society has deemed adult male rape to be an unspeakably shameful subject.",Deliverance

280,Everton_Paul,One of the finest films ever,10,25 April 2006,"Deliverance is, in my opinion, one of the finest movies ever made. Several other reviewers have passed comments like 'boring', Obviously subscribers to the brain dead, 2 minute attention span, machine gun edited film school of (much of) modern cinema. Oh dear!Many other reviewers have passed comments like, ""for the 70's, an excellent film.."" Err.., hang on a minute, the 1970s was probably the finest era of Hollywood cinema!! An era when there were; numerous, super talented leading actors who were noted for their ACTING rather than their looks, great directors, and interesting plots - coupled with a coming of age of cinematography and film/camera techniques. The 70's was an era when so many topics (war, love, crime, drama) were made into true classic, gripping must-see movies.Oh HOW I wish the same could be said today!! Getting back to Deliverance! I won't talk about the plot, as other reviews here talk in depth about that. I will simply say that this is one of the afore mentioned 'must-see' movies!! The acting throughout (by the leads and the support - many of whom were genuine locals) is extraordinary. Burt Reynolds in particular blew me away, simply because I never realised (when I first saw it) that he could be so utterly brilliant as an 'straight' actor - rather than a comedic actor. The cinematography is jaw dropping, and the editing is seamless (so unlike today movies today)- slow and relaxed in parts (allowing the film to 'breath') and tight and fast when needed.The sheer beauty of the photography is a joy, and the wonderful scenery and beautiful surroundings belie the horrible situation the four central characters find themselves in.Like all great movies, the movie contains COMPELLING sequences and in Deliverance there are two of note - 1) the dualling banjos scene, and 2) the infamous rape scene. Like the Russian Roulette scene in the Deer Hunter, or the 'Is it safe' dental torture scene in Marathon man - these scenes are utterly gripping, so brilliantly acted and believable, you cannot divert your attention from the screen. Such moments pass into movie legend. Such scenes are full of human drama - a drama that is intensified by the ACTING - and not ruined (as is often the case today) by needless, superfluous fast and rapid editing. The camera is allowed to dwell on actors faces, or actors as a group - so that the interaction is more realistic, and the movie watcher feels more like an 'observer' (instead of just being made to feel dizzy and sick - as is often the case with the over the top editing typical today!) I am 32, and how I envy the cinemagoer of the 70's. Thank god for DVD! The only down side of this movie is the negative image it portrays of the 'South'. I have seen several documentaries of life in the south, and have visited Georgia and the Carolinas. The majority of people I met (and observed on the documentaries) from the region are very friendly and helpful. For many 'southerners', two truths pervade, religion and poverty. Life is very, very tough for many of the people in these regions and they are suitably hardy and phlegmatic about life's struggles and death. There is a gritty and raw side to their character.I have travelled widely throughout the US, and the many of the people of the North Eastern US have not got a clue about life in the South.I don't want to get political, but George Bush Jnr could do with addressing some REAL social concerns (i.e. poverty) in his own country before 'preaching' to the wider world about 'democracy' and 'freedom'.The movie Deliverance portrays the poverty and hardship of the South (that still exists today) accurately, but it gives a disproportionate image of the 'evil' side of the region. Having said that - it is a story!!",Deliverance
281,cmdev,Solid,8,9 August 2021,"As another reviewer noted, what makes Deliverance spooky is not specifically the plot but the plausibility of it all, and I completely agree. This film conveys being in a survival situation very well. It's correctly an ugly and unglamorous experience enhanced by the nontraditional ending and writing.Deliverance may be a disturbing watch (especially for more innocent minds) but aside from the one notorious scene it doesn't go too far. Personally I think that scene really adds to the gravity of the plot, but I can see how it would be pretty shocking to some people.As for the technical stuff, the characters are memorable and each one contributes to the story and the deeper symbolism of the film. The performances of all four lead actors, in particular Jon Voight, are top notch and deserve the praise they receive. The lack of much of a score really contributes to the suspense and plausibility I mentioned above.My only complaint is that the pacing seemed rushed/unpolished at times.

The most disturbing films I've seen are Last House on the Left, I Spit on Your Grave, Salo, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Cannibal Ferox, Cannibal Holocaust and Deliverance. I saw I spit on Your grave before this and i thought it was a shocking and unbearable movie. I heard Deliverance was close to ISOYG so i checked it out. I loved it. I like the story: 4 city boys plan a canoe trip down the cahulawassee river and 2 of them are captured by 2 deranged inbred Hillbillys, and are tortured, raped and violated in the woods. It's not as unbearable as I spit on Your Grave and Last House on the Left but that ""Squeal Like a Pig"" rape scene is really disturbing.

289,david.farthing,Dated,6,7 April 2000,I watched this on DVD with high expectations. 'The duelling banjos' tune retrieved from the back of my mind. As I sat back to watch I was immediately hit with how dated the film was.The scenery was great and when they get up into the wilderness to begin their journey and they meet the local boy with the Banjo that tune imediately gets into your mind. Unfortunately for me it is soon after this that the story becomes a little dull. Whilst the story was great back in the seventies it seems to have lost some of its appeal over the last few years. The river scenes make the film but the rapids seemed to be a little tame compared to how I remember them first time round. There is a certain rough quality to the film that makes it worth seeing at least once. The commentary on the DVD is worth watching just to understand how they approached filming in such a remarkable location.,Deliverance
290,MisterRedWhite,One of the greatest movies of all times,10,17 April 2019,"This movie was so far ahead of its time it wasn't funny. The director hauled everything in for miles and made the photographers be in the water to create realism and a movie goer point of view. The actors did all the stunts. They learned how to shoot bows properly and canoe severe whitewater. The soundtrack and back ground noises are. Incredibly real.
The acting is fantastic, but directed to excellence. So many films have copied elements of this movie, as well as how to shoot a movie on location e.g. Platoon, Predator, etc.
The one scene I have to fast forward though is too harsh for me, but it happens, so I respect it. If you can't appreciate this film then you have no business reviewing films.",Deliverance

292,clint-thrust,My own ramblings on the subject of Deliverance,8,30 March 2008,"Deliverance is John Boorman's 1972 horror/thriller movie about a group of four Atlanta businessmen (Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cox), that undertake a canoe trip down the Cahulawassee River before the river is dammed. Along the way, a raft (no pun intended) of unpleasant things happen to the men. Despite the nasty happenings in this picture, Boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely. The location was really chosen well. Indeed, this would still be a very nice film to watch, had the canoe trip gone smoothly. The lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible. Not only is the location scenic, but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. It has been said that Burt Reynolds' performance as the outdoorsman, Lewis, is the star acting role in this film. I reckon however, that Jon Voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man, Ed, who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive. In fact, the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman. It was Voight himself. To cut costs the filming wasn't insured and the actors did their own stunts. The soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. Eric Weissberg's and Steve Mendel's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the Duelling Banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance. At a couple of other points in the movie, we are treated to more, softer, banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river For all the good points of this film, I did find it a little lacking in purpose. It doesn't build suspense very well and it isn't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe. The plot itself is somewhat poor and it doesn't really go anywhere. Nevertheless, this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation. I did like it but for fans of gore, there isn't really much of it. None really, in fact. It isn't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour. Think of it like Rambo: First Blood meets Three Men In A Boat. Look out for a very young Charley Boorman as Ed's son. I did like this movie, the soundtrack, cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10.",Deliverance

There are more than couple of problems in the ""continuity"" section...Butb it's okay, I can live with them! - The story itself is horrifically monstrous and thus good!Burt Reynolds makes in my opinion the best role of his entire career - and look at Jon Voight after about 75 minutes: he looks like a young Johnny Depp!",Deliverance
294,froggiebastard,Unnerving Apocalyptic hell,8,31 January 2004,"From the onset Deliverance sets itself as different and special movie, distancing itself from the usual adventure canoe movies (such as Curtis Hanson's River Wild (1994)).  The much-heralded ""Duel Banjo"" scene is a spectacular and unnerving start to the film- Ronny Cox's character, whilst waiting in a desolate ""gas"" station strums up his guitar with a strange-looking inbred child playing on his banjo.  The scene that follows is as brilliant as it is disturbing and the music becomes a soundtrack for the rest of the film.The four canoeists (Reynolds, Voight, Beatty, Cox) trip down the River (soon to be flooded by a huge lake- a very neat twist from writer Dickey) doesn't become a trip to survive nature as one assumes it will be, but a fight for survival from fellow men. And what men!!! The nemesis of  the canoists turns out to be a duo of inbred hillbillies (rotting teeth et al). Making the hillbillies the villans is a terrifying touch-  their faces contorted in ugliness, with seemingly no sense of morals and humanity.   The most uncomfortable scene of the film is the male-rape scene (""Squeel like a piggy!"")- but don't let it put you off seeing the movie.It's not flawless, however.  The film makes very uncomfortable viewing (and essentially unsatisfying) and you never feel a real attachment with the protaganists but if you like your movies with a bit of originality and horror this is the one for you...Reynolds puts in one of his better perfomances and Jon Voight (father of Angelina Jolie) acts in what probably is his best performance to date.  Boormans direction is sound, and this is undoubtably one of his best movies.The film turns into an apocalyptic struggle for the canoeists, and Boorman creates a nightmarish hell that will play upon your mind for days to come- and put you off canoeing for life...

295,alientimes,The only Jon Voight film I can stand,7,5 December 2003,"This is not so much a review of Deliverance as a libellous diatribe about Jon Voight.  Every single film I have seen him in either sucks or is highly over-rated.  Or both.  Take for example The Deer Hunter, sentimental patriotic mush and pretentious to boot.  Then there's Coming Home, more or less the same movie only without the Russian Roulette.  Midnight Cowboy is the most overrated film ever, surely.  So the best thing about Deliverance is that somehow I can actually watch it despite Jon Voight's creeping, seeping presence.  And obviously the bit with the banjoes is fun and when the fat guy has to squeal like a pig.  The theme of man vs nature has been better done (even by Boorman) but it keeps the film the right side of sensationalist and its probably Burt Reynold's best film, unless you want to include Boogie Nights, obviously.",Deliverance
296,MJKAnderson90,Deliverance Delivers,7,14 January 2013,"I went in expecting to see another ""The Hills Have Eyes"" or ""Wrong Turn."" I was pleasantly surprised and mistaken. The character development was great. Burt Reynolds plays a perfect conspiracy theorist-end of the world-survivalist and John Voight is a perfect character foil. He is a successful businessman with a beautiful wife and son and a perfect life. Both Burt's and John's character arcs are interesting and unexpected. John becomes the underdog-hero and Burt becomes the victim. And let's not overlook unforgettable performances by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. The story development is what really took me by surprise. As I said before, I was expecting another story about some guys fighting disfigured people in unfamiliar territory. The story, however, was more about four men fighting for survival when modern society has been stripped from them. The two ""hillbillies"" were simply the catalyst to set the events in motion. The only reason I give this a 7/10 instead of a 9/10 is because of one scene. The cinematography was consistently beautiful throughout the film, except the scene they shot day for night. I understand they didn't have film stock or lenses that would shoot in low light levels and they had to make do with what they could. However, it was so distracting in some parts that it completely took me out of the moment and I was only able settle back in several minutes after the scene was over.

All the performances are really superb, especially Voight as the conflicted Ed. The musical score is very catchy yet is creepy after watching the movie, sort of like The Exorcist's Tubular Bells.

303,scottd_123,"moving, sickening and rather epic.",9,16 December 2006,"well at the beginning of the film, everything is completely normal. we see four men, just taking some time out to go canoing somewhere in the outback, for time to unwind and relax, or maybe so, for a little adventure.But as the film goes on, things take a terrifying dive for the worse, as the four young men got a lot more than they bargained for, and as an audience we witness some of the finest acting which modern cinema lacks dramatically also while squirming in suspense at the some of the critical points in the movie.Of course the 2 highlights most critics would agree would be the famous duelling banjos scene, in which a retarded child takes on a musical duel with Ronny cox's character drew. and of course the other scene is the very controversial homosexual hillbilly rape, in which i dreaded as it built up to it, yet was unable to take my eyes off of the screen.the theme music through out the film, in a way sums up the epic tale, the riff played during the duelling guitar scene is played through out the film, but much slower.an undeniable superb piece of acting is john Voight's character, in which we see a truly normal ordinary man, put to the test as he has to use wits and skill, and even more, courage to actually survive the sinister villains. the retarded banjo boy who duels with cox's character drew at the beginning, is considered by most viewers as with out a doubt, the most sinister, despite him not doing anything bad to the men at all. i think its because he represents the villainous territory in which the men don't belong in, and i think the bit when they are flowing down stream and they see the boy on the bridge above, staring at them, thats when as an audience we see that there is a dark hidden evil in the outback.all in all, the film is intense, gritty, violent, morbid, and epic in general. the film is a dark journey through the great unknown which is hidden from the world, an evil not visible by the likes of 'city people'. a deteriorating world hidden out of sight, where there is simply a different way of life.superb film in all.9/10 - recommended",Deliverance
304,rcvincelli,What Lies Buried Beneath the Lake?,10,3 July 2008,"""It's all up to you, Ed?"" ""Now you get to play the game."" The day my father left my mother, he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend, on opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was but fourteen years old. I wasn't even entirely sure what I was seeing, but I will never forgot it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty.Watching it today, thirty-six years later, it still gives me quivers.My father was a huge Burt Reynolds fan, hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie.' I had seen two films at the Dome prior to this: ""Grand Prix"" and ""The Song of Norway."" Well this wasn't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shell-shocked.But even at that tender age, I appreciated the artistry...and after seeing again today, am I surprised I was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing, yet extremely well-crafted film.Suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year-old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend. I don't blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit much for a child to witness.As an adult, I still find it quite disturbing, yet I am still very impressed with the quality of the film-making.Burt Reynolds as an absolute wonder, as are all the principles...from Billy Redden as the inbred guitar wonder, to Ronny Cox as the terrified insurance salesman...everyone does an admirable job. The sound quality is second to none, from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks. The photography, cinematography...all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate.The moral questions raised, from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being, remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released. And the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life-altering. These four men, city men, suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined, raise the bar from action to horror.It's a classic to be sure. And the phrase ""you have a pretty mouth"" has been quoted endlessly, from Saturday Night Live to off-the-cuff comments around water-cooler at work, this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture...as much as ""Make my day"" or ""I'll be back"" ever were.So what would YOU do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city, cozy bed, wife and kids? And if you took the measures Burt Reynolds did (and I would have done the same) would you bury the body beneath the soon-to-be-lake, or stand trial and take your chances? The bottom line is: Deliverance delivers. You can take that to the bank. If this movie doesn't get under your skin, then you are not human.Even if you have seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the above question.My favorite part of the film remains the same: Ed failing to kill the deer...then changing. Life and it's unpredictable circumstance can change a man. And I suppose that's what this film is all about Jon Voight, in particular, as Ed, gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the more gifted actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his highly underrated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor, his acting lifts the movie to another level. Climbing the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to make it right It needs to be seen to be believed. I guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level.Briskly paced, tense, taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string, this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today. Times have changes, but our choices as human beings have not.Ten out of ten stars.",Deliverance
305,zoot_suit44,An incredible masterpiece,9,26 July 2008,"When a movie shocks you with it's disturbing, brooding atmosphere, and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography, you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat, masterpiece of a film. Although with most modern movies, extremely enjoyable as some are, those that really shock you into focus are the strongest, and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly, stick with you for a life time. I say, proudly, that I am a fan of movies that disturb, not just horror movies, but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding. Movies like Breakdown and The Missing, that send a chill down your spine, making you think ""holy crap, that could happen to me"", and visually entice you, are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie. Because I am only 21, I did not grow up with actors like Burt Renyolds, Jon Voight and Ned Beatty, albeit I am familiar with them, I didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors, as opposed to actors now like Shia LaBouf and Justin Long. I must say, after the long hype and witnessing Deliverance for the first time, I was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago, and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies. Burt Renyolds plays Lewis, the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made, filling the whole wilderness in water. Renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer, sort of no nonsense, and filled with machismo. Witnessing him portray the tough guy, made me think differently about him as an actor, as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician. The dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader. Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty play as the novice adventurers, Drew and Bob respectively, joining in for the fun of a canoe trip. The actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was Jon Voight, once again I have only seen him as an older actor, however, unlike Renyolds, I have quite liked Voight's acting (and i don't regard Anaconda when I say that), for example the national treasure movies. Voight plays Ed, whom, like Lewis, is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character, a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks Lewis' machismo. The film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside. You immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to, like the imbred kid who plays the infamous ""Duelling Banjo's"" at the start of the film with Ronny Cox's character Drew; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene. As with all atmospheric movies, from this moment on, dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form. The canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival. The film's cinematics do not let up, and I back that comment up with the scene in which Ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow. As Ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him, cocks his rifle, only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting I have seen in a film. In wrapping up, Deliverance is one film, who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date, remains one of the best films in cinematic history.",Deliverance
306,aryluizdalazenjunior,"The best film of John Boorman, and a testament of Burt Reynolds talent as an actor.",8,24 May 2012,"Extremely brutal film, it is arguably the best performance in the career of Burt Reynolds, and may be John Boorman,'s finest. I always thought that Mr. Boorman was among the best filmmakers ever - him, David Cronenberg and John Frankenheimer. Sadly, none of these three ever won an Academy Award. I read the novel by James Dickey, which I think is a more suitable vehicle for such a powerful story of man versus nature, in a sense that the author uses the advantage of not being limited to budget or time constriction. In paper, Deliverance is even more gripping than the movie, and you get to know what happens for the surviving members of the adventure once they come back to civilization. I remember Dickey's prose, describing the Jon Voight character in the novel, coming back to civilization after the ordeal, the buildings gradually appearing, the mountains behind, but the river, although far, perennial and now a part of himself. Some of the best poetic things about the novel couldn't be translated to the film, but this 1972 movie stood the test of time. It builds atmosphere, and it is a testament for the quality of the writing and the direction, that even with not much happening, the film is breathtaking and tense, and when tragedy strikes, it's a roller-coaster.

In spite of Boorman's lackluster effort to achieve a powerful conclusion, the collective performances of the actors involved in Deliverance truly shine, ultimately shedding light on the degradation suffered at the hands of another human being and therefore, Deliverance offers an intriguing and concise perspective into the depths of human behaviour. ~TheSilencingMachine",Deliverance
309,patrick-319,Awesome Existential Action/Adventure Classic!!!!,10,10 February 2006,"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen. The acting is absolutely stellar -- the chemistry between Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox is incredible as four guys from wildly differing backgrounds, united by a common thread of humanity. The four city-slickers head out together for a white water canoe trip down a river in the hill country of northern Georgia. The film is packed to the brim with action, adventure, and the essence of survival. Adding to the intensity is that fact that almost all of the movie was shot on location, at an almost inaccessible river deep in the south. Director John Boorman had to use jeeps to truck in the equipment and the 4 lead actors were actually transported by canoe! Voight also performs a rock climbing feat that will leave you in awe (according to the ""making of"" documentary on the DVD, Voight declined to use a stuntman). The white-water cinematography and choreography is breathtaking, especially considering that this was shot in the early 1970s.At first, from a quick glance, Deliverance appears to be a straightforward adventure story; however, the film goes down a deeply philosophical route as the four men race their vehicles into the back-country and then their canoes down the wilds of the river. The film explores our relationship with nature, conceptualization of morality, and the existentialism inherent in life. The backwoods hillbillies the four adventurers interact with in various ways paint an amazingly complex portrait which ties together the destruction of nature, man's ""evolution"" from his natural roots to the resigned life of ""city dweller,"" and the tensions and prejudice inherent in humanity. This is done perfectly, without drawing on stereotypical ""black vs. white"" or ""yankee vs. southerner"" comparisons--all the characters in this film are southerners, although each character (major and minor), for all intensive purposes, transcends categorization.The ""Dueling Banjo"" scene, in which guitar-slinging Ronny Cox battles a banjo-playing hillbilly kid (the actor, Billy Redden, was actually a resident of the backwoods region where this was shot) sharply complements the men's fight against the river, and the river's fight to remain wild. This film simultaneously explores the theme of duality from the confines of: (1) the individual's mind, (2) Reynolds' group of comrades, (3) all humanity as a whole, and (4) something much greater. The banjo music in this scene is awesome!!! If you enjoy the song ""Dueling Banjos"", I strongly suggest that you pick up the Deliverance soundtrack, which also includes 17 additional songs played by amazing banjo musician Eric Weissberg (I believe only ""Deuling Banjos"" and maybe one or two other songs were actually used in the film).There are some disturbing scenes in this film, so it is not for the overly squeamish but, if you think you can handle the river, I encourage you to take this powerful, action-packed journey into the philosophical backwater of humanity!",Deliverance

The story itself is believable, suspenseful, and well thought out. Character development is also done well, the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film. The villains in this movie are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something. This movie shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it.

Deliverance stays in your mind long after you first see it - and I find that it is eminently suitable for repeated viewings.  The simplicity of this movie is part of its charm.

That is, I think it is one of the best ""who done-it"" plots of all time. The fact that we never really know whether or not the four city slickers were being pursued from the start or whether or not Voight shot the wrong guy or not... But there are clues. Like the shot of three guys in the woods when the trip set out up river, when there were only two guys that followed them in the truck. At first we think it is the same guys that agreed to drive the cars. But where did the third come from? Were they even the same guys or some others? And why did the sheriff ask Voight if the two guys who agreed to drive the cars had a third with them? Did he suspect something about three crazed buggers haunting those parts? Or did he suspect that the missing brother-in-law may have been with them? And other minor clues... The guy that Voight shot on the top of the gorge had a wedding ring that the directors were key to focus on. Brother-in-law of the guy in Aintry as he suggested? Also, there aren't many bridges in that neck of the woods. The rape scene was on the right bank. Voight shot the second victim on the left bank. Careless or meaningless direction? I don't think so. Not from Boorman. But do I know what it all means? Hell no, but it is worth buying the DVD and doing a closer study. I think there is an answer in there somewhere. But if anyone else has it figured out, please let me know. Fascinating.",Deliverance

319,void074,Ed (voight) and the cliff climb....,10,23 July 2007,"I've seen a version of this film, not sure how many different versions there were, but during Ed's climb up the cliff wall to kill the man who 'shot' Drew, we hear an understated piece of incidental electronica (roughly the same music plays during the end few scenes around the house and hospital, when bobby and ed cant get their stories straight). I feel this music wraps the whole scene with a disarming atmospheric that is sadly missing from the DVD version i have, where the music is conspicuous by its absence - my DVD version , and incidentally on most TV reruns, has just the wind and the noise of the waterfall, which i guess sounds a lot more harsh, perhaps in keeping with the tone of the film. I don't know, i just prefer the music;-) So are there two versions?????? PS I love this film, its defo in my top ten.",Deliverance
320,eal23,A Strange Film that Leaves Questions to Be Asked,8,20 November 2008,"One of the things that makes this movie unique is the ambiguous nature of the plot. A few of the events occur in a way that leaves you unsure of what has really happened. For example, we are never positive on what led to Drew's strange behavior while on the canoe and his subsequent death. One of the men says that he saw the toothless man up on the hill, but none of the other men saw him and no gunshot was heard. When they find Drew's body, there is no clear gunshot wound. Another example is when Ed shoots the man with his bow, assuming that it was the same toothless man they had encountered the day before. When he looks at the man's face he is unsure whether it is the same man, and Bobby also expresses that he is uncertain as to whom Ed had killed.I liked that there were some elements of the film that were left open-ended. The surviving characters never achieve any closure, and still live in fear that someone will find out what truly happened that weekend.",Deliverance
321,grimmjest,The power of 'squeal like a pig.',2,7 September 2011,"Finally sat down and watched Deliverance for the first time after years of using it for fodder for jokes. Even discounting the best known scenes, what a particularly awful movie. With its wooden acting and poor writing, if it didn't have the one scene everyone knows (yeah, you know the one), I think that it would have slipped completely into obscurity. Why sink Drew's body after dragging it down river? Why sink the hunter's body where you not only you lost all your equipment (like the other canoe) but you knowingly dropped your entire wallet? Did they really have to tape a mass of chewed on spam to Burt Reynolds' leg to show that he had broken it? Complete garbage, and I'll never get that hour and a half of my life back.",Deliverance

I think what I saw was edited a lot (TBS). Normally I'd be upset about the editing, but I only had to see Ned Beatty briefly in his underwear...so I guess I win on that one. Amazing acting, the banjo kid and that village were weird and scary in the worst way. This movie was a 9/10...and remember next time you go on a canoe trip, make sure there is a huge padlock on your titanium underwear.",Deliverance
323,ko_to_tamo_peva,bad bad bad,3,6 February 2009,"I'm surprised at the amount of positive reviews for this one. It's an older movie, 1970s; the scenes are not scary at all, you don't see them falling off from huge waterfalls...they don't seem scared, and you're scared for them. You can see it's actors acting...they pretend they're exhausted at the end, rowing to the shore...the whole movie is set in the same environment...some small river, except for the first few minutes of the beginning and end. People give exaggerated credit to older and badly-made movies, and to independent and cheap movies...I don't; what is good is good, and what isn't isn't - this wasn't.Yeah, there's the rape scene in the middle of the movie...nothing special. There's the kid playing the banjo in the beginning, but I didn't care too much for it.It's as if anyone could have made this film himself. The River Wild seemed realer and scarier, not to mention it had better acting...I saw it when I was much younger, could really be as bad, tho, now. It's a movie starring Meryl Streep, and not as old. I don't have a problem with old movies, but I'm not a fan of badly-made 1970s movies.Skip this one.",Deliverance

325,lindzf1982,deliverance,7,9 October 2009,Deliverance is a movie about four business men that embark on a journey down a river through backwoods Appalachia. The men decide to go on a canoing trip before the river and surrounding countryside are buried under a massive lake being formed for the creation of a new power station. The men cross paths with two hillbillies from the backwoods and the canoing trip soon turns from a fun trip to a nightmare of survival. Lewis sees Bobby in the woods being humiliated and sodomized by one of the hillbillies. He takes matters into his own hands and shoots and kills the man with a bow and arrow. The men then face a decision on whether to call the authorities or bury the man in the countryside that will soon be covered in water. After a vote the men decide to bury the man and continue down river to get to their cars that are waiting for them. On their adventure down stream Drew decides not to wear his life jacket and falls into the river at some rough rapids. This causes his boat to collide with the other boat and all four men end up in the water. Lewis breaks his leg and convinces Bobby and Ed that Drew was shot by the hillbilly. This provokes Ed to climb the gorge and kill the other hillbilly. The three men make it to their cars and are questioned by the authorities. The men are not charged and they go their own ways. I think that this movie raises some questions on what exactly happened to Drew. I question if the hillbilly actually shot Drew or if he could not face what had happened on the river. It also makes you wonder why he would not wear his life jacket knowing that there had been rough rapids and they would probably face more.,Deliverance
326,rgettys,Crimes against nature,8,12 October 2006,"What is the underlying theme of this film? I think it is all about ""crimes against nature,"" as well as a ""think-piece"" concerning the dichotomy of man's uneasy coexistence with nature. Destroying a picturesque river setting by flooding it to create a man-made dam; spearing fish with a modified high-power bow/arrow; using the river's naturally-formed rapids for a week-end adventure with little appreciation for the natural surroundings or the people who live there, etc. Let us not fail to add forced homosexual rape by sodomy; killing others with impunity; man's attempted ability to manipulate reality by telling mutually-agreed false stories - vs- nature's ability to reveal only facts. There are so many more such references that can be similarly drawn. I think that is the theme James Dickey was working with. Combine the effective picturesque prose of Dickey's novel with Boorman's vividly beautiful filming of the story and the result is a memorable film; probably more appreciated by history than it was when the film was initially released. I would agree the acting is fine, yet may be the weakest part of the final product. Nonetheless, this is a fine film - one of my favorites.",Deliverance
327,scom37,A Real Film,10,1 April 2011,"Today America's moviegoers would scoff at this brilliant movie: where's the special effect? Why aren't Reese Whitherspoon and Adam Sandler in it? Where's the awesome uplifting message of hope? Settle in and remember the days of movie craftsmanship, when the message wasn't syrupy ""save-the-world"" or ""be-nice-to-each-other"" garbage. The 70s is the philosophical and spiritual edge of American film making, and Deliverance delivers a brutal message of human nature, corruption of human life, and generations of lost Americans drowning in meaningless luxury. Deliverance's power cannot be ignored. Take a look at yourself after watching Deliverance. Are you as civilized and law-abiding as you think?",Deliverance

329,vze44dsg,Think it can't happen? Try again.,8,2 May 2005,"After having my own backwoods nightmare, I was interested in renting this one after a friend made a remote parallel to this movie upon hearing about my experience.Think it can't happen? I trajected off of I-95 in Maryland one night recently to avoid the Susquahanna River toll and to use the opportunity to fill up the car at a place where gas is cheap. In the town of Conowingo, I encountered an aggressive driver and wound up involved in a major incident of road rage. I was stalked and harassed but managed to make it to a convenient store and stop within a reasonable amount of time. The driver got out of his car, was threatening and virulent, and approached me. I called the police on my cell phone. The other person involved was so hostile that I couldn't get out of my car and had to spray pepper spray out of a halfway open window.After a few minutes, the guy pulled his car to another side of the store. Things calmed down, and I went into the store to grab a Coke while I waited for the police. Right as I got finished being rung up, the cashier said to another co-worker ""Here come the calvary"". Apparently, everyone in the store knew what was going on.I'm the one who called the cops, but the entire situation turned on me. Another group of people that weren't even involved told the cops that I was driving like a maniac, came up and pointed me out saying ""This is the crazy guy"". I had no idea who these people were. It appeared that some of the townsfolk collaborated and ganged up on me. As I stood there dressed preppy next to my Toyota Camry looking and feeling like an obvious target, the cops searched my car and even asked if I had been drinking. I was even asked to recite the ""ABCs"" and count backwards from 59 to 36. Given I had several groups of people mentioning that I was driving insanely, the cop had no choice but to react that way. However, these idiot rednecks had a number of fallacies in their story that undermined their credibility including telling the cops I had a gun. So, fortunately, the cops were rationale enough to realize that their story was fabricated upon finding no gun. They let me go, and I consider myself very lucky. Fortunately, it was state police; things might not have gone so well if it were local law enforcement.My experience heightened the realism that this movie successfully projects. This is one you should not pass up, and if you ever go off the trail, beware!",Deliverance
330,hamwriter,"Envy, hatred, secrecy, deliverance.",10,18 January 2006,"This film wasn't shot perfectly, it wasn't edited without flaw, and it's hardly an epic adventure. What Deliverance is, is an incredibly brave unsettling work with intensity that gives the viewer a sense of desperation and powerlessness that has yet to be recaptured on screen due to its subject matter. Deliverance should be applauded for its audacity and the will to not conform to any standard studio template of its time. The action flows with the river. Slow and quiet at times, rapid and violent during others. The river becomes a character unto itself, physically challenging these men to their limit, daring them to survive. And surviving means living with the memory of something these four characters will never forget. Envy, hatred, secrecy, deliverance.",Deliverance
331,pklemon,Fantastic movie!! They don't make great movies like this anymore!,10,7 February 2017,"I just spent a half hour writing about one of the BEST movies ever - I first saw it as a sophomore in high school, and watched it again on t.v. last night.Did they let 16 year old girls into R rated movies back in the early 1970's? Doubtful! My date must have been 18.As my first review, and as I'm not a bit good with computers, all that I typed earlier just went missing. However, I'll add this much and trust that viewers will take a chance with this exceptional movie. It's NOT to be missed! Very intense, very intriguing, and so much better than anything Hollywood churns out today. I can't even imagine that this movie would get an R rating in this day and age. Most likely XXXX or not made at all. What a pity.P.S. The previous review was spot on! I should have left well enough alone, but felt compelled to add a female perspective.

332,brian-1151,Disturbing but excellent forward-thinking film,9,16 October 2016,"A critically-acclaimed drama from 1972 that was ahead of its time, Deliverance shows the tragic results of trying to reason with Donald Trump supporters. Stars Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight as sane people from civilization, who have to make difficult decisions about their own survival; decisions that are much tougher and more dangerous than the ones we will all have to make during the 2016 family holidays. The film doesn't hold back - there are some truly shocking scenes in Deliverance, perhaps more shocking even than watching a 2016 presidential debate or campaign speech. This film is well worth watching, and will provide a welcome escape from the drama engulfing all our lives. Sort of. Well, at least the scenery is different.",Deliverance
