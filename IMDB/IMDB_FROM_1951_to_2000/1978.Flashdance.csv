0,TheLittleSongbird,Not completely feeling it,5,4 July 2017,"Love musicals. Love dramas. Love a lot of films from the 80s, despite being aware of some of my friends who consider it one of the weaker decades for film. While there are certainly far worse musicals, there are also far better. 'Flashdance' is not without its moments but overall left me not completely feeling it.Where 'Flashdance' is most successful is in the soundtrack and dancing. The soundtrack is toe-tappingly infectious and is infused with a lot of energy. This is particularly so with ""What a Feeling"", wonderfully sung by Irene Cara, which won a worthy Oscar and became an iconic hit of the 80s. ""Maniac"" is a close second. The dance sequences are clearly strenuous, while also being high-octane in energy and having surprising grace.That is not to say that it doesn't have other good things elsewhere. Adrian Lynne directs very well, capturing perfectly the post-disco visual mood and general atmosphere of the time. 'Flashdance' looks good too, being cleverly shot and atmospherically lit and designed.However, the acting is really not great. Jennifer Beals seemed too lightweight for a pretty lewd character, and when showing a more aggressive, harder side it comes over as annoying and like she was uncomfortable doing it. She does fare better than Michael Nouri, whose character is obnoxious, bland and clichéd, all of those accentuated in Nouri's acting. If the rest of the cast are not being mentioned, it is because their contributions were not memorable.'Flashdance's' script is a complete mess. Cliché-ridden, cheesy and often tasteless. The story is vastly overshadowed by the film's style, music and dancing, it is barely existent and what there is pretty dull and preposterous, too often the opposite of feel-good or charming while the sordid-ness also feels over the top. Nice message, if not exactly new, but the very frothy and severely underdeveloped romance belongs somewhere else entirely.Overall, has good points but am not completely feeling it. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Flashdance
1,SnoopyStyle,80s cheese with heart,7,26 March 2015,"Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) is a Pittsburgh steel welder by day and exotic dancer by night at Mawby's Bar. She dreams to be a ballet dancer but is too intimidated to apply. Her boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri) falls for her. Her friend short order cook Richie (Kyle T. Heffner) wants to be a comic. Jeanie Szabo (Sunny Johnson) wants to be a competitive ice skater. Alex is hounded by Johnny C. (Lee Ving) to strip naked for his club. Jeanie fails as a skater. After Richie goes off to LA, he returns to find Jeanie going out and stripping for Johnny. She finds that Nick helped her get an audition. Her mentor Hanna Long (Lilia Skala) dies. All of it pushes her to go for her dreams.Lobster has never been sexier. Cynthia Rhodes does a crazy dance and so does Beals' body double. They are all iconic dance scenes. There are some great 80s music. The movie screams 80s cheese but it's even better than that. There are some great scenes. Jeanie's progression is heart breaking. The older dancer (I believe it's Belinda Bauer) does a great speech about dreams fading away. This is not just good 80s cheese. It also has heart.",Flashdance
2,mark.waltz,"It's a weird dream, but it's her dream.",6,24 January 2017,"So this movie, the first film I saw at the Chinese Grauman's upon moving to L.A., has one of the great 80's soundtracks of all time, in addition to a standard Cinderella story of a struggling dancer who wants to get out of her nighttime exotic dancing job into one of the big dance schools in Pittsburgh. She works as a welder to make a living and deals with all sorts of sexual harassment which she handles like a pro. She's certainly able to take care of herself and nobody's going to mess with her unless she wants to be messed with. She's Jennifer Beals, a sort of here today, whatever happened to them tomorrow sort of star who hasn't quite had the A list career she started off with, but then she hasn't quite faded into obscurity either. I found her very likable and wanted to see more of her, but if there's anything in her career that she'll always be remembered for, at least as a cult actress, it will be ""Flashdance"".This has a rough around the edges feel to it with its Pittsburgh street life view, and director Adrian Lyne (""Fatal Attraction"") gets much of the gritty side of that Pennsylvania city quite right. She has the right man (the handsome Michael Nouri) and the right attitude to succeed in finding her dreams, so what a feeling you know she'll have once that dream is achieved. She also has her own real life fairy godmother (Oscar winning Lilia Skala), so there's never any doubt that this will have the standard Hollywood ending. Kyle T. Heffner is amusing as Beals' struggling stand-up comic pal. While a decent actress with presence, Beals does not do her own dancing which gave this film some bad press when it came out with all of the out of work dancers/actresses possibly more qualified for the role. The music is fun, the energy filled with a really retro 80's atmosphere, and in spite of being cheesy when I look back on it nearly 35 years later, I have fond memories of it.",Flashdance
3,jboothmillard,Flashdance,5,11 February 2011,"From director Adrian Lyne (9 ½ Weeks, Fatal Attraction, Jacob's Ladder), this film has probably one of the most recognisable dance routines ever put in a film, I had to see if the rest of the film was any good too. Basically Alexandra 'Alex' Owens (Roger Dodger's Golden Globe nominated Jennifer Beals) is an eighteen year old who works in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania steel mill as a welder by day, but by night she expresses her true passion for dance, exotically doing so in Mawby's bar. Despite no real training, she has taught herself plenty of moves, and dreams of becoming a professional (ballet) dancer, starting with enrolling at Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory. At Mawby's bar, she attracts the interest of her steel mill boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), neither have met each other, and she has friends at the bar who have their dreams of fame as well. Waitress Jeanie Szabo (Sunny Johnson) wants to become a professional ice skater, and her boyfriend Richie Blazik (Kyle T. Heffner) is a cook who wants to be a stand-up comedian, we see them both try their hand at these career choices. Alex did plan to go to the Conservatory to sign up for an audition, but she realised with no training she hasn't got enough qualifications, but her dance teacher and mentor, retired ballet dancer Hanna Long (Lilia Skala) encourages her to go ahead with trying to keep going. We saw Jeanie fall twice at her skating audition, and after losing her confidence she turns to dancing at The Zanzibar, a strip club where she performs nude, but Alex rescues her. Nick and Alex have become lovers, he does reveal he has an ex-wife named Katie (Belinda Bauer), and arguments do settle, and he is able to get Alex an audition with his contacts at the Conservatory. Despite being a little mad with Nick getting an audition for her, and suffering the death of Hanna, Alex soldiers on an turns up for her important audition for the dancing school. She does fall and need to start again, but she confidently performs a great routine to the Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Irene Cara title song ""Flashdance...What A Feeling"" (number 55 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), and the end of the film sees running happily out of the building to hug Nick and freeze frame. Also starring Lee Ving as Johnny C., Ron Karabatsos as Jake Mawby, Malcolm Danare as Cecil, Philip Bruns as Frank Szabo and Micole Mercurio as Rosemary Szabo. Beals makes a pretty and quite admirable character, the film has a good soundtrack, not just with the title song, but the other memorable song, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated ""Maniac"", indeed the final routine scene, recreated by Geri Halliwell for ""It's Raining Men"" among others, is the reason to watch, but overall, not a bad musical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Score for Giorgio Moroder and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Giorgio Moroder, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Screenplay. Worth watching!",Flashdance
4,Woodyanders,"More than a little short on substance, but the dazzling style keeps it humming and Beals is a delight",8,14 July 2020,"Eager 18-year-old lass Alex (a perky and appealing portrayal by Jennifer Beals) works as a welder by day and as an exotic dancer at night, but desperately yearns to achieve her full potential by getting into a prestigious ballet school.Granted, things get really corny and melodramatic at times, but director Adrian Lyne keeps the slight, but still engrossing story zipping along at a snappy pace, the exciting dance set pieces have hot sensual energy to burn (Cynthia Rhodes in particular is an absolute dynamo!), and the central theme about never giving up on your big dream gives this film a winning surplus of charm and heart. Moreover, Beals presents a hugely sympathetic main character who's super easy to care about and root for; she receives sound support from Michael Nouri as handsome and likeable boss Nick Hurley, Lilia Skala as wise old mentor Hanna Long, Sunny Johnson as spunky aspiring skater Jeanie Szabo, Kyle T. Heffner as amiable wannabe stand-up comic Richie, and Lee Ving as sleazy strip club owner Johnny C. Prolific extra Bob Harks has a nice small role as a Catholic priest. Donald Peterman's slickn'n'sparkling cinematography and the punchy editing provide plenty of extra thrilling kick. Further galvanized by Giorgio Moroder's pulsating score and a rousing rock soundtrack (Irene Cara's ""What a Feeling"" seriously smokes in no uncertain terms), this iconic 80's smash hit overall rates as a very sweet and inspiring movie.",Flashdance
5,moonspinner55,"A nice piece of movie-candy, though with some gross, inappropriate humor...",6,26 March 2006,"From the soundtrack music to the break dancing to Jennifer Beals' big poof 'do, everything about ""Flashdance"" looks and feels like old news. Even the steel mill setting is passé (most of the steel mills in Pennsylvania went under due to Japan's steel at cheaper prices). However, at the time of its release, ""Flashdance"" was a piece of movie-candy, with a romance subplot between welder/dancer Beals and boss Michael Nouri that is exceptionally sweet. Lilia Skala has a pleasant supporting bit as a former ballerina and the late Sunny Johnson (who died while this picture was still in theaters) shows echoes of Sharon Tate in ""Valley of the Dolls"": vulnerable, naked, and touchingly doomed playing Beals' ice-skater friend. Unfortunately, there are some really ungainly jokes in the film (re: 'honkies', small penises, Polish jokes, a gross lesbian joke, and a real stinker about cockroaches in hamburgers), but the basic outline of the picture, corny though it may be, still works a little magic. It's hard not to get worked up by the propulsive editing in the final scenes and during Beals' ""Maniac"" number. But looking at it now is just a little bit embarrassing. **1/2 from ****",Flashdance
6,blanche-2,"One look at that collarless t-shirt, and you're back in the '80s",6,14 June 2009,"""Flashdance"" is an iconic 1980s film, memorable for its terrific music, the collarless t-shirt and sweatshirt, and some fabulous dancing. It also launched the career of beautiful Jennifer Beals.The interesting thing about ""Flashdance"" is that there's really not much to it at all. It's a bare-bones story about a Pennsylvania welder (Beals) by day, men's club dancer at night - the dances are sexy and creative performances without nudity, money being thrown at you, etc. The boss of her day job (Michael Nouri) sees her dance and falls for her. She wants to audition for the Philadelphia Dance Repertory Company but she has no real training, she's just naturally gifted. She's encouraged by an elderly friend (Lilla Skala).The reality is it plays like a bunch of music videos. The photography relies heavily on the use of shadows and silhouettes during the dancing, which is quite effective.The acting is so-so; Michael Nouri is fine, but he doesn't have much to do. Cynthia Rhoades, a fabulous dancer who retired after marriage, is pretty and credible as a friend. Beals, who put her career on hold to finish college, is sweet; her acting improved over time. None of the characters are particularly well developed - it's all dialogue in between the music.Nevertheless, ""Flashdance"" is an exuberant film that appeals to the youth in all of us, that ""take your passion and make it happen"" mentality, with all that music making you want to get up and dance. There were three different dance/acrobatic doubles used for Beals. I can remember it was a semi-scandal when the woman who did most of the dancing was revealed; the studio kept it quiet and didn't credit the dancers.A light, fun film that gave the '80s some great music and fun fashion.",Flashdance
7,sunwarrior13,Flashdance Is The Ultimate Guilty Pleasure Classic,7,13 October 2011,"Flashdance probably launched the guilty pleasure classics of the 1980's for which future dance movies such as Footloose and Dirty Dancing followed suit.It was smashed by the critics at the time of its release due to many formulaic movies themes applied to it but it managed to gross more than $100 million at the box office.The movie was the first collaboration between Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer,the producers of Tom Cruise movies,Top Gun and Days Of Thunder.It stars Jennifer Beals as Alex,a Pittsburgh woman with two jobs as a welder and an exotic dancer wants to get into ballet school.The other stars in the film includes Michael Nouri and Lilia Skala.The film was directed by Adrian Lyne. The story involves teen-age Alexandra ""Alex"" Owens works as a welder at a steel mill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during the day, and as a dancer at Mawby's bar in the evenings. She lives alone in a converted warehouse with her pet dog, Grunt. Despite a lack of formal dance training, she aspires to be accepted by a prestigious dance school, the fictional Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory. During one of her performances at Mawby's, she attracts the interest of Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), her boss at the steel mill, and he learns that Alex is one of his employees.Alex goes to the Conservatory to ask for an application form for an audition, but runs out of the building when she realizes that since she lacks formal training and professional experience, she would have to leave much of the form blank. Alex's dance teacher and mentor is a retired ballet dancer named Hanna Long (Lilia Skala), who encourages Alex to pursue her dream of becoming a professional ballet dancer. After Jeanie falls twice while auditioning for an ice show, she loses confidence in herself and becomes a dancer at The Zanzibar, where she performs in the nude, and Alex goes to the strip club to rescue Jeanie. Alex and Nick become lovers, but he has an ex-wife named Katie (Belinda Bauer), and they have a hostile encounter in a local restaurant. Nick uses his contacts at the Conservatory to secure an audition. Just before the audition, Alex goes to Hanna's house and learns that she has died. At the audition, Alex falls at the beginning of her routine, but starts over and completes the routine successfully. In the final scene, Alex runs out of the Conservatory building with a smile on her face and is hugged by Nick, who gives her a bouquet of red roses. She gives a rose to him, and the film ends with a freeze frame. The ending of the film does not say directly whether Alex wins a place at the Conservatory as a result of her audition.The movie is characterized,just like what I've said in the first paragraph by numerous elements of guilty pleasures that a viewers seeks in an entertaining movie such as romance,teen-age memories,formulaic themes,predictability,interesting characters, great choreographed dance scenes, and sequences in the style of music videos.Aside from that,it has many memorable original 80's songs classics such as ""Maniac"" by Michael Sembello;""Lady, Lady, Lady"", by Joe Esposito; ""Gloria"" and ""Imagination"" by Laura Branigan; ""I'll Be Here Where The Heart Is"" by Kim Carnes and the Academy Award-winning ""Flashdance... What a Feeling"" by Irene Cara.Of course,the final dance scene at the audition is also worth the mention.In terms of acting,Jennifer Beals shines in her film debut as Alex.She gives an electrifying performance despite the lack of depth given to her character.Also,she is very engaging as we do care for her character to succeed in her aspirations as a dancer.Overall,Flashdance can be considered as the ultimate guilty pleasure classic.It was made not to please the critics but to please the audience who wants to relax and would prefer not to go into deep thinking but rather seek pure entertainment when watching a movie.With this objective,the movie delivers.",Flashdance
8,Theo Robertson,A Bad Way To Sell Records,4,5 January 2005,"This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea to sell some records . No seriously it was . The thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a LP , sell it and make even more money for the studio . You could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when MTV play a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie . This is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American film making and FLASHDANCE opened the door to this "" Let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie "" type film makingJennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice . Welding is a fairly sophisticated trade , it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes . There's other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and "" flashdancing "" being somehow similar . ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot , dirty flashdancing the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won't get the job . it's kind of like saying that screen writing , novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they're not But I guess none of this mattered to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the movie . Actually Lyne almost makes a very sexy movie , JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent looking . Fortunately I sussed out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly litin long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body . That's because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man ! I bet there's a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that",Flashdance
9,preppy-3,The first MTV movie--not a good thing,4,8 April 2003,"A lady welder (Jennifer Beals) dances at a local bar at night and dreams of becoming a professional dancer. She's also romanced by her boss (Michael Nouri) and coached by a retired dancer. She also has a bunch of fellow dancers at the bar and a cook who tells some of the stupidest, sexist and racist jokes I've ever heard--by the way, we're supposed to LIKE this character and find his appalling humor hysterically funny!A shallow story, bad acting, crappy dialogue, non-stop profanity sink this. But then again, it's not really a movie--it's a bunch of MTV videos slung together with only the faintest gleam of a plot.This was (somehow) a huge hit back in 1983--I didn't like it then and I still don't like it now. I'm giving it a 5 just for the music, the message of the movie (follow your dreams no matter what), the good direction by Adrian Lyne and Beals (she can't act at all, but I like her...and she's a hell of a lot better than Nouri).How did such a stupid, shallow, foul-mouthed movie become such a big hit?",Flashdance
10,evanston_dad,"Work It, Jennifer",5,11 February 2008,"A female welder (yes, you read that correctly) dreams of being a ballerina -- all she needs to do is convince the audition committee for an elite dancing school that she has what it takes. Boy does she ever, showing them that stripper moves and ballet aren't mutually exclusive, all set to the top 40 sounds of Irene Cara.Welcome to the 1980s, folks, and more specifically, to the run of dance movies clearly inspired by the look and feel of MTV, this one starring Jennifer Beals. ""Flashdance"" is ridiculous, but would it be anywhere nearly as fun to watch now if it weren't? Grade: C",Flashdance
11,Wuchakk,"The dance version of ""Rocky""",7,4 June 2015,"Released in 1983, ""Flashdance"" is a drama/music/romance film starring Jennifer Beals as, Alex Owens, an 18 year-old welder in Pittsburgh who dreams of being a professional dancer and longs to be accepted into a prestigious school. She dances at a nightclub in her spare time, which is contrasted by the strip club across the street, owned by a sleazebag who tries to lure the respectable dancers into his seedy lair (Lee Ving). One of her friends aspires to be a figure skater (Sunny Johnson) and another friend a stand-up comedian (Kyle T. Heffner). Meanwhile her tall, dark and handsome boss takes a liking to her (Michael Nouri). This is an entertaining dance flick with the requisite early 80's soundtrack. All the dance sequences were performed by the uncredited French dancer Marine Jahan, who later sued the producers for not crediting her (the brief break-dancing scene was done by a dude). While the wide-eyed Beals and Jahan are in top shape and comely enough, I favor Sunny (the skater).I was impressed by the quality characterizations for a relatively short sports movie. I call it a ""sports movie"" because that's essentially what it is – ""Rocky"" with a female protagonist and dancing instead of boxing. I also like the Pittsburgh locations. Despite my positive feelings, the less-popular ""Heavenly Bodies,"" which came out 9½ months later and stars cutie Cynthia Dale, is superior IMHO. The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. GRADE: B",Flashdance
12,Mr-Fusion,"Come for the dancing, stay for the . . . um . . .",5,26 May 2015,"I'll admit right now that ""Flashdance"" was probably doomed when I saw Jerry Bruckheimer's and Joe Eszterhas' names in the opening credits. But to be fair, the movie's got their fingerprints all over it. Jennifer Beals has the same irrational rage that Elizabeth Berkley had in ""Showgirls"". and it's a tired blue-collar-underdog-fulfilling-her-dreams story, shot like a music video. Not to mention the high-powered pop soundtrack. Peel away that packaging, and there's not a lot there.And oddly enough, there's also not much of a payoff after she nails the audition. It just sorta happens. 5/10",Flashdance
13,JamesHitchcock,Lively Popular Entertainment,6,14 January 2004,"In recent years there have been a number of British films based on the theme of working-class people who find fulfilment through their cultural activities; examples being Educating Rita (the first and most distinguished), Brassed Off, The Full Monty and Billy Elliott.  Such films are frequently described as `quintessentially British' or `something that we can do and Hollywood can't', whereas the truth is that twenty years ago Hollywood was indeed making very similar films, mostly centred upon dancing, such as Saturday Night Fever, Dirty Dancing or Flashdance. Whereas these American films may not have had the covert (or, in the case of Brassed Off, highly overt) political message of their British counterparts, they nevertheless concentrated on differences in social class far more than Hollywood movies usually do.The heroine of Flashdance, Alex, is a young woman who works as a welder and whose main joy in life is dancing. She moonlights as a dancer in a local nightclub, but her great ambition in life is to become a ballet dancer. The film tells the story of how she achieves that ambition, as well as the story of her romance with a wealthy middle-class divorcee, set against frequent dance sequences as Alex and her ice-skating friend Jeanie go through their paces. The climax comes with a scene in which she auditions for a place at a prestigious ballet academy and treats the judging committee to a bravura display of breakdancing. (Would a ballet school really be prepared to offer a place to a candidate whose dance skills owe more to the disco than to Swan Lake and who seems completely ignorant of balletic idiom?)The film has its weak points. Although the plot is not as non-existent as some reviewers have felt, it nevertheless tends to take second place to the showpiece dance numbers; at times, it felt as if I were watching an extended series of pop videos. Potentially interesting themes are ignored; for example, Alex is a practising Catholic, but this seems to be a plot device to enable scenes set in the confessional to be used as soliloquies in which she can air her emotional problems. No attempt is made to explore the possible conflict between the demands of her religion and her sexually provocative dancing or her love for a divorcee.The acting is undistinguished; Jennifer Beals makes an attractive and personable heroine, but it is clear why, despite the success of this film, she did not go on to become a major star. Her acting is too weak to enable her to carry a film; certainly I felt that she would be out of her depth in one that depends more upon plot and less upon song and dance. The other characters are little more than ciphers, with the exception of Hanna, the old lady who acts as Alex's mentor. I could certainly have done without the tasteless ethnic jokes told by Alex's comedian friend.
Yet, despite its faults, I enjoyed this film. Its redeeming feature is the zest and energy of its dance sequences, set to some well-chosen music such as Laura Branigan's Gloria or Irene Cara's title song. It may not be deep or significant, but it is an enjoyable, well-made piece of popular entertainment. 6/10.",Flashdance
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,An 80's iconic movie,5,1 September 2007,"I know how much Flashdance became such a huge hit of the 80's, it defined a whole new generation of clothes, behavior, and dance moves. That's what made Flashdance so special. Now I was born in '85 so I kinda missed out on these things, but I understand it's importance. I just bought this movie yesterday, it was back to back with Footloose, two iconic 80's movies, and I watched Flashdance this afternoon. While this film defined a huge part of the 80's, it was an average film with a simple plot. The acting and story is just pretty average, but it's a cute and fun one.Alex is a welder by day, but at night she is a sexy exotic dancer who grabs the attention of all the men. But she has big time dreams to become a ballet dancer, she has promised her grandmother that she would apply to the top ballet school and try to get an audition. But Alex is always intimidated by the other ""proper looking"" dancers with tons more experience than her. She falls in love with a fellow co-worker, Nick, who wants her to make it just as badly. She goes through rough times, but she just wants to make it and will do anything for that chance.Flashdance is one of those must see movies if you wanna see the important films of the 80's. I just wanted to see what this movie was about since it's such a huge part of film culture. Jennifer Beals actually did a great job as Alex, she was absolutely beautiful and made the character very likable. While this film did not live up to my expectations, it still was a good film. It has an awesome sound track and really is a lot of fun to dance too. Now excuse me, but I wanna try to take my bra off without removing my shirt, lol.5/10",Flashdance
15,DKosty123,What A Feeling,5,11 March 2008,"This is the kind of movie where everything is a prelude to the climatic  sequence with the ""Oh, What A Feeling"". Jennifer Beals is cast as the  main star of only her second film. The rest of the cast is a group of  little known support players. Biels is the star and this remains her  best film.  The climatic sequence is the main draw to this film. The viewer forgets  almost everything else in the film once you see it. I say almost  because the most often published photo graph of Beals pulling that long  shirt over her buff 20 year young body does get a lot of attention & is  memorable to be sure. That photo was used to sell tickets.  This very much early 80's period piece is an OK movie with a great  song. It is not a classic film but if this were your blind date, you'd  enjoy the date but unless forced too, you might fore-go a second one.",Flashdance
16,StrictlyConfidential,Take Your Passion And Make It Happen,6,21 January 2021,"Featuring some really excellent dance sequences (along with some good soundtrack music) - ""Flashdance"" is a fairly entertaining film from 1983.Just don't expect this film's story-line to grab your attention 'cause it's all pretty drab and predictable stuff (for the most part).",Flashdance
17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Royalties... what a feeling.,4,7 May 2020,"Let's not beat about the bush here: 'Flashdance (1983)' is nothing more than a cash-grab, designed specifically to feed off a cycle of royalties. The intention, even as described by those making the movie, is for the film to sell the soundtrack, which then sells the film, and for the soundtrack to be played in public (via, essentially, pre-made music videos), which leads to further free marketing and brings in a hefty royalty cheque. As such, the piece is pretty much as bare-bones as you can get, its thin story stretched over the ninety minute mark simply so it can be classed as a 'feature'. It's about an eighteen-year-old woman who works in a steel mill by day and dances in a non-nude exotic club by night and... well, that's about it, actually. There simply isn't a proper plot. Instead, the flick moves through short-lived subplots that don't amount to a cohesive whole. I mean, the protagonist's ambition is to be a ballet dancer but we only really see her attempt to do this twice. There's no real drive to her oft-promised but never delivered arc, as she seems quite content with the life she lives and doesn't actually come across all that many obstacles. In fact, whenever she reaches a small hurdle, she throws an absolute fit and acts as if she's starring in 'Fatal Attraction (1983)'. This would be fine if the piece were willing to explore her inner demons but it seems as though it actively goes out of its way not to. There's just nothing all that interesting about the picture. It's shot in an utterly inoffensive but generally effective way, it has a few decent dance sequences (with some really bad doubling, I'll add) and it is, when it comes down to it, absolutely watchable. However, it's neither engaging nor entertaining. The best thing about it is its custom-made soundtrack, which has a number of genuinely good songs on it (including 'Flashdance... What A Feeling'). Of course it is, though; that's the only part that received any real attention. 4/10",Flashdance

19,leplatypus,Flashback (web),10,25 August 2013,"I'm really surprised: i always thought that ""Flashdance"" was a cult movie and i see that it's rated at 5,8 on IMDb so close to a stinker!Personally, i watched it last night and even after 30 years, I found it an excellent movie. It's really tied with the 80s and that's its charm: It's about ordinary people, who work hard (for the money), have moral beliefs and have sex in intimacy. So it's the total opposite of nowadays pictures that involves lazy upper classes people, who believes in their own justice and wallows in luxury!So, it was refreshing to see this young woman riding her bicycle, helping her friends, doing a man job for living and pursuing her dreams. I really like the setting in Pittsburgh, as it was not glamor. If you cut all the musical sequences (and there's a lot), you have a very fast movie that goes for the main thing so it's not boring. The dance sequences are enough diverse (classic, street, club) to not be dull as well and they are well directed with good songs: ""what a feeling"", ""Maniac"" and ""she works hard for the money"" are really hits that are still highly audible today! I can't remember any other movies with so much good songs ! Lyne is a good director as he gives excellent frames and deepness and uses new technology (the strobing effect for example).At last, Jennifer was an amazing newcomer: she was really good here and it's a bit a pity that she has such a strange career. She had the right to even refuse the sequel, but with her, it would have been interesting to discover what finally her character has done of her life!For sure, there are some problems: it's a bit unrealistic (her accommodation, the ideal boyfriend driving a Porsche and having a long arm). But there is also a lot of humanity: all her friends failed or died so we really care about her fate!So, i rate the maximum (10) and i hope people will follow me as well!",Flashdance

The hybrid result is the 95 minute eyesore known as Flashdance.Alex(Jennifer Beals) is a welder at a steel mill, complete with hard hat for authenticity, during the daytime and at night she is a dancer of yet undiscovered natural grace and ability. She lives alone with her dog, Grunt; I am not making this up. Oh, and by the way, she has been accepted into a prestigious dance academy, how could I forget. It only gets worse. Here comes the father figure, Nick(Michael Nouri), her boss at the steel plant, happens to see her performing what looks like a semi erotic number on stage at a local club. Nick gets horny for his young employee. He and his ex wife fight over his new youthful trophy girlfriend, Alex. More stupidity follows and my only advice is to avoid this long form video and read a book instead.",Flashdance

Let's face it, folks - If you actually took away Flashdance's ""Giorgio Moroder""-driven soundtrack, as well as the impressive dance sequences where the uncredited Marine Jahan doubled for Jennifer Beals (who couldn't dance her way out of a wet, paper bag) - Then (Yes. Indeed) this dull-edged story about an 18-year-old welder-cum-dancer (Can you believe such a preposterous scenario as that?) would have been a major flop-eroo like no other. Released in 1983 to great fanfare - Flashdance was produced on a relatively modest budget of just $7 million. Yet. In its first year, alone, it actually grossed over $200 million, worldwide, at the box-office.And, speaking about anyone seriously thinking about taking up welding as a means of employment - Believe me - It's definitely one of those super-unhealthy trades where one is up close and inhaling all sorts of noxious fumes and gases, non-stop.

24,iquine,Better Soundtrack Than Movie,3,1 November 2017,"(Flash Review)With a story as thin as a White Castle burger, the story gets totally squashed by the vibrant and avant-guard dance scenes which are over the top 80s in style. The director failed at evoking any emotion from the young protagonist dancer who tries to work her way from, believe it or not, a welder to getting accepted to a prestigious dance school. The failings lie within a story that is choppy, unfocused, poorly paced and edited. That being said, there is a killer break dancing scene and I give it credit for actually focusing on the dancing, more than other 80s dance-focused movies, which are boldly memorable. Lastly, why are there so many scenes of people walking down industrial train tracks in the 80s? There was a random scene of that here too.",Flashdance
25,Fluke_Skywalker,What a feeling,7,15 January 2016,"Astronaut John Glenn once said (about seeing earth from outer space) ""To look out at this kind of creation and not believe in God is to me impossible"". I bring this up because I more or less said the same thing when Jennifer Beals first lifted up her welding mask in 'Flashdance'. Wow. But she's more than a pretty face. The material may only be thimble deep, but Beals brings just the right mix of energy, grit and old fashioned spunk to the part and instantly gets us on her side. That she was only 18 at the time is mind boggling. No, it's not her dancing, and this is painfully obvious on a large HD TV, but she does just fine with the dramatic heavy lifting, such as it is.Born out of the BIG Bang that was MTV, 'Flashdance' became a phenomenon in 1983. Marrying the visual style of the former with an old fashioned underdog tale in the spirit of Rocky, it captured people's imagination and remains a well loved guilty pleasure for many. So much so that it recently inspired a musical in the UK that has since traveled the U.S. as well.It does one no good to hold the film up to any sort of deep scrutiny. Just put on your legwarmers and go with the beat. What a feeling.",Flashdance
26,jimbo-53-186511,Impressive as a technical exercise but it feels more like a series of montages in search of a story,4,12 May 2016,"Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) is a welder by day and exotic dancer by night. However, neither of these things satisfy her so she decides to try and fulfil her true passion by enrolling in a ballet school.Let's get one thing out of the way fairly early on - Flashdance is not a particularly good film. It's a film that opens up with a story, but it's a story that is never really expanded upon - director Adrian Lyne fills much of the running time up with montages that are mostly a cross between music videos and fitness workouts. The film also contains way too many scenes which seem to exist merely to elongate the running time - such as the 'ice skating' scene and the rather random scene where a police officer and a member of the public are directing traffic whilst dancing. From a technical point of view these things are quite impressive, but they have absolutely naff all to do with the story and consequently add very little to the picture.Whilst Jennifer Beals was never going to win any awards for her performance here I actually thought that she did show moments of greatness; her scene with Michael Nouri about halfway through the film where she seemingly cries on cue was a good piece of cinema and Lyne takes full advantage of this moment. Although her performance here is hit and miss across the board, Beals is never less than charming at any given point in the film - she's adorable, charming and easy on the eye and she really does light up the screen whenever she's in front of the camera. Sadly this never really extends to her chemistry with Nouri and their romance is never convincing and this aspect clearly weakens the film slightly.Although the film is filled with lots of excellent technical moments it's the story that really lets the film down as it seems to only be used to start and end the film - there's very little of substance in between. For this reason it's going to something that lovers of cinema or lovers of a good story are going to have a hard job caring about. Having said that it is perhaps passable as a date movie or may even work for those who can't resist a bit of 80's cheese (which this film reeks of BTW).Where the film really stands strong is in its technical areas such as Choreography and Editing (which it receives academy nominations for). Whilst it's mostly good, sadly some of the hard work is undone in the final dance scene where it's pretty obvious that a body-double is used for some of Beals' scenes - check out the moment where she dances right in front of the judges where you can quite clearly see that it isn't Beals doing the dancing!!! Despite some of the negatives it is a passable film, but with a story that's practically non-existent throughout its running time it's a pretty unmemorable film even though it is mildly entertaining at times.",Flashdance
27,dwpollar,"Fair simple, rocky-type story...",3,31 August 2010,"1st watched 8/27/2010 -- 3 out of 10 (Dir-Adrian Lyne): Fair simple, rocky-type story about a young woman from Pittsburgh who is a steel worker by day, a dancer by night, and wants to get into a local dance school following the example of her grandmother. Jennifer Beals plays the busy and feisty 18 year old with the dream in this Adrian Lyne directed video-like story. The movie is full of music and video snippets without a whole lot of dialogue and this fills up the movie instead of a story. You never really get a chance to understand the characters because of this choice by the director. You understand what the characters want, but you never really get a fully-developed ""why"" for any of the characters. There are some other minor characters that carry dreams as well -- like a cook who wants to be a comedienne at the local bar where the Beals' character dances. So the real purpose of the story is to show you not to stop reaching for your dreams, but the shallowness of the characters do not help you care. Beals is sexy and enticing at times but is never really given much of an opportunity to act, and when she's given it she doesn't do it that well. The boyfriend, played by Michael Nouri, is just an older middle-aged guy honkering for a younger chic and the Beals' character fits the bill for him. So, overall, you have a very shallow movie about reaching your dreams and never giving up that just doesn't quite cut it despite some good music and OK dancing.",Flashdance

Self-taught she dreams of entering a ballet school, something seemingly impossible given lack of any recognised dance schooling. In true fairy tale fashion we glide through specious drama involving an elder ballerina, a piteous stand-up comedian slash cook, a waitress turned stripper and the inevitably beguiling rags-to-riches princess meets her prince.Whishing through a tirade of dance sequences (including two ice-skating routine) about 30% of the movie consists of musical numbers, whilst the remaining runtime is rudimentary adhesive pretending to tell a story, with the dramatic excuse burdening the lead actress Beals, who has endless enamour and childishly vampiric sex appeal. The dances themselves are undeniably the highlight, most dimly-lit and featuring fast-editing montage, aimed predominantly at hiding the fact, that all sequences were performed by doubles. Inadvertently this gives ""Flashdance"" a surprising allurement, which came to be deeply influential to future cinema and video-clips, making the movie carry much more weight in filmmaking history then the banality of its story would even deem possible.",Flashdance

31,PredragReviews,Amazing Soundtrack of 80's,7,4 May 2016,"What makes a good film for me is that it is enjoyable, entertaining, gripping, likable and emotional. Flashdance without a doubt ticks all these five boxes. Flahdance is a very retro, cheesy entertaining film that is at no point boring and never drags, and is also a very clear symbol of the great 1980's and the night club exotic dancing scene of the time. Jennifer Beals puts down an amazing performance, as a dancer and as an actress. I guess the story comes down to the fact that reality bites, that life is tough, but if you push hard you just might make it.All in all, Flashdance despite its few undeniable faults is a very decent and enjoyable film in my opinion. As it mostly meets all of my requirements I am happy to give it a positive review. This film is one of the quintessential 80's films, that works well as a symbolic artifact of its time.

Every time it seems I re-watch this movie it gets worse and worse as I recognize how trite and pathetic the cardboard story and dialog is. It doesn't hold up as a good movie in today's cinema. There's a bare bones plot about following one's dreams, but essentially the movie is about 45min of story and 45min of MTV-style cuts. Jennifer Beals is energetic and certainly in outstanding shape for her quasi-interesting dance machines, but her acting and more to the point the movie's script is dirt poor and woefully dated. The final number featuring the theme song showed a stand-in and stunt double plopped in for almost half the number. Can't recommend - but maybe - for nostalgia's sake.

As I saw in the critical reviews at the time, the dancing and music were good while the plot was stupid. They were certainly right about the last part. The characters and storyline were hardly believable, especially all the inexplicable temper tantrums from Beals.Unfortunately the music and dancing weren't very good either, and the movie actually was pretty boring.

37,maria2023,Provided Inspiration Among Americans During Difficult Times,7,9 September 2019,"Jennifer Beals stars in this guilty pleasure dance classic released in the 80's entitled ""Flashdance"".Michael Nouri and the late Sunny Johnson co-stars. This was an early partnership of partners Jerry Buckheimer and Don Simpson.It was an early film as well directed by Adrian Lyne.The beauteous Jennifer Beals in her film debut portrays Alex,a Pittsburgh woman who works two jobs as a welder by day at a steel mill and an exotic dancer at night at Mawry's. Then,he meets the owner of the steel bar in Nick Hurley and develops a romance with him.In it,we get to see Alex tries to get into the Conservatory to become a dancer. Will she make it despite her lack of formal dance training? Your guess is as good as mine.This was obviously a memorable film that earned a lot of money in the box office.It also has great themes such as striving for one's dream no matter how difficult and to never give up despite the odds as well as obstacles achieving them. It was release in a decade when Americans were experiencing lots of economic difficulties. Despite being a cliched and predictable movie,many did enjoy it back when it was released as it gave many hope during difficult times.As for the performances,Jennifer Beals did a fantastic job despite having to portray a thin character.She was obviously beauteous and charming. While it was evident that she never did any of the dancing in the movie - those were done by doubles such as Marine Jahan and Crazy Legs, the viewer will definitely enjoy the movie and would probably cheer for her character to succeed.",Flashdance
38,patriciogl10,A great '80s film.,7,4 December 2019,"Flashdance is a good film, carried almost entirely by Jennifer Beals acting performance and dancing performance. Despite these acts being the central appeal of the film, there is also a nice story set to serve as context that encourages the pursuit of dreams, in spite of reality constantly knocking on the door. It was a daring move to showcase a female steel worker moonlighting as an exotic dancer, it was courageous to show a female lead working two jobs on her own, with no male support whatsover, she's her own woman. Adrian Lyne has always portrayed smart,
determined and brave women in his films, Jennifer Beals' Alex Owens being one of his firsts.Primarily known for its dance audition scene, along with some exotic dance scenes famously displayed in Irene Cara's What a Feeling music video, although this film is much more than just dancing, it's about the passion of it, giving all that it takes to make it professionally, to have a unique opportunity and seize it, about standing up on your own two feet and chasing your dreams.It highly evokes nostalgia, because it screams 80s, that's why is so enjoyable, apart from the dancing. So revisit, re-live it, or watch it if you haven't, I wouldn't call this a classic but it's a well-known '80s movie that deserves to be seen.",Flashdance
39,bbhlthph,Flashdance clearly provides what many viewers want,7,3 November 2003,"There are already many comments on this film in the IMDb database, and I had no intention of writing another until to my surprise I noticed that it was frequently being replayed on several different local TV channels. Flashdance is a very outdated movie that has never appealed to most film critics, so I felt this was sufficiently unusual to justify an attempted explanation.	Since the DVD of Flashdance was released, it has appeared for hire in many small local convenience stores and service stations that only maintain a very small rack of films for hire Clearly although it is now very much of a period movie, it continues to retain an enormous appeal for many of those who have seen it before. Personally I have watched our tape of Flashdance more often than most of the other tapes we have at home. This is not because it would be my first choice, but because it is a film that my wife loves to watch again and again; whilst I find I can view it repeatedly more readily than many of her other favorite tapes, so when we are discussing what to view and have rejected a number of other possibilities we tend to turn back to Flashdance. This reinforces the comments already made in your database about Flashdance being a ""feel good"" movie for which most people seem able to ignore the faults and just enjoy the music, the dancing and the romance. (It also features ""Grunt"", a very appealing dog, who remains one of the reasons why my wife is always ready to rewatch this film.) As a film Flashdance is therefore something of a paradox. Originally the final product was not very highly regarded by the studio and only received a limited release. This was severely panned by most of the critics, and  not surprisingly the film initially received very little support from the public. The reviews and the low attendance led to plans to withdraw it from circulation early, but before these were implemented the audiences started to grow and continued to increase until cinemas showing the film were mostly packed out. Clearly those few who saw the film at an early showing started telling their friends to ignore the critics and see it. This escalated exponentially until the film finished up as a major hit. In commenting on this film it would be equally invalid to ignore the very real concerns of the critics or the equally real appeal it had, and still seems to have, for most of the public.	The story is trite - a female welder in a steelworks dreams of being a ballet dancer and practices her dancing in one of the local bars at night. Here she meets and starts to fall in love with her fairly young divorced boss. With his support she is able obtain an audition with a major dance company who are essentially only interested in her dance training, and lose any interest they may have had when she says she has never attended a dance school. However she proceeds to audition for the very bored selection committee and gives an electrifying free dance performance that in true fairy story tradition brings the committee to its feet. Some critics have complained that doubles replaced the star Jennifer Beals for this sequence, but this is surely not important - the real question is how effectively the film plays, and this sequence has rightly been very widely admired. About the time the film was released, modern dance companies were being formed alongside traditional ballet companies in many major cities in North America and this sequence certainly added to the appeal of the film at the time, but it is decidedly not the only reason for watching it.		I could spend pages criticizing the screenplay in several different respects, but other comments in your database have already done this, and these criticisms are ultimately not damming. The important thing is that the film maintains an ongoing flow which sweeps most viewers along and earns it a place as one of the finer musical comedies to have been released in the past quarter century. The object of a film is to entertain the public and in ranking Flashdance I feel I must base my rating on its undeniable success in doing just this. So 7 out of 10.",Flashdance
40,Sober-Friend,A Culture Phenomenon,8,1 April 2018,Watching this film screams 1980's. However this film to me is just as entertaining now as when it was first released in 1983. Alex is a welder by day and dancer by night. Her dream is to be able to enter a dance academy but she is afraid of not only getting in but even applying freaks her out. Alex at times is very mature for her age but at times she acts very immature.

However, after that, the lack of story began to take its toll and I found the film dragged. I also felt the story was quite confused, with characters and sub plots popping up without rhyme or reason and being left with loose ends.I didn't like Jennifer Beals's acting and I found the portrayal of her character too aggressive. You can imagine her becoming a diva if she ever hit the big time. She wasn't given much back story so I never felt I know who she was, why she was working as a welder or why she wanted to get where she was going.The last 5 minutes, with the dance audition, became horrendously cheesy and quite out of tone with this otherwise mature film.",Flashdance
42,imbluzclooby,Style over substance. So 80's.,5,11 October 2021,"Before I dump on this this dated 80's pop yarn, I must admit that it was a huge hit back in 1983. If you haven't seen this yet, just know that this is an indicative example of how a lame and weak drama can have effective allure to the public. At least for the early 1980's which it is so reflective of. Flashdance fits this bill to a T.To begin, this trite story is about a very young gal who has aspirations of becoming a professional ballet dancer. She is self taught and lives around the Rust belt in Pittsburgh, PA. To make ends meet, she works as a welder by day and moonlights as an exotic dancer in a local night club. Jennifer Beal, in her movie debut, takes on this role, but she is rather genteel and fragile looking to come off as a tough girl who does rugged work. She is shown to have bouts of tantrums, risque behavior and street wisdom. She seems unsuited for this type of character requirement since she is much too young and soft looking. She even looks uncomfortable playing the scenes where she shows aggression. I just learned that she didn't do much dancing at all since the dancing scenes are performed by Body doubles. After close review I can see it now. The scenes where she is practicing to ""She's a maniac"" only shows her face and her feet in close-ups. The rest of the routine is clearly another person doing all the strenuous movements and stretches. It is clear that the body-double is more muscular and athletic looking than Jennifer Beals, but the dim lighting and edits are done so well that I didn't even notice initially. And this goes for the rest of the dance scenes, which are the highlight of the movie.Flashdance is a confluence of MTV meets Film drama. It succeeds as the former, but fails as the latter. The ulterior motive was to sell a soundtrack. The plot is very weak and not very involving. The supporting characters are cliche. Beals' character is just not fleshed out enough for us to really care about her personally much. Of course, at the end it's exciting, because we are all waiting for that moment for her to knock her audition out of the park with her exciting dance routine. And that's what we are anticipating. Her love interest, Michael Nouri, is bland and doesn't reveal much about why he decides to go for her, other than he's thrilled at watching her dance. But the love story angle, her work angle and the little drama at the bar are just not believable and somewhat muffled in their delivery. They just don't add any appeal to this movie. Did I also mention that being a welder is a dangerous job that requires skill and intensive training. It is virtually impossible that an 18 year old girl can just walk in and learn this so quickly. And the percentage of women in that profession must be under 1%.Flashdance fits in the same genre with movies like ""Fame"". This whole craze about young people working on their passions and fulfilling their dreams of becoming singers, actors, musicians and dancers is what inspires this. The film throws in these little subplots of how people are aspiring to be performers. Her friends at the nightclub: a cook/comedian, ice-skater, etc. And how these people are struggling. But the main character is determined and good enough to succeed. The drama, characters and the overall progression is not involving enough and is actually boring until we get to our finale of her acing her audition and running outside to leap into her boyfriend's arms with that signature 1980's freeze frame. It's all so cheesey, but it's as satisfying as an ending as we could get.To its credit, the dance scenes are pretty good and exhilarating enough to hold our attention. I could also credit Flashdance for being innovative in that it attempts to achieve the Cinderella story with a touch of Rocky. But it really is just a 1980's chick flick.",Flashdance

Jennifer Beals, who I considered world's hottest woman, between 1984 and 1989, stars as Alex, a welder by day and an interpretive dancer in a club by night. Alex has an unstated dream of becoming a ballet dancer. She meets her welding supervisor Nick after he catches her act in the club. He likes her, and they date. She expresses her secret dream of doing ballet to him. He gets her an audition for her dream of joining a ballet company.She finds out in the middle of the Fort Pitt tunnel in Pittsburgh that Nick got her the audition and goes into a rage at him, stopping all traffic under Mount Washington (""Stop the Car Nick!""). She refuses to go to the audition and goes into a big depression. Prior to the audition day, after she has not shown up for work in a week, Nick talks to her and tells her she is using him as a scapegoat for her real problem, which is her fear of performing poorly in front of all those well trained dance/ballet people. He then makes the true statement, when your dreams dies you die. Effectively he was telling Alex, you got to go and give it your all or you'll die inside. She then deals with a death of a relative, and has time to think about things. Realizing that Nick had a belief in her that went beyond their relationship and Nick was also risking his reputation by telling the ballet company to take a look at her, and Nick has no say in which dancer is selected during these auditions, she shows up compete with the better trained dancers for the spot. She puts on the Irene Cara song, ""What A Feeling"" and dances showing her tremendous love for dancing. It has no resemblance to ballet, but the people judging can feel her incredible exuberance for dancing as she brings them alive and the movie audience can also feel this. You want to cheer when she runs gleefully out of the audition and jumps for joy to tell Nick she blew away her better trained competition and made it into the ballet company.",Flashdance
46,Jakemcclake,A Good Message About Following Your Dream,9,18 March 2019,"This musical movie shows several unsuccessful people who had dreams that they eventually gave up on. We see a cook, who wishes to become a comedian and follows his dream to Los Angeles only who have his dream crushed. We also see a skater who follows her dream to skate in a big show, but falls several times causing her to give up on her dream.We also see Hanna a former ballerina who never became the star, and is mentoring a young lady named Alex. Alex is played by Jennifer Beals, and is a welder working for Nick (Michael Nouri). Alex also works as a FlashDancer in a bar at night, expressing herself in various costume dances,to music in front of a large appreciative audience.As Nick gets involved with Alex we find out her dream is to become a ballerina, but she has no ballerina training and is fearful of the judgment and possible rejection in auditing for a ballerina company. She also saw dreams of her friends being crushed by reality, and feels it will happen to her. There is a quite a internal struggle within Alex regarding the audition for the Ballerina company.The power of Music is a key element in the movie. Alex's father once told her, ""if you close your eyes you can see the music"". This statement is key in the outcome in the movie. This meaning music can make you see, feel and sometimes do powerful things. There is an important scene done to the song ""What A Feeling"" a powerful uplifiting song.",Flashdance

Well,to cut the story short,she became a star in his movie after it surprisingly grossed more than a $100 million at the box office during its release but she decided to pursue her studies at Yale University and never never made another box office hit comparable to this film that she dwindled into the being part of the supporting cast. In an interview,she stated that she is happy not meriting too much attention considering that she does not have the fortitude to it.Going back to her film debut for which she is primarily identified with,it tells the story of a young teen-ager who aspire for a dance career particularly in a conservatory.Although we know what is going to be the conclusion of the plot,it was evident that the movie tries to provide a wonderful journey as Alex pursues that dream. The elements in her journey includes the friends who also pursues dreams of their own. Added to it,there is a romantic story involved between her and her boss on the steel mill. Finally,there are great songs involved from Irene Cara's Oscar-winning song ""What a feeling(Flashdance)?"" and a lot more.Overall,it was a cultural phenomenon during its decade of release in the 80's.

49,marbleann,Fluffdance,5,19 May 2005,"Oh boy I just saw this movie on TV after of few years. It is still entertaining but cornball. I remember when it first came out, it was a major hit. And Jennifer Beals was still passing for white. I am glad to see she is not doing that anymore. With movies such as All Saints and shows like the L Word. People actually aspired to be strippers after seeing this movie. Since all it was is a cleaned up stripper movie, not a dance movie. I still think that Flashdance phenomena is still going on to this day. Ever since that movie came out every stripper is a stripper because they use the Flashdance excuse, they are aspiring dancers who are paying for college..school. It is hilarious. The movie is kind of creepy now that I am older but at the time I thought nothing of this 35 year boss chasing after his 19 year old employee. Talk about a lawsuit waiting to happen. Also no way in Pittsburgh will there be a 19 year old arc welder. That is a very good job which takes years to master, a big union job. She surely could afford to go to any school she wanted if she was making welding money. And that bike would of been gone a long time ago with the bad weather Pittsburgh has in the winter. I liked that she did have friends too many of these movies the women seem to have no friends. But just boyfriends and perhaps a family member. And they all got along. I liked that. It was very sad that the actress who played Jeannie, Sunny Johnson, died the next year. She was very popular at the time and I remember being shocked. Jennifer Beals is very engaging in the movie, Micheal Nouri is creepy and entirely too old for her. It was a joke at time when people use to do Jennifer Beals imitations with her running in place to the music Maniac because it was the only scene in the movie you actually saw her face while she moving. What was distracting about the movie was the dance doubles, they did not even have the same body type and in the last scene, the one that is suppose to be the showstopper, that took away from the movie. They actually used a man named crazy legs to do the break dancing spin And you can see it! I was happy to see Cynthia Rhodes who is a real dancer..why didn't they use her for the lead since she could really dance? Since she married Richard Marx she hasn't been seen. I almost forgot about her. She was all over the place in during the 80's. I am happy to see Jennifer Beals career doing well. She really has picked good edgy roles. All in All the movie is very entertaining. Not The Red Shoes , but good for what it is...fluffy, not to be taken seriously. But Nouri is too old for that girl.",Flashdance
50,mhubbard-54657,Guilty pleasure,7,18 November 2018,"Here is a film that makes riding a bike around Pittsburgh in the rain look very sexy.
Alex is a very earnest young woman. Although she is only 18, there are no parents in evidence and she seems mostly alone in the world, except for her ballet mentor, an elderly woman, and some friends who have similar dreams of escaping their blue collar world. She does a man's job all day for the good pay, operating heavy equipment. Apparently she is the only female on the premises, but mysteriously there is no harassment.To satisfy her creative urges, she does exotic dancing in the evening at the local bar. Her true passion in life is the ballet, but she has never taken a single lesson. She has apparently practiced extensively on her own, a barre being set up in the warehouse where she lives with a pit bull. She longs to join the local dance company, but is terrified of rejection. One day she walks into the building to make her application, but she is intimidated by the other women, and leaves without applying.Against her better judgment she begins a relationship with her boss, a high powered man in the community who can pull strings for her, but she does not want any strings pulled. She wants to get into the ballet company on her own merit.After her dance mentor suddenly dies, she has an epiphany. She takes the plunge, applies to the conservatory, auditions for a part and amazes the committee with gravity defying moves and even some break dancing.Totally implausible, but a pretty film to watch, with good music and dancing.Her friends do not fare as well. Jeanie, the skater, falls twice during her competition and crumbles on the ice. The actress unfortunately died a year later of a brain aneurysm.Fun film bringing back memories of the 80's.",Flashdance

However, the movie has some heart-grabbing moments, the score is wonderful, the girls are pretty, and the moral of the story (keep on trying until you win) is as true as it ever was.

Alex is an admirable character. She is strong-minded, strong willed, confident, and takes no BS from anyone.Though Flashdance was very boring, it was however, quite inspiring. Throughout the slow paced, dull film, there was a very well received underlying message; try for your dreams or you never know if they will come true. Without our dreams we die.This movie took place in the 80's and we knew it. Everything was very 80's. The hair, the clothes, and the music were very true to the 80's. Normally I love dancing movies but the dancing style of the 80's just wasn't my taste so I didn't enjoy the performances, though I did enjoy and much appreciate the inspirational message.This is a feel good movie to see when you are feeling hopeless and in need of some encouragement and inspiration.",Flashdance

58,breckstewart,The Music and the Dancing is What Matters,6,10 April 2019,"I was a teenager when I saw this movie and since I didn't go to a movie house very often in those days (even less now), of course the movie had an impact on me. But what I remember mostly from my perception back then was how great the music was and how the dancing was out of this world.This said, I hadn't seen it since then and I wanted to watch it again with an adult perspective to review things properly. It might be unfair to judge Flashdance with our modern eyes since as an audience we are so much more sophisticated being deluged with special effects and amazing technical achievements in movies then we all were in the 1980's.But even as a 15 year old and not knowing much of anything about editing or technical aspects of movie making, I remember that I instantly noticed that the dancing was not done by the same person. This is no big secret now and is even mentioned in the trivia here but Marine Jahan was the one who danced in most of the sequences that were supposed to be done by Jennifer Beals. I recall being startled at just how carelessly they had filmed Marine in medium shot with her face clearly visible in many segments inter cut with a few shots of Beals in close ups to maintain the illusion.I also remember an award show in those days where they finally exposed the truth that Marine Jahan was the dancing double and she even performed a dance routine that blew me away. I can just imagine how frustrating it must have been for her not even being credited here or anywhere else for her work. Her dancing is amazing and I don't know why they couldn't use someone who could act the scenes as well as dance but I guess we're talking about a different era.Today of course, they would find an actress who can dance or a dancer who can act and they do exist. This brings me back to the ultimate frustration I felt with this movie. Cynthia Rhodes has a small part as Tina Tech one of the dancers and I will never figure out why they didn't give her the lead part of Alex Owens. Not only was Rhodes gorgeous and an amazing dancer (her one big dancing scene is the highlight of the movie to me...) but she could also act. She deserved that part but I guess Beals had something that the producers preferred.I have to say that I was disappointed in Jennifer's performance. For some reason, I didn't connect with her portrayal and even though she is the lead, the fact that I keep seeing someone else's face every time Alex dances pulls me out of the story which by the way, isn't much at all. Nothing really happens and except for the dance scenes which are spectacular, nothing else attracted my attention.Which brings me to my final point. This is I think one of the very first movies that was truly made successful by the soundtrack. The music is of course the main star of this movie and on that front, they struck gold. Even today, those songs are so powerful that they uplift the so-so movie into the stratosphere.So a 6 star rating felt fair because even though this is by means a great movie and should mostly be viewed as a collection of music videos, the dancing and the music makes it an enjoyable depiction of an era gone by and I for one can respect the fact that this became such a monster hit that it defined a whole generation.",Flashdance

60,connorbbalboa,"Style over substance, galore!",2,26 September 2017,"Style-over-substance films usually annoy me. When those movie are as bad as Flashdance, I just want to ask the people who made them what they were thinking. Actually, this was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who are well known for making films of cinematic gloss, but nothing with real humanity. The story is so simple, the whole thing is probably 50 minutes too long. This is basically Rocky if the story has dance scenes for filler, the numerous subplots went nowhere, and the characters weren't appealing.For a story, Jennifer Beals plays a young girl named Alex who wants to be a professional dancer, and not just to dance at a small nightclub. By day, she works as a welder at a steel mill; shocking since she is only 18. The steel mill boss's son falls in love with her and later tries to help her get into the professional dance group that she yearns to be a part of, if only she had more confidence.Everything that I highlighted in just three sentences is everything there is to know about the main story. Everything else is just music video-inspired dancing scenes (which, unfortunately, are mostly performed by Beals's body double instead of Beals herself) set to popular 80s songs, and subplots that go nowhere or are resolved in five minutes. For one thing, Alex sees the boss's son with his previous wife, she gets mad and throws a rock at his window, but the next day, he explains why his ex-wife was with him in the first place. Later, her friend joins a sleazy strip club, and Alex forces her to leave after three minutes. There is even an old woman who is Alex's friend, and conveniently, was also a famous dancer. Not enough time is spent on the relationship they have and the film never establishes how they met.The acting is average at best, with Beals giving the warmest performance of the whole cast, and most of the characters act like old stereotypes, such as the pathetic friend who makes useless jokes (which leads to another sub-plot that goes nowhere) and the aggressive jocks who have eyes for the main heroine. Alex herself is also the victim of the horrible screenplay. Close to the beginning of the film, she actually does come close to signing up for an audition for the dance group, but she backs out because she is afraid. Not a good enough reason? Well, the film still has an hour and fifteen minutes left, and if she did get her confidence at that moment, it would be nothing more than a short film.I have very little to say about Flashdance because the film offers so little. I guess the dance scenes are well shot, and Beals performance makes things a little more tolerable, but everything else is quite awful. Even some of the 80s songs are poor. This is easily one of the most uninteresting pieces of nothing ever made.",Flashdance
61,showtrmp,Irresistible Trash,8,25 March 2012,"I saw this movie as a child and knew it was terrible then, yet I couldn't take my eyes off it for a second. This is the rare movie that is so bad it is unforgettable; elements from it instantly entered the pop mythology of the 1980s. An entire generation (whether they saw the movie or not) became familiar with the welder-by-day/dancer-by-night conceit, the creative-bra-removal scene, the ""Maniac"" running-in-place dance workout, and (of course) the interpretive dance involving gallons of water. Film critics may not have been enchanted, but you don't get such scenes in every movie.Every so often, a low-budget ""sleeper"" movie comes out and becomes a runaway hit; generally, such movies are blue-collar musicals. They are about the ways in which struggling lower-class people use song and dance to break away from their squalid lives. (Examples--""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Grease"", ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Full Monty"", ""Billy Elliot""). This movie could be a parody of that genre, but it is played (and was taken) straight. A dewy-eyed female welder, Alex (whose hair, makeup, and wardrobe are always impeccable) finds artistic release at night through her performances in the oddest nightclub in movie history; the dancers thrash around and gyrate under strobe lights while never removing so much as a sock--yet the place stays in business despite competition from a ""real"" strip club up the street (whose sleazy promoter keeps trying to poach away Alex and her friends). Yet Alex isn't fulfilled by this--she longs to study classical ballet and be taken ""seriously"". To that end, she keeps almost-applying to a local dance academy, urged on by an elderly former ballerina (Lilia Skala)--this unlikely friendship is actually one of the most likable and believable elements in the movie. It's less a movie than an extended rock video--everything is soaked in 1980s ""atmosphere"" and scored to Giorgio Moroder hits. Strange, I know, but not all movie love is explicable.",Flashdance
62,ad2020,A representative of the 80's to be sure.,7,23 November 2000,"But it's the good 80's, and I'd like to point out that this is more of an artistic movie than anything else, especially with the lighting and the main character's quirks(even though it doesn't seem like that was the producer's intention!) Also the story of how this was cast makes me wonder (I would've voted for Demi Moore, but oh well)if the producers knew how this movie would've fared. It's started the 80's new wave look I'm told, and it actually enpowered women in it's own shallow way, so we can safely say it was a breakthrough, kinda like The Matrix restarted the whole industrial-cyberpunk goth trend. Still, why does she want to be a ballerina? It's doesn't make sense, she'd be better off in a chorus line where the people are likeable as she was!!! As a dancer back in the 80's (and yes, it was hard to admit to being a male dancer back then!!) this movie was cool to watch and the soundtrack was pretty awesome!!

63,passenger70,Freeze Frame,6,10 August 2019,"You might think that this iconic movie is a spiritual successor to dance themed classics like Saturday Night Fever or Fame. In reality this shallow epic works best as pseudo-sequel to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner - another film featuring animated mannequins posing in clouds of smoke, sparks and steam. Producers Simpson and Bruckheimer perfected this kind of style as substance filmmaking in the early 80's where every shot is a magazine ad and every scene an MTV video. Don't be fooled by the perfunctory romance or vague tale of ambition, this film exists to sell the soundtrack and not the other way around.

64,b_havag,"Great music, poor movie",6,28 December 2008,"""Flashdance"" from 1983 is a poor movie. To me it seems just like a bunch of music videos played after each other, and the already plain story obviously suffers from this. Jennifer Beals stars as Alex Owens, a working-class girl working as a welder during the day and as a dancer each night. Her dream is to obtain a place in a prestigious dance school. One night her boss at the steel mill, Nick, (Michael Nouri) sees her dancing in the club, and he immediately becomes attracted to her. You can probably guess the rest of the movie yourself, thats how predictable and ""seen-before"" it is.I can see why the feature is loved by someone though; I found Beals charming as Alex and Nouri quite alright as Nick and I loved the soundtrack, which is amazing and got a well earned Oscar. It doesn't hurt with beautiful and sexy leads, 80's spirit, music and dancing either. A typical teen-movie.One star for Jennifer Beals, one for the eighties and Flashdance's teen-appeal and two stars for one of the best movie soundtracks ever. 5/10",Flashdance
65,joltjohn,a good date night movie (you can make out between the songs),6,13 December 2002,"I just watched ""Flashdance"" for the first time and it is a film so lame, inconsequential and annoyingly dumb that it actually made the comparably silly ""Footloose"" look like ""Singing in the Rain"" by comparison. Actually, I'm being too hard on ""Footloose,"" since it actually had a plot, some interesting characters, and a point-of-view (to say nothing of a POINT), as opposed to the pointless and silly ""Flashdance."" which was like ""Rocky"" with a dance motif and female star.I hope you don't take my ""critique"" the wrong way... Honestly, I don't think the movie is really all that good, but the message, and the feeling, and the spirit of this movie, are all very wonderful and infectious indeed and should NOT be discounted. It makes it a wonderful movie.  It is a story of energy, of feeling and of life The story seems utterly predictable and rather contrived, and the characters are weak. The music (which I *do* remember well from that time) is still excellent, and some of the dance routines are inventive. Others were pretty bad. like the  closing dance routine which is as bad  a dance scene as you'll ever see in any movie. The final dance scene In ""Footloose"" was much better. also  did you know a man was actually doing that twirly move and that Jennifer Beals didn't dance at all, actually they used about four stunt doubles).  For a dance movie, Flashdance doesn't show that much dancing. Even the gorgeous Jennifer Beals (and her dance doubles doing all those dance numbers.( I wonder if she has that huge curly perm -although fashionable at 1983 - only to shadow the face of her double. ) couldn't hold my interest. As short as Flashdance was, I was looking at my watch about halfway through.The best parts of this movie are the  ""music videos"" and the soundtrack in the film is fantastic, it makes you the feel, the passion come alive as it drives the story and gives it a soul. It is that fantastic soundtrack that makes that, and the whole film for that matter, simply come alive. Beals is one of the few reasons to watch this movie. She is not bad at all as an actress! And she is sexy, cute and pretty. She has a very attractive smile and shows sometimes a very sexy body language. The worst parts are the dance performances which destroys the whole movie. Also the dialogs wasn't really good or interesting.  Unfortunately, there are some really ungainly jokes in the film(re: 'honkies', small penises, Polish jokes, a gross lesbian joke, and a real stinker about cockroaches in hamburgers--this is funny??), but the basic outline of the picture, corny though it may be, still works a little magic.SPOILERS, BEWARE!!! Some things I really don't like about this movie: It seems that she is the only female working at the mill.  Also if  a female co-worker started dating the male boss a lot of people would think she was doing it to get ahead and not cheer them on like in the movie.  Why would any reasonable ""male"" go to a club just to see women dance in skimpy clothes.  I can see that going to any regular nite-club.When she first dances to the song ""maniac"" and they cut to shot of her dog it looks like he is getting ""excited"" watching her.   That  scene with the traffic cop, what what that all about?  Some things do confuse me about it (e.g. Jeanie asks Alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing; Alex replies ""About 25 years,"" isn't Alex supposed to be 18?)  Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work? When she doesn't go to work for nearly a week, wouldn't she be laid off? Living in a warehouse-I can almost see it, but not quite. It doesn't seem right that she's a welder, owns a warehouse house, AND is trying to get into ballet. None of it really makes sense.To summerize, Flashdance will never make the AFI's Top 100, but it has an infectious charm. Jennifer Beals is really only so-so in the leading role, and her leading man Michael Nouri is no better off, but it doesn't matter. What does matter here is the great music, especially that title track that may be the most inspirational show .tune since the theme from Rocky. Really, the whole film is played like a 90-minute ad for MTV! Laugh at the dopey plot and listen to the great tunes. Great film to earmark the 80s. Short on plot, but big on rock and roll and performance, especially by Beals, who excels as a welder (and semi-erotic dancer) who has dreams of ballet. I guess I'm recommending the film. I still find myself humming the title song.",Flashdance
66,elle_kittyca,"Don't expect high art, but this was the 80s.",6,17 April 2016,"I give this a reasonably high rating of 6 or 6.5, but that is with some serious caveats. First, more than half of the charm of this movie is nostalgia. If you grew up in the 80s, this movie was cutting edge for a teenager. It captured the feeling of energy and mania at the time in the music scene. On the upside, the characters are sympathetic and you can care about their story if you can overlook the ridiculousness of a few aspects of it. The downside includes those ridiculous aspects, and the fact that the story romanticized a lot of bad things. Like pretty woman, it gives the illusion that if the ""bad girl"" gets vulnerable enough, a sensitive man will save her. In Pretty woman its a prostitute, In Flashdance its a stripper. In real life, its just not true.",Flashdance

Most of us have dreams or had them.When I first saw this movie I was 23 and I was full of hopes andambitions. And looking back now, this movie makes me see what happenswhen you don't go for them. I loved Jennifer Beals when I saw the movie back then. Little did weknow that Jennifer was the original Jennifer Lopez. The whole PuertoRican babe with the bubble butt that drives men crazy these days wasactually on display in Flashdance! This movie sparked a fashion craze with the torn and cut-up sweats andthe leg-warmers. Who can forget the scene where Jennifer and MichaelNouri character(who seemed too old for her actually) are in herapartment and she takes off her bra from under her ripped up sweat top.Was that erotic or what?!! It also had a memorable sound-track thatstill has numbers like 'What a Feeling"" and ""Maniac"" being played onthose 80's disco radio shows. All in all this movie was like  the movie Rocky! Instead of Philly yougot Pittsburgh! Instead of a boxer, you get a dancer! Instead of thetheme song "" Gonna Fly Now"" with the line "" feeling strong now"", you get""What a Feeling"". Like the nobody club boxer with no real formal boxingtraining, you get a dancer with little formal training who rises to thetop. Of course we know that in the real world, these characters wouldhave very little chance of becoming successes. Rocky Balboa would ofended up a punching bag just padding future champions records, andJennifer would",Flashdance
68,madpigmadpig,Only worth watching to get all the puns people make about the film,3,30 May 2014,"An 18-year-old female daytime welder and evening stripper (more like cheeseball interpretive dancer) waffles about auditioning for a dance school while idling with her various co-workers.Some of the dancing is good, but most of it is more mechanical than artistic and almost seems to ignore the accompanying music. The camera-work is surprisingly professional though. The editing in this movie is incredibly clunky, jumpy (unintentionally visible and not supportive of telling the story), and the editor keeps repeating the same shots far too close together and too often to be for the purpose of either building momentum or getting a point across. Rather than being a stylistic choice, this seems to be an example of clumsy editing - rookie film student stuff. I lost interest at the 18-minute mark when the writers decided to extend the plot merely by postponing the inciting action of the last act (applying to the school) due to nerves. But I kept watching anyway, so here's the rest: The majority of the film consists of an insipid attempt at a romance story between the protagonist and her wealthy boss. The protagonist is wholly un-compelling. The side characters (an ice skater/stripper and a cook/racist comedian) are uninteresting, mildly offensive, and a general waste of time. The love interest is just a bit creepy, and not just because he's waay too old for her.Recommended for people intent on watching all 80s dance movies, no matter how poorly made they are.Content notes: Lots of filthy cussing and some racist language, some partial nudity, soily perverts acting pervy, one brief fight scene.",Flashdance

70,chrissch,Doesn't wear well,4,2 February 2002,"Having just watched Flashdance for the first time, I can't appreciate the effect that it obviously had at the time on so many of those who've commented here.  But looking at Flashdance from almost 20 years later, it doesn't seem to have worn well.  The story seems utterly predictable and rather contrived, and the characters are weak.  The music (which I *do* remember well from that time) is still excellent, and some of the dance routines are inventive.  Others were pretty bad.  The closing dance routine is indeed fabulous, but much too short -- for a dance movie, Flashdance doesn't show that much dancing.  Even the gorgeous Jennifer Beals (and her dance doubles) couldn't hold my interest.  As short as Flashdance was, I was looking at my watch about halfway through.  One viewing is plenty for me. 4/10",Flashdance
71,colorsflashing,Not the worst film ever....,4,5 January 2019,"There are worse films out there. There are.This one is a little like ""Showgirls"" in that 1) it is not a good movie; 2) it didn't do much for its star's career (although unlike ""Showgirls"" it wasn't a total career-ender); 3) the lead character is someone with serious temper/behavioral issues, who can be seen running into traffic after pitching a fit; and 4) Joe Eszterhas wrote the screenplay for both. The big differences are that ""Showgirls"" has better dialogue and is not boring, and its premise is more believable. It also has significantly more nudity and is rated ""X,"" but the fact that we don't have to watch Nomi at confession makes up for that.In this movie, Alex (Jennifer Beals) is an 18-year-old welder (?- how did she get that job??) at a steel company in Pittsburgh, and apparently rides her bike 40-50 miles every day. So she is very physically fit, but smokes. We don't know anything about her background or her actual family. She lives in an abandoned warehouse that has no other tenants but does have running water and utilities. She has a little old lady friend Hanna (Lilia Skala) who was once a ballet dancer. At night, clearly not wearied from her welding job, Alex dances at a local bar called Mawby's, where the dancers have fancy stage sets, fancy outfits, new routines every night, and don't have to take off their clothes. You know, a completely typical blue-collar bar. Her 35-year-old boss Nick (the luscious Michael Nouri) sees her dancing there and woos her, and eventually they decide to go out. Across the way is the evil pit of depravity called ""Zanzibar"" where the dancers have to abandon all hope and be naked, and is run by ""Johnny C,"" who looks to be the poor man's version of Robert De Niro.The movie tells us, ""when you give up your dream, you die."" Alex has dreams, as do her friends. One friend, Jeanie, is actually a talented skater, but messes up at a competition held at a poorly-lit ice rink. Nick says she will do better next time, but Alex informs him that there won't be a next time, without further explanation. I guess in this world, if at first you don't succeed, you are consigned to laying on your back on a table at the Zanzibar, allowing drooling drunks to eyeball your crotch as you move your legs in circles, until Alex shows up, drags you (mostly naked) out to the street, and yells at you that that isn't dancing. Another friend, Richie, wants to be a stand-up comic, and thinks the road to success is telling Polish jokes. At one point he takes off for Los Angeles to seek his fame and fortune, but apparently when he doesn't become a big star in 5 days, returns to Pittsburgh, more of a loser than when he left. Technically Jeanie and Richie are not deceased, but since they failed at their dreams and will never pursue them again, their drab future in their insignificant lives in blue-collar Pittsburgh is a metaphor for death. I do not know if this movie was very popular in blue-collar Pittsburgh.At 35, Nick (Alex' boss) is a socially powerful millionaire, and is on the board of the ""Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory,"" where Alex aspires to become a ballet dancer, even though she has no idea what is involved, and even though it bears absolutely no resemblance to any dancing she ever does. Or even any practicing that she ever does. When she goes to the PCDR to pick up an application form, she is standing in line with other people. They are wearing pointe shoes (really? to go get an application?) while she is wearing her clod hoppers. On her way through the building to get the application, she has to pass multiple ballet dancers who are extremely white, who are in what appears to be a museum hallway, practicing their bends, and apparently communicating with each other silently, perhaps with telepathy. To paraphrase Mozart from the movie ""Amadeus"": people so lofty they look as if they zh*t marble. The presence, and numbers, of these heavenly, taciturn creatures evidently intimidate little miss welder half to death, and she flees to Hanna's house, and lies about getting an application. Guilt over her lie causes her to go to church, and we are forced to sit through her awkward confession (not the only time in this movie, regrettably).Nick discovers that Alex wants to be a ballet dancer, and using his clout, instructs the snooty applications office secretary (Lucy Lee Flippin) to make sure Alex gets an invite, which humorously almost causes the secretary to choke on her sandwich.Well, there's a bunch of meaningless back-and-forth when Alex finds out that she didn't get the invite all by herself, yadda yadda yadda. But then Hanna dies, and as Alex tearfully holds Hanna's ratty old pointe shoes, she realizes that she actually has to make an effort to pursue her dream, and unlike her friends, can't just give up at the first sign of adversity. This of course leads us to the famous climax, where Alex dances for the PCDR committee. Although she doesn't dance ballet. But dadgummit she is going to show those pompous, cold people real, passionate dancing! Bring them out of their shells! Point at them in turn! Show them there is life and talent teeming outside of the silent marble halls which they inhabit! And indeed, after a false start, she has them tapping their toes, and even the snooty secretary is won over.As I said at the beginning of this review, there are worse movies. This is just a lot of illogical fluff, and as others have pointed out, is really just music videos strung together by a weak story. Could have been worse, but it also could have been a lot better.",Flashdance

73,hunkyguys85,"SPOILERS Could've been better, could've been worse SPOILERS",4,9 September 2001,"SPOILERS, BEWARE!!!  Flashdance is a fair movie, in my opinion.  Some things do confuse me about it (e.g. Jeanie asks Alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing; Alex replies ""About 25 years,"" isn't Alex supposed to be 18?) and some things do fascinate me about it (I LOVED the spins!). Overall, though, it intrigued me.  When this movie was made, I wasn't even born.  I didn't really experience the eighties (I was born in '85) and I have to wonder: sometimes Alex would just run in place a bit, or throw herself all over, not really dancing, just banging in to things, tossing her head back, and waving her arms-was this considered ""dancing"" back then?  If it was, I'm not sure I could've standed it.  The spins, the flip, the fluid movements were great, but some of it-my neighbor's toddler could've done better!  Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work?  When she doesn't go to work for nearly a week, wouldn't she be laid off?  Living in a warehouse-I can almost see it, but not quite.  It doesn't seem right that she's a welder, owns a warehouse house, AND is trying to get into ballet.  None of it really makes sense.  I shouldn't be too judgemental considering my own background, but please. Maybe Jennifer Beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder, I don't know.  But either way, they could've picked a better actress.  The actors were fine.  I even liked the romance.  You make your own decision.  But mine is-rent it once, don't see it again-it isn't worth it.",Flashdance
74,ILuvPrincessDiaries2,Not as good as I was expecting....,3,10 February 2011,"So, lately I have been seeing all the 'great classics' of the musical and dance era. I started with Grease, (and accidentally saw Grease 2), Saturday Night Live, Dirty Dancing, West Side Story, and the list goes on. I must say Dirty Dancing and Flashdance got nearly the same rating, but I think we all know which is the greater of the two films. Where Dirty Dancing (and most of the other movies) had at least one good song and one to two great dance scenes, I found that Flashdance didn't really have either. Yes, the one song Jennifer Beals does her audition for the dance company to in the end is pretty good, but not memorable. The dancing was only OK, and no songs were a must have on my ipod.The story line however, was another matter. At first they started out slow, fleshing out the characters, but then I felt as is they threw this approach out the window and flew about pitching random scenes that were not memorable, nor on the whole, necessary.I also had a problem with the nudity (which I confess I was not expecting)and the swearing felt almost forced, as if they were trying to make it a better movie with curse words: the verdict? They failed.In my opinion, if you want to see good movie with good dancing and music, see Dirty Dancing, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers or Grease. You will be much more satisfied.",Flashdance

I loved it when I saw it the first time and now I own it on DVD.  This movie is uplifting, charming, and has the best ending to a film I have ever seen. The music makes the whole movie work.  It is almost like the movie was created to go around the music.  Jennifer Beals plays a lonely, attractive, yet scared 18-year-old woman, even though she acts much older.  She is mature, intelligent, strong, and full of life.  Any man, including myself, would go gaga for a woman like this.   But, most importantly, she chases her dream.  It is this part of the movie that I feel captures the entire film.  The main character, as well as other side characters, chase their dreams even though they are all scared to death of failure. Some of them do fail but some succeed in varying degrees. They all chase what they want out of life and that is truly the message of the movie. The ending you will have to witness for yourself but every time I see it I get goose bumps.  It makes me feel like I can do anything I put my mind to. Excellent film.  Highly recommended.",Flashdance

79,pizza0,"Not Epic, Not Dramatic, Eletrical & Magical",9,27 December 2004,"The definition of the word ""Movie"" states that a movie is: ""A contiguous series of video frames (and optionally synchronized audio) that are displayed fast enough to provide the illusion of motion. A frame rate of 30 frames per second is a typical target for a movie."" that said, I really don't see why people pick on this movie because it doesn't have a plot. I'd understand if people don't like the plot, but to those of you who think FlashDance's a joke because it doesn't look like a movie, I say gimme a break. This picture has a simple plot, perhaps, a story about a wielder/dancer going for her dream and falling in love with a man might not be enough for a lot of viewers. however, the movie en-powered itself with what is arguably the best ORIGINAL movie soundtrack of all time, I think someone mentioned earlier, if the studio was to release every song on the sound track as a single, then everyone one of them could have topped charts. And, those who didn't like the movie also complained about acting, well now, I personally thought there was great acting on Jennifer's part. I think, maybe what people do not see is that, given the plot, there was only so much to act for, so instead, she created an attitude, which translated into the music, the cloth, and everything else in the movie. and that, made the movie an icon. The fact that Flashdance made a huge impact on people(hell, it defined a whole generation!!)just like any other memorable moving pictures, is more than enough for me to say it's an excellent movie.",Flashdance
80,HalRagland,A 94 Minute Music Video,1,27 July 2008,"I give ""Flashdance"" a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos, in order to clock in as a feature length film. Since when does that count as film? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer, who, incomprehensibly, has a job as a welder in a Pittsburgh steel factory. Not a line of work most older women find their way into, much less 18-year-olds fresh out of high school. Meanwhile, at night she works as an exotic dancer, who never actually takes off her clothes, in a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. Yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at Mawby's, you would think they were working at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip.Alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice her age. After resisting Nick's advances, because going out with the boss isn't a good idea, she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to Alex's co-workers.When Beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss/boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her tantrums. She angrily tells Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.Of course, Alex does eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the Conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yeah, it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation.I don't think I can judge whether or not Beals can actually act well on the basis of what I saw in ""Flashdance"". This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written, that I don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.You have to hand it to the makers of ""Flashdance"" though. This movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. In this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script, then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that I cared about. Instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain can't take seriously. A truly forgettable ""film"".",Flashdance
81,TeEn AnGeL,I can't have it all.........,5,12 July 2004,"Oh, what a feeling I had when I watched this movie. Instead of making me believe I could dance right through my life, this film made me want to sleep right through it. I usually enjoy musicals involving many astounding hits from the 80s, but still, the sheer star power of Joan Jett and the Blackhearts performing 'I Love Rock and Roll' was just not enough for me this time. Though what I enjoyed most was that funky dance music that came after Joan...It was sooooooooo FUNKY!But funky music aside, there was not much else to enjoy in this film. I felt empty as I watched Kyle T. Heffner perform the role of Ritchie. He subtly reminded me of Mike Damus and the funny, hilarious and extremely corny jokes he told. Oh Mike, if only you were old enough to play Ritchie back then.
But getting back to me, often, all alone I have cried silent tears full of pride. So I thought I could relate to this film because I too was once a dancer like Jennifer Beals, sadly it was much more of a difficult road to acceptance for me. Yes, Flashdance ended on a positive note, and I can only hope that one day I could be like Alex. But digression is something I do often, so let's get back to my review, I give this film 5 out of 10 because the story was rather weak, and the acting was so bad, I felt I could have acted all the parts out better than them...except maybe the part played by Jumbo Red. For him, I watched until the end.",Flashdance
82,mike_2511,"Atmospheric, almost perfect",9,11 June 2012,"You know when a work of art just clicks with you? This was one such film.One an initial level, I admire it immensely artistically – it's beautifully shot, and the lighting is amongst the best I've ever seen, hazy, dim, soft and warm, it really added to the atmosphere. And then there was just the catalogue of amazing scenes, from the strobe dance in the club against the white background (an epileptic fit waiting to happen, I'd have thought it'd warn you on the box), the scene outside the club in the driving rain when she drags out the semi-naked Jeannie, the dance in the spray at the start and of course the final audition.The acting is great, too, especially Beale, who is extremely empathic whilst remaining feisty and full of character. The story moves quick and visually the film is very distinctive. Some scenes seem pretty risqué for the time, though never forced, and the dialogue is excellent and well delivered. The soundtrack is pretty perfect too, most of it written by Moroder so that's to be expected. The way the songs connect with every scene is so skillful and understated. They also got all the little things right, such as locations and choice of shot. One of the most perfect films I've ever watched. The only criticism is the ending, which is abrupt.

83,adambeare-77852,An entertaining and thrilling dance film!,9,3 July 2020,"I wanted to see Flashdance after watching Saturday night fever, as This made me become interested in the dance genre of film and wanted to see more. I had heard about Flashdance in the past and was interested in seeing it. After watching it, I have to say it was entertaining, emotional and the dancing shown in this film was phenomenal. Jennifer Beals played Alex Owens who works as a welder and also works at a bar, but shows an interest and skill in dancing and wants to make it big as a dancer. The film ends with herself auditioning and the dance scene at this part of the film is amazing. The emotion in this film can be felt when Alex gets that feeling of wanting to chase the dream, wanting to be a true dancer. the film ending with Her spectacular dancing is perfect as her dreams have become a reality. The music is also great with the songs "" what a feeling"" and ""maniac"". My only problem with this film is that I feel more could have been done with the ending, such as Alex celebrating after the audition, or even Alex performing in front of a live audience, proving that it all paid off. Besides that though, Flashdance is awesome and gets a 9/10 from me.",Flashdance

I love dance films, I really truly do, but there comes a time where a dance film becomes a music video, and Flashdance has just crossed that thresh hold.Jennifer Beals, playing the lovable and very talented Alex, is one of the only highlights of this film. She is very good at what she does and quite endearing, but her appearance as the main character doesn't make up for the fact that this film is pretty bad in many other ways.The prominent men in Alex's life are creepy, and she falls in love with the one who follows her home in his car, buys her way into an audition, and generally just uses his power as her boss over her. The film itself lacks a majority of a plot, and the exposition needed to explain Alex's existence simply isn't there. Why does she want to dance? How are these people she spends time with related to her? How old is she in relation to her partner? Why should we care about her story? It's bad to come out of a film and realise that you haven't really been impacted by any of the characters' stories.The continuity is messy. There are cuts where there shouldn't be and chronologically, everything is a bit of a disaster.However, the dancing is very good, and the soundtrack is awesome. This film could be worse.",Flashdance

86,klbowersox,This movie is surprisingly bad.,1,25 February 2005,"I was a sophomore in college when this movie came out and I had never actually seen it until last night. I finally decided to watch it because I like good dancing and because the movie had such cultural impact. After seeing the movie I am completely baffled by how it had any effect other than putting people to sleep.The story is pretty preposterous when you think about it. Does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer joint full of gnarly old steel-workers and teamsters could keep their clientèle with the high concept dances that those girls were doing? They would have all been over to Zanzibar faster than you can say ""performance art"". Can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre TV watching No theater dance thing that she did? Please.It seems plausible to me that there could be a woman that worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer--after all both are physically demanding jobs. But I didn't buy for a second that THAT girl worked in a steel yard. And I didn't buy for a second that I was looking at a real steel yard. Steel work is dangerous. You don't keep your work area looking like a junk yard and not end up loosing a limb. I love some of the inane shots like when two welders are sitting in the big corrugated tubes welding. What the hell are they doing in there? Or when she is cutting six inches off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch. She was obviously board and just started cutting random things up.But story holes like that can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least stimulating in some way. Flashdance doesn't offer anything to balance it, however.The dancing horrible. It is the spastic twitch-and-pose style that ruined American musicals until...well are we really over it yet? The sensuality that the movie tries for is ruined by Jennifer Beal's complete lack of personality. I mean I am a 42 year old male and when she was supposed to be eating lobster my only reaction was to think that she should get a lobster bib.You can't really get behind Alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow. The dog had more going on than she did.The love affair is flat. It comes across as nothing more than a boss with the hots for one of his workers. Zero passion.Even the final scene where she dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other stiffs is unsatisfying because the panels reaction is so unbelievable. What serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes at Alex's lame cheerleader routine? In short the movie had nothing but leg-warmers and large sweatshirts. Oh, yeah, there is a good chunk of nudity when Alex ""rescues"" her friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a laughable bit of hypocrisy). Other than that the movie is a waste of time. I wish that the MST3K crew were still in business. This would make good fodder for them.",Flashdance

It chronicles the story of a young women encouraging her friends to try and succeed (or fail) at their passions while she waits on the sideline for her big chance, afraid to take the plunge at her own dream.Alex is a beautiful woman who works in a steel mill by day, but at night dances which is her true passion. She longs to be a professional dancer and pursue her dreams of being on stage but is too afraid to go out and get it. She is a loyal friend and encourages her pals to go out and give it their all while she stays stagnant.In pure 80's fashion, the movie plot isn't a masterpiece (imagine how they remade footloose in the 2000's and it seemed odd and very out of place) but I find it to be genuine and kinda heartfelt as you root for Alex throughout the film and watch her pick up her friends to dust them back off so they can get ""back on the horse"" so to speak.

What about the characters?Do you think we really need them.Some might say YES but in this kind of movie I doubt it.Anyway,MUSIC,DANCING AND JENNIFER BEALS(An actress full of virtues and beauty,an upcoming Hollywood star in the middle 80's,who was simply betrayed by her own choices.What a pity,she could have reached the top of star system,up where Sharon,Demi.Sigourney and Julia belong)are the soul of this much wondrous rhythmical experience.Giorgio Moroder did a great job in the field of music and Adrian Lyne as a director was a professional choice.""WHAT A FEELING"" and""MANIAC"" are simply wonderful songs(Personal Opinion:""MANIAC"" deserved the oscar award)so much of the 80's,and the choreography is real magic(Jennifer gave her best in this area,revealing a great dancing talent).

Contrary to popular belief, Michael Jackson did not invent the moonwalk.There is a scene where Nouri and Beals are taking a romantic stroll. They momentarily pass a group of people break dancing on the street. This is where the world was first treated to a moonwalk.It wasn't until years later that Jacko took credit for inventing it. He never gave proper credit to the unnamed street dancer in Flashdance.",Flashdance

It is still emulated and relevant showing up in cartoons such as Shrek. I will always remember fondly the curious feelings it gave me when I watched it as an 8 year old kid. Seeing all the dancing and decisions in the young women's lives of Alex and her friend. The nude bar scenes were my first exposure to sex. I had never seen naked women in a movie before! It was awesome and confusing at the same time! And my mom never censored it! And of course you feel sorry for poor Jeani. There's a real life porn actress/prostitute who has a similar story. You can see the path Jeani is going before Alex helps her. I will always remember the barking of the sleazy nude bar owner every time I pass a strip joint: ""Live nude beautiful girls!!!""

Who could wish for more ? I saw this film five times when it came out and actually took up dancing after seeing it. So it changed my life bigtime as I met my wife to be in dance class.She even looked like Cynthia Rhodes the acrobatic dancer who makes a few fantastic dances in the movie and is on par with Jennifer Beals. Some people criticize this film for not being realistic , but speaking as a dancer myself I think it is very realistic but of course condensed and dramatized.

I loved it when i was at university but it has always bothered me that the film never explained whether she had parents or not. Was she an orphan? It also seemed a bit odd that at 18 she was a welder.IT is a skilled job. How did she get that job as a girl at 18!! and 20 yrs ago!! And the rest of the male workers seemed to accept her .. which I find hard to believe. Their must have been a lot of male chauvanism in that environment. But then it is make believe and I should not be such a cynic!

The acting isn't really that strong either (but Jennifer Beals is soooo hot I can't believe it), nor are the characters. Sure, the characters are likable, but not very deeply developed. You pretty much don't know anything about the characters backgrounds, families or history in general. This movie isn't a masterpiece, but gosh darn it that soundtrack, the dancing and the whole feel of the movie is fantastic. If you are a grumpy person who thinks everything about the 80's was cheesy and lame, for the love of God don't watch this film (you might go out on a killing rampage if you do) However, if you are not a person like that, watch this film cause' it will make you feel awesome.

I have only watched it once, and that was more than 10 years ago when I was a kid going to a primary school in Beijing. I am Chinese and I grew up in Beijing, so I don't know how much my opinions reflect the typical audience. This movie made a very deep impression on me. It was in the late 80s when I watched it, and it, along with other movies, introduced me to American culture. And I was just fascinated. I remember for a while everybody in China was doing breakdancing, partly because of _Flashdance_. I realize it is not a very good movie, but for me this movie brings back memory of the 80s, when my friends and I first learned about American culture, and how we tried to learn everything about America as we grew up.",Flashdance

However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was. I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic. The character developments also lacked in depth. I think that this was, very much, a product of the 80s: the film does not hold up today!",Flashdance
105,corporatelaw2,It's OK,5,28 January 2012,"I know how much Flashdance became such a huge hit of the 80's, it defined a whole new generation of clothes, behavior, and dance moves. That's what made Flashdance so special. Now I was born in '85 so I kinda missed out on these things, but I understand it's importance. I just bought this movie yesterday, it was back to back with Footloose, two iconic 80's movies, and I watched Flashdance this afternoon. While this film defined a huge part of the 80's, it was an average film with a simple plot. The acting and story is just pretty average, but it's a cute and fun one.Alex is a welder by day, but at night she is a sexy exotic dancer who grabs the attention of all the men. But she has big time dreams to become a ballet dancer, she has promised her grandmother that she would apply to the top ballet school and try to get an audition. But Alex is always intimidated by the other ""proper looking"" dancers with tons more experience than her. She falls in love with a fellow co-worker, Nick, who wants her to make it just as badly. She goes through rough times, but she just wants to make it and will do anything for that chance.Flashdance is one of those must see movies if you wanna see the important films of the 80's. I just wanted to see what this movie was about since it's such a huge part of film culture. Jennifer Beals actually did a great job as Alex, she was absolutely beautiful and made the character very likable. While this film did not live up to my expectations, it still was a good film. It has an awesome sound track and really is a lot of fun to dance too. Now excuse me, but I wanna try to take my bra off without removing my shirt, lol.5/10",Flashdance

So what makes this film more relevant is its music, the dancers and the sensation it gives you if you get involved with the songs, the rhythms.. then you would like just to make your body part of the same experience and dance. Because to dance is a feast of life, isn't it ? /////////////As this page demands to put at least 10 lines to appear here I wanted to write something in Spanish but I am forbidden to use any other language but English.....which is strange I must say... Aren't we free to say and communicate ?? ... so I might have to repeat and say ........ that we people should dance more , and enjoy more our moments in life and this film will make you do it... if you let it , if you get involved in the rhythms , in the movements , in the notes and realize that each part of your body can actually move with each note..... And I just wrote this hot comment because they demand 10 lines!!!!//////// //////I always think that it depends on what you search to what you find, so if you want a drama, you wont have a drama with this film , you also wont have a documental... and films are like people , so when you see them you should try to accept them and evaluate them for what they are NOT FOR WHAT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE WITH YOUR OWN PARAMETRERS.... this is a musical for people that love music ....",Flashdance
107,keren-7,"Trashdance - lewd, sordid and painful",1,29 June 2006,"I'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. I had major problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repellent. Beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing lewdness, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. It is very difficult to believe that Nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. And what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. Yuck. As for the dancing, I'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. What on earth was that TV dance sequence about in the club? Who was supposed to be dancing? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! And even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out, she would NEVER get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. There were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when Alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was the break dancing in the street. I also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? How did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?Where were her family? Was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney film needs their head examined. And anyway, what happened to the ice skater? Many people said the film was poor but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep on trying, and your dreams will come true. Watch ""The Little Mermaid"" instead.",Flashdance

The idea of a female welder from Pittsburgh, who strips at a local club on the side my not be your idea of a great story. However, this young woman has aspirations- and burning passion to make it big. This was Jennifer Beals shining moment in this little film that simply says ""Take your passion, and make it happen"". Oh yes, there is a grit to this film, and it takes time for the story to develop. But when Alex Owens meets Nicky,(Michael Nouri) a man she ultimately trusts, things get interesting. The soundtrack in the film is fantastic, it makes the feel, the passion come alive as it drives the story and gives it a soul. The workouts this young woman goes through are incredible, and it is that fantastic soundtrack that makes that, and the whole film for that matter, simply come alive. It is the message and the music that makes this my favorite film, and the ending gives me a rush of emotion every time I watch it. Oh, and her dog, Grunt, is so ugly that he's cute!",Flashdance

Indeed here is selected a mixtape of one of the greatest and catchy songs. All time while I was watching my body and my feet just went to move and dance by themselves with no particular intention. What can I say, I think I'm probably overestimate the significance in ""Flashdance"" among other movies but wow - this really got me. I figure this film will be liked by me forever and has earned its special place in my heart. Foggy streets, falling raindrops on the door windows, street shots, choreography performance, cute Jeniffer Beals face, there are too many really damn good visual frames. You just like watching at a really beautiful and delicious pie and you really want to try a bit of it as soon as possible. Well I want to recommend ""Flashdance"" to everybody who wants to cheer up and start believing in yourself in all terms. The leitmotiv in here is obviously striving for success and fulfilling your own ambitions.Check it out if you haven't this this picture yet, you won't regret; get a glass of white white (or whatever on your preference) and easily relax on your comfy bed while listening to this beautiful soundtrack.Very light, inspiring, beautifully romantic, classic, well made film.

People wonder where the style changes come from, well they come from movies and this one Changed Life, Dance and style as we know it today. The movie had a kind of vibe that let you know to ""follow your dream"" and enjoy your life, love and most of all Dance. It added the love of your elders mixed with the life of the young. It made working in a Steel Mill, cool and showed no class distinction in Rich or the working Poor, that is, love is love.

I was maybe expecting too much but, anyway, all I really enjoyed is the dance scenes and the theme, which are both excellent and cult. Apart from that, I was not moved at all by the love intrigue which does not add anything particularly transcendent to the movie, in my opinion. What i liked, however, is the constant tension between femininity and masculinity throughout the whole movie. Even though the movie is not clearly feminist, the way it depicts women's role in Society sparks-off a slightly feminist undertone at times : female characters are definitely struggling with males' tendency to dominate, which may explain the sometimes ""manly"" attitude of the protagonist.",Flashdance

While I also live real life, I still like to see movies based on real life, helps me relate sometimes.Anyways, this movie is a keeper in my eyes, and if you haven't seen it, you should. Can't believe it took me this long to see it. It was way before its time and very sketchy for its time as well, which makes me wonder how it did so well to begin with.Might want to also check out the behind the scenes/making of this movie that you can see on T.V. and cable as well as should be on the DVD, it's worth the watch.

113,oykuesen,a twenty-something perspective,6,30 December 2013,"Last thing Flashdance page needs is another review, but I felt so compelled to write one, and I will keep it short. As someone not even born in the 80s I have only heard about Flashdance, but I knew the song before watching the movie. Sure the storyline feels sappy and the dialogue at times is very cliché; I don't want to give any spoilers I rather suggest you watch it before reading others' comments to get a feel of it yourself. But I guess what draws you in is not only the amazing song selection that works so well with the movie's rhythm but also Alex's character overall. She is very relatable, dignified and so much soaked into her own world of dreams that she takes you there with her. Here as far as the acting goes, I can say that Beals does a fine job; you can tell she feels Alex in her bones. I loved how comfortable Alex seemed in her own skin and surroundings meanwhile feeling isolated and lost. Would I watch it again? Maybe just to watch Alex's character and see some of the dance sequences. Yet, I recommend watching it to everyone else, as it is already a part of pop culture history.",Flashdance
114,eduthais,This movie is less outdated than many people nowadays might think,7,8 May 2005,"I've seen Flashdance about 15 to 20 times during my whole life since 1983. And all the times I've seen it, it was in the Spanish version. Yesterday I saw the original version and I just couldn't believe how different it was from what I've been watching all this time. While in the original version, Alex seems to be a candid 18 year old girl trying to find her dream, in Spanish her voice makes her look like a much older and experienced woman with an empty life. From what I have noticed about the film production, it is indeed a low-cost movie whose success had nothing to do with its editing, set-ups or actors. I would say that the thing that definitely made a hit out it was the music. I don't think this movie is outdated at all nowadays. In fact, I would say that a remake of this movie would be a hit at the box office. However, I don't think it would be such a good idea to place Jennifer Lopez as Alex, like some people say it would be.",Flashdance

This story has a lot of moral behind it, like telling us to strive for our dreams and stuff like that. I really love the last part when the lead actress when ahead with the audition in this prestigious theatre. Despite the fact that she never had any dancing in her entire life, ( which she is required to fill up in the audition form, and she do not have any dancing shoes ) she still went for it. Her moves were marvelous, combining the moves of break-dance, ballet, street-dance and most importantly, flashdance. Even though she failed 1 or 2 times in the audition, she take her chances seriously and she was accepted by the judges.

117,gta-36049,Pure 80's vibe,7,2 June 2018,"I saw this movie for the first time in my life a few days ago and i must say i loved this movie.If you think about the 80's the picture you have in mind is pretty close to what you see on the screen when you put in Flashdance. From the first second onwards it blasts 80's synthesizer-sound in your eardrums, you see the typical hairstyles and clothes (that you would instantly relate to that era in your head). It's just a perfect emulation of that period of time, i felt like i was there, totally immersed and ready to go. So regarding the atmosphere it was just perfect for me. In addition Jennifer Beals as the main character Alex Owens delivers an enchanting performance. She acts in a natural and relatable way, i was with her from the beginning till the end and felt all of her struggle to become a professional dancer. Her female role also struck me as rather atypical. She works in a man dominated job, she is living her life on her own and takes the active part in her relationship to the male love-interest. It's impressing how dynamic and fast-paced the movie is, there is not a single moment that leaves you bored. To me it represents a perfect example of a feel good movie.Even though i seem to only have praise for it, i am completely aware that there are multiple doubtful performances and that story-wise it has not that much to offer. It's not something you think about for days or something that leaves a deeper and lasting impression inside of you. But it leaves you with a smile on your face, with energy in your feet and makes you ready to dance yourself.Yeah I know that all mostly sounds like I am an all-out fanboy, but what should you do when you catch the Feeling?",Flashdance

It's no wonder Jennifer Bealls had trouble finding good work after this movie. Bad acting bad directing and bad continuity. The woman is actually wearing metal buttons on herself, as a ""welder"" which is a no-no. The storyline is supposedly meant to be uplifting and a struggle to prove one's self. I easily proved I could uplift myself from the struggle to sit any further the second time I gave this movie a chance. This title is still in print?

When the movie came out in 1983 I was living in Pittsburgh, where the movie was filmed and based, and dating a ballerina, so the movie was near and dear to my heart. The plot was totally unbelievable, the sets were unrealistic and the people were too shallow, but still, our generation suspended reality and just enjoyed the movie.Through the years I began understanding what an impact Flash Dance had on my generation, it especially hit home when I met my future wife in New York City and saw pictures of her and her sisters during that time period. Their hair was modeled after Jennifer Beals', their dress and many of the things they did developed from the movie. An entire generation of young women embraced the 'big, curly hair' look, the off the shoulder sweatshirt and tank-top look and wearing tights and ankle warmers, much to the enjoyment of the men around them. Jennifer Beals' big eyes, brilliant smile and joy of life became endearing qualities that only a lucky few women could properly emulate, I still enjoy that look today.This is a wonderful movie where one should not criticize the fine technical details, instead the viewer should just sit back and enjoy a very nice feel-good movie.",Flashdance
