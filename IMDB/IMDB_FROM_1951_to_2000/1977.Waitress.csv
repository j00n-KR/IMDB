0,SnoopyStyle,Charming whimsical movie,7,21 July 2014,"Jenna Hunterson (Keri Russell) is a pie shop waitress who makes amazing pies with strange names. She is dismayed that her husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto) got her pregnant. He's a controlling, obnoxious, and demeaning. Her best friends are her fellow waitresses Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn (Adrienne Shelly). The owner of the pie shop is Old Joe (Andy Griffith). She's trying to save money to run away from Earl. She wants to enter a $25k pie contest in a nearby town but Earl won't permit it. Then she meets the new doctor Jim Pomatter (Nathan Fillion). She falls for him only that he's already married.It's a whimsical movie about slightly quirky characters by Adrienne Shelly. It's really sad that she got murdered. She showed herself to be an interesting emerging filmmaker. It's more charming rather than laugh out loud funny. The heart of it is the adorably sweet Keri Russell.",Waitress
1,gavin6942,I Didn't Receive the Slice Everyone Else Received,4,3 May 2008,"Jenna (Keri Russell) is a waitress at a small town, southern pie diner. Each morning she invents a new pie that corresponds to her mood or life at that particular moment. Her co-workers are neurotic, her husband's abusive and there is no escape. But after accidentally becoming pregnant, Jenna finds a new lease on life in her doctor (Nathan Fillion). Is this the happiness she's been looking for? My good friend Chelsea and I were all set to watch a horrible movie when we found this disc left in the DVD player by an unseen hand. She had heard good things, and I was ready for anything. Add on the fact it comes from Fox Searchlight (who seem skilled at picking out independent features) and stars Fillion (and Andy Griffith) and I was happy to give it a chance. Well, I'm sorry to ruin everybody's party, but all the positive reviews of this film are wrong. It is a complete waste of time from beginning to end.Keri Russell is bland, her character is surprisingly not particularly lovable (I barely felt bad she was being abused) and for the most part her co-stars and supporting characters are not overly interesting. I sort of enjoyed the character of one of the co-workers (sorry, I forgot her name) and I like Lew Temple (who plays manager Cal) as an actor... but really, it just wasn't working. Not even Fillion could save this. The film was cliché after cliché with a predictable plot... I won't give anything away, but let's just say you could guess the entire film's direction after the first ten or fifteen minutes. Maybe this works in romantic comedies, but this movie wasn't all that romantic and fell far short of a comedy.It was really going for the indie vibe, as evidenced by the artsy shots of someone (clearly not Russell) making pies of an unusual variety. I'm sorry, your artsiness doesn't work on me. Others have criticized my love of ""Juno"", saying it was just trying too hard to be independent. Well, that's how I feel about this one. If those people want to see ""Waitress"" and get back to me, I'd love to discuss this one. Towards the third act, Chelsea was getting physical ill from lack of redeeming value. Not long after, I felt the pains, too. Unless you hate your life and want to ruin an otherwise good day, don't waste your time with ""Waitress"".",Waitress
2,jboothmillard,Waitress,7,21 June 2013,"I heard about this independent film, which I really wanted to see, because I knew the writer and director Adrienne Shelly died not long after filming had finished, and not long before it was headlining a film festival, I assumed her death was either an accident or suicide, I had no idea she was murdered! Basically Jenna Hunterson (Dark Skies' Keri Russell) works at Joe's Diner in a small town in the American South as a waitress, inventing many varieties of delicious pies, she hopes to get away from her abusive husband Earl Hunterson (Jeremy Sisto), and has been saving a thousand and hidden it around the house. Her plans suddenly change when she finds herself pregnant with her husband's baby, this is not something she wants but is going to give birth, and it certainly urges her more to enter a pie baking contest to win the $25,000 prize. Tracking Jenna's pregnancy progress is new physician Dr. Jim Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), who at first she is unwilling to talk to much seeing how he is not her usual doctor she has known since childhood, and of course she shows no enthusiasm for the unborn child. She hides this pregnancy for her grouchy boss Cal (Lew Temple) as she is sure he will fire her, but actually he doesn't care, and continuing work she bonds with her only friends, co-workers Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn (Adrienne Shelly), and cantankerous diner owner Old Joe (Andy Griffith) who offers her wisdom. As Jenna spends more time with Dr. Pomatter, who is also married himself, they start seeing each other both in and out of the medical office and having mutual attraction start an affair, and of course he enjoys her delectable pies. The baby is nearing the point of coming out, there is a point when Earl obviously knows she is pregnant, but also discovers the hidden money and she is forced to pretend it is for a baby crib, which she buys with her saved money. Jenna ends the affair with Dr. Pomatter, has a visit from Old Joe who is being treated himself, and soon after she gives birth to a baby girl, it turns out to be something she is really happy about, and bonding with the child she finds the strength to be blunt to Earl and say that she hasn't loved him for years. She is upset to find out that Joe went into a coma and will most likely die, but she remembered he gave her an envelope before the birth, it is a hand-drawn card sketch, and also she is shocked to receive a cheque for $270,450, with a message to start her life afresh. The final scenes see Jenna and her girl she named Lulu (as a toddler played by Shelley's real daughter Sophie Ostroy) bonding joyfully, she does win the pie baking contest, and she taken over the diner renamed Lulu's Pies where her friends and customer enjoy the brightly coloured pies served everyday. Also starring Eddie Jemison as Ogie and Darby Stanchfield as Francine Pomatter. Russell gives a really sweet performance as the woman passionate about pies and trying to find herself while finding new love, Fillion is likable as the doctor and love interest, and the supporting cast members all do well, including Shelley as an eccentric fellow waitress, the story is nice and simple, flows really nicely mixing well though funny, loving and dramatic moments, including with the subjects of motherhood and unhappy marriage, and the pies look really nice, it is such a shame what happened to Shelley, as this is a really heartwarming romantic comedy. Very good!",Waitress
3,moonspinner55,"'Cute', lackadaisically silly...though the cast is good and nearly makes it worthwhile",5,16 August 2011,"The late Adrienne Shelly wrote, directed, and co-stars in this modest comedy wherein a small town pie-maker (who works as a waitress at the diner she makes desserts for!) considers leaving her abusive husband for her handsome--but already-married--obstetrician. To complicate matters, she finds she's pregnant for the first time (after the husband got her drunk one night), though this only seems to sweeten the pot for the doctor, who wants to run off with her anyhow. Keri Russell is very fetching and grounded in the leading role, but her character (who has been making delicious treats her entire life) comes off as an underachiever, with no money and no hope in turning her baking talents into a lucrative profession. Jeremy Sisto's angry, selfish husband fares no better; wouldn't he want his wife bringing home more money...or is he happy struggling along from paycheck to paycheck? The condition that he's so jealous he won't allow her to try for bigger prospects is a lazy, illogical out, and the scenes between husband and wife are both unpleasant and unconvincing. Shelly has created some engaging, folksy supporting roles (such as Andy Griffith's salty proprietor), but because the movie has only one foot in reality, the situations these people are involved in do not come to much. The humor is quirky-cute though not terribly funny, while the Southern milieu, the life in the diner, and the side-threads of romance each fail to come off. ** from ****",Waitress
4,Quinoa1984,it's got all the right ingredients to be a cut above most rom coms,7,24 October 2016,"Waitress could have turned into a middling mess, or something with characters that are hard to like (or, I should really note, sociopathic) if done in a more hard-lined Hollywood 'rom-com' assembly-line output (in 2007 those were still done). But Adrienne Shelley was more, for lack of a less precise word-choice, sweet-hearted about her characters. Even the villain of the story, and he is a villain who stands firmly in the way of our hero Keri Russell, her character's husband played by Jeremy Sisto, takes a break (if only in the tiniest moments) to not be a scumbag and show how he too can be vulnerable and afraid.He surely shows his humanity the least - Sisto is scarily adept at making his Earl into a presence that's felt off camera too, if not more so - but Shelley had with Waitress a real chance to make a commercial picture and she took it. Prior to this she directed a couple of low budget independent films, and with this may have seemed to go 'mainstream'. The casting choices though are what count here especially; Russell carries so much screen presence that it's a wonder the lens doesn't make out with her before Nathan Fillion's Doctor does. And in small parts she gets things right too with Cheryl Hines as another waitress at the diner where Jenna serves and (especially, well, uniquely) makes pies, and Andy Griffith is the nice-but-demeaning water (he better get his two waters AND have time to read the horoscope!)There are times when the movie goes into perhaps being too 'cute' or 'quirky'; this is from the same studio, Fox Searchlight, that would a few months later put out another story of an uncertain-in-her-life young woman, Juno, and there's points this dips into being a story that is so light it might float away (or another way to put it on the other extreme is that it's a more grounded version of Pushing Daisies). And oddly enough if there's one part of the movie that doesn't work for me it's ironically Shelley's own sub-plot, where she's another waitress courted by a stone-cold Nebbish with a capital N, and who have an argument in the diner which kind of grinds the movie to a halt.But I can forgive (most of) that for how pure the relationship is between Russell and Fillion on screen; I wish I saw more of Nathan FIllion in movies, or at least in leads like this where he gets to develop a character and he shows us just enough to get to understand why he's doing the things he is. Or, on the reverse, not entirely know why, again this is from Jenna's point of view and that's crucial - we're seeing it through HER eyes, through the downtrodden hero we want to see get out of her loveless marriage. Though some parts are funny (scattered really), it's actually more of a drama with a light touch, and it feels harrowing at times in the scope of a low-middle class, blue collar existence: what does one do with the options presented, i.e. bad marriage, a baby on the way that may/may not be loved, and an affair that is hot but untenable?Russell guides all of these conflicts of the character beautifully, leading up to a conclusion that is genuine and moving. To a further point, knowing about the horrible circumstances outside of the production - Shelley was murdered just before the film was released, though it was finished at the time - makes the very ending a real lump-in-the-throat moment (or just cry your eyes out, go for it). Waitress wears its emotions on its sleeve, but it carries its sincerity along both in the writing and performances, so it's a tough film to ever put down all that much.",Waitress
5,JohnHowardReid,The last half is superb!,7,2 June 2016,"Yes, we have two movies of the same name released in the same year. This one is not really a comedy, although it is advertised as such and does indeed have its comic moments. It's a sad picture really, its poignancy rendered even more chillingly dramatic by the murder of writer/director/player Adrienne Shelly by an intruder in her New York office/apartment halfway through 2006. Presumably, the movie was edited without her guidelines and it simply runs too long. I'm sure that had she lived, Adrienne would have trimmed the first half of the movie which tends to be both repetitious and inconsequential and even – let's fact it! – boring! With the entrance of the new doctor, however, the last half of the movie becomes very poignant and I'm not really giving anything away by saying that it comes to a rather downbeat conclusion that is not unexpected but still rather sad. Admittedly, a New York reviewer had the opposite response – ""Leaves you feeling good!"" he wrote. Admittedly, performances are good all around, and as the lead character, Keri Russell is nothing short of outstanding! The superb 20th Century Fox DVD has some wonderful extras.",Waitress
6,tavm,Keri Russell gives a wonderful performance in Adrienne Shelly's Waitress,9,2 June 2007,"Having just seen one woman-gets-pregnant movie (Knocked Up), I wasn't sure how I'd react seeing another one several minutes later in the same theatre. But Waitress is more than that. It's about a woman (Keri Russell) who loves making pies in the diner so much, she wants to save enough money to enter a pie-baking contest and win the grand prize so she can run away from her no-good husband (Jeremy Sisto). It's also about the friendships she has with her fellow workers (Cheryl Hines, the movie's late writer/director Adrienne Shelly) and the diner owner (Andy Griffith in a wonderfully offbeat yet homespun performance) who gives Jenna (Russell's character) some good advice. And it's about Jenna's affair with the newbie doctor (Nathan Fillion) who helps her grow spiritedly and sexually. All the drama and humor come together to make Waitress one of the more touching films I've seen this year. And the song Keri sings in the middle and end (and co-written by Shelly) is one of the more wistful I've heard in memory. Losing Ms. Shelly last November was a great tragedy but in this, her last film, she's created one of the most optimistic dramedies of the year.",Waitress
7,edwagreen,Waitress Serves Up Real American Pie ****,9,14 July 2010,"This is a very good film dealing with 3 waitresses. It is not Mel's Diner at ""Alice."" In fact, this is even better.The film centers around Keri Russell who is in a very bad marriage. Her abusive husband is just too miserable to watch. Things get even more complicated when she finds herself pregnant and soon begins a relationship with the new pediatrician in the town.Andy Griffith's role as the crotchety owner of the restaurant and other establishments is well suited here. While it is predictable what will happen, it is most poignant as things evolve.The wonderful ending demonstrates that an appropriate ending occurred. We see really true values ensue as well as doctors being normal people as well.Adrienne Shelly did a marvelous job in directing and in a supporting role. Her tragic murder deprived us of really someone with a great future.",Waitress
8,michaelRokeefe,"Apple, peach , strawberry and Bad Baby Pie.",7,11 December 2007,"A little strange, but funny romantic comedy. The characters really make the movie. I've always liked Keri Russell on the little screen, but on the big screen...oops, I'm in love again. Jenna(Russell) is a waitress at Joe's Pies diner; being a pie genius she bakes all the pies everyday and creates a new one every day. But her life is not a happy one. She is married to an a^^hole of a husband named Earl(Jeremy Sisto). She also finds out that she is pregnant and does not want the child; she just wants to leave Earl. Her doctor is in semi-retirement and Jenna's doctor will be the young Dr. Pomatter(Nathan Fillion); the two fall in love immediately, but know it is wrong. Cal(Lew Temple)is the diner's methodical manager; sometime seeming heartless. Owner of Joe's Pies is Old Joe(Andy Griffith), who only gets along with one of the waitresses...Jenna. The other waitresses are played by Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Shelly, who is also the movies writer and director. Jenna's life changes drastically when she gives birth to her daughter Lulu. Starting a little slow, WAITRESS moves into super glide and is worth its weight in Blue Plate Specials.",Waitress
9,sunwarrior13,Adrienne Shelly's Film Legacy,10,7 September 2012,"Waitress is a comedy-drama film written and directed by Adrienne Shelly, who also appears in a supporting role.Incidentally,it was the final film from actress/filmmaker.The movie debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah just months after the director was discovered dead in her New York City apartment -- the victim of a homicide.Keri Russell plays Jenna, a waitress living in the American South, who is trapped in an unhappy marriage with the abusive Earl,played by Jeremy Sisto. She works in Joe's Pie Diner, where her job includes creating inventive pies with unusual titles inspired by her life, such as the ""Bad Baby Pie"" she invents after her unwanted pregnancy is confirmed. Jenna longs to run away from her dismal marriage, and is slowly accumulating money to do so. She pins her hopes for escape on a pie contest in a nearby town, which offers a $25,000 grand prize, but her husband won't let her go. Her only friends are coworkers Becky and Dawn ,and Joe, the curmudgeonly owner of the diner and several other local businesses, who encourages her to begin a new life elsewhere.Jenna's life changes after she meets her new physician, Jim Pomatter,portrayed by Nathan Fillion.She fears that her dreams are all but dead when handsome Dr. Pomatter reveals that she is soon to become a mother. As Jenna begins penning a series of letters to her unborn baby, her life starts to change for the better in ways she never could have imagined. Adrienne Shelly's lasting legacy is this exquisite, engaging film about slices of life.The performances are more than satisfactory as Keri Russell is luminous as Jenna and Jeremy Sisto plays excellent as her abusive husband as he was able to make his abhorrent character relatable.Obviously,it is a small movie set in a small town, and features actors who were most famous for parts on the small screen. but nevertheless,it also just happens to be one of the more entertaining movies of the year.",Waitress
10,jotix100,Let them eat pie,7,22 February 2009,"It is a tribute to the creator of this film, Adrienne Shelley, that she left such wonderful memories with this viewer. Firstly, when we discovered her in the early Hal Hartley's films. She was a dynamo; she packed such strength in her tiny body that she loomed bigger than life in most of her screen appearances. We also had the opportunity to catch her in one of her rare theatre appearances at the Ohio theatre in New York in a play that wasn't that great, but every time she was on stage, Ms. Shelley projected a fantastic intelligence and wit.""Waitress"" was a labor of love for Adrianne Shelley. As a writer and director, she was generous to a fault. She always took a step back to let others shine, as is the case in this film. This film reflects how far she had gone in her work as well as the bright future she had ahead of her. All that, alas, was taken away from Ms. Shelley in a senseless moment by a deranged mind.The best thing in the film is Keri Russell, who as Jenna gives a good performance. Nathan Fillion is seen as Dr. Pomatter, a confused individual who loses his head when he meets Jenna. Jeremy Sisto appears as Jenna's abusive husband Earl. Cheryl Hines, Andy Griffith, Eddy Jemison and Ms. Shelley complete the supporting cast.Even though Adrienne Shelley is not with us, she'll live forever through the films in which she appeared. Let's hope she's smiling at us from heaven.",Waitress
11,writers_reign,Humble Pie,8,11 August 2007,"It's difficult - though not impossible - to be critical of a film when you know going in that the writer/director was murdereed shortly before its release. Essentially this is the kind of film you're able to enjoy even whilst notching up its flaws. Essentially Adrienne Shelley's mantra is 'aren't men beasts' and there's nothing wrong with that as a point of view, indeed, there is even more than a grain of truth in it but we part company in the way she stacks the deck by creating an Angelic character verging on the Saintly and saddling her with a Neanderthal husband. A girl as attractive and intelligent as Jenna wouldn't stay with a control freak like Earl for five minutes in the real world, let alone rushing to prostrate herself beneath his foot every time he yells 'heel', and a guy like Earl, who shows no sign of having anything resembling an IQ couldn't possibly earn enough money (significantly we are never told what he actually DOES for a living) to own such a well-appointed house, car, etc, at a relatively early age. As noted, however, these flaws don't get in the way of the simple pleasures of an undemanding chick flick in which (almost) everybody lives happily ever after.",Waitress
12,lastliberal,As sweet as strawberry pie. Yum!,7,29 June 2008,"I couldn't get the song ""Ya Never Know Just 'Oo You're Gonna Meet"" out of my mind. You can hear it in Sherlock Holmes ""Dressed to Kill,"" but it basically says to always look your best because you never know. That is the thing that is so recurring throughout this film. You just never know who someone will find attractive, even if everyone else thinks they are mean, or a grouch, or whatever. That is, except for Jenna's husband, Earl (Jeremy Sisto). The only song that fits him is Goodbye Earl by the Dixie Chicks.You can't really call this movie a comedy, but there were a few moments of mirth. It almost defies the description romantic, as the romance appeared tragic. I just call it a fun movie that makes you appreciate good acting and writing and directing.Keri Russell was fantastic. Andy Griffith was perfect. Adrienne Shelly, writer and director, is a tragic loss to movie making.It is probably not a movie that a guy should like, but I did, if nothing else to see all the wonderful pies. Yum!",Waitress
13,george.schmidt,Wonderful slice of life romantic dramedy; sweet as pie; a fitting legacy for Shelly,9,3 May 2007,"WAITRESS (2007) ***1/2 Keri Russell, Nathan Fillion, Cheryl Hines, Jeremy Sisto, Andy Griffith, Adrienne Shelly, Eddie Jemison, Lew Temple, Darby Stanchfield. Bittersweet romantic dramedy about the titular young woman (Russell in an affectively tart and tangy performance) whose unwanted pregnancy fuels her desire to leave her miserable marriage to a n abusive lout (Sisto) - whose only solace is her penchant for baking creatively inspired pies showcased at her diner - and winds up falling in love with her new ob-gyn Fillion (amiably sexy nice guy). Energized with a spry and witty ensemble including Hines as her best friend and fellow waitress providing some much needed sass and sensibility; artful codger Griffith as the small town impresario and owner of the restaurant she works in; and Shelley, who wrote and directed this wonderful slice of life smartly executed and poignantly underscored in no short measure to the tragic real-life undercurrent (Shelly was murdered several months prior to the film's release); this is a divine final chapter to her indie legacy and she should be honored for delivering a heartfelt labor of love; one last bit of trivia : that's Shelly's real-life toddler daughter in the coda. One of the year's best films.",Waitress
14,evanston_dad,Strengths Mostly Outweigh Weaknesses,7,2 January 2008,"This hit and miss comedy has an inherent poignancy because of the fact that its writer and director, Adrienne Shelley, was murdered before the film was released. Not knowing all of the details about her life or death, I can't help but wonder if this story about an insecure waitress who dreams of a life away from her loutish husband and dull existence was in some ways the fantasy of Shelley herself. This makes me want to be lenient on the movie's faults, of which there are many.The biggest is the casting of Keri Russell in the lead role. She's a fine actress, but she doesn't fit the part. She's far too pretty and self-assured, and too much of a firecracker for so much of the movie, to understand why she's let herself settle for a husband and life that's way beneath her. And the film's resolution is too glib, and bordering on irresponsible. Obviously, Shelley, in her screenplay, was responding to the empowering act of becoming a mother that she no doubt felt in her own life (the daughter of Keri Russell's character in the movie is Shelley's real-life daughter), but to suggest that Russell's character could simply tell her husband to get out of her life without any ramifications rings completely false.But I am a fan of Nathan Fillion, who plays a doctor with whom Russell strikes up a heated affair, and he brings a lot of charm and charisma to the film. Cheryl Hines, who I can't stand on HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" is a breath of fresh air as one of Russell's fellow waitress friends (she's reminiscent of Flo from the film ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore""), and Shelley herself plays another, mousier, colleague. Andy Griffith also makes an appearance as a cranky but lovable old man.An honest effort whose strengths mostly outweigh its weaknesses.Grade: B+",Waitress
15,ferguson-6,Spontaneous Poetry,8,2 May 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. Very personal and intimate story from the very talented Adrienne Shelly. Ms. Shelly was tragically murdered before the film was released, but what a legacy and gift she left for her husband, daughter and film lovers.Keri Russell (""Felicity"") stars as Jenna, a fabulous pie maker who is a lost soul married to the world's worst husband - played brilliantly by Jeremy Sisto. She works at a diner with her two friends played wonderfully by the bubbly Cheryl Hines and the film's writer and director, Adrienne Shelly. The relationship between these three is very realistic, touching and entertaining. They love and cherish each other.Outstanding support from Eddie Jemison (""Ocean's Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen""), Nathan Fillian (""Serenity"") and the great Andy Griffith, who has some great lines and definitely should work more often!! Jemison's spontaneous poetry capture the heart of Ms. Shelly's character and Fillian's Dr. Pomatter shows Russell what it is like to be adored, rather than abused.This is not slick Hollywood film-making. It is quirky ... just like real life. These are characters, who for the most part, make the best of their situations. Every now and then, if we are lucky, we capture a moment of pure bliss ... whether it is in the selfless hug from another, or the miracle of childbirth. The script analyzes loneliness and bad relationships with a twist of humor and much insight.While it is heart-breaking that Ms. Shelly did not live to see the final product, we see her heart and soul on screen. And don't miss her real daughter (Sophie Ostrey) as Ms. Russell's 3 year old LuLu. This is a wonderful little film with some terrific moments and a nice message to enjoy your life.",Waitress
16,anaconda-40658,Russell Serves!,10,30 April 2015,"Waitress (2007): Dir: Adrienne Shelly / Cast: Keri Russell, Nathan Fillion, Cheryl Hines, Adrienne Shelly, Andy Griffith: Charming comedy about life's surprises and our ability to make a difference to others. Keri Russell plays a waitress whose imagination allows her to bake pies based upon any state of emotion or feeling. She is pregnant but wants nothing to do with her possessive and abusive husband. When she is referred to a new doctor an affair begins. Director Adrienne Shelly was sadly taken from us upon completion of this film. This is a film to be proud of and allows film goers to reflect upon Shelly on an extremely high note. Russell is solid giving detailed verbal voice over commentary regarding pies and her state of mind. While she counters her husband with an affair, it is how she eventually deals with it that is priceless. Nathan Fillion is amusing as her new doctor. He is not satisfied within his marriage and discovers a fresh start with Russell, which is halted by evaluation. Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Shelly play waitresses who support Russell. They provide a great deal of comic relief and allow Russell a potential way out of her misery. Andy Griffith steals moments as a customer who ends up providing a key element that allows Russell to excel forward. Excellent drama comedy with a strong theme serves up a message of growth, responsibility and freedom. Score: 10 / 10",Waitress
17,gradyharp,'Tis the gift to be simple...,8,28 November 2007,"On the surface WAITRESS is a simple, honest, unpretentious, funny, tender, and sensitive film about simple people in a small Southern town: it is the core of the film, the examination of individual's choices, consequences, rights, and fraternity that makes the little Indie so special. And another feature that adds a dimension of significance to the movie is that actress/writer/director Adrienne Shelly did not live to see the magic she created: Shelly was murdered in November 2006, a loss of a superb budding talent.Using a very small cast of characters WAITRESS takes place in a Pie Diner, owned by the crusty and demanding Old Joe (Andy Griffith), managed by the grumpy Cal (Lew Temple), and run by three waitresses - frumpy little Dawn (Adrienne Shelly) looking for love, been-there-done-that Becky (Cheryl Hines) whose married to a drooling waste, and Jenna (Keri Russell), an unhappily married (to Earl - Jeremy Sisto) pie maker expert who longs to leave her marriage but has just discovered she is pregnant. She comes under the care of the OB-GYN Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion - also married) and in the course of her care the two fall in love. How Jenna manages to cope with the disruptive pregnancy and the other waitresses deal with their simple lives is the crux of the story. And while this simple plot lone doesn't appear to offer much, the manner in which it is written and acted makes is a little jewel.Many are touting the emergence of Keri Russell as a serious actress as the reason for seeing this film, but the real genius behind the honest simplicity of the story is the sadly deceased Adrienne Shelly. She will be missed. In a series of fitting homages the featurettes add to the DVD version of this film. Grady Harp",Waitress
18,zetes,"Sweet, fun, and lovable. With at least one deadly flaw.",8,27 May 2007,"A flawed but lovable little indie comedy about an unhappily married waitress and pie-making genius (Keri Russell) who begins an affair with her gynecologist (Nathan Fillion) after discovering that she's pregnant. Let's get the film's biggest flaw out of the way first: Russell's husband (Jeremy Sisto) is such a tremendously despicable character that he feels like he was just written to be hissed at. And I actually heard people hissing. Surely people as cruel and as ape-like as this man exist, but in the film it feels so easy and obvious that I ended up becoming enraged whenever he would pop up on screen. Really, if this character had been toned-down, or at least if he didn't have so much screen time, this would have been a shoo-in for my top 10 list this year. After the husband, the only other fault I could find is that it ends a tad too patly. Otherwise, I pretty much loved this movie. I love the quirky dialogue, and the comic performances are just perfect. Russell's and Fillion's initially awkward relationship is especially hilarious. And there are wonderful supporting performances by the director herself, Cheryl Hines and Andy Griffith (so nice to have him still around, although with an actor that age you can guess what happens to him in the end!). Of course the film can hardly be mentioned without bringing up Adirenne Shelly's tragic death. She was murdered this past November. It felt especially sad after the film was over. Waitress was such a lovely confection, you just want more.",Waitress
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Waitress,7,9 September 2007,"The late writer-director Adrienne Shelly's Waitress is a fine quirky film. But I have to admit one of the prime reasons for my catching this movie, is that it stars Keri Russell. Somehow I didn't find her all that attractive during her Felicity days, but my, how have things changed, and her very short role in M:I:III was somewhat a pity. Here, she plays the lead role as Jenna, a waitress at a pie diner, who's secretly wishing to save enough money to get away from a miserable life.And what a miserable life that is. Stuck in an unhappy marriage, her life is the home to work to home cycle, putting up with customers in the diner, but worse, having to tolerate her husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto) and his nonsense. A possessive, insecure man, he controls Jenna, even as ridiculous as the things she has to say to him, and makes life an emotional, and sometimes physical hell for her. Your blood will just boil when you see the kind of treatment he dishes out, especially the miscellaneous blackmailing techniques.But Jenna's thoughts and plans of escape get put on hold as she becomes pregnant. And having secret desires with a newcomer doctor Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion of Serenity) just happens to complicate things, not that he's a good looker, but finally here's someone who lends a listening ear, but wait, is also married! The story dwells upon life in general, and the choices and decisions one makes, and I thought for a moment it nearly gone into Little Children territory.Waitress contains a lot of charm, in having the good looking leads in Keri Russell and Nathan Fillion play off each other. Those into bakery will also be smiling at the numerous pies that Jenna bakes, whose ingredients and inspiration come from her life situations and events. Andy Griffith, whom I have watched as a boy his television series Matlock, lends himself to a role as Old Joe, who owns the pie diner, a fussy man who dictates his every wish at the diner, but one who also dispenses invaluable everyday life advice to Jenna when she needed it most. But as much as I like the many characters in the movie, I still take my hat off to Jeremy Sisto's Earl, as the asshat husband. Those who behave like he does ought to be ashamed, and it's a constant reminder never to degenerate into a complete prick like he is.It makes a wonderful date movie this week, even though it's not a romance movie per se and is heavy on dialogue. But definitely one of the major issues raised and as observed here, is for the guys to take stock of our behaviour when dealing with our loved ones. This, despite Waitress being a chick flick.",Waitress
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,"So sweet, hard not to fall in love with Waitress",8,4 December 2007,"When I saw the trailer for Waitress earlier this year, it looked like the big yawn or something that would be more average. Especially since we have not seen Kerri Russell for a while. But I saw this movie at Hollywood Video and decided to go ahead and check it out and I watched this movie tonite and I actually enjoyed Waitress very much. I think because it was one of the most realistic stories I have seen in a while, it wasn't over or under done. Kerri Russell did an absolute terrific job of her character, Jenna, she was truly a tragic, yet uplifting character. She was so beautiful and charming, she brought Jenna to life, I know this is saying a bit much, but I wouldn't give it a surprise look if I saw her for a nomination during Oscar time. Waitress is one of the year's most uplifting stories of the year.Jenna is a waitress in a small town where her pies are just the envy of everyone. She wants to enter a pie contest to win a twenty five thousand dollar prize and it seems promising, but one problem, she's now pregnant, and her husband, Earl is such a scum bag and treats her like dirt. But when the new hot doctor is in town who is taking care of her pregnancy, they start an affair. Things seem like they would be be getting better, but Jenna doesn't know how to be happy once again, until she realize the little joy that is growing inside her.Waitress is a terrific film, I highly recommend it. It was very well written and has wonderful performances. Kerri Russell was lovely and reminds me of those old time actresses. I think my favorite part was when she has her first kiss with the doctor, just it was so random, it was passionate, yet funny, also steamy. She and Nathan Fillinian played the chemistry so perfectly, especially in their kitchen scene, it was beautiful. Waitress was a charming comedy and I wouldn't mind seeing it again, I was surprised and definitely glad that I gave this film a chance.8/10",Waitress
21,lasttimeisaw,Waitress,6,23 January 2012,"Director/writer/actress Adrienne's jinxed misfortune (she was killed in a burglary at home) before releasing her second film in 2006 took on a critically unanticipated hype for this indie drama-comedy, starring a haplessly chirpy Keri Russell as the waitress and pie-baker, engrossed over 19 million dollars on the domestic box-office (versus its $2,000,000 budget). I was prejudiced to expect a comedic girl-gone-independent rousing story thanks to the bright-colored poster, multi-montages of garish pies, the risible characters (Hines and Shelly, two co-worker at the pie diner). But soon it was exposed that the film takes on a rather weighty route to probe a matter-of-fact escapism of Keri's character, Jenna's birth (with a new baby on her way) and rebirth (her own life) plan, opening her own pie diner and leaving his fiendish- tempered husband. Apart from all the emotional empathy towards Adrienne, the film calls upon a solid soap-opera plot wisdom to embroider Jenna a down-to-earth plight till an energy- accumulated outburst strikes back to take reprisal for all the miseries she has and also be feasible to a blithe ending. The film certainly possesses its own appeal to a more female-inclined demography, partial because of its not-so-subtle feminism by manufacturing a loathsomely sadistic husband, an adorable but weak-willed married gynecologist as the tryst fantasy, also a wealthy but eccentric old geezer who Jenna befriends with (no spoilers alert, also to render some explicable getaway for the revitalization of her new-born life and baby). Keri Russell acts in her comfort zone and by far it is her best work to widen her realm as a leading character, it's a shame that her recent films are not so-well-received, she is in my top 10 list of BEST ACTRESS in 2007, also R.I.P.

22,KineticSeoul,Decent feel good movie about a struggling waitress,7,12 March 2011,"When I first read about this movie I was slightly hyped to watch it. It just seemed like a really good feel good movie, and it didn't really meet my expectation but it's still a decent movie. The movie is basically about relationships and making pie and that almost sums up the movie, but the direction is joyous and done pretty well. Keri Russell put on a excellent performance in this and the way she talks and acts is intriguing to watch. She is sort of cute and lovable in this movie and likable because of it, so I couldn't help but have sympathy for her character. When it comes to the comedy it isn't really funny or anything, but it's still a bright and somewhat touching movie. Mainly because of the main protagonist who tries to overcome her struggles by making pies, which by the way made me get a big appetite for pies. The main problem I have with this movie is that there isn't enough going on and that just sort of made me lose interest in the movie few times. But this movie is basically character driven and focuses on the life of a struggling waitress who makes the best pies and it's sort of engaging since you care for this character. I mean she isn't all that interesting or anything, but still a lovable character. This is a pretty good feel good movie but nothing all that great and didn't really beat my expectations. It's worth renting if there isn't other movies you really want to watch and it's nothing really amazing, just a decent feel good movie.7/10",Waitress
23,Buddy-51,innate charm overcomes inconsistent tone,6,13 August 2009,"Ever since she was a little girl, Jenna (Keri Russell) has been concocting world-class pie recipes - a different pie, in fact, for every mood and occasion that life has to offer. Now, in her thirties, she finds herself stuck working as a waitress in somebody else's pie shop and trapped in a loveless marriage to a domineering and physically abusive lout named Earl. And, oh yes, she also happens to be pregnant.This is the set-up for ""Waitress,"" a slick, low-budget independent romantic comedy that was one of the genuine sleeper hits of 2007. It is also the movie that marked the final work of the gifted writer/director/co-star Adrienne Shelley who was tragically murdered by a burglar about six months prior to the release of the film.That morbid taint notwithstanding, ""Waitress"" is a generally amiable comedy that, despite its small town New England setting and naturalistic performances, isn't always as genuine and authentic as it needs to be to be effective. The scenes between Jenna and her fellow waitresses (Shelley, Cheryl Hines) do have the ring of ""girl talk"" truth about them, but those involving Jenna and the dreamy young pediatrician who's just set up his practice in town come across as pure Hollywood contrivance and hokum.Russell has warmth and appeal as the deeply unhappy and conflicted Jenna, and she receives excellent support from Shelley and Hines as her encouraging and understanding co-workers and friends. Nathan Fillion, however, makes for a rather bland love interest as the gallant and gorgeous - albeit married - Doctor Pomatter, while the truly talented Jeremy Sisto (""Six Feet Under"") struggles under the weight of a poorly written part as Jenna's irredeemably smarmy and churlish husband - a character that's at least a half a dozen shades too dark for a comedy as innocuous and lighthearted in tone as this one is. In fact, one of the major weaknesses in the script is its insistence on seeing its main male characters in two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional terms. Of the actors, though, it is the venerable Andy Griffith who steals every scene he's in as the crusty but wise owner of the diner who sets Jenna straight on a thing or two regarding how she's choosing to live her life.There's a nice fairy tale ending to leave you feeling uplifted and good about life - which is just about all one really asks for from a film such as this one, I guess.Be forewarned, however: this movie is not recommended for anyone who is on a strict diet or who is in any way serious about reducing calories.",Waitress
24,cherold,Never quite connects,5,3 September 2008,"Waitress is a perfectly decent movie that can't manage to rise above decent. It has some fine moments in it - a very funny exchange between Dawn and her ""stalker elf"" and a lovely moment when Jenna gives birth - and it is visually striking, but for the most part the movie seems just a touch too slow and a little too false.This is probably main a result of a bland performance by Keri Russel, who fails to imbue the role with the fragile charm and sadness the part requires, and Adrienne Shelly's script, which is full of rather dull conversations.It's not a bad movie, it's just a very ordinary one.",Waitress
25,Robert_duder,An unfortunately dull look at life straight out of the trailer park...but did we want to see it?,4,12 December 2007,"There wasn't anything particularly wrong with Waitress except that there wasn't anything particularly right. It was dull, plain and simple. Maybe it's the fact that I see people like this from this film every day and I don't find it entertaining but it's a very uninteresting story about a bunch or low moralled, disturbingly foolish trailer park red necks getting in each other's way and screwing up their lives. The characters are almost interesting but never really get any sort of story going so that you care what happens to any of them. It's not like it's torture watching them or the movie but you just don't have any reason to keep watching. It's boring and slow moving and you don't care what happens to any one of them. There is some sort of muddled romance that never takes off despite some decent chemistry and performances between the leads, the romance is not a romance at all but some sort of half baked lust filled affair. I get that director and writer (also co-star) Adrienne Shelly was trying to do something unique and different and interesting but it bombs on all three counts and I would have thought something written and directed by a seemingly talented woman who is not new to writing, directing, or acting would create something women would appreciate with a strong female lead and instead its dirty and vulgar and rather insulting to any self respecting female.Terrific actress (still looking for a truly big break I think) Keri Russell does her very best with what she is given. Unfortunately her character is not likable, kind of sleazy, foolish and straight from the trailer. I don't blame Russell or her performance but rather the story and the direction and the script which is lame. Russell does her best. She has a terrific knack for playing girl next door, down to earth type roles but this isn't her best. (Check her out in August Rush or even Mission Impossible 3.) Jeremy Sisto might be the only one who gets kudos for trying to do something good with his character...the completely unlikable slob of a husband Earl. At first you don't really see anything wrong with Earl except that Russell's character can't stand him. This is also a fault with the story because it should be established early on that he's an ass. But as it unfolds you see his behavior and why she hates him. Sisto turns in a very different performance than what he's used to and does well at it. He is also good for a few (very few) laughs in the film mostly at his expense. Nathan Fillion, another actor I have come to respect a great deal, does his best as the local doctor Pomatter who becomes enamored with Russell's character while he is her OBGYN. Disturbing?? Yah a little. Fillion and Russell have chemistry but it doesn't matter because their relationship if you want to call it that is disturbing and completely wrong. You can't get past that. Andy Griffith (however they got him to do this) makes a small cameo role as the owner of the diner and he's fun to watch and makes the film that much better with him in it.I'm not trying to be over sensitive or say something is inappropriate because of content...I don't wanna be the red tape guy...but the film had no back bone or worthy concept except to show this group of unintelligent people doing really stupid things and it was like painfully watching real life and that's not fun or entertaining and it certainly wasn't artistic. There just wasn't any rhyme or reason for any of it. So in saying all that why score it at all? Well the actors did decently with what they were given. Nobody was particularly heinous at their part. Also the film was somehow watchable, it wasn't painful to watch, just boring. In fact my girlfriend used the word ""cute"" to describe it so maybe I'm being too harsh but I wouldn't ever choose to sit through it again. Steer clear of this one unless you want to see for yourself but there isn't much to see unfortunately. This was nominated for some kind of awards?? Hmm weird. 4/10",Waitress

I enjoyed the quirky characters and the way they spoke, but all that southern charm couldn't cover up the fact that everyone was cheating on their spouses, which made it difficult to root for any of their relationships-and that caused the overall story to suffer.

28,inkblot11,There's no gratuity large enough to offer Miss Shelley for this wonderful film!,9,26 May 2007,"Jenna (Keri Russell) is a waitress in a Southern restaurant called Joe's Pie Diner. She is a champion pie maker and greatly adds to the diner's appeal with her mouthwatering confections. Unfortunately, she is married to an abusive husband named Earl (Jeremy Sisto) and finds herself pregnant to boot. Her fellow waitresses (Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Shelley herself) are sympathetic, as is the diner's owner, Joe (Andy Griffith). As abortion is not an option, Jenna schedules herself for an examination with the doctor. Much to her surprise, there is a new physician in town, taking the place Jenna's normal M.D. He is a wonderfully kind and thoughtful man who truly listens to Jenna's wishes. Although he is married, he becomes smitten with Jenna and visa versa, and they begin to see each other. But, what if the young waitress's husband finds out or the doctor's wife? There is also a pie baking contest in the region that Jenna would love to win but, will her husband allow her to attend the bake-off? This is a lovely and very funny movie with a big heart. The characters are very believable and show off humanity at its best and its worst. Russell is outstanding as Jenna, a lovely lady, with a bevy of problems, who rises above her situation. The other actors are also quite wonderful, from Sisto's despicable husband to Griffith's cranky diner owner to Shelley's shy, lovelorn waitress. The production looks gorgeous, with nice costumes, beautiful Southern scenery, nice cinematography, and more. Yet, it is the great script and marvelous direction, all by Shelley, that are most impressive. Alas, Shelley was murdered shortly after the film was completed. What a great loss to the world! Imagine Woody Allen dying after Bananas and you can understand how much sorrow her death brings. That said, we still have this great movie to cherish forever, for there is not a big enough gratuitiy in the universe to thank Shelley for this film.",Waitress
29,tabuno,Different and Nice,8,21 January 2019,"11 June 2007. Waitress has a charm all its own. The balance between comedy and drama has been accomplished without the traditional fancy one-liners but with more finesse of actual life performances, brilliantly performed by Keri Russell, an award nominating role and acting job. The drama is well played by Jeremy Sisto in an unsympathetic role and except for the ultimate direction Keri and Jeremy take in a somewhat oversimplified scripted episode, their relationship and performances are excellent. The lightness and the comedy that intersperse this small, intimate film about a wife burdened with a selfish husband and living a life as a waitress who loves to bake pies and discovers that she is pregnant is a meaningful film about facing up to one's responsibilities and dreams.

It's hard to watch this comedy without feeling a sense of sadness over the tragic, senseless death of director, writer, and co-star Shelly, who has fashioned a winning and touching film. Russell is well cast as the perpetually annoyed waitress while Fillion is likable as her nervous obstetrician. The scenes of them fooling around in the doctor's office are hilarious. Griffith is terrific as the owner of the restaurant, a salty old man with raging hormones. This enjoyable comedy will always stand as a tribute to the multi-talented Shelly.",Waitress
31,Red-125,A fairy tale with the wrong Prince Charming,7,30 June 2007,"""Waitress"" (2007) was written and directed by Adrienne Shelly, who also co-starred in the film. (Tragically, Ms. Shelly was killed on November 1, 2006, before the movie was released.)""Waitress,"" although billed as a romantic comedy, has serious undertones. Keri Russell plays Jenna, a waitress in a diner. The diner specializes in pies that Jenna makes. Jenna is an imaginative and extraordinary baker, and baking is her primary source of enjoyment. If this were a classic fairy tale, Jenna would be the princess and Earl (played brilliantly by Jeremy Sisto) would be the evil ogre. The problem is that the evil ogre also happens to be Jenna's controlling and abusive husband.The staff in the diner serve as Jenna's loyal friends, although all of them have their own problems. Andy Griffith plays the grouchy customer Joe, who in the fairy tale would be the fairy godmother or, in this case, the fairy godfather.Fortunately, there's a Prince Charming. Unfortunately, he's the wrong Prince Charming. Physicians in the audience will squirm in their seats when Jenna falls in love with her ob-gyn. (Maybe non-physicians will squirm as well, although people love the movie, so I guess they didn't squirm too much.)My suggestion is to see the film, but accept it for what it is--a fairy tale. It's set in a never-never land where nurses still wear caps and starched white uniforms, and if your heart is pure (and you look like Keri Russell) everything will work out in the end.",Waitress
32,MaxBorg89,"Bittersweet, touching and humorous: a rewarding swansong for Adrienne Shelly",8,23 August 2007,"It is a shame that writer-director-actress Adrienne Shelly was murdered shortly after completing this film (she was about to be told it had been admitted to the Sundance Festival). A shame, because Waitress, her third feature as a director, is one of the smartest independent pictures I've ever seen, meaning hers is a great loss, especially in an industry where female filmmakers aren't that popular (Jane Campion, Sofia Coppola and a few others notwithstanding).As suggested by the title, the movie is about a waitress: Jenna (Keri Russell) earns her living by baking delicious pies (to which she gives extremely original names) and thus ensuring the loyal customers remain loyal. Sadly, that is the only joyful thing about her life: she doesn't have that many friends, except for her colleagues Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn (played by Shelly), her boss isn't a very nice guy (fortunately the actual owner of the diner, portrayed by Andy ""Matlock"" Griffith, is kind enough to compensate) and her husband (Jeremy Sisto) is an abusive, excessively jealous jerk. On top of that, one day she finds out she is pregnant, which implies her plans to run away have been a complete waste of time (to express her feelings, she comes up with an ""I-don't-want-Earl's-baby"" pie). Her mood changes, though, once she meets the new town physician, Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), with whom she embarks on a forbidden but very gratifying romance, feeling sort of happy for the first time in many years.Achieving happiness: that is probably the film's most important theme, alongside infidelity and unwanted pregnancy (although abortion is never contemplated), which are dealt with in a surprisingly mature way, given the lightness of touch (the movie is rated PG-13). Through the character of Jenna, brought to life by a marvelous Russell, who should finally receive the recognition she deserves (her previous big-screen credits added up to nothing substantial aside from a minor part in Mission: Impossible III), the director conveys her own thoughts about life and its demands (she was pregnant while she wrote the screenplay), providing the audience with an accessible, yet not so optimistic, portrait of small-town life: the protagonist wants to leave her violent spouse (whom Sisto makes more human than expected, clearly drawing on his Six Feet Under experience) more than anything in the world, but she has no choice but to stay with him, also because if she ran away, she would never see her lover again and therefore be denied the only ""pleasant"" aspect of her existence. It is a very conflicting situation, and as long as Shelly focuses on that section of the film, she constantly hits the target.The same cannot be said of a couple of subplots she decides to explore: while her own character gets a solid treatment, Becky's love-life is hinted at and never mentioned again, despite spawning one of the picture's funniest scenes. The inclusion of Dr. Pomatter's wife feels equally pointless, as her one appearance seems to have the sole purpose of reminding everyone of the sinful nature of what is going on, only to deny her the opportunity to do something meaningful come the climax.Ah, the ending: that is probably the weakest link in the movie, partly because Griffith, the film's real soul, is largely missing in the entire third act, but also because the conclusion, though quite satisfactory, is not as sharp or heartfelt as the rest of the story had suggested.Nonetheless, Waitress has all the right tools to become 2007's Little Miss Sunshine: smart writing, spot-on acting and most of all an original vision, that of a woman who, unfortunately, wasn't given enough time to perfect her craft. What we have, however, is a solid enough testament to her passion and brilliance.",Waitress
33,mattkratz,brilliant,10,22 January 2008,"This was a remarkable film about second chances, redemption, and trying to figure out what's important in your like. (or at least that was how I interpreted it.) The movie stars Keri Russell as Jenna, who is trapped in an abusive marriage and in a seemingly dead-end job as a waitress in a pie restaurant. However, she is excellent at her job, as she constantly comes up with new pies at the diner. Her marriage takes a turn for the worse when she learns that she is pregnant. She doesn't want her abusive and controlling husband as a father.Other than that, things seem to be going fairly well. Her co-workers and diner owner are very supportive. She gets redemption when the handsome new doctor lends her support, and they start an affair.I think the movie was very well-made. I thought all the waitress characters were memorable, especially Jenna. I loved Andy Griffith's character of Old Joe, who at first seems cantankerous and grumpy but turns out to be a marvelous person.This movie is a must-see.

34,EUyeshima,"The ""I-Think-I've-Seen-This-Before-But-I-Still-Liked-It-a-Lot"" Pie",8,20 December 2007,"This agreeably idiosyncratic 2007 dramedy has plenty to offer and includes some great moments of warmth and humor, but its eccentricities sometimes threaten to overwhelm the quiet, slightly fantastical story at the heart of the film. Fortunately, actress Adrienne Shelly shows a supple dexterity in balancing all the off-kilter elements since she wrote and directed the film. Sadly, this would also be her last film as she was murdered shortly before its debut at this year's Sundance Festival. I was previously not familiar with Shelly's work either before or behind the camera, but the uniquely fresh perspective on display here makes her loss as a film-making creative force feel all the more tragic.The plot concerns the travails of Jenna, a waitress at Joe's Pie Diner. Stuck in a loveless marriage to an abusive, childish man named Earl, she finds herself unhappily pregnant with his child and dreams of escaping her dreary life. Since her accumulated tip money is not nearly enough for her to leave, Jenna wants to enter a local pie-making contest with a grand prize of $25,000. At the diner, she shows a unique talent for creating unusual pies, and inspired by the events in her life, she makes and names a new one every day. Her best friends are the two other waitresses at the diner - sassy, breast-imbalanced Becky and vacuous, pasty-skinned Dawn, which makes the set-up feel like Martin Scorsese's ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" (or more accurately the sitcom it spawned). There is even a character named old Joe, the bromide-spouting owner of the diner dispensing nuggets of unsolicited advice to Jenna. Further complicating matters is the town's new gynecologist, the befuddled and sensitive Dr. Pomatter, and what happens after he and Jenna meet becomes inevitable.The story doesn't take many surprising turns, especially when it is clear from the outset that we are following Jenna's bumptious journey toward self-fulfillment. However, what Shelly does extremely well is add her own sense of local color and realistic character development to the potentially cliché-ridden situation. The result is often funny, sometimes poignant and at certain points, intentionally absurd. With her porcelain doll looks and previously passive demeanor, Keri Russell would seem like a shallow choice to play Jenna, but she surprises by giving a fully dimensional and affecting performance. Her best scenes are early on as her quietly desperate situation is being established. The other actors provide solid support. Nathan Fillion provides a nicely disheveled charm to the smitten Pomatter, although his character is developed more as a fantasy figure. More interesting is Jeremy Sisto as Earl, who is at turns, dangerous and pathetically needy. Sisto plays him with such simmering menace that it's hard to believe the actor played Jesus in a 1999 miniseries (featuring Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene!).Playing the saucy ""Flo""-type waitress, Cheryl Hines provides expert comic support as Becky, while Shelly herself plays Dawn with quirky, bespectacled vulnerability. As old Joe, Andy Griffith shows up periodically to comment on what's going on. The film's atmospheric elements are first-rate starting with Matthew Irving's cinematography (the brightly colored finale has a fairytale feeling thanks to his expert camera-work) and a clever soundtrack sweetened by a lullaby written by Andrew Hollander and Shelly. The 2007 DVD comes with a standard set of extras including an informative commentary track by Russell and producer Michael Roiff. The ten-minute making-of featurette, ""This is How We Made Waitress Pie"", is mainly a series of on-set clips and interviews that look directed toward a press junket. There is a brief memorial tribute of sorts to Shelly, though the treatment feels cursory and elusive given the graphic circumstances of her death. Rounding out the extras are a profile on Russell's approach to the role of Jenna and a more superficial featurette about everyone's favorite pies.",Waitress
35,aharmas,One Remarkable Treat for the Heart,10,1 June 2007,"One of the most pleasurable aspects of ""Waitress"" is seeing how lovable its main star is. Had Keri Russell not done such a terrific job in this film, and had she not been so lovingly photographed here, the film would have been only half successful. This is not take any credit away from the perceptive script by Shelly, which explores whatever mysteries shape the relationships among people. It never becomes quirky or underdeveloped. It is pretty much like the creative metaphors displayed in the film, as pie after pie, reflect Jenna's mood.The story is deceptively simple, as this suffering young man is unable to break free from a routine that is slowly killing her spirit as a stiffling husband abuses her constantly, and a rather unexpected suitor brings more complications into her life. What we don't expect is the constant creative developments that take the viewers to a great conclusion. We bond with Jenna from the beginning and root for her, hoping everything will turn out o.k., but knowing that it possibly won't happen.What this enchanting film gives us is a sweet treat and a nice break from the bloated special effects monsters that we have been tortured with lately. ""Waitress"" gives us plenty of heart, very intelligent lines, and much respect for an audience that yearns for a logical story with likable and believable situations in the real world. Here no storyline is neglected or padded with unnecessary distractions. What matters in this small, yet powerful film is the understanding of the human heart and its contradictions when confronted with apparent logical choices.Russell is likely to walk away with at least a nomination later in the year because it is her performance that anchors the film. She is heartbeat that pumps life into a universe we are rarely exposed to in the movies anymore: that of the real world, a world that needs a hearty dose of love, care, and respect... after all, what do you think makes anything special?",Waitress

What separates it out from the herd though it tackles several hard issues: falling in love while married, being married to a pig of a man (and that's mildly) yet never descending into heavy drama or frightening the viewer: the emphasis is rather on the strength of women, their strength to endure, to find the comedy in that, and this makes it a romantic treat without being slushy or smutty.A clever device of using pie recipes emotes the inner voice, the restaurant is the crossroads of a host of lives, and the gentle Southern setting (A little too Southern in places) all add a candy floss atmosphere.It has a kind heart and a light touch, but it is lifted way of its weight class by a wonderful ending - and is recommended on that basis alone.

It's hard to get it right, but here it's done perfectly. It's the story about Jenna (Keri Russell) a small-town waitress who gets pregnant by her abusive husband, and all she wants is to win a pie baking contest and run away.I'm not very similar to the character of Jenna, and yet it's as if she was written for me. I love how strong her character is, both in terms of the writing and in her ability to survive her current circumstances to get to a better life. But don't forget her talent for creating pies in her head based on what she's feeling and thinking. I also predict that the starring role by Keri Russell and the supporting performance by Andy Griffith will go down as the most underrated.The film deals with some very dark story lines - an abusive husband, an unwanted pregnancy, and some inappropriate indiscretions, and I laughed most of the way through (spare a few tears). It's a tough line to walk, but the film does it with heart. Take this as a warning if it might offend you.""Waitress"" touched me in a way that no other film has. Every time I watch it, it inspires me to find exactly what I want and to strive for a better life. It really is that good to me.",Waitress
41,Terrell-4,A pleasant excursion into pie-making and determination,7,27 January 2008,"Can a poor, pregnant Deep South waitress find happiness baking pies while married to a redneck bully and having an affair with her married gynecologist? No. But don't count on an unhappy ending once she leaves her husband, sends her lover back to his wife and then, thanks to a fortuitous death, manages to bake pies to her heart's content, and sell them, too. Waitress is an eccentric and affectionate look at the life and times of Jenna, played with great empathy and charm by Keri Russell. Jenna is a small-town young woman who married her boyfriend, Earl, and now realizes what a jerk he is. She wants out, with a new life and another chance at happiness. What she doesn't want is Earl or, at first, the baby. Getting it on with the new, young doctor perhaps isn't the best idea, but it gives Jenna some joy. About the only people who really appreciate her are her two friends who also wait on tables at the diner, and the old curmudgeon, played by Andy Griffin, who owns the place and wants what he wants when he wants it...namely, a slice of Jenna's special pie, served by Jenna. Jenna's pies really are deliciously unique. Her mamma taught her long ago, and now Jenna works out all her frustrations and love by inventing all sorts of pies. Despite her pies, her life looks increasingly bleak until...well, see the movie or buy the DVD. It's no spoiler to say that this slightly contrived, oddball romantic comedy has a happy ending, and that pies are the reason. The nice things about the movie are Russell's performance, closely followed by Griffin's. The writer/director, Adrienne Shelly, who also plays one of Jenna's waitress pals, gives the movie a kind of goofy cheer. The movie isn't a cartoon, but there is enough cheerful exaggeration that most of the time Waitress comes across as kind of charming. A bit off-putting, however, is the role of Earl. The guy is so down-right mean and selfish that every time he shows up on screen you'll most likely flinch. Jenna's doctor, on the other hand, comes across just as needy as Earl but also weak. If one of Shelly's messages is that a woman who needs to be strong shouldn't get entangled with most men, she gives us some first- class examples. Jenna is going to be a happy woman, we know, because of a generous bequest, her pies and her baby. I'm not sure an adult male now will ever figure in the mix. Waitress is the kind of feel-good movie that many people will fall in love with. I'm not sure how many times someone will want to watch it, but the first time, if you're not in a curmudgeonly mood, should be satisfying. And for those who occasionally think life is a series of random acts of pointlessness, Adrienne Shelly was murdered just as she was finishing the editing of Waitress. She had been in her office and had complained about the noise a worker on the floor above her was making. He came down and killed her.",Waitress
42,jaredmobarak,I'm happy enoughWaitress,6,30 May 2007,"I'm not sure whether my wanting to see Waitress was due to its off-kilter humor, shown via its trailer, or because of the horrible tragedy surrounding writer/director/supporting actress Adrienne Shelly. Her murder definitely overshadows the dreamlike comedy she has left behind as her final foray in Hollywood. This is a tale of a poor girl dragging through life, desperately looking for a way out. As far as style goes, I can only think of Edward Scissorhands as having the same hyper-real environment filled with quirky characters and fantastical sequences grounded in reality. There is a definite fairytale quality at work here and, if anything, that lightheartedness helps you enjoy what is on screen for what it is and not for being Shelly's final time in theatres.Keri Russell plays our lead rolea pie making genius whom is married to an emotionally abusive husband (if not physically) and spends time with her two older friends from the diner she is employed at. One fateful day brings her the news that she is pregnant, despite only making love to her husband once in the past six weeks. She despises the child for what it stands fora broken marriage and a bond to keep her from running away for good. Needing to make sure the child is healthy, she goes to the doctor, only to find a new resident physician. What starts as awkward flirting soon escalates into an affair and Russell's character finally sees some happiness at the end of her dark tunnel.The story is ultimately a simple one, yet it is told intelligently and with many eccentricities to keep a viewer's attention. Each change in emotion for Russell is soon followed by a comical interlude of a newly invented pie to help ease the tension. All the characters have a bit of country-bumpkin in them and their exchanges throughout are laced with a naïve seriousness to every single word uttered. Their inability to take what is said with a grain of salt just makes it funnier for the audience to laugh at the reactions to seemingly innocuous dialogue. Credit for this must go to Shelly for creating an environment on set for all the actors to feel comfortable enough to really believe in and encompass themselves with their roles. Russell is magnificent, and that says something because besides Mission Impossible 3, I can't even think of something else I have seen her in. She allows for all emotions to come out and never goes too far into camp or over-the-top flamboyancy. Shelly herself is perfect as the friend with low self-esteem and not so quick intelligence. The mousy façade and little girl smile seemed misplaced at first, but as the film continues on it becomes exactly what her character is. Jeremy Sisto gives a nice turn as the bad boyfriend, conveying the misplaced aggression as well as the insecurity and longing for love that manifests it. On the other hand, Nathan Fillion truly shines as the knight in shining armor doctor. His nervousness and awkward mannerisms show his feelings towards our lead. Both his and her smiles are infectious when they are together; the chemistry is effective to portray the bond they create, as well as the mirrored relationship to Russell and Sisto. Last, but not least, is Andy Griffith bringing the heart and soul to the film. His crotchety old man, hiding his real feelings inside, helps lead our heroine onto a path of happiness without regret. Their moments together bring a smile to your face.Although there was a lot to enjoy about the movie, the acting and humor especially, the film is not without many flaws. I am not quite sure on the timeline, but I wouldn't be surprised if Shelly had been killed before the final cut was edited. There is some strange pacing at times, grinding the action to unnecessary halts before going forward again, as well as awkward cuts. Whether it be the out of place quick cut to Sisto at the beginning or the abrupt transition from one scene to that of a wedding towards the end, the film seems a tad hacked up at times. Its moments of creativity are also somewhat out of place, if only because there are so few of them. The circular panning around a romantic embrace is utilized twice and an interesting bit of blurring to accentuate Russell in an end scene once. While fascinating techniques, their innovativeness is almost too risqué for what we have been witnessing.It is a shame that a review for Waitress must be weighed down with the tragedy surrounding it. There is a very good film hidden here, that may have shown through with a bit more editing and tightening. Had Shelly gone on, she might have rectified some problems after screenings and feedback. Instead we are given a very heartfelt story that shows how close to her it was. The film displays the promise of a filmmaker just hitting her prime; she could only have improved upon the talent she so obviously had. Just like the Tim Burton film I compared it to in tone at the start, this film ends bittersweetly yet realistically, (I applaud the fact that the fairytale happily-ever-after ending didn't seep in completely), but after everything there is a sense of hope and happiness that was missing in our lead's life at the start.",Waitress
43,sharky_55,"Baby don't you cry, gonna make a pie, gonna make a pie with a heart in the middle",8,4 February 2017,"Waitress has the kitschy, quirky eccentricity of a TV sitcom, and the musical cues to go along with it. When Jenna first throws herself into the arms of the new doctor, their tight embrace and kiss is accompanied by an operatic fanfare, and the world starts spinning around in giddy joy. On the opposite side of the spectrum are her nightmares of a naughty child's tantrum coming to life right before her eyes, with Wagner's Flight of the Valkyries accentuating her fears. When the relationship is finally consummated the world rushes past her as a big smile is plastered upon her face - the blooming romance is like a jolt of lightning to her modest, small town existence. True to the setting the characters all speak with hammy southern accents and a generous dose of droll sarcasm; they know they don't amount to much, but they know this and can also poke fun at themselves. Jenna Hunterson finds herself stuck in the middle of a waitress gradient - on the right is the blonde barbie doll that is Becky, and on the left Dawn, who is attractive but seldom shows it, and almost always hides herself behind Ugly Betty-style glasses. Jenna is the plain yet pretty one, and the pie whiz. Waitress fully acknowledges how music and food are valuable commodities that are passed down from generation to generation, and how for a lonely waitress they can be both comforting and an avenue to vent frustrations. Jenna isn't only good at making pies that taste delicious, she's also able to pack them full of character and feeling. The best of the zany comedy in Waitress comes from her aptly and often aggressively named pies that represent her current dilemma, whether its the confusions surrounding an affair or the worries of being a future mother. Her handiwork takes note; berries are pulverised, chocolate is smothered, fruitcake is smashed and mashed. The biggest obstacle in Jenna's path is her mean abuser of a husband, Earl. He's one of those typical deadbeat partners,and one of those husbands who feel the need to physically assert their relationship because they are insecure about its longevity. Earl says things like ""I feed you, I pay for the house. Do what I tell you, and I won't get mad."" A man in a loving marriage would never think of needing to spell this out and fish for gratitude. And yet, the film doesn't make him out to be a complete monster, and argues that even horrible people like Earl deserve better than to have their feelings hurt behind their back. That's expressed through a lovely sentiment from Andy Griffith as the diner owner, who begins initially as the familiar elderly oddball but secretly slips up now and again, reminding us that good advice can sometimes come from the most surprising sources. It is a testament to the writing that we agree with his every word, and yet still want Jenna to be swept off her feet by the fresh-faced, goofy doctor and to ride far away on the back of a stallion. Next to Earl's sweaty embraces, Doctor Jim is practically a knight in shining armour. Most rom-coms rarely have the nuance to be able to connect the main storyline of infidelity and ask the audience to also consider the side characters and their tricky affairs. The movie has a tragic undertone to its creation, in which writer/director Adrienne Shelly was murdered before she could see its acceptance into Sundance. One of her great personal achievements was to go through the full production whilst also juggling the same predicament of Jenna's - she wrote the script as she was 8 months pregnant, trying to confront her fears of impending motherhood and pondering the enormous pressures that society puts upon women when they do not act womanly (eg. not wanting to have and raise kids). It is her daughter Sophie who plays the young Lulu in the epilogue, bringing both story and reality full circle. What shines through is Shelly's determination and warmth directed at her career as well as her daughter - Jenna is struck with the same concerns, but she never allows others to dictate how she is meant to feel. We know through her actions and her pies that she is a good person, and also recognises that quality in those surrounding her. That is what enables her to do the right thing by breaking off the affair with Jim, and that is how she earns the happy ending.",Waitress
44,MrGKB,A bittersweet testament to a foreshortened career....,7,4 July 2008,"...""Waitress"" reminded me a great deal of ""Steel Magnolias,"" not only with its focus on its female leads, but also it's easy mix of pathos and humor, the ol' surefire ""you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss some bucks goodbye."" It's a chick flick for sure, but despite the somewhat biased treatment of its men, ""Waitress"" manages to charm with a down-home camaraderie, a screenplay that only rarely slips to sit-com levels, and performances, especially by the lusciously talented Keri ""Felicity"" Russell as Jenna, the titular lead, that were successfully inspired by the craft and dedication of the film's tragically deceased writer/director/actor, Adrienne Shelly. Not to be morbid, but the lady certainly went out on a high note, cooking up a zesty slice of life and strawberry love, to steal a metaphor or two. Russell gets strong support from the likes of Cheryl ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" Hines, Nathan ""Slither"" Fillion, Andy ""I was born the same day as Marilyn Monroe"" Griffith, Jeremy ""May"" Sisto, Lew ""Halloween 2007"" Temple, and Shelly herself; those viewers who appreciate quality ensemble work will definitely enjoy ""Waitress."" Amusingly, the fine camera-work is courtesy of Matthew Irving, who previously lensed ""Waiting..."", a food services comedy of much lower brow. All the production elements come together as perfectly as, well--a lovingly crafted pie; ""Waitress"" is a treat meant to go down easy and linger on your emotional taste buds. The nutritional values are simple and straightforward: stand up for yourself, go for your dreams, do the right thing. Russell's winning performance makes them all seem natural and inevitable, despite the incongruity of a thoroughly beautiful young woman being trapped by a menial job, an abusive, changeling husband, and an unexpected pregnancy in Mayberry, R.F.D. ""Waitress"" may be a thinly-disguised bodice-ripper, yet it somehow transcends itself. I look forward to seeing what her crew can posthumously do with Adrienne Shelly's last script.",Waitress
45,rupie,de mortuis nil nisi bonum,3,16 January 2008,"That is, for non-Latin speakers, ""speak not ill of the dead."" The circumstances of Adrienne Shelly's death are horrific, but one cannot let one's human sympathy for the departed impede an honest evaluation of her movie.I rented ""Waitress"" expecting much after reading so many adulatory reviews. I came away disappointed. I think I can see Shelly's intentions here, i.e. to make an intelligent comedy with a feminist message. Unfortunately, despite some good efforts by the actors and actresses, and a few sporadic flashes of good writing, in the end the whole effort collapses.Even in a comedy, characters have to be, at some level, believable. Not here. Earl is a cartoon drawing of a rotten husband, and Jenna's easy manipulation of him defies credibility, which you have to have, even in a comedy. Pity poor Andy Griffith (God bless him) playing here the archetypal curmudgeon-with-a-heart-of-gold (didn't you just know it, from the first encounter in the diner?). When Dawn (played by Shelly) meets El Dorko Grando Ogie for her ""five minute date', didn't you just know that despite the obvious ickiness they would wind up together? Everything is so predictable, except for the unbelievable ending when the miraculous ""empowerment"" provided by her newborn child ""enables"" her to somehow miraculously give her rotten husband the heave-ho. In what world - either real or comedic - does this happen?And please spare us the ""post-resolution"" clips at the end when, after all the plot niceties have been supposedly cleaned up, we are treated to film clip scenarios of the la-la happiness that supposedly was to ensue after what we just watched.The most enjoyable and creative part of the movie was the various pie recipes Jenna dreamed up, and their very descriptive titles. But that's not enough to relieve the tedium of 108 minutes. A critic I once read talked about films that can't make up their minds what they want to be. If this is supposed to be a comedy, it's not funny enough. If it's supposed to be feminist drama, it's not believable.",Waitress

47,bopdog,"Some good elements, but ultimately is nothing but a silly feminist rant.",5,18 June 2007,"The previews for 'Waitress' promised a well done, arty, indie kind of look into the world of a single, working class gal finding her way. Or someat. Her psycho-themed pies seemed funny. Each pie bearing the name of an act of desperate resolution to problems we all have faced at some time. Even the pies bearing these frustrations looked clever, exotic, and very, very good to eat as well. So what happened? Upon viewing, I had mixed feelings about this movie. Keri Russell is all grown up now, after TV's 'Felicity'. She is an appealing actor, with charm and beauty. Her performance here was very good, actually. Same could also be said of the other ladies, including writer/director Adrienne Shelly, who plays a substantial role as the girl buddy sidekick. I found nothing to dislike, and much to admire, in those portrayals.What was disturbing, and what gives the movie its amateurish flavor, is the portrayal of the male characters. Every single man in this movie was a complete prat. Each was either evil, such as the heroine's odious wife-beating husband, or a pathetic buffoon, such as Andy Griffith's character. Then there was the three-toothed hillbilly, Cal. Even the so-called romantic lead, the 'best' male in the cast, the love-interest doctor, was a confused, dithering loser.As an artistic choice of writer-director Adrienne Shelly, that's certainly OK. There are certainly many such unpleasant and nefarious menfolk in the world. Some of those characters make good movies. But here their portrayals take on the tone of a crusade, a paranoid obsession. This movie, an otherwise admirable 'first time' helming job from a young woman, has the stench of a tirade, a silly feminist rant.I would hope that IF any personal unhealed emotional wounds, unmet needs, and unresolved psychological issues still haunt any of those women responsible for 'Waitress', they get some effective professional help and work through them ASAP. That kind of deep resentment would be an awful burden for a real person to lug around with one in real life.",Waitress
48,Imdbidia,Charming,6,16 March 2011,"The story of a young pie cook and waitress, Jenna (played by gorgeous Keri Russell), who struggles to survive emotionally to the tyranny of a jealous and possessive husband in a small town in southern USA.I did not think it was an independent film worthy of Sundance, --where, however, triumphed--, but rather a Hollywood film. The film has an interesting script, but it's too pretentious as touches too many issues (domestic violence, loneliness, deception, creative cuisine, unwanted pregnancy, the need to escape the village and her husband to have a better life) but none of them deep enough or with enough originality.Several elements deserve praise. Firstly, the culinary part. The food and pastries that Jenna creates are an emotional expression of her daily mood and feelings, and the scenes connected with their preparation are beautifully presented, filmed with intimacy and warmth; it somewhat reminds me of the emotional food story presented in Like Water for Chocolate. Secondly, the relationship(predictable and many times told) between Jenna and the grumpy old man who owns the Cafe where she works, played by a delightful Andy Griffith. Thirdly, the dialogs between the three waitresses and their personal stories, really nice and funny, with that southern accent full of grammatical inaccuracies so charming! Finally, the unloving letters that Jenna writes to her unborn child. Moreover, the film has beautiful colors, a 1950s feeling in it too, and a great cheerfulness, that makes the watching very enjoyable.The three waitresses Keri Russell, Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Shelley) are great in their roles, but are Jeremy Sisto, as the insecure and jealous husband, and Griffith, the ones that really stand out and steal the show.",Waitress
49,vampyrecowboy,Just a touch above boring.,4,28 January 2009,"Because the director and writer dies does not make this a better movie.It's not cool that the director was killed, but that has no bearing on this film and how it was written, performed, directed and overall played out.The characters lacked, the story lacked.It was dull, lifeless and at times too stupid to believe.The Southern charm has been overdone, the conversations and actions seemed so poorly developed - when the best character you have is played by Andy Griffith, then it's time to realize that maybe the script wasn't so hot to begin with.Many characters were just wasted ink on a page as were many scenes and lots of dialog.It's a 4...and that is a touch above total boredom, but since I'm at home with a back injury, it's really cold outside, the movie didn't cost me anything and I don't have too much to do, it was bearable to watch, but that's it.In 2 hours from now, this will be another movie that means nothing in my world.No, it wasn't cool that the director died, but that doesn't make this film any better or any worse.Was she talented?

50,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: Too cartoony for drama, too serious for a comedy",4,27 March 2008,"""Waitress"" doesn't seem to know whether to take itself seriously or not. About half the scenes were too comedic for a serious film, and the other have way too syrupy and serious for a comedy.The courtship of Ogie is clearly meant to be funny, but it just struck me as weird and wrong throughout. The relationship with old Joe felt entirely fake to me.Mainly, characters in the film make bad choices (4 of them commit adultery), and we are clearly expected to empathize with (rather than dislike) those decisions.The pie theme was cute. But it became repetitive and then monotonous.Without spoiling the ending, I can tell you that the entire film seems to build up to a strong woman who doesn't need anyone theme. And then fails to deliver.Maybe it's because I'm a guy, but I hated this film throughout. It had real potential, but seemed more like a bunch of gimmicks with no closure.A much better movie with a similar theme is Juno, which was comedic throughout and has a satisfying ending. It avoids melodrama and doesn't set the audience up to identify with main characters who ultimately let you down.-Jon",Waitress
51,the-movie-guy,Wonderful sleeper film with heart,8,24 May 2007,"(My Synopsis) Jenna (Keri Russell) was taught by her mother to bake pies as a little girl, and now she bakes delicious pies each day and works as a waitress at Joe's Diner. Joe's Diner specializes in serving different pies to its customers each day with a new surprise pie everyday. Jenna always comes up with a new pie by using her emotions in baking new and undiscovered recipes and giving them great names such as ""Kick in the Pants Pie"" and ""I Don't Want Earl's Baby Pie"". Jenna wants to enter a Pie Baking Contest and win $25,000, but her abusive husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto) doesn't want her to have her dream. If Jenna can win the contest, she will be able to leave Earl and start a new life. Unfortunately for Jenna, Earl gets her pregnant and now she is stuck. Jenna starts writing letters to her unborn child and by the time the baby is born, Jenna has built up her self confidence.(My Comment) This small-town diner is a perfect place to tell the story of Jenna's life. The movie brought out the feelings of a small-town where everyone knows what everyone else is doing in town. Andy Griffith was great and gives a memorable performance for the part he played as owner of the Joe's Diner. You will fall in love with the character of Jenna and want to take her home and make her safe from Earl. Jeremy Sisto played his part very well, because I wanted to take Earl out and beat the devil out of him. In character development, the writers bring out different emotions and give us the feeling of caring about what actually happens to the characters. I know that I would love to go to Jenna's Diner and eat one of her famous pies. This is a wonderful sleeper film with heart, some great moments, and a message to everyone to take out a slice of life and live it to the fullest. It's too bad that this film will be shown in limited release. (Fox Searchlight, Run time 1:47, Rated PG-13)(8/10)",Waitress
52,PeachHamBeach,So beautifully human...,10,17 May 2007,"I saw this film last night. By the time it was over I was crying, but not necessarily just from sadness.I have this feeling that even without the now well-known tragedy that accompanied this film's release, this would have been the sleeper indie hit of the year anyway.Adrienne Shelly is truly a master storyteller. Her style is so unique as to feel almost foreign to a lot of moviegoers I'll bet.The screening I went to was overflowing, and I even arrived early.This film is overwhelmingly emotional. It leaves you feeling everything at once. Happy, melancholy, a little angry even. It is a comedy to be sure, and a pleasing one. But it also has some disturbing subject matter. Shelly skillfully weaves it all together to make a film where you are laughing through your tears.It is a very beautifully human story. It does NOT glamorize anything, especially not adultery and domestic violence.All of the characters are each on a journey in life, where they will either learn from their mistakes, or not learn from them, but NEVER does this film get preachy about anything. Let me repeat, this film does not GLAMORIZE, nor does it PREACH. It just presents you with several beautifully developed characters who are facing their problems in honestly human ways. Nobody's saying they are right in what they do.There are no easy solutions presented either.I grew to love the characters. All of them. Because they were ALL human. I didn't see any villains, monsters, heroes or angels. I saw PEOPLE.This film deserves MULTIPLE awards for being so emotionally rich. The entire cast is perfect, with brilliant performances by all. Keri Russell, Nathan Fillion, Jeremy Sisto, and Andy Griffith are especially deserving of kudos, but the support from Cheryl Hines, Lew Temple, Eddie Jemison and Shelly herself are also very powerful. Big film studios should take a lesson, it IS possible for even the smallest supporting character to make an impact. Case in point: the Lew Temple character.I'll give this one an A+.",Waitress

Keri Russell was born to play the lead, in a performance that is a shoe in for my Best Actress of the year. She is so quirky and adorable, while displaying a deep hidden pain and need to get away from her overbearing husband (played superbly by Jeremy Sisto). The rest of the cast is also absolutely jaw-droppingly hilarious. They all mold together so seamlessly and are always there in the background to keep the laughs pouring out of you. Nathan Fillion is a shining grace, and will easily be making a spot on my Supporting Actor lineup. He is incredibly natural as the quirky, awkward and sweetly romantic OB-GYN who becomes Russell's love interest and her outlet to escape the stress and pain of her life. The romance between them is so real and authentic, that it's very hard when you realize they can't actually be together.

Being pregnant is a burden and an inconvenience, and should not be something that is celebrated.I very much disagreed with the social commentary of this movie, and couldn't get past it.

The story concerns an waitress in a pie shop (played by Kerri Russell), stuck in a dead end marriage to an abusive control freak. Her only means of not cracking up all together is making yummy looking pies. Matters get more complicated when she finds out she's pregnant, and (potentially) falling for her new ob-gyn.

57,bobbobwhite,Terrific fun; wildly creative and magically original,9,31 May 2007,"Cartoonish and fairy tale-magical in places, harsh and realistic in others, but both sides meshed perfectly and made for an enchanting and very entertaining film that was truly spectacular for a first time writing and directing effort by Adrienne Shelley. Tragically for her and for us, this first film is her last, as she was murdered last fall in her apartment in NYC. That loss is critical for modern film-making and for the rest of us, as Ms. Shelley possessed a uniquely creative and convincingly oddball look at the world through her quirky personal lens which leaves viewers upbeat, optimistic, and very rewarded. After seeing this film in its full creative brilliance, I am so saddened that she will not get the chance to hold us in her magic spell again. The unhappy life of a southern, pie-creating waitress seems to not be a story that would be very interesting to most, but Shelley really pulls it off and makes it fun and irresistible. The cartoon-like pastel colors of the sets, the brilliant character development of everyone, and the deeply zany story and dialog made this the best film of the year so far for me. It was amazing to me that it all worked so well and came together so satisfyingly at the end.For example, Dawn's(Shelley's character)boyfriend/fiancé/husband's ""spontaneous poetry"" will be forever seen as a classic and no doubt will be endlessly copied in other films. If for no other reason, see the movie for his adoring poetry. The films I have seen in the last few years that had a similar flavor to Waitress were Pleasantville and Tim Burton's Big Fish. If you liked those, you will love Waitress. Do yourself a big favor....don't miss it, and take someone you love with you. You won't want it to end.",Waitress
58,henrycoles9,Poignant inspiration,10,19 July 2021,"This is the perfect kind of poignant drama, complex romance and sheer, endearing humanity that I keep looking for in every movie I watch. Jenna is a hard-up waitress stuck with her abusive, loutish jerk of a husband in a backwater town and, to cap it all, he just got her knocked up. She hates her life, hates her baby and the only thing that takes her mind off things is baking scrumptious pies, which she gives names inspired by her daily predicaments. Jenna runs into a dapper obstetrician, Dr. Pomatter, who is new in town with his wife and an extremely complicated albeit quite hilarious affair ensues. This is what's so exceptionally good about this movie. It doesn't portray Dr. Pomatter as the knight in shining armor riding in to save the damsel in distress. The affair isn't made to look like the ultimate deliverance from the evil husband. It's just something that happens along the way as the vivacious Jenna threads her way through her dismal life and the pregnancy she couldn't hate more. There's loads of profound discussions between Jenna and her coworkers Dawn and Becky as they, too, explore love and relationships and try to find their place in the world, while dealing with a cranky boss here and a creepy customer there. I won't spoil the ending, but rest assured it's as good as you can imagine. In a nutshell, it's a woman who is powerless but not helpless. She gets slapped, she gets beaten down and she pulls herself up by her bootstraps as she envisions the next pie to bake and cooks up a deeply creative and personal name to give it. And there's also the kindness of strangers - you can always count on the kindness of strangers and the ineffable ways fate can mend your heart and get you back up on your feet.And Keri Russel rocks, of course!",Waitress
59,come2whereimfrom,"A fine slice of work, pie-fect.",7,13 August 2007,"Sadly writer, actress and director Adrienne Shelley is not around to enjoy the success her film is receiving, she was waiting to find out if it had made the Cannes selection when she was found in an apparent suicide which later turned out to be a murder. I think the hardest thing in watching this film knowing that information is how anyone could murder someone who clearly had such a wonderful heart and an amazing outlook on life. I say this because Waitress is a movie of such warmth and compassion it positively glows on the screen from the moment it opens. Its filled with brilliant characters from all walks of life, like the girls who work in the pie shop Dawn, Jenna and Becky, Old Joe the owner, Earl the redneck with no redeemable qualities to the odd but endearing Ogie who is into 'spontaneous poetry'. The script is sharp and provides the collective cast each with moments to shine within the story, which although is a fairly traditional girl meets boy is told in a very quirky and emotive way. Keri Russell is a show stealer as Jenna the main character undergoing considerable turbulence in her life and although the story follows her its also about all the interactions that occur in her everyday existence and life can lead you in various directions at anytime, often with surprising results. The whole pie theme that runs through the film is a great little diversion and as well as voice-overs is an insight into Jenna's thoughts, she invents a new pie everyday and the titles give you an idea of where her head is at 'I don't want Earl's baby pie' and 'I Can't Have No Affair Because It's Wrong And I Don't Want Earl To Kill Me Pie' are just two. I'm one of the biggest cynics in the world and probably too jaded to be sucked in 100% so at times it did seem to veer into the pass me a bucket its too sickly sweet stage, but that's just me. This is a film that anyone can enjoy, its funny; it's sad, it has mass appeal and is a fitting tribute to a great talent we have sadly lost. So pull up a stool and grab some pie and enjoy the Waitress.",Waitress
60,pkpera,Very unrealistic,4,19 January 2020,"This started really interesting, and Keri Russell is adorable. But as 2 main male characters appeared I felt their actions, behaving just not realistic, and on top of it, all it was presented superficial, cliche wise.Male characters were just dumb, selfish, not seeing what is in front of them ...
Old restaurant guest was only one presented as someone OK, but he acted weirdly big part of time too.And those ""no"", then ""yes"" after 5 secs scenes, main actress as ""kissing attacker"" ?? I guess 'inspiration' came from other ...
Well, I really did not say until now that some movie favorises female characters, but this one surely does it. Even poor restaurant boss was presented as total douche without good reason.End was letdown for me, and I guess that some will think how heartless I'm - no it was touching, but no way that it happen so, not even in far from me Florida.
If poor abused wife needed that to realize how babies, kids are important. lovable - well, she was just dumb, not listening on what goes around. I felt sorry for young baby with such mother. Because, let's face: will she suddenly becoming smart and really good mother now ? No, she will just make mistakes as did before. Love is most important, but it is not enough.
In this movie even love was not most important. Pies were it :-)

I don't say it's a bad movie just that is simple and nothing too fancy about it. Just the drama of an ordinary American woman and her daily routines at work and at home. Also we are not told why her husband has this vile behavior for his wife, in fact what she ever do to him that deserves this treatment? There a many movies with mystery in witch a review is hard to write because after you watched you still don't get it, even if you watch more then once but here is not the case so I still think is a too appreciate film for it's trite content.

It's interesting, though pretty silly, but, since it's a comedy, that's OK. It's not fun, but, it's not intended to be fun.All the characters are weird, though none are crazy. It has a touch of misandry, but, just a touch, much, much less than ""girl power"" movies that came after it. Actually, the ""girl power"" aspect of it is fine, if a little silly. Sure, some women do find the strength to ""take on the world"" when they give birth, but, not that many. Most just feel exhausted and want to run away from the world to recover.There are a few worthwhile moments in the movie, with interesting insights. Like when we learn that the bar-manager is a good man, even though he's a jerk. Or when we learn that Keri Russel's husband does love her and his abusive behavior is actually out of fear of losing her, not some ""deep evil"".Acting is good in general. Kerri Russel does overact a little, but in a comedy, that's kind of expected. Nathan Fillion is always great playing a confused nice guy.Bottom line - few things here are great, but, a lot of stuff is good. It's an OK watch, even if you don't like chick-flick movies in general.",Waitress
63,ikanboy,Mel's Diner meets the brother's Grimm,7,13 June 2007,"It took me a half hour or so to finally decide to relax and enjoy this fractured fairy tale of rural Americana. To start with the dialog was definitely meant to express what people think, and not what they really come up with. The characters are all quirky and driven by the screenplay - written by the late Adrienne Shelley, who plays ditsy Dawn - and while it is satirical, and a tease by an urbanite of middle America, it has it's heart in the right place. Only Sisto's character is dark, and at times menacing, but he too is a caricature - all bark and precious little bite.As satires go this one decides to have us like the main characters, because they all seem to like each other, even though we sense that Shelley is being more than a tad mocking about ""southern soaps."" And it is all presented as a modern day ""frectured"" fairy tale. Russell plays Cinderella, who married her Prince, and found him to be a frog. Her Savior is her gynecologist - way more cute than a gynecologist should be - and the fairy Godmother is grumpy old Andy Griffith, who doesn't have a magic wand but does manage to turn a depressing future into a magical pie shop.And if you come into this movie knowing the tragedy that befell it's Director/writer/actress, it adds a heavy poignancy to the spice.",Waitress
64,JoshtheGiant,A Nearly Perfect Comedy/Drama,9,28 November 2007,"Waitress is an wonderful feel good movie with an enchanting performance by Keri Russell. For a romantic comedy it is rather deep and emotionally distressing at times, but that's because we empathize with the characters so much. Russell's character is a southern bell of sorts, who get's pregnant by her jerk of a husband, and ends up having an affair with her genealogist. It may sound like a soap opera, but it isn't. It actually works brilliantly because of the pitch perfect script, acting, and direction. It is also a perfect finale to Adrienne Shelly, the writer, director, and co-star of the film who was murdered shortly before its release. This makes the already bittersweet film even more so. I should also mention Andy Griffith's brilliant performance as the owner of the restaurant where Russell's character works. If Russell is the heart of the film, and the script is the blood, he is the white blood cells.",Waitress

But unfortunately only gave me a few laughs.Keri Russell was excellent. Her performance gave us a realistic look at being pregnant(i think, i have never been pregnant).

When her normal doctor retires she is left with a new doctor who she embarks on a wacky relationship with.This is a chick flick. No doubt about it.

66,seawalker,Wasn't that a really nice film?,7,13 August 2007,"Jenna (Keri Russell) is a waitress working in a small town diner. Jenna is a pie making genius. She is able to think up new recipes for pies, based on her state of mind at the time (I-Hate-Myself-And-I-Want-To-Pie, anyone?), seemingly at will. But Jenna has problems. She is married to a boorish and self centered man that she hates. She is accidentally pregnant by him. She is resigned to bringing this new life into the world, but finds no joy in it. Jenna is attracted to the new Doctor in town, but all she can see are her dreams of escape slowly withering and dying. There is no way out. Or maybe there is?The Cineworld on Broad Street in Birmingham was quiet. (""Waitress"" is hardly Summer blockbuster material.) I had the entire back row to myself, except for two old ladies sitting a couple of seats away from me. When ""Waitress"" had finished, one of the old ladies turned to the other and said""Wasn't that a really nice film?""Hey! Who am I to compete with that? ""Waitress"" really is a nice film. It is a very sweet, very cute and dryly funny comedy drama. Lovely performances by the whole cast (Keri Russell just glows), especially from Jeremy Sisto as Jenna's terrible husband Earl. He manages to turn what could have been a pretty one dimensional character into a full fledged study of cruelty and self centeredness, based on terrible, deep down insecurity. It's just an extended cameo, but I think that it is a great performance.If it hadn't have been for the Adrienne Shelly's notorious death, and the resultant publicity, ""Waitress"" may never have got the reasonable distribution in the UK that it is getting. That would have been a shame. I'm glad that I saw it. If you are of the cynical bent, stay at home, but if you aren't, go and see ""Waitress"". You will like it.",Waitress
67,hfan77,A Very Yummy Movie,9,2 December 2007,"My girlfriend and I have seen Waitress three times (once on DVD) and every time I saw it, I felt it was a very yummy movie, thanks to the variety of pies Jenna made that reflected her emotions. Keri Russell was outstanding as Jenna, stuck in a bad marriage to Earl, played wonderfully by Jeremy Sisto. Cheryl Hines and the late Adrienne Shelly (who also wrote and directed)lent excellent support as her fellow waitresses Becky and Dawn. It was also great to see Andy Griffith as Joe, the diner owner who looked a lot heavier than his days playing the sheriff of Mayberry. Let's not forget Nathan Fllion as Dr. Pomatter, the married gynecologist Jenna has an affair with.In some respects, Waitress reminds me of the 70s sitcom Alice, where Jenna, the voice of reason, resembles the title character, Becky is a blond variation on Flo and Dawn has the personality that resembles Vera. Cal, their boss, played by Lew Temple reminded me a lot of Mel.I also like the song at the end that Jenna sings to her newborn daughter Lulu ""Gonna make a Pie"". I frequently sing that to my girlfriend. It's a shame Adrienne Shelly is gone. Waitress is a tribute to her legacy.",Waitress

So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us.

69,moutonbear25,"Rich, sweet and made with love.",8,6 May 2007,"RichSomewhere, someone is making a pie that is all their own. They have been to the grocery store; they have chosen the best ingredients. They have a recipe in their head that might have once been their mother's or might have come to them while they waited for the bus. And though there may be situations or circumstances in their lives that may be keeping them from the happiness they deserve, for the time it will take to prepare their warm treat, they will be focused on the act of creation itself. That same kind of care is baked into writer/ director Adrienne Shelley's Sundance darling, WAITRESS. Like the film's heroine, Jenna (Keri Russell) who bakes to escape from her dreary, hopeless life, Shelley ensures that WAITRESS is the result of blending all the right ingredients, not over baking and gently sifting in just the right amount of love whenever necessary.If WAITRESS were itself a pie, it would taste like the perfect combination of different flavours coming to life on your tongue one after the other instead of all at once. It would be rich, not overly sweet. Realism gives this romantic comedy its affluence. Jenna plays a waitress who works thankless hours at a pie shop outside of town. She is married to a controlling, abusive husband (played by a humanely needy Jeremy Sisto) and has just discovered that she is pregnant. She thought her life was going nowhere before but the baby news shut the oven door for good on whatever dreams she still held on to. Russell plays Jenna like a woman resigned to her fate. She is not necessarily unhappy in her day-to-day interactions; she merely does not believe that any good will come to her in her life. None has come thus far so why should she expect anything different from the future? She is not a pessimist but a pragmatist. While the dead-end career/deadbeat husband angle has been played out before, Shelley makes sure to avoid cliché with a sensitive script that allows for her characters to make sensible choices rather than typical ones that define the genre. The relationship that is perhaps treated most delicately and also becomes the central relationship in the film is the one that forms between Jenna and her new gynecologist, Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion). After an initially uncomfortable meeting, the two start an affair that finds Jenna following her pregnancy very closely with what seems like weekly visits to her doctor. Affairs are very tricky to sell on film as the romance has the extra challenge of overshadowing the innocent partners that are left at home and the undue hurt that is caused to them. In Jenna's case, the woman has got it so rough; you want her to have this happiness. What value do the vows she made to her husband have when he essentially manipulated her into marrying him in the first place so that he would never be alone? Russell makes it boisterously enjoyable to watch Jenna realize that she can actually make choices that control her own destiny. They may not be ideal but they can bring smiles to her face again. And as for Dr. Pomatter and his involvement, Shelley wisely chooses not to show his wife until much later on or explain away why he is cheating. In the end, it isn't his story and all that matters is that he's there and he sees Jenna for the wondrous woman she is.WAITRESS is easy to fall in love with. After all, isn't there a little waitress in all of us? To varying degrees, we all wish that something about our lives had turned out differently. If we're lucky there are elements that we are happy with but there is always going to be something we don't feel we've explored to its fullest or opportunities we feel we've been cheated out of. Let this movie and its creation be a lesson to us all to enjoy the moments where we feel happy just making a pie, as those are the moments that matter and you never know what life has in mind for you next.Before she could witness the critical success and audience reaction to her film, a construction worker killed writer/director Adrienne Shelley over a noise dispute in her building.",Waitress

72,stevepat99,Delicious Fun - NOT!,4,30 November 2007,"Waitress is a 'food' movie involving Jenna's near super ability to create awesome pies. The film's scenes involving Jenna baking pies, creating pies and thinking about pies are FUN and well done. Keri is awesome FUN to watch. However, this is why I did NOT find the film delicious fun.1. The DVD jacket describes Jenna's husband as obnoxious. Actually, he is a near dribbling unkempt man, a wife controlling freak and does anyone mention he is also a WIFE BEATER. NOT FUN.2. Despite an available friends support system and the fact that Jenna is not living in 'fear' for her life should she leave Earl (confirmed later in the film) Jenna chooses to stay with Earl so she can accumulate money to enter a pie contest. Staying with an abusive, wife beating husband is also NOT FUN.3. DVD jacket notes Jenna sees winning the pie contest as the key to her salvation. Yet the pie contest does not play a FUN role in the film and salvation is at hand prior to any involvement in the contest.4. Jenna meets her 'true love,' a man who becomes her soul mate and as she says 'my best friend.' He feels the same. She is eager for the relationship which blossoms. Then for fear he would be leaving an unhappy marriage (as she would be leaving an abusive one) she turns her back on him to prevent others from being hurt. What others? He has no kids! NO FUN HERE.5. An elderly friend who is near death give her a 'card.' NOT FUN. 6.Jenna's husband Earl goes on two further rampages. One in the pie restaurant causing material damage and also in the hospital room where he tackled by three medical people and evicted. NOT FUN.7. Jenna learns she is pregnant and rants on and on that she HATES her pregnancy and any thought of becoming a mother. NOT FUN.8. Salvation does not come to Jenna by way of her talent or any effort on part. Rather it comes a purely by way of a lucky windfall, out of the blue and against all odds. Might just as well have had Jenna win the lottery. NOT FUN If the film makers had Jenna succeed as the result of her efforts via the pie contest or otherwise, had Earl simply been a 'bad' husband vis a vis uncaring, unpleasant, cheating, obnoxious, self centered etc. (rather than an obscene wife beater) and kept her 'romance' in the lusting rather than best friend/soul mate stage the film would have been much improved with ample room for REAL FUN. Wife beating, for me, is the wrong ingredient in this romantic comedy recipe.",Waitress
73,pontifikator,"""Waitress"" has brilliant casting and direction.",8,23 December 2010,"Waitress""Waitress"" has brilliant casting and direction. Whoever did the casting nailed every role no matter how small with the perfect actor. This movie was directed by Adrienne Shelly, who also wrote the screenplay. (She was murdered just before the film's release when she walked in on a burglar in her home office.)The movie is about Jenna (Keri Russell), who is married to a terrible man. Jenna finds out she's pregnant just when she's saved up enough money from waitressing to leave her husband. Russell has a hard, angry face throughout much of the movie, exactly as we'd expect from someone in her position. Her husband, Earl, is played by Jeremy Sisto with totally convincing creepiness as a controlling, needy narcissist. (I don't know where Shelly dredged up his character, but she nailed it in the screen play, and Sisto nailed it in his performance). Jenna falls in love with her doctor (Dr. Pomatter), played superbly by Nathan Fillion. Jenna and Pomatter's scenes range from riotously funny to affectingly poignant. The problem is, he's married, too, and his wife (played by Darby Stanchfield) loves him. I was watching the movie, wondering how Shelly was going to get Jenna and Pomatter out of what clearly is an untenable relationship.Aside from the conflict of their adulterous relationship, we have a potentially even more momentous conflict: Jenna doesn't want to be pregnant. It means she can't just run off and leave Earl. Jenna begins a letter to her baby, explaining why she can't love it.Meanwhile, her fellow waitresses, her manager, the restaurant owner, and a wealth of others have their fifteen minutes on the screen, adding a richness to the world of Jenna that we're peeking in on. Shelly does get all the conflicts resolved, but the ending is a little too ""deus ex machina"" for me. Just a little, not enough to spoil it. It's a great, grand film, and Shelly's murderer robbed us all of a wonderful talent.",Waitress
74,Paynebyname,"Paper thin characters, predictable story and ultimately demeaning to women",2,3 July 2008,"I don't like give low ratings to films but this film was poor.This film is billed as a delicious romantic comedy but I couldn't find any comedy and virtually no romance. Moreso it seemed to send out the strangest of messages.This waitress lives with an abusive, dominating husband that she hates but has never been able to leave - yawn.I'm sick and tired of the portrayal of women who hook up with a 'bad boy' assuming they can change/tame him and then are surprised when they can't. If he hits or verbally intimidates you for the first time, you decide your course of action. You give him another chance or you leave him. If he does it again and you don't go then you've only got yourself to blame.Why do these women play the victim all the time? You choose who you date/marry. Your choice of partner reflects on you as a person. Maybe you should have put a little thought into it beforehand. I'm so tired of the ""Oh it's not my fault, he changed"" response. This hand washing of responsibility for your plight is ridiculous. The signs were there but you probably chose to ignore them.She then gets pregnant by him, which when she does the pregnancy test is praying it comes in negative. It comes in positive but at no point does she consider termination. ""The child won't have a dad but I'm going to have it anyway"" is the sentiment.Why couldn't she terminate? She can't stand this man yet she wants to have his child? She wants to be free and not tied down anymore yet is going to be lumbered with a child. Why have a child that is going to grow up without a father? Why can't she think of the child's future? If you know from the get go that it won't have access to its father then you are affecting the child's upbringing from the beginning. Abortions are there to correct mistakes. Granted they should not be used as contraceptive but they are there so you don't have to go through with the birth.She then has an affair with a married man (even though she's still married) creating a strange situation that 'she thinks nothing wrong with having an affair' but it so traditional that she couldn't entertain a termination.I'm not comparing an affair with an abortion but again the film gives no reason as to why abortion is such a complete no-no. One makes the assumption it's because of her moral code, religious beliefs or something else. Although the film synopsis describes her as sassy, maybe she has traditional values. The point I'm making is that her morals/values/religious beliefs don't impede her having an affair with a married man yet prevent her from even considering an abortion.Some will say that 'just leaving him' is overly simplistic but in the film she can't do this when she is without child but finds the strength to once having had a baby. Therefore implying that a baby will resolve all of your problems.The film sends out an awful message. Basically a woman on her own isn't strong enough or independent enough to stand up for herself but having a child and becoming a mother makes everything OK. Get out of an abusive relationship by having a child with aforementioned man, then raise the child without the balance of a fathers input. Is this is the rallying call for a host of council house, single slags? I find this film portrays a ridiculously old fashioned ideal that a woman is only complete when she is a mother. In my mind this is utter trash and couldn't be more demeaning or non PC to women.",Waitress

But she's trapped in by her idiot of a husband... until she meets a handsome new man in town and makes one last desperate attempt at happiness.Keri Russell shines in this radiant film about humans struggle for contentment. Her Jenna is a woman who everyone loves- yet who's friends all agree they would never want to switch places with. And her friends are wonderful, played to perfection by Cheryl Hines and writer-director Adrienne Shelley. Both are perfect in their roles and light up the screen every scene they're in.Waitress examines one of worst problems humans have: We get stuck in relationships, in situations, in places we don't want to be and we think we are stuck. We think there is no way out and no happy ending is possible. We think that once terrible things happen to us, we're simply left to wallow in self-loathing. We are wrong, as this tale goes to tell.This film is a true delight and one of the must-see films of the year.

Drawn in by the magnetic pull of irresistible Fillion, however, I eventually acquiesced.Stuck in a marriage with her possessive and jealous husband Earl, Jenna desperately seeks the money she needs to escape her small-town existence and establish her own pie diner. Discovering she is pregnant, she reluctantly falls into a relationship with her gynecologist Dr Pomatter.A devout disciple of Firefly and Serenity, I regard myself as something of a Fillion completist, the irresistible charm and humour of the man preventing me from staying away from even the sappiest sounding things to which he aligns himself (I've yet to sink to the level of Desperate Housewives, mind). But! This is a not a Fillion film, so we shall have to stop treating it as such, shan't we? The film's primary character, Jenna, is well portrayed, her situation a sympathetic one. Jeremy Sisto is typically mad as her suspicious husband, an excellent supporting role. However, I don't buy for a second that theirs is the kind of relationship from which she couldn't simply walk away. Earl appears not in the slightest abusive, either physically or sexually, and has the mental faculty of a child. This is not a character than I can imagine holding any sort of sway over a character as strong as Jenna. The film relies on our belief in the tragedy of her circumstance, yet it is more cartoonish than anything else, the vaguely sketched conflicts within the marriage never approaching the realism of an abusive relationship. Furthermore, the bright colour scheme of the film retains an optimism which seems to clash with the mood Shelly is attempting to create. Though she deals in dark themes, not least of all adultery, the film has the feeling of a glossy rom-com in which the most problematic of troubles are infinitesimal in comparison to that of real life. The film exists in a fairy-tale world, so far removed from reality that it is quite irksome. The humour feels as though it is trying too hard to be kooky and quirky, only serving to add to this disappointing fantasy sheen which prevents the narrative ever realising its potential. Elements of the plot are quite unoriginal and predictable, particularly that of wealthy and curmudgeonly diner-owner cum customer Joe, the progress of which everyone ought to see from a mile away. Though it is massively flawed, the film has a certain charm, articulated particularly by Fillion (call me biased, I'm right though). It may be unrealistic and a dancing-around of serious topics, but its comedy has some merit, the scenes in the doctor's office around the articulation of the illicit relationship particularly well constructed. These are the only scenes of the film that truly work, and one laments the fact that they are not more in number.Dragged down by its many flaws, Waitress glosses in a saccharine way over the real problems its themes should address. There are a decent number of laughs to be had here, though mostly only whilst Nathan Fillion or Jeremy Sisto are on-screen. Too kooky, colourful, and rom-com oriented for its own good, it's formulaic, but a bit of fun.",Waitress
79,littlemartinarocena,Femenine Awakenings And A Slice Of Pie,8,16 September 2007,"Kerri Russell bursts into a leading role that has the classic signs of a character destined to remain in the subconscious heart of anyone who meets her. The passive wife of a time bomb, a horribly, fearless, perfect Jeremy Sisto. She goes through life working as a waitress, cooking amazing pies and hiding money all over the house as a safety net for whenever she's ready to run away. The funny thing is that by the time we witness her submission to her husband, we know her well enough to know that the attitude is an act and that she is up to something. She's putting up with the ugliness of her home life because she has a plan. She has become sort of hard, but her hardness is purely cosmetic, underneath it all she's just a girl longing for a reason to love. Adrienne Shelly, the director, plays Dawn, one of her co-workers and Andy Griffith provides a lovely, surprising touch. Recommended.",Waitress
80,mycannonball,"""Pleasantly Surprised by how GOOD this Movie was"" Pie",9,9 January 2008,"What a charming, yet cynical movie! This is a story of flawed characters (like real people) who are trying to get by. There are some hilarious moments, some dark moments, and some sweet ones.Keri Russell nails this role. I had no opinion of her acting prior to this (having never really watched ""Felicity""). I'm a fan now! Jeremy Sisto is great as her pathetic, jealous husband. All the actors are fantastic.There is some criticism of this movie on its Message Board (but people tend to mostly complain on Message Boards anyway). One of the complaints is that these characters don't grow enough and that they are unlikable. I completely disagree with that assessment. I felt empathy for all the characters. None of them were completely happy for various reasons, and they were grappling with whatever they could to get by. The females relied on each others' friendships without judgment of one another. The grumpy old man's grouchiness comes from loneliness/lack of friends. I even felt sorry for Earl, the abusive husband, because he obviously was an insecure little boy.That said, despite the characters feeling very dissatisfied at times, I felt very satisfied while watching this because there are some extremely funny moments throughout as well as some touching moments as well.The only sad thing to say is that I am sorry we won't be able to watch Adrienne Shelly's new work. She was a gifted writer, director, and actor who is missed.",Waitress
81,Monotreme02,Shamelessly uplifting and feel-good with brilliant screen writing and performances,8,22 December 2007,"As a small, micro-budgeted independent film, and considering her background, it comes as no surprise that Shelly pays a lot more attention to actual cinematic quality and value than most of her other ""rom-com""-helming companions. Indeed Shelly's absolutely wonderful script contains many of the eccentricities and sass expected of independent film. Set in the deep south, Shelly's characters talk and act like they stand on the very finest line between caricature and real human beings, and have just enough of both to be at once adorably lovable and charmingly appealing and at the same time wholly realistic and believable. The film indeed is outrageously funny, most of its comedy deriving from the quirky supporting characters that populate Jenna's colourful world. And while Shelly does round her script off with a feel-good happy-go-lucky everything-works-out-in-the-end finale, that doesn't at all derive from everything leading up to it, on the contrary: Optimistic feel-good movies are somewhat of a rarity in today's modern age of cynical Hollywood. And Shelly portrays everything up until said ending with such a brilliant combination of light-hearted comedy and the downright bleakness of Jenna's unhappy reality, and creates such a wonderfully sympathetic and downright lovable character in Jenna, that one is more than ready to forgive Shelly for giving her the happy ending she deserves.The film immensely benefits from its outstanding cast, who portray the characters perks, quirks and charm with time code persistence and put in enormously delightful performances, each and every one. Nathan Fillion, who should be in a lot more movies, is immediately lovable as the neurotic doctor and his almost blind devotion to the notion of making these two people happy is a wonder to behold. The brilliant Cheryl Hines and writer-director Adrienne Shelly herself deliver spot-on brilliant turns as Jenna's two co-workers at the diner, and provide the best comedy of the entire film in their doubtfully-scripted dialogues and encounters. Jeremy Sisto is simply monstrous as Jenna's overbearing husband, and yet, manages to let show just enough for us to know what Jenna saw in him before he changed for the worst after their marriage. Andy Griffith is also wonderful as the old owner of the diner who serves as a kind of mentor/father figure to Jenna's lonely, broken woman, and the drips of sympathy and love he allows to trickle through his craggy, malicious facade are a wonder to behold.But this films brightest shining star is none other than its star, Keri Russell, who plays Jenna with such utter devotion and sheer irresistibility. The coldest person on earth could still not possibly avoid falling in love with and sympathizing with Russell's Jenna. Her unhappiness and fatigue are tragic; her lack of enthusiasm and her cynicism are charming; her love for pie making and for happiness is inspirational. With such a beguilingly lovable character, it's no surprise that Shelly gave her a happy ending: At the end of all things, the viewing audience can't think of a more deserving cinematic persona to receive the happy ending treatment. And Russell is absolutely divine in the role, delivering an Oscar-caliber performance that should really put her on the leading lady map and finalize her relocation from being a television star to being a reliable leading lady of the cinema.And the pies. How can anybody review this film without mentioning the pies? After all, they play almost as an important part in the film as the characters do. Like the wine in Alexander Payne's Sideways, the pies in Waitress serve the very important purpose of conveying Jenna's feelings for the audience. As she invents a pie in her head, we see her visualization of the creation: The invented pies all get names according to the thoughts on her mind, and the visualizations further emphasize her feelings. If she is angry, she will violently throw in the rough, rugged ingredients; if the feelings are of happiness, she uses soft, placid ingredients, which she tenderly pats into the pie. They look so good and the characters in the film enjoy them so much, it's impossible to watch this film without getting an immediate and urgent craving for a good pie.In all, Waitress is a wonderfully uplifting and absolutely lovable film, unashamed and unafraid of its blatant happy-go-lucky, feel-good nature  in fact using it for its advantage. Populated with wonderfully quirky characters and deep southern sass and aided by spot-on supporting performances by a wildly hilarious cast, the film's true centerpiece is Keri Russell's wonderful, exquisitely lovable, Oscar-caliber performance as the main character Jenna. Shelly employs enough cinematic and screen writing quality to elevate this leagues above your average feel-good romantic comedy and turn it into something much more; sincerely lovable, frankly uplifting and just all-around beautiful and wonderfully entertaining.",Waitress
82,alrodbel,"More than a flick, a snapshot of our culture",6,30 May 2007,"This review will be in the form of an exchange of letters:Dear AlThe film was a direct attack on marriage. There were 2 different ""affairs"" going on at the same time. There was a constant theme of husbands being stupid, from the revelation from the Andy Griffith character how his marriages had failed because of him, to the cruelty and stupidity of the husband of the star , the manager of the diner, and even the doctor who was so disorganized that he couldn't find things and told the waitress to push the files on the floor. He was so emotionless most of the time. The star was such a brainless person herself. Obviously she did not know what love was ( Lust vs love) She married the guy. Did she EVER care for him? Obviously they did not talk about children. Men in general were portrayed as stupid, but this movie was so stupid, but then are we supposed to laugh at things some think are precious? -------- My Response:I happened to have found the film ""Waitress"" enjoyable and a real treat, yet, I found your review of the movie absolutely on target. After Sheila and I left the film, we compared notes as we always do. The upbeat effect, almost euphoria that I felt was something I couldn't quite understand, since the movie was trivial at best.You may have helped put words to my quandary. The main character's relationship with her husband never rang true. If he was so unfeeling, so selfish, why did she ever marry the slob. Maybe if he had gotten a brain tumor that changed him from a nice guy to the crude character that he became, it would have at least been coherent.Your point that this movie condones infidelity was overlooked by me because this is the culture in which we live. Perhaps this is made more sad by it being so accepted, so ubiquitous, that I don't even notice it anymore. But, I suspect this is more prevalent in the movie world than in the real world, where actions have real consequences.But I think most people who enjoyed the movie are not affected by the casual infidelity. And I happened to find the character, Ogie, who married the waitress a redeeming individual. He truly loved her enough to fight for her. He, unlike the other men in the movie, was a decent and rather delightful man. Perhaps, it was their happiness, Ogie's overwhelming irrepressible love for his wife expressed in his poem at the alter, ""Yes,"" that was the source of my pleasure from this film.There is a real life coda to this film that makes the trivial, profound. Adrienne Shelly, who wrote and directed the film and played the Waitress who finally found true love was murdered before this film was finished. She left a grieving husband and infant child.How very precious is finding a life companion, and how easily our culture treats this as a joke.",Waitress
83,mockturtle,Sense...then sentimentality,6,17 May 2007,"I have been a big Adrienne Shelly fan since her early Hal Hartley movies and also saw her uneven but touching ""I'll Take You There,"" where she brought out the screwball in Ally Sheedy without sacrificing her edge. Here she brings out a deeply funny, authentic and moving performance from Keri Russell, a performer I did not dislike but never thought a lot of before this film. She also casts the rest of the people impeccably, A#1 being Andy Griffith;if you've ever seen ""A Face in the Crowd"" you know that he is one of the titanic largely untapped acting talents of the last century. His scenes with Ms. Russell make up the true heart of this small but mighty film. Jeremy Sisto is perfect as well, his character is not given any background beyond the fact that he changed after marriage, but Sisto constant vulnerability mixed with his monstrosity and telling lines like ""I've never had anybody belong to me before,"" seem to indicate that he became drunk with the power of authority when he entered the marriage and his own fragile sense of power caused him to be the (often hilarious, as with the car honking, often terrible, as with the physical violence) broken, absurd and terrible person he is in the film. Eddie Jemison shines in a part that is really risky, he has to be even more overbearing than Sisto's character, but to be the exact opposite, to be actually worthy. Shelly herself and Cheryl Hines are solid in their support (Shelly is adorable), but keep the spotlight firmly on Ms. Russell. Nathan Fillion has been perfect in everything I've ever seen him in, and his open and unpretentious, handsome semi-doofus-but-convincing-as-a-doctor character shows a broader range than his heretofore role as a sort of new-wave Bruce Campbell.Unfortunately the film loses its footing towards the end with sentiment overtaking the sensibilities preceding it. A maudlin and manipulative mother-daughter song is obviously ADR and not source, and it relies upon the old ""everything changes when you see your baby"" switcheroo. Then she leaves the hospital without even checking on Old Joe, who just gave her tons of money and is currently in a coma (presumably because to have him just dead would bewhat, too much of a downer? A coma is better?), then she buys the pie shop and takes Joe's name off it, which doesn't seem very nice. She gives up any chance for a balanced life and lives entirely for her daughter, who she dresses like a doll and then dresses up the same as. She also ditches the doc who, while married to a good person, obviously loves her more than his wife.It is through the outright charm of Fillion and Ms. Russell that the entire affair is able to come across as not-as-not-right as it is. But for it to go nowhere brings back the creepiness about it they managed to turn away. The whole first 2/3 of the movie is pretty excellent, but I can't ignore that I was really let down by the way it all wrapped up. Up until that point there is a sense of genuine feeling and a level-headedness about, for example, how difficult it must be to leave even someone like Earl and everything you know, not just making it seem easy. Then at the end she just does it, he is dragged off, apparently never gives her more trouble and it actually was just that easy.Ms. Shelly was undeniably very very talented and her death is a great loss to the film community (and so sad that the little girl at the end is hers), maybe her next one would have been 3/3 excellent. I think I'm going to go eat some pie now.",Waitress
84,Phillemos,What's the deal with those pies?,8,23 January 2008,"So I was flying out to Las Vegas with my friend Mark and ""Waitress"" was the in-flight movie. Mark bought headphones; I was too cheap to do the same. But I kept looking at the pie scenes, nudging Mark and asking him, ""What's the deal with those pies?"" It made me have to see the movie myself (with sound) to figure it out. Keri Russell has a miserable life with a miserable husband (Jeremy Sisto), but also a gift for making pies, which she does for the local diner where she waits tables. The movie details her pregnancy and affair with a new-to-town doctor, who also happens to be married. In between she makes a lot of pies (which look delicious) and rises above her waitress friends: Cheryl Hines, who's also in a miserable marriage, and Adrienne Shelly (who also directed) gets roped into marrying the guy from the Budweiser ""Yes-I-Am"" commercials. Surprisingly, for someone like me who usually can't sit through chick flicks, I thought this was quite well done. Russell is very funny, the visuals of the pies being made are colorful and brilliant, and the rural-Southern feel of this movie just works well. It's not all perfect. As with many chick flicks, the men are stereotyped as total a-holes, Rusell's love interests clearly are questionable, Hines starts fooling around with the evil chef boss, and Shelly's fiancé acts like a complete tool. Even Andy Griffith, who helps Russell get on her feet, comes across throughout much of the movie as a curmudgeonly, miserable old man. But I found myself laughing through much of the misery, and I suppose a movie that can make you laugh while you feel for the pain of the main characters has something going for it. The tragic murder of Adrienne Shelly shortly before her movie was released will probably give the film extra legs and a certain degree of immortality. But it's a solid film that's fun to watch, and gives you a craving for pie.",Waitress
85,mike-925,Fried Green Tomato Pies at Sheriff Taylor's Whistlestop Cafe,8,26 June 2007,"It seems that Sheriff Andy Taylor has established a Pie Cafe in Mayberry. Three winning waitresses work at Andy's Pie Cafe. Its wonderful and down home.The girls don't have many aspirations past the Pie Stop Cafe. Jenna (Keri Russell) just wants to dump her old man and make pies. Pie-making is a bit of a neurosis with her. When things are at their worst at home with the old man, she just sits down and creates an entirely new pie with totally off-the-wall ingredients. Its too bad they're consumed at Sheriff Andy's Pie Cafe. A psychologist might help her by simply analyzing the pies and their trimmings.Jenna's old man is- are you ready?- Earl! The name has been getting a workout since the Dixie Chicks outed him in their famous song, only to have NBC do a TV series about Earl. With a name like Earl, the audience's expectations are already low. Earl is the husband from hell. The trouble is Jenna's gone and got herself pregnant by him.Fortunately, there's a new married gynecologist in town. Jenna and he hit it off instantly. She jumps onto his lap right in the office. The cook at Andy's Whistlestop is a piece of work too. Even Andy ain't what he used to be. He's now called Joe, he's 81 years old, stops for a pie ever day, is in love with Jenna, and owns most of Mount Ivy or Mayberry or wherever it is. Its Andy Griffith, of course, only in this film, his name is Joe. He's a persnickety customer, insistent about the particulars of his order.But we're talking' about Cal (Lew Temple) the cook here. Cal can't say a kind word to any of the waitresses at Andy's. He's always complainin' they're not getting' the orders out fast enough. But who put Cal in charge, anyway? Joe (Andy?) probably did.Jenna don' want the baby cause its Earl's, but Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion) is having none of that. He wants her to have the baby even if it is Earl's. I forgot to mention that, like Jenna, Pomatter is married.Beckie starts another storyline when she tells Jenna and Dawn (Adrienne Shelly) that she has a new boyfriend too, but she ain't sayin' who it is. Dawn is a mess. She ain't never had a decent boyfriend and she's spoilin' for one. Finally, she puts an ad in- one of those newspaper things- and gets a live one. He scares her pretty good. Jenna and Beckie aren't impressed with his free-associatin' poetry neither. But they decide Dawn's time has arrived. They put her through a makeover.Meanwhile, Joe(sheriff Taylor?) has figured out Jenna is pregnant and asked her what she's gonna do. Jenna pledges Joe to silence. The audience knows that if Andy has figured it out, its only a matter of time before Earl finds out Jenna is pregnant.There's the inevitable showdown between Earl and the Gynecologist, but the audience knows its all gonna turn out fine in the end. The identity of Beckie's boyfriend is revealed. Dawn finds the love of her life and marries him. The acting in Waitress is first rate, particularly the acting of Andy Griffith and Kerri Russell. Adrienne Shelly's story and direction are wrought with just the right combination of green tomatoes and steel magnolias. She'll probably get nominated for best director and/or best script. I wouldn't be surprised if Sheriff Andy appeared in a TV series based on Waitress.Dawn (Adrienne Shelly) is writer and director on this film. She started in acting then branched into making exploitation films and TV. Gradually she started making better features. There's a serious postscript to this film. Adrienne Shelly was murdered by a construction worker who was renovating apartments below her office in New York, before Waitress was released, in November, 2006. The construction worker hung Shelly's body from a shower rod to fake her suicide after the two had exchanged blows arguing about noise from the renovation. He had knocked her unconscious, thought she was dead and was worried he'd be deported. So he hung her body from the shower rod. It was the hanging that actually killed her. The film is dedicated to Adrienne Shelly.",Waitress
86,birck,The real story in this film (may contain a spoiler),9,11 June 2007,"This is a good film about an abusive relationship. As soon as her husband enters the film, the tone changes to reflect their relationship. It isn't good. The light, offhand, but lasting relationships the main character maintains with people in the restaurant disappear when she is with her husband, thanklessly well-played by Jeremy Sisto. Would the denouement succeed, in reality? Would he simply exit the scene, vindictive but non-violent? Perhaps, but I think not. My real reason for leaving a comment here is to draw attention to the star-Keri Russell. She has a face straight out of Botticelli. Raphael. Fra Angellico. Michaelangelo.

87,john32935,Sweet as Pie,7,3 March 2015,"This is a wonderful study of a woman trapped in a bad marriage who dreams of escaping until she receives some unwelcomed news which derails her plans. Of course, I enjoyed the unique pies as well (and thought about cheating on my diet because of them).The cast is very engaging particularly Keri Russell's perfect embodiment as the trapped woman and Andy Griffith's grumpy old man. The dialog is thoughtful and well-paced. The characters are believable, even if just a little quirky.My biggest complaint lies with the infidelity that drives a major portion of the plot. While one can sympathize with Keri Russell's plight and (almost) accept her behavior, there is no justification given for the behavior of Nathan Fillion's character. Sure there is attraction between them, but would a happily married man engage in such behavior? Apparently, this movie's answer is ""yes."" And that answer seems out of place with the rest of the movie and detracts from the overall feel.To see my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",Waitress
88,Surecure,An incredibly endearing film,9,18 May 2007,"Waitress is a film that is almost impossible not to love. It is such an obvious labor of love for all involved and brings out some of the best work of many of those involved. And unlike many ""labor of love"" films, this one is actually both highly entertaining and easily accessible. From start to finish, it is a heart moving and amusing film with many quirks and magnificent originality. While it is a romantic comedy, it is not a ""Hollywood"" romantic comedy in that the film rarely -- if ever -- goes where you expect it to go.The story follows a young waitress (played by Keri Russell) who is married to a full-time loser (Jeremy Sisto) with a mean spirit. She finds out she is pregnant which ultimately puts her on a collision course with the new doctor in town (Nathan Fillion) whom she falls into a passionate love affair with. The film follows this waitress as she tries to sort out her own problematic relationship with her husband, understand what her heart is telling her about her affair, all the while dealing with her everyday life with her fellow waitress friends (Adrienne Shelly and Cheryl Hines) and a grumpy old customer (Andy Griffith) who happens to own the restaurant where she works.Every character in this film is memorable for one reason or another, including several minor character such as the short-order cook of the restaurant, and even a mother and her young, obnoxious son who frequent the restaurant and strike fear into the pregnant protagonist. Andy Griffith in particular grabs the audience's attention and makes his role a true standout.The only major criticism that can be brought against the film is some of the camera work. At times the focus is unclear with the camera seemingly unsure which actors it should be staying on and at times simply not being in focus at all. However, it is such a minor issue and would go unnoticed to most audiences that it certainly doesn't bring the quality of the film down in any way.Adrienne Shelly who acted in, wrote and directed the film (as well as co-set designed, co- costume designed and even provided one of the songs for the film) has left one perfect little film here. It is such a tragedy that she did not live to see this film's release as it certainly would have given her the success she so richly deserved. This film can easily be recommended to anybody who has a heart.",Waitress
89,NutzieFagin,Blue Plate Special Delight,7,17 May 2012,"I have a friend that loves odd little independent flicks. We have some weekends where we go out for a movie and either she or I get to pick. Because she picks movies that I never hear of, she literally drags me kicking and screaming to the theater and I always think I will hate it--Problem is that she is never wrong.... I found Waitresss as entertaining as a fine five course meal.The plot is very simple. Meet Jenna (Keri Russell) a pretty but quirky young woman who works as a waitress in a diner that specializes in home baked pies located in some sleepy Southern town. Jenna's only passion in life is concocting delicious pies with odd ingredients off the top of her head which she has special names for them depending on her mood or what is happening in her life. However, she feels trapped in a loveless marriage with her overbearing caveman husband, Earl (Jeremy Sisto) who treats her more like his possession than a wife. Her life changes drastically when she gets accidentally pregnant by her husband whom she plots to leave one day and win a contest to become a pie baking champion. Jenna feels hopeless for her life but again fate lends a hand when she meets and has a affair with the handsome new doctor, Dr Pometter (Nathan Fullion) Now Jenna must face some choices and challenges about her life.The other characters are just as quirky. Jenna's two co-workers Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn played by the talented director herself, Adrianne Shelly are Jenna's best friends and probably considered family. The owner of the diner,rich Old Joe, played by Andy Griffith is a cranky curmudgeon with a somewhat lovable air about him. I always thought that the reason Jenna's character got along so well with Old Joe because both characters seem to look at life with a somewhat pessimistic attitude.I think the film explores the choices that people make in life--sometimes bad or morally corrupt. Nobody is condemned or ridiculed but often shown how they arrive at their chosen destination. And as we go thru life running ""like chickens with their heads cut off"" we may eventually arrive to a conclusion that we made the wrong choice. If so, the only right thing to do is ""make a clean break and start over"" I would also advise that the film has been criticized as NOT male friendly. A lot of people feel that the male characters are blamed for all the bad things in life--I disagree and you will have to make the choice after seeing it. I think that each character made their own situations and bad choices.Also a warning, that this film will make you HUNGRY! Various pie recipes are shown and by the end of the film, you'll probably be looking for desert. It also has made me somewhat of a pie maker myself! It is a tragedy that such a talent like Adrianne Shelly was taken away from us before her time. I believe that had she lived, she would be seeing Academy Award.",Waitress

This is the movie for you!,4,18 June 2007,"I don't know the background of the writer, director, etc., but if they were man-hating lesbians, this movie would be the logical result. OK, Earl the husband is slime, fine. The doctor is slime, but in a slightly more nuanced way--it takes Keri Russell a little longer to figure that out, and of course discard him like a used tissue without a trace of regret or feeling. The goofy boyfriend of the other waitress is slime--a jerk, whose only quality is persistence. The doctors that Keri interviews in her search for a doctor--all male--are slime for a variety of reasons. The chef at the restaurant is slime--cheating on his wife for no good reason and just being a miserable human being. The Andy Griffith character is allowed a good moment or two, but Keri is the only one who can stand him.To sum up, there is not one male character in the movie worthy of respect, or even a neutral feeling. The women on the other hand are all sisters-under-the-skin and reluctant to hurt each other, just happy-go-lucky gals out for a good time.They key scene is at the end, where Keri has her baby (a girl, of course), and realizes that she doesn't need men at all!

92,tritisan,Like a chocolate sardine pie,7,23 July 2007,"I give the people who made this film credit for not providing easy answers or making things unambiguous. Everybody was complicated. Everybody was somewhat confused by their own reactions and behaviors. This is how most of us humans feel, most of the time, methinks.However...I'm glad I'm not the only one here who has to feel like defending Earl. Yes, he was a controlling jerk. But other than the one time he slapped her*, did he do anything else truly bad or immoral? Did he have an affair? (We don't know for sure, but there was no indication of that at all in the film.) He was emotionally needy and annoying, but was he really that bad? All the characters in this film are ""bad"", from a strictly moralistic POV. I don't think Jenna was evil by any means, but at the end I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. What's the message to young women here? It seems to be something like, ""Being empowered means diddling whoever you like (getting lucky with no consequences)"", or maybe, ""Pray for a kind, old, sugar daddy who will leave you all his money, and not even expect anything in return, so you can be 'independent' (getting lucky, again)"", or how 'bout, ""If you find yourself in an unpleasant/borderline abusive relationship, simply turn off your emotions and be cold to your partner without being honest with yourself or with him; anything you do to remedy the situation (like running away or having an affair or dumping him the moment his first child is born) is okay-dokey"", or (my favorite feminist message), ""Rearing a child by yourself is really great and not as hard as it looks.""* Has anyone else noticed the double standard around slapping? I'm not talking about punching or beating, just slapping. In most films or shows I've seen, when a man slaps a woman, it's portrayed as a BIG NO NO. But when the woman slaps the man, it's usually presented as justifiable or played for laughs. Is this because of the power dynamic between the sexes?

93,nuhc,Predictable & boring,3,2 December 2007,"My wife rented this movie so I was obliged to watch it with her. Midway through the movie I was trying to stay interested in it.What's so bad about this movie? Well first the storyline seems to be the same thing over & over. If the story had gone into more detail how Jenna ended up in a bad marriage other than ""he changed after we got married"" and had some more back story with some of the other characters, it may have been a better movie. As it was, it was just ""pregnant waitress in unhappy marriage gets involved in an affair with her doctor"" for about an hour & a half, with a predictable ending. Before the end of the movie I told my wife that she'd get rid of her husband and win the pie contest. I also knew that Old Joe would help her out financially somehow.The other thing I hated about this movie was how every male character was unlikable, with the exception of Old Joe at the end. The controlling, abusive, lousy husband for one; the unethical doctor with a loving wife getting a little with the main character on the side; the jerk of a boss who never has anything nice to say to his employees; and the psycho stalker 5-minute date of one of the waitresses.Another unbelievable aspect was at the end when Jenna told her husband she wanted a divorce, and later ended her affair with her doctor, yet there were no repercussions from a psycho controlling abusive ex-husband or a jilted ex-lover. It's like once she made the decision to get rid of them, that was that. There was a chance for more story there but the chance was ignored. I know the movie is supposed to be a romantic comedy, but there was already a portrayal of domestic violence, so why not a little more story? I suppose women will really enjoy this movie while most men will probably hate it. And that's OK for a chick flick but this one leaves so much to be desired.",Waitress
94,matthewtessnear,Real-Life Relationships Film,8,6 January 2019,"I love pie, and that drew me to this movie. What I found was a tale about a waitress who bakes amazing pies. I also found a story that showcases realistic relationships we all struggle through-the people who hurt us, the people who lift us up and the people who absolutely change our lives. I'm not usually a Nathan Fillion fan, but he is perfect in this role. And I was never a huge Keri Russell fan with Felicity or her other roles, but she is also perfectly cast here. Other than the sad tale of the director in real life, I'm so happy with how this whole production plays out in the end.",Waitress
95,phillipstephenso,Life,10,7 May 2007,"Life begins and ends in this fine production, which also celebrates motherhood, just in time for this year's celebration of Mother's Day. Keri Russell is the expectant mother, who is no longer in love with her husband, Jeremy Sisto. She remembers him getting her drunk one night, as the origin of her being knocked up. Meanwhile, she works as waitress and the ""pie genius"" at a pie restaurant, that serves untold numbers of different and unusual sorts of pies. In fact, she is constantly day-dreaming of different recipes for pies. Her waitress friends are also two engaging and well-developed characters, who have problems of their own, but no pregnancy. The owner of the restaurant is Andy Griffith, who is marvelous as a grumpy but ultimately golden-hearted daily customer and confidant of Keri. Finally, Nathan Fillion is the doctor, who supervises the progress of Keri's pregnancy, with unexpected results.Without giving away too many more of the further twists and turns of the plot, this is a charming ensemble of actors and actresses, who depict expertly the common personalities found often in small-town America, something similar to Andy Griffith's Mayberry, in fact.But, the film's focus on a pregnant woman is touching and realistic. In fact, few films do such a good job of capturing the ambivalence and serious issues of love, life, vulnerability, violence, and death faced by a pregnant woman like this one.",Waitress
96,someofusarebrave,patriarchy strikes again!,5,26 November 2010,"I really hated this movie. I thought I was going to like it and then I didn't at all. I like Keri Russell all right, and I adore Nathan Fillion--as actors, people!--but this script really bothered me. The woman puts up with tons of b.s. from the people around her, and eventually this tendency to befriend gruff old coots everyone else has the sense to stay away from and to let herself be made into a doormat pays off in the form of enough money presumably to live off of. She talks about leaving her husband for months, but puts it off because pregnant women can't leave their husbands, apparently. She eventually falls for a married man, who falls equally hard for her and who she eventually becomes ""best friends"" with. Then, she decides she wants to run away with him after telling him she doesn't want to be ""saved""--which he doesn't seem to be offering--but her baby arrives at precisely the moment she at last decides to run, of course. The baby she never wanted gives her the courage to leave her husband, but she turns down her lover's offer to be with her and perhaps leave his wife for her, which certainly seems to be real enough. Thus, we all learn that we will become as strong as we can possibly be once we have babies, regardless how we feel about this at the time. We also learn that we ought to stand up for women we haven't met--not for their right to know the truth, but rather to be coddled and treated like children by those who claim to love us most. Parts of this movie are definitely funny and it's worth seeing for the actors and actresses alone, but the end result of so much build-up to this woman striking out independently eventually left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I've never seen a woman suddenly transcend her troubles upon giving birth, and I believe the assumption that women immediately will has caused a lot of trouble and pain. This movie began with a clear and strident and welcome desire to tell the truth. It ended on a note that indicated women cannot possibly be happy if we follow our heart, but must instead follow our wombs to bliss. Apparently we are little more than baby-making and cooking machines, intended to give to other people rather than welcome unexpected surprises that come into our lives and please only ourselves.",Waitress

I think this is not the best show he has given.This film is so awful,because all we keep seeing is this girl and her doctor ""get it on"". Old Joe is a friend, but really does not help the situation. Keri Russell plays a pregnant girl on the skids with her boyfriend. She has an affair with her obstetrician and goes gaga over him. With all the movies about ""lost Love"" and ""broken Hearts"", I thought this wasn't so great at all.

If I were her, I would have dreamed of an escape from her horribly screechy-voiced co-workers as well. And perhaps the director, who seemed unable to draw decent performances from any of the central cast, including Keri Russell (there are scenes that make you cringe almost as badly as Russell is cringing on-screen).Pretty much the only redeeming factor in this film was Nathan Fillion's portrayal of a likeable neurotic doctor. However, his character makes decisions that are never really explained or explored and thus remain mainly as background to the waitress' life.Still, the script is not quite run-of-the-mill enough to deserve to be completely crushed.

99,drama59,Great Script and well acted by an amazing cast,9,26 December 2015,"Adrienne Shelly did a wonderful job of crafting, directing and acting in this amazing story of the lives of several people in a small town. Keri Russell is wonderful as Jenna who is a woman trapped in a loveless marriage with no hopes of anything for the future. Her abusive husband played by Jeremy Sisto (who did a wonderful job) showed the plight of the middle American woman and the anguish they suffer in a small town and the small minded egocentric self absorbed male that feels the woman is there to serve his needs and nothing more. Nathan Fillion was wonderful as the small town doctor that provided a ray of hope to his patient Jenna. He gave a glimpse of what is could be like to be wanted and loved. Cheryl Hines is great as Becky the hardened woman with an invalid husband who just wants more out of life. Adrienne Shelly is superb as Dawn. Her quirky character looking for love is priceless. Andy Griffith is great as Joe the cranky Pie Shop Owner who only wanted the life he could have had but always passed on. I would recommend this to anyone. This Tranche de vie is well worth watching. The cast is perfect and the script is wonderful. The sad part is that Adrienne was killed shortly after making this movie. It looked at first that she had committed suicide but later determined that she had been killed by a worker in her building. She caught him trying to steal from her purse and he killed her and made it look like a suicide. He later confessed to these facts. She left behind a husband and small daughter (who appears in the film). Perhaps more of a ""chick flick"" I would suggest this to anyone who loves a good movie.

I can't believe how many people rated it highly here... it's stunning. Shocking.Really sucks that she died and all, but I won't give this a good rating just because she kicked the bucket.

I haven't seen any of the other films she has directed, but I did love her acting in the Hal Hartley film ""Trust"" (1990). She was an incredible talent. ""Waitress"" is a beautiful story. All the characters were well acted and were perfectly nuanced. The story spends just the right amount of time with each one, it doesn't skip a beat. Each role is played flawlessly; every scene delivers and moves on. The pacing is key in the enjoyment of this film. Every turn and reveal is fresh and thought out.

102,garydiamond,An offbeat romantic comedy... just how I like 'em.,7,26 February 2009,"I must confess, I'm a huge fan of the cancelled and much missed television series Firefly and it's excellent silver screen adaptation Serenity; Nathan Fillion's work in particular. I consider him an underrated actor and checked out this picture just to see more of his range. What I was not expecting was a charming little picture alive with intriguing fantasy touches, eager to tell a good story but not eager to fill the audience with sap and morality tales, which is always refreshing.Keri Russell is a good-looking lady and she embodies her character well. I see hints of a young Debbie Harry in her features and the potential to carve out a good career - in fact if you check her resume you'll find she is keeping busy. Andy Griffith is a revelation as the crusty proprietor of the pie shop where she works as a waitress, dispensing wisdom and cynicism between tersely ordering his daily meals. Nathan Fillion does well as the somewhat awkward yet charming doctor who sweeps Jenna off of her feet - good to see him on the big screen again.The film is shot simply, yet effectively. There are some good cutaways where Jenna defines her life as a series of pies she imagines in her mind, and the two ""spontaneous kiss"" scenes between her and Pomatter are among the most touching and subtly comedic embraces I've seen in this style of picture. Shelley captures several moments of emotion well and shows all that could have been had fate not intervened to stop her making more movies - her script and directing are consistent and enjoyable throughout.The only thing that lets the picture down is the abrupt way it concludes, tying up loose threads so fast that the stitches run and make it look messy. It deflates the impact of the picture and loses a whole star, especially the way Old Joe and Pomatter are dismissed without any dwelling on the moment. Little thought is given to many of the other periphery characters too. The movie could have stood an extra ten or fifteen minutes to present us with a fully absorbed finale.Still, some faults aside, this is yet another positive example of the creativity you sometimes encounter when delving into lower-budget independently financed films, made without executive meddling from the all-encompassing (and usually formulaic) Hollywood machine. It is vaguely reminiscent of ""Mystic Pizza (1988)"" in setting and execution yet manages to be a much more consistent piece of work, ending aside.Anyone looking for quirky romantic comedy in the vein of ""Sliding Doors (1998)"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)"" or ""Stranger Than Fiction (2006)"" would do well to pick up a copy of this. Just be sure that you have a supply of delicious pies handy for consumption afterwards.",Waitress
103,forindcine,Waitress - Honor Adrienne Shelly for her wonderful film.,8,3 June 2007,"Waitress is a delicious comedy about Jenna, (Keri Russell) a discontented waitress living in the south with an amazing knack for creating pies that relay her feelings. She is in a terrible marriage with Earl (Jeremy Sisco) who plays her unreasonable and controlling husband. The bright spots in her life are her co-worker waitresses, Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn (Adrienne Shelly). Becky is in her 40's with an invalid husband but is completely obsessed with how gravity has treated her left breast. Dawn, the unique one in the group can't find a good man and has resorted to 5-minute dates as a last resort. They all work at 'Joe's Pie Diner' where Jenna whips up the most hilarious ingredients and names for pies imaginable. She finds out she's pregnant but doesn't want the child because it will prevent her escaping her husband and starting a new life. Becky and Dawn are excited about the 'little girl' on the way and give Jenna a baby book in which she writes a letter to her soon-to-be offspring. This narration, Jenna's pie-making, and perfectly cast characters all blend together and make a most appetizing comedy. You even get Old Joe (Andy Griffith) a mature, hilarious yet picky patron and owner of the diner. Indie film star, Adrienne Shelly who wrote, directed, and played 'Dawn' in this film, was murdered in her New York apartment last November just prior to her best work being released at Sundance. Honor her by enjoying the growth of independent cinema and Shelly's wonderful ability to make us laugh.Go see Waitress. As the film's tagline says, ""If only life were as easy as pie.""",Waitress

OK, she is pretty and there are some funny lines. But aren't pie recipes a bit, er, boring?

Instead of bringing something new to the party, this film just keeps recycling these tired old clichés in obvious, trite and unrealistic ways. I kept thinking, well, it's a comedy, it's only for fun. But obvious and unrealistic humour to work has to go over the top, like Steve Martin or Leslie Nielsen. Obvious and unrealistic humour about pies and men being meanies is just dull.

105,gpaltrow2001,"Wonderful! Thank you, Ms. Shelly !",9,6 December 2007,"This movie gets 9 stars for the brilliance of Adrienne Shelly. I read up on her after watching 'Waitress' and found that her film history goes back to 1989, although most Americans haven't heard of her. She has been acting and directing for a long time, and even though I haven't seen her other films, I suspect they are directed with feminine, independent panache. It is truly a Shakesperean tragedy that once Ms. Shelly reached the pinnacle of her career she was cut down. There is no other movie this wonderful, that is written, directed and co-starred by a woman, who is then silenced. Now, apart from the praise of Ms. Shelly, the movie itself is amazing. It is low-budget but doesn't act it. That is thanks to the insightful, funny and touching script, and the set pieces that take place in a small town. I rented this DVD for my girlfriend and me to watch, knowing we would enjoy it based solely on reviews I had read. Keri Russell was incredible; I had no idea she was this skilled as an actress. Every supporting character has a purpose, and we become invested in them. The husband is the worst I have ever seen portrayed; I suspect that Ms. Shelly took every horrible line she had ever heard louts utter and inserted them into the mouth of this Neanderthal. I said to my girlfriend at one point, ""I'm embarrassed to be a guy right now."" The pies are brilliant and sensuous; my girlfriend in particular liked the 'Naughty Pumpkin Pie'. The movie is a romantic comedy/fantasy drama. It is both real and unreal, taking place in a universe just slightly out of sync with our own. It is a slice of pie heaven that will leave you wanting seconds. P.S. Cheryl Hines, always good and who plays the third waitress after Keri Russell and Adrienne Shelly, is set to direct Ms. Shelly's apparent last script, 'Serious Moonlight', set to be released in 2009. I'm already looking forward to it.",Waitress

The point of making us prattle on (as I'm doing) is completely lost on me. How verbose do I have to be to share an opinion about a movie? Anyways, this movie was a cute movie and I think could have been really good. The problem is that the timing and flow of the movie is completely off, sometimes taking you all the way out of the movie and leaving you to sit and wonder why you are watching it. When the movie does have good points (Andy Griffith, or some intimate scenes with the lead) it really does a good job of driving home.The ending leaves much to be desired with our lead, after not caring for her child at all, has an epiphany that suddenly lets her divorce her abusive husband and leave the person she has a fling with. It is horribly unbelievable and pat. It also raises the question of what men are good for in this movie besides making babies (the husband), giving someone money they didn't earn (Andy) or giving someone support and help just to be crapped on (Nathan). In the end it left me unfulfilled and annoyed.",Waitress

Javier Bardem). were the best supporting actor Oscar mine to bestow, i'd give it to Sisto. amazing portrayal.Andy Griffith is wonderful as Joe. how many roles for octogenarians are that ripe? and of those roles, how many are acted with charisma? i loved Nathan Fillion as the doctor. i found his awkward attraction believable and his comic timing impeccable: ""well, then, i'll see you on Friday, Mrs. Hunterson...(long pause)... i wish it were Friday."" that the 3 waitresses are beautifully portrayed goes without saying.one other psychological truth in the movie concerns rescuing. Jenna is a diamond in the rough. her radiance and charisma are quite visible to the audience, but not to most of those in Jenna's life. Joe sees her; Dr. Pommater sees her. of course they fall in love with her - just as we, the audience, do. of course both want to rescue her - just as we in the audience do.that Joe can legitimately rescue her and that Dr. Pommater cannot is one of the subtle truths that make this movie more than just a diversion. that Jenna tells Dr. Pommater, ""and don't try to rescue me"" is just so right for the integrity of her street-smart character.",Waitress

The scenes dragged on and the pie making narration could have become something of a visual metaphor if setup a bit better.The reason for this unusually high rating is for the utter relief of a protagonist who is safely away from an aggressive husband and that she evolves into loving her child on first inspection which is typical to many new mothers.A nice entertaining moment for feminists who are eager to man hate and who also might have found peace during a reluctant venture into motherhood.In conclusion: A pro-life message outside of the authors intentions ensues, peoples ability to adapt is beyond question.RIP Ms Shelly x",Waitress

She plots her escape while having an affair with a married doctor. To make everything worse, she's pregnant but does not want the baby. The writer/director wants to make a light, sweet comedy out of this grim stuff. It does not work at all. It's as if someone took the script of ""Medea"" and tried to make a rom-com.

At least SOMEONE in a horror movie typically has a good intention, even if they do end up dying. lol.. Seriously though, I thought this to be a chick flick my wife (and even I) would enjoy. There is almost NO comedy to this story. What is worse is the moral that this movie teaches. Basically it teaches you that basically all marriages are doomed and therefore you should have sex with whoever you want with reckless abandon. Yeah, you do eventually get one other lesson which is that women are really better off alone than to be with anyone. I was consistently perturbed that every character in this movie, except Dawn, due to their openness to adultery. It's wrong, no it isn't wrong, it's wrong, it isn't, OK OK it isn't - insert sexual scene here. My wife and I watched with anticipation of seeing just ONE character showing the others that there was a better way to live. That moment never came. They should simply call this Desperate Housewives: The Movie. In the end this movie simply teaches that life is horrible (in particular talking about marriage) so you should do anything you want to please yourself and make it less horrible for you.

113,xander34,Refreshing,7,21 May 2007,"It is awfully difficult to write about the new pie-filled romantic comedy Waitress without indiscreetly mentioning the tragic death of its writer, director, and co-star Adrienne Shelly. Whenever a wonderfully unique moment occurred in the film, there was a realization that Shelly will sadly never reach her true potential made evident in the film. A major hit at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, one would think Waitress would be a strange, oddly funny gem of a film, due to the festival's independent sensibilities. Yet what starts as that refreshing, different type of a film, turns into another familiar, mainstream romantic comedy.The film starts with Jenna, perfectly played by Keri Russell, a waitress at a southern diner, who soon discovers that she is pregnant. Jenna's greatest gift is her apparent extraordinary ability to create amazingly delicious pies. Making her own original pies with inventive names seems to help her escape from life with her angry, insecure, narcissistic husband (Jeremy Sisto). Giving Jenna more of a reason to simply run away from her marriage is her new gynecologist, Dr. Potmatter (Nathan Fillion), whom she soon has an affair with. The film is loaded with other memorable roles including her fellow waitresses Becky (Cheryl Hines), and Dawn (Shelly), Dawn's eccentric poetry shouting stalker/boyfriend Ogie (Eddie Jemison), and Old Joe, the diner's owner, and the man whom only Jenna can tolerate, unforgettably brought to life by Andy Griffith.Waitress is one of the better romantic comedies a wife would drag her husband to, with supremely enjoyable moments, hilarious bits of dialogue, and a first-rate performance by Russell. Her performance is key to the film, as she is basically the only fully developed character. Yet, by the end of the day, the Waitress is still a very light, undoubtedly sentimental, but genuinely pleasant offering by a filmmaker who should have had a great future as an auteur.",Waitress

As she dreams of escaping her abusive husband, Earl, played by Jeremy Sisto, she discovers an unwanted pregnancy.THIS one event will set into motion a series of changes in her life, starting with her new physician, Dr. Pomatter, played nicely by Nathan Fillion. There is an immediate chemistry between the two and it only serves to make this film even better. A relationship develops between the two married parties, and Jenna begins to dream of escaping to a much better life.There is also some great wit and banter between Russell and Andy Griffith, portraying Old Joe, the pie shop's ornery owner. And some terrific exchanges between Russell's Jenna and her co-workers Becky (Cheryl Hines of HBO's CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM) and Dawn (played perfectly by the auteur Shelly).Some reviewers have unfairly criticized the ending, of which I won't give away, however, I will say that movies are an escape, and chances are you will exit this particular movie feeling very good.A pretty good escape. A very good film. And a great legacy for Shelly, by any standards.",Waitress
120,davegrenfell,Not enough happening,4,1 August 2007,"This film is twenty minutes too long. I don't know why, because nothing much happens in the first 45 minutes. We find out our heroine is pregnant, and likes making pies, and works as a Waitress. Then we are reminded of those facts, over and over again.The woman is bored of her life, so the film shows this, quite mistakenly, in a very boring way. My feeling is, the more boring a character's life is, the more dynamic and rapid the camera and editing should be, to provide contrast and stop us all falling asleep.After the big kiss happens, at the 45 minutes mark (twenty five minutes too late) there aren't enough consequences. Nobody finds out. Nobody gets in trouble. That's not enough. Why does she cheat at all if there aren't going to be problems because of it? The film reminded me a good deal of that Sarah Polley movie My Life Without Me, about the mom who gets cancer, doesn't tell anyone, has an affair that no-one finds out about, then dies. Where's the drama? The conflict? Adrienne Shelley was a great actor and creative spirit, and somebody needs to get back in the editing room and kick this film into shape so it provides a fitting testament to her. As it stands, it's like a stage play in an early draft.",Waitress
121,chasburch,Actors cannot overcome cardboard characterizations,4,15 December 2007,"I'm fairly surprised at the relatively hight ratings of this movie. I came away feeling cheated, primarily because the script created such cardboard characters.Jenna is a waitress with a genius for pie recipes in a Southern town that should have been named Misogynyville. All the waitresses in the diner where Jenna works commiserate in a support network of lowered expectations concerning the male sex. Every man is either goofy, grumpy or just plain obnoxious, as in the case of Jenna's husband, Earl. Just how bright and charming Jenna happened to marry a Neanderthal like Earl is never fully explained, except for a reference to the fact that he ""changed"" after he married her. This would imply that Earl was clever enough to hide his true nature during courtship, which I truly doubt.Jenna becomes pregnant after an ill-advised bout of drunken lovemaking with Earl, which sidetracks her plans of becoming independent. She finds that her doctor has semi-retired, and a new, attractive (albeit nervous) doctor is taking over her practice. He is a nice man, therefore from out of town. Wonder what happens next? Anyway the plot twists which are not predictable are baffling, as characters exhibit behavior that serves the plot but not their persona. The principle actors give nice performances, and there is a decent bit from Andy Griffith at the town's gruff but lovable old man, but not enough to save a script that needed some re-writes.",Waitress
122,augurar,Just awful,1,23 November 2011,"Here's a brief summary of this mess of a film. A young waitress and pie-maker is trapped in an unhappy marriage. After becoming pregnant, she mopes around and has an affair for about an hour and a half, after which all her problems are solved by cute baby footage and a kindly old moneybags ex machina.Plotting, as you may have guessed from the above summary, suffered from the writer's obvious lack of talent. In terms of dramatic action, the movie basically introduced its premise (a pregnant woman in an unhappy situation has an affair with her doctor), stagnated for an extended period of time, and then resolved everything suddenly at the end as Earl, Dr. Pomatter, and Old Joe simultaneously vanish in a puff of smoke. This is not how you make a plot!I can't really comment on characterization in this film, because there weren't any characters. The worst portrayal was the husband Earl, a ridiculously exaggerated figure with no redeeming qualities or really any qualities at all beyond being mean. The lead character was also very poorly drawn – I think she was supposed to represent a strong character trapped in a bad situation, but in reality she did almost nothing for the whole movie before suddenly finding her true calling as a mother. She didn't develop in any way – basically she just suffered for a while and then had all her problems solved by money and a divorce. The doctor is as much of an empty shell as everyone else. Pretty much all he does is make doctor-like remarks that sound about as realistic as the setup for a pornographic scene, mixed with unconvincing declarations of feeling. I suppose he is supposed to seem sincere and romantic, but it just doesn't work.",Waitress
123,PresidentForLife,Neither Good Nor Bad,5,31 March 2008,"This is one of those movies that's a darling of the critics, but there really isn't much that hasn't been said before, and better. It reminded me a bit of the movie ""Chocolat,"" which centered on a much stronger single woman character, but without the surreal charm. The male characters - even the bad husband and the stalker who becomes a different husband - were more complex, if not well developed, than the wimpy female leads, whose lives seemed to stand for the propositions that: 1) women don't need men, and children don't need fathers; 2) adultery is the key to relieving boredom of any kind, and 3) even a stalker is better than being single. That the gruff Andy Griffith character would go off and never be seen again, leaving the legacy of a life-changing gift, was totally predictable. To all this triteness, I must say BAH.",Waitress
124,Affirmative_Dave,Misandrists will love the movie,6,1 July 2009,"It is refreshing to view new faces from time to time. I like ""Waitress"" for that: a decent movie that tells an interesting story based on original ideas where not-that-famous actors play.Russell and Sisto do really a good job. They are convincing and rightfully cast for their respective role.So, where is the problem?While the editing of the film is ""funny"" at times, the script is the problem. In several places the situations are irrelevant, not credible. The reactions of the people are often ridiculous. And men act strange...The message intended from the director becomes quickly very clear: simply put, she hates men. From half of the movie it appears clearly that the director is a woman, and during the second half, it becomes obvious she must have some sort of revenge to take on men...I liked the ending though and gave the movie a 6 instead of 5.",Waitress
125,brainyidiot,annoyance as entertainment?,3,16 November 2007,"It's difficult to say anything bad about a motion picture after the brutal murder of its director. What can you say about a picture where the most appealing thing about it is a wonderful selection of pies. The actors do their best struggling to bring meaning into a script that falls flat in its attempt to reflect true life with a meandering story that has you laboriously counting the minutes after a promising first half hour. The big question that comes to mind is how can an attractive women have such a jerk as a husband-be passive about it, and could a doctor really fall for a bloated pregnant mental case of a woman-especially after it's revealed that he has a loving together wife of his own? All the main characters except Andy Griffith are completely annoying and unworthy of any entertainment value. It's basically a chick flick gone bad and a total waste of talent and time. If you wish to feel pain watching painful lives you might like it. Others beware.",Waitress
126,miriamwebster,Pie in the Sky,3,28 November 2007,"Sadly, I must agree with person who suggested that the overwhelming critical acclaim that greeted this movie almost certainly had lots more to do with its tragic back story (director/writer/co-star Adrienne Shelly was murdered shortly before film's Sundance premiere) than anything that transpires on screen. As a result, what probably would have been (at best) a so-so direct-to-video release or forgettable made-for-cable time-killer is now a vastly over-rated disappointment that can't begin to live up to its hype. Doesn't help that DVD's misleading marketing campaign sells this as a feel-good ""chick lite"" comedy. Not even close--unless your idea of ""delicious fun"" (to quote prominent cover blurb) is story of a spunky-but-conflicted diner drudge who hopes her pie-baking skills will get her out of a hellacious marriage (complete with physical violence) and a twisted relationship with a weird obstetrician whose unethical tactics should have him called before a medical board. Plot is reminiscent of a very dark episode of TV's Alice (right down to supporting characters straight out of Mel's Diner: a wise-cracking waitress, a ditzy waitress, a grouchy cook, quirky customers), tricked out with spousal abuse, extra-marital trysts, an unwanted pregnancy and flat-out illogical plotting and unbelievable situations. (Knowing that her mean-tempered husband is looking for her, why would a woman who is trying to escape from an abusive marriage wait for a bus on the main drag of a small town? In what diner would a full-time waitress also be expected--let alone have the time--to bake the dozens of pies that are the restaurant's specialty? And why. . .) Broad characterizations, fuzzy motivation and occasional lapses into tired sitcom shtick don't help.Keri Russell is winning as the hard luck hash-slinger with pie-in-the-sky dreams and rest of the appealing cast (including Cheryl Hines and an under-used Andy Griffith) does what it can. Unfortunately, they're all stuck with a stale recipe in which pathos and whimsy never begin to gel and, unlike the heroine's famous pastries, this film just doesn't pan out. For a much more entertaining and involving movie in a somewhat similar vein, see Julianne Moore in the far superior The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio, based on true story of a low-income 1950's housewife who used her jingle-writing contest skills to keep her off-kilter family afloat.",Waitress
127,adiwsusanto,Must See Movie,8,13 January 2008,"OK, let's start. The movie somehow catch me from the very beginning. Right at the moment when Jenna stir the chocolate & says things in her minds, it already captured me. I hope this going to be a good movie. I was wrong, this is a GREAT movie. Jenna struggles through her miserable life and her only way out is her pie.The thing that I thing is missing is that the film didn't elaborate more on how she got married in the first place and how her mama lived her life and passed away. The doctor's life was also not drilled deep enough to understand why he needs to have a fling.The film is all about Jenna and how little things around her change her life, her decision towards life. It's a bit cliché and I can sort of guess the ending, still I love this movie. Not so many crying moments, I even had more laughs. GREAT movie, must see.",Waitress
128,tomm-25,Chick flick? Morality Tale? Dark Comedy?,3,2 July 2007,"While I hesitate to be a party-pooper, I must call a spade a spade and say that (IMHO) this film would probably NOT have gained general release had it not been for the tragic circumstances of the writer/director's demise.The acting is fine, 'tho a bit amateurish, the editing is crisp, and the cinematography is acceptable. The major faults lie in the story and direction. There's hardly any substance here. It's doesn't work as comedy - not even light-grey (certainly not ""dark"") comedy... characters are poorly developed (except for what other chrs have to say about them -- sure, Earl is a jerk, but not all that bad a jerk, and - for that matter, so is the sexually exploitative and wholly unethical Dr. P, and Becky and Dawn tell us that Joe is insufferable and Cal a mean-spirited slave-driver). The only chr I could see with any clarity was Ogie (sp?), and that's because there wasn't much there to begin with. No one's motives were any more than hearsay by other chrs.Was this a morality tale? A comedy? A spoof? (Of what?) A love story? (certainly not! How could one see the frantic necking and sex between Dr. P and Jenna as being in any way serious?) It could be called a ""chick flick,"" but only if the definition of chick-flick insists that every male chr be a self-interested, sex-seeking arschloch. Were the chrs stereotypes? Clichés? WHAT WAS THE POINT?To be sure, this was an earnest effort at film-making/storytelling, but it falls far short of just about everything except ""cute.""",Waitress

To go to a movie like this one, as enjoyable as it is and then somehow try to ""politicize"" it is a sad commentary on the current state of America.Anyway, the movie does borrow some elements from the movies ""Thelma and Louise"" and also ""Like Water For Chocolate"".It is sad to see Adrienne Shelly in the movie, however this movie is a real gem. And very funny. Ms. Shelly's writing and direction of the movie was superb. The supporting cast are all great and I was not even expecting much from Andy Griffith, but he was great in this movie.

130,Ben7,"Mate, Then Eat the Male",5,19 May 2008,"It's been nearly a century now that the so-called emancipation of women has been underway. Patriarchy is by definition unjust, and the resentments harbored by women forced to live under such a social arrangement have been brilliantly exploited by capitol. As women entered the workplace, prices rose, ultimately resulting in an economy that provides two workers for the price of one. Few families can get by on just dad's paycheck these days. Cynical unsupervised children are left unattended to do who-knows what while the role of the father is passed on to putative ""new families"" of peers. Mom and dad, if dad is indeed in the house, come home too tired to really participate in their children's lives, and in any event, there are myriad electronic distractions to pass the time apart while under the same roof. Just as a heterosexual romance written by a gay or lesbian writer is the product of imagination and supposition, this New York intellectual's vision of the lives of bumpkins prone to violence and double negatives also misses the mark. As an earlier user comment notes, feminism, though spawned from excesses of the past, has shot right through equality into a battle of the sexes. Look at the male characters. Andy Griffith plays a sexually harmless grouch who has the good grace to die at a convenient point in the narrative and leave our heroine a quarter mil in hard cash. Served his purpose. Earl, the abusive husband, is just a shade better portrayed than utterly two-dimensional, although even he was necessary to provide the seed for mama's little girl. The boss at the diner admits to having no ambition beyond the momentary, and serves as a studly cipher for the cause of getting Cheryl Hines' ashes hauled. Neither Hines' character nor Russel's would touch the goofy but earnest guy who wins the heart of the goofy waitress with a 10-foot pole, but what the heck? He's good enough for her, ha ha ha. Forget the ethics, professional and personal, the doc was about to do the right thing by Russel's character when a biological imperative wrenched the moment from their hands. Russel said he was her best friend, but she's willing to jettison that rare connection with little thought once she has foaled a new female to mold into a man-hating Amazon. The gentle, loving way melted goop was stirred in the fabrication of pies, accompanied by gentle, loving, politically correct ""women's music,"" also grated upon this rough old coot. But that's a minor annoyance alongside this picture's marginalization of half the human race.",Waitress
131,craymond,Kick In The Pants Pie,8,8 June 2007,"Girls, this is a hoot of a chick flick, but you can tell your guys not to worry. As I told my wife, the main character's (Keri Russell's) husband is such a slob he makes me look like Prince Charming. And what a treat to see Andy Griffith again! We saw ""Knocked Up"" last week, and it was okay I suppose--except for Hollywood's insatiable love of the f* word. The contrast with Waitress is instructive. Knocked Up is the unlikely story about the out-of-wedlock impregnation of a gorgeous blond TV personality by a drugged-up loser. The pregnancy in Waitress is within a marriage, but she despises her husband. One really great thing about both movies is that abortion is never seriously considered as an option. Waitress is a hundred times better, though it probably won't make a fraction of the box office. That's a shame, because this is good stuff. But there's an even sadder note. After the movie I learned that Adrienne Shelley--who wrote, directed and acted (beautifully) in Waitress--was murdered last November...by an illegal immigrant who said he ""was having a bad day.""

And it was so wonderful to see Andy Griffith on the big screen.I am sorry to say that I had not heard of Adrienne Shelly until this film.

134,dancingmike,It's all about the pies,9,31 May 2007,"I'm tagging this with possible spoilers, though most of what I'm writing has been seen already in ""non-spoiler-tagged"" comments.This is a delightful film about self expression. Keri Russell is a waitress, Jenna, who feels trapped in her life. Her husband is a scumbag who seems only to want to own her. He is abusive and feels it necessary to control every aspect of her life. Fortunately he doesn't.The entire cast is terrific and supportive of Jenna on her journey of self-discovery, except for the scumbag, of course. Jenna has become so repressed that she seems to have lost the will to articulate her feelings, so she communicates them through her pies. Whenever she has a problem a pie recipe occurs to her and she pours her feelings into it. This pie baking connection started when her mother (also a master pie maker)would bake pies with her and let the love flow. It was in these times she felt more loved than in any other time in her life.Jenna has a few ""adventures"" on her journey and has a baked response to each one of them. She makes ""evil husband"" pies instead of telling the scumbag what she's feeling. When she becomes pregnant she has such low self esteem that she feels she can't be a good mother. Also, a baby will get in the way of her loosely planned escape from the scumbag. She doesn't feel right about an abortion pie but does bake a ""bad baby"" pie, as she initially takes out her negative feelings on the fetus.Jenna has quite the surprise when she finds her regular OB/GYN has semi-retired and a new doc, a good looking man, has been recruited to take her place. She achieves quite the breakthrough when she lets her feelings out in a non-pie mode and plants a big kiss on the doc. An affair ensues and her pies for him are designed to make him love her more.Her amazing talent with pies has landed her the waitress/pie baker job at Joe's Pies, a shop owned by an apparently old lecher and curmudgeon played by Andy Griffith. None of the other waitresses can stand to wait on him but our Jenna comes to the rescue. As hard as he works at being an old grump, Jenna sees through it and is the only person who ""sees"" him. Joe LOVES Jenna's pies and got a laugh from our audience when he ordered a slice of ""bad baby"" pie.Back to the affair. Jenna is feeling better about her pregnancy because of the doc. She still thinks it will be a bad thing for her and will trap her in her awful marriage forever, but being loved and appreciated just for who she is has helped with her self doubt. But she's always running things through her mind. She swings between getting out of the affair and loving being there. No middling feelings for our Jenna.There is a great friendship between Jenna and her two fellow waitresses, but I won't spend any time on it, as you've no doubt read about it in previous comments. Getting back to Jenna, she experiences joy previously unknown to her in her affair and more degradation by the scumbag, including one incident of public humiliation. What a weasel. Then the water breaks.There's quite the adventure associated with the birth. The doc is in love with her (who wouldn't be?) and the scumbag comes to the room and immediately marks his territory. If there's one thing he is, it's consistent. Joe comes to visit as a fellow patient. He says ""some of his liver needs to be removed"". He gives her a card and tells her to read it later and wanders back to his room.The birth is the usual scene with pain from the wife. The scumbag isn't the slightest bit interested in her pain, but when the baby turns out to be a girl he looks at Jenna like she did this on purpose to disappoint him. Jenna is a bit slow in responding to holding her girl at first but when she does, that unbelievable surge of love you feel when you have your first look at your baby hits her. I remember well when that happened to me. I didn't know I had that much love in me until my children came into my life.Well, this is it for Jenna. She's finally had the experience of someone loving her and appreciating her for who she is. Her hatred toward her husband is at a new peak and she knows what true love is, having seen and held her baby. She finally voices her true feelings to the scumbag's face and he gets ""helped"" out of the hospital by a number of the staff.All good things come to Jenna after taking this big step in her life. I think she will not have trouble expressing herself in words from this point on and we can be sure her ""custom"" pies will continue forever. Jenna's arc is one of beginning with self doubt and swallowing her words and emotions to finding her ""other"" (besides the pies) voice and letting herself say what she's thinking. This allows her to finally reach true happiness.Keri Russell did a wonderful job with this film. She is so expressive that if a fair amount of dialog had been cut you could still tell what was going on just by watching her face and body language. Go see it, you'll laugh a lot and find your heartstrings plucked. It's a terrific film.",Waitress

And this morning I was depressed to learn of her death.Coming back to the movie, Keri was graceful in August Rush and she is beautiful in this movie.

The characters and the relations are so well written and yet so light hearted.All the pies in the movie make me wanna go to a pie diner every morning. After the movie I was in the mood for a 'I wanna fall in love' pie.The characters, the cinematography and the soundtrack - together make a good quirky heart warming experience and not your average too good to be true rom-com flick.Just like Jena's pie with a heart in the middle, I believe Shelly had her heart in this movie.

Shelly wrote a script with an unusually realistic look at humor and relationships. The actors are wonderful; and so are the direction and the script. I have to give a special nod to Any Griffith for the best performance he's ever been allowed to do. At points when you expect the performances to go over the top and become caricatures, the script and the acting pull in tight and come up with subtlety. It's not only worth seeing once, it's worth watching over again for the moments you're afraid you didn't appreciate properly the first time. It has some pacing issues, or I would have marked it higher. It's a real gem, though, the type of movie to signal the start of a brilliant career.

141,RobynHarris,Hold you forever in the middle of my heart,10,22 November 2007,"Sadly, it looks like tonight (Nov 22, 2007) is the last regularly scheduled night for Waitress to play in theaters. I first heard about this film at the Indianapolis Film Festival. From that night in late April, till tonight's last show in Madison, Wisconsin, I've followed, from afar, the story of ""The little movie that could (with pie)"". I've seen the film probably half a dozen times in the last eight months, in theaters all over the eastern US. The more different venues I saw this film in,the more magical it became.I heard Adrienne Shelly, in one of her last interviews, say that she wrote this movie as a love letter to her unborn daughter, Sophie. In much the same way that Jenna wrote a love letter to her unborn daughter, Lulu. For me, the defining moment of this movie was in the delivery room, when Jenna first holds her child. The entire world falls away and all that exists are the two of them: Mother and Daughter. Joined by the eternal and inseparable act of birth.Earl's only prescient moment in the movie was when he tells Jenna, ""Don't you go loving that baby too much."" The threat to his marriage and his control over Jenna did not come from an affair. In the end, both loathsome lunkhead Earl and dapper doctor Pomatter were eclipsed by the true love of Jenna's life, Lulu. That is the elemental truth that the movie touches. As close as the bond is between friends and lovers, man and woman, husband and wife, it does not approach the connection between mother and child.(Jun 25, 2010 -- I saw a scant few moments of this movie again last night on Lifetime and I remembered again why I love it so much. I believe they were showing the film in honor of what would have been Adrienne Shelley's 44th birthday, yesterday. We are thinking of you Adrienne. Thank you for this gift.This is a movie that just gathers your heart up in a big unselfish hug, and you can't help wanting to hug it back.)I recommend this film in the highest possible terms.

I kid you not, this film is one of the most ridiculous steaming piles of poo I have ever seen. I stuck with it because of Nathan Fillion, whom I loved in Firefly. I thought something interesting might happen because he was in it. I was totally wrong.I can't figure out how anyone could give this creeping ick a good review. NOTHING HAPPENS in this film. NOTHING. It shambles like a zombie for two painful hours until this woman squirts out a baby five minutes before the end. Suddenly, she grows a spine and dumps her horrific husband; grows some morals and ends her affair; and as luck would have it becomes independent. Oh, and did I mention that if you're nice to rich old men, they'll give you money? Just because you can make a good pie. Mark my words, ladies. If you can cook, a man will look after you.While some of the dialog is funny and the characters amusing, the messages and themes of the story are appalling.The writer-director, Adrienne Shelly, was murdered just before the film was finished. I can't help but think all the hoo-ha and awards are pity awards. This bag of junk should never have made it into the can. It's a pity because there was a lot of true talent involved. The actors are not one iota at fault for the lack of direction and plot.Oh, and most of the pies looked and sounded disgusting. I don't know how that's possible, but they managed it.",Waitress

144,GrayAreaDVM,Men are not all misogynistic,1,15 January 2008,"Have you ever noticed how, if a review praises a movie, any movie, the, ""helpful"", votes pile up? If a review is critical in any way, forget your percentages. It will be, ""3 helpful out of 1209 total"", especially if you dare go against a popular trend, one that should have died long ago, that of hating men. This was one of the most enabling movies ever made. Sure, if a wife finds herself married to that brute, she should do whatever it takes to get out of the marriage. The Doctor was, however, just as abusive, dismissive, selfish and manipulative, not helping her, but in a different way, being maybe worse, since appearing to be what she wanted in a man. The harm in this movie rests in the fact that, in general, everyone feels, at one time or another, picked on, under-appreciated and taken advantage of by others. If a woman is sensitized , and looking for sources, other than herself, sensitized to look for it in signs in her husband, then he takes the brunt of the hate which is in most cases conjured up in the minds of everyone, occasionally, man or women. The net result of the mother and daughter walking off alone, being perfectly happy to be without a man, now that, my friends, is misleading and completely detrimental to those women who might otherwise try to work things out with their real-life husbands. Not with husbands like he was in the movie, but with the average husband who only occasionally is a jerk and, I might add, not too many more times than the average wife is to her husband, in real life. Man-hating movies get a pass by the general public. During the feminist movement, men were, ""put in their place,"" regularly and some of that actually needed to occur. It has gone too far, past being equal, rebounding now to hating men and leading many women to trying to live without them, a really, really stupid outcome of the entire feminist movement. You would think there were no worthy men out there, if you listen to these movies, (and another of my favorite worst movies called, ""This Boy's Life."") Very few men are misogynists. Most men are well worth living with. Women are NOT better off without them altogether. What The Waitress does is take a case, where dumping the jerk IS more than appropriate, and causes lingering anticipatory angst in a woman's mind, seeing similar things in the men she lives around, stretching now to find them, when, in fact, those things looked for so hard are not even close to really being part of what the men around those women will do or are being, in degree nor goal, even being capable of mimicking. Women and men, both, tend to blame the wrong person, the easy one to blame, the man, in this movie, when it is many times their own sadness they cannot deal with. Are women really this helpless in general? These kinds of victim movies are an indictment of the powerlessness of women, a lack of power that most men do not see or perceive. Most men would never come close to treating their wife in that manner, yet he might just inordinately get his head bit off if he even approaches what might look like the impending doom of emerging expected bad behavior, as was truly seen by the husband in the movie. ""Running away."" as she said many times, will be too often a result for many women after seeing that movie, when that is the stupidest thing they could do, not warranted and not beneficial, thinking life is better without men altogether. The three girls as waitresses were three of the biggest losers imaginable. You are telling me that fact was entirely the fault of the men around them? The only acceptable boyfriend was the sister-like wimp in which one of them saw little enough of a threat that he was OK! That's the kind of a man women want? The only ""acceptable"" man, now, can't be one? Some reviewers I read thought this was just a great comedy. Folks, if you have a clue, if you discern anything about anything, you must know there is not a single funny thing in or about this movie.",Waitress

Her only source of fun is to name her pies after things that happen in her life. Jenna finds out that she is pregnant and is far from excited.

Therefore when her girlfriends at the restaurant, and the woman conducting her ultra sound congratulate her on her pregnancy, she makes it evident that she is not happy. In a hope to escape her lifeless existence, Jenna hides some of her money from her husband in an attempt to enter a pie-baking contest, from which the winnings would pay for her to relocate and start her life over. The owner of her restaurant, Joe, tells Jenna that she needs to start fresh, while her lover Dr. Pomatter tells Jenna she should drop everything and move away with him.Joe is admitted for an illness to the same hospital in which Jenna will give birth, and gives her a simple message to let her know she was his only friend.

147,scschell,Bittersweet and Delicious,10,6 December 2007,"A conversation-starter at the Sundance Film Festival and a modest success at the box office, ""Waitress"" is a small tale about a small woman overcoming great odds. Writer and director Adrienne Shelly wrote the screenplay for the film whilst pregnant with her first child Sophie and began filming in November of '05. Principal photography wrapped three days before Christmas, a mere twenty days after it began. With an overall budget of $2 million and Shelly directing and starring in the film while looking after her infant daughter with her husband Andy, she was a force to be reckoned with.Sadly, Shelly would never see the film to its fruition. Only a year after ""Waitress"" began filming, she was murdered by a young Ecuadorian immigrant in her Manhattan home, leaving behind Andy, Sophie and a film career that might have been. She was forty years old. ""Waitress"" is Shelly's swan song, a work that would have opened people's eyes to her talents as a screenwriter and a film director. It is unfortunate that she will only be appreciated now posthumously.The film begins with Jenna Hunterson (Russell) doing what she does best  making pies. The kitchen is her oasis, a place where her sweet machinations come to life in the form of pies, quiches and tarts. Her saccharine creations distract from the awful monotony of her life as a waitress at Joe's Pie Diner, not to mention an unwanted pregnancy for which her jerk of a husband Earl (Sisto) is responsible. After a pregnancy test comes out positive, she makes an appointment with her family doctor only to discover she has left the practice and been replaced by Dr. Jim Pomatter (Fillion). Unhappily married and unhappily pregnant more so, she begins having an affair with - of all people - her obstetrician. Dr. Pomatter (whom she insists on calling by his professional name, even while she is sleeping with him) is a nervous and bumbling sweetheart who also happens to be married and he and Jenna literally stumble into love. No sooner does she realize she's falling in love, Jenna starts pouring her passions into her pies, much in the same way that Tita did in ""Like Water For Chocolate"" (""Naughty Pumpkin Pie""). All the while, Jenna grows ever larger and tries to plan her escape from Earl's clutches and take her pie-making to the next level while amusing herself with the romantic hang-ups of her co-workers Dawn (Shelly) and Becky (Hines) and putting up with persnickety Joe (Griffith), the diner's aging proprietor.There isn't even one bad performance here, no matter how small the part. The standouts, of course, are Russell and the seasoned and celebrated Andy Griffith as Joe. Russell's Jenna is almost a tragic heroine  poor but not broken, she is kind but willful, a seemingly meek woman with an irrepressible spirit. Russell embodies her character physically and emotionally  her Jenna is heartbreakingly lovely inside and out, a petite beauty who is sad but resolute (""though she be but little, she is fierce"") and has an admirably acidic sense of humor to boot. Who else's sense of humor can also be admired is Griffith's curmudgeon Joe, one who cackles as he says that he ""loves living vicariously through the pain and suffering of others."" Sisto's Earl is a possessive jerk, a low-scale tyrant who underneath is incredibly insecure and needs constant reassurance of Jenna's commitment to him. Fillion's awkward Dr. Pomatter is completely endearing and the surrounding cast rounds out the wonderfully entertaining ensemble. Dry humor is speckled throughout to keep this somewhat trifling tale from getting too sickly sweet, especially after Jenna's first rendezvous with Dr. Pomatter when Joe (Griffith) points out her smeared lipstick and tells her to ""wipe away her indiscretions"" before serving him breakfast.For a small film, it has big potential. If you peruse the shelves of Blockbuster as much as I, don't let this fantastic sleeper get lost among the big-budget bull. Rent it and let it wrap you up like a warm blanket.""Gonna make a pie with a heart in the middle""",Waitress
148,jozielee,Sweet As Pie,10,27 May 2007,"What a fantastic script. The words Adrienne Shelly put down on paper are funny and crisp. Her sweetly preposterous story unfolds to create a charming cast of characters - the abused wife (Keri Russell), the homely lonely-heart in search of Mr. Right (Adrienne Shelly), and the happy-go-lucky only interested in Mr. Right Now (Cheryl Hines). All three characters are waitresses at Pete's Cafe, a hole-in-the-wall truck stop best known for its specialty pies.At first glance I was reminded of the 60's television show ""Alice."" But soon the story took off in its own quirky direction. Veteran actor Andy Griffith portrays a curmudgeon horoscope reader who just happens to also own of the restaurant. I loved this colorful movie, and lament that such a wonderful storyteller was silenced so early in what looked to be a promising career. We're all diminished by her loss. Hopefully over time this little film will gain cult following and will remain in the forefront of the minds of moviegoers.As I write this review I'm reminded of a song Andie McDonald sang in the John Travolta movie, MICHAEL. It goes like this:""Pie, pie; Me, oh, my; Nothing tastes sweet, wet, salty and dry; All at once 'o well it's pie; Apple! Pumpkin!

I was totally turned off by the poster for this film, but seeing the high mean rating I decided begrudgingly to view it. You really cant judge a book by its cover, and a lot of the undercurrent of this film in my opinion is looking deeper within yourself & those in your life. I rarely cringed or winced due to excessive embarrassment from a horrendous script, the script was good, and directed well! Its a story with heart and only some mild cliché strewn into the pie mix.

152,dr_games,An excellent date film,9,4 June 2007,"This film is a masterful blend of growth and subtle influences. Keri Russell does a very credible job in the leading role creating a believable character that the audience could identify with. Nathan Fillion was perfectly cast as the nervous, self-doubting doctor that falls for his patient in a whirl-wind affair, but Andy Griffith steals the show as the curmudgeonly Old Joe with the hidden heart of gold.Keri Russell plays Jenna, a waitress who feels that she is on a dead-end path. Jenna is a genius at baking pies, and she dreams of leaving her dead-end marriage and moving away when she gets drunk and ""screws up by sleeping with her husband."" Jenna becomes pregnant, and each time in the movie that it appears that Jenna is about to overcome her obstacles, more are placed in her path.The audience is able to hear Jenna's thoughts in the form of narration as she ponders each plot complication and twist. Her observations are witty and insightful.Nathan Fillion plays Dr. Pomatter with great style. Fillion effortlessly portrays the self-conscious doctor that falls for his patient and tries to rescue her while he cannot rescue himself from his own shortcomings. Bravo! This was Adrienne Shelly's ""Citizen Kane,"" and it is a horrible tragedy that she was murdered before the film was released.The only disappointment was Jeremy Sisto's performance as Earl, Jenna's paranoid and abusive husband. Sisto is an excellent actor, and it is hard to tell why he fails in this role. Earl did not come off as the horrible husband that one would expect. The dialog was there to suggest it, but Sisto failed to bring home the emotional punch.In the end, it is the delivery of the baby that gives Jenna the emotional strength to end her affair with the Dr. and to move away from Earl and get a divorce, and it is Old Joe that provides the financial resources to make her dreams into a reality.One of the things that I enjoyed most about this film is that it appealed to the audience members on different levels. The children could identify with wanting to move on with life and Jenna's struggle to do that. Some of my younger friends identified with the closeness and importance of Jenna's relationship with her female friends, and as a parent I most identified with the role that a mentor can have and that it is never too late to change.A great film that is worth watching several times.",Waitress

156,bcdc39,"""Knocked Up"" light",10,5 October 2007,"I saw ""Knocked Up"" and ""Waitress"" within a month of each other. They turned out to be two very different films about the exact same thing: unwanted pregnancies; one the result of a one-night stand, the other the seed of a really bad husband. My response to these two critically acclaimed films couldn't be more different. They are kind of the inverse of each other, in fact. One (""Waitress"") was filled with flawed but likable characters, with one extremely flawed, yet darkly quirky character at its core. Though you hated his character it provided the movie with the perfect amount of conflict, and brought out many endearing qualities in the people afflicted with his presence. The other(""Knocked Up"") was swarming with that type of hard-to-love character, with one or two more likable ones mixed in. The endearing elements here came (in my admittedly biased opinion) at too great a price.I saw ""Knocked Up"" the same week my mom died, which accounts for my bias (and is the reason I haven't yet rated it at IMDb). It was a tough week for me as you can imagine. One day I was sitting around feeling depressed and decided I needed an escape, so I went to the movie at the top of my must-see list, ""Knocked Up."" As I sat watching it, I felt even worse than when I came in. If it was meant to be a feel-good movie the filmmaker failed miserably, at least for the emotionally-impaired moviegoer, like myself. As I sat there I decided it must be either a) easily the most overrated movie of the year, or b) exactly the wrong movie to see the week of your mother's funeral, because it's full of people you'd never bring home to her. It was so crass and packed with the most unappealing, low-life characters which I felt I was supposed be oddly endeared to, but wasn't at all. It had quirky, funny moments that virtually drown under all the crap. I was sitting there asking myself, ""This is the movie chalking up 4-star reviews all over the country?"" and ""Am I in the right theater?"" Then I saw ""Waitress,"" which would have been the perfect movie to see in place of ""Knocked Up."" It was a lighter, breezier, yet infinitely more substantial Knocked Up. It was everything the lesser film tried to be, charming and sweet and funny and sad and quirky  all mixed together into a delicious whole, like one of Jenna's pies. The experience of watching ""Waitress"" was made all the more poignant knowing the brilliant, attractive woman who wrote, directed, and played a wonderfully quirky supporting role, was murdered soon after its completion. So this was tragically both her breakout film and her swan song. It's sad to imagine what the movie world will miss out on as a result of her untimely death.The screenplay was written to perfection. The characters were all believable and magically meshed together. Each character, down to the most minor, was interesting and added spice to the story. The acting, especially for a low-budget film, was amazing. Keri Russell, as Jenna, was especially convincing, in a performance that never struck a false note. Jeremy Sisto's performance, as her disposable husband, was spot on. The presence of an aging Andy Griffith was a treat on many levels, in what may become his swan song. His career since his classic TV series has seemed to gradually decline, but he shows he can still act here. His against-type crotchety old man character, brilliantly conceived by Shelly, and executed by Griffith, is wonderfully complex. It's an Oscar-worthy performance that may get sadly passed by at Oscar time, as will, I'm afraid, this beautiful little gem of a film. I couldn't recommend it more highly.",Waitress
157,Anionic_Surfactant,Most emotionally moving picture you'll see in a long time,10,31 May 2008,"I've seen most of 2007's movies, I'm almost certain that I've seen all the top movies and I can say without a doubt that Waitress moved me more than any of them. In fact, it moved me more than any other movie made in recent years, at least reaching back to 2003.I'm rather an icy person, even if I say so myself. Don't show emotion and hate melodrama - and my definition of melodrama is quite broad - and this movie didn't even once give me silly chills due to unoriginal melodrama staples that so many movies so often like to lean on. And that's a feat because this movie is so emotional, but didn't even once go into the typical Hollywood melodramatic romance that I have despised so much in so many movies.I've wanted something emotionally satisfying and feel-good for a long time and this movie perfectly serves that purpose. I've seen it three times in three days from start to finish and every time it puts me in a better mood than I was in when I sat down to watch it. You feel so much for the characters; when they're sad you're sympathetic, when they're happy you're happy with them, when they're trying to do something you root for them and when they cry, I think most people will cry with them.Andy Griffith stood out for me though all the actors were amazing, most notably him and Keri Russell, who performed immaculately in every scene she was in and she was in pretty much all of them. Not to mention that she looks gorgeous, even when giving birth! The outstanding and charming dialog they're given helps, of course.I've heard this movie be described as being reminiscent of a fairy-tale and I agree to a degree, it does have that aura about it. But that's only a good thing, in fact it's a wonderful thing because the movie was already magical. It's a realistic fairy-tale; it's something everyone can relate to in one way or another but at the same time unusual because the characters are so deep and developed. I searched far and wide and I couldn't find one generic or shallow character in this movie.I promise that you'll have a more positive outlook on life after watching this movie.",Waitress
158,meredithconnie,hooked,10,4 June 2007,"It took me a little while to warm to the style of the film but the characters were all so affectionately drawn that it didn't take too long. The pacing of the film also seemed to try to catch people out - what they thought was funny may have been serious, and what you thought was serious may have been funny, and by the time the serious stuff really kicks in, you're hooked.Who makes movies about women trying to make it with miserable lives, miserable relationships, shitty low wage jobs, and only making it through because of the support they can lend each other? Not enough people. Just for that, this would have been something fresh and delightful.An additional bonus - and this is the kicker - is that Shelley had been in this kind of abusive relationship or knew someone who had. This was real. There was no need for over the top stuff, because the reality is that its just gritting your teeth and getting on with it, all the while losing your ability to hope and to see joy in the world. The redemption for this character was also real - OK, romanticized, but don't we all need a little of that?

159,gunnerthekiwi,Delicious Rom-Com Treat,8,11 May 2008,"WAITRESS (M) Directed by Adrienne Shelly Reviewed by Matthew GunnThe recipe for a great romantic comedy: Step 1. Start with an accomplished chef (director Adrienne Shelly). Step 2. Present her with the finest ingredients of lovable characters, an intriguing love story and a good helping of humour. Step 3. Stir thoroughly and bon appetite! It seems the makers of Waitress followed the recipe book closely upon making this delicious rom-com. Jenna Hunterson's (Keri Russel) life is stuck in limbo. She has big dreams but is being held back by her dense and pretentious husband Earl, who would like nothing more than for her to stay at home and cook for him. However Jenna has plans of cooking for a larger audience. She has a talent for pie making, and plans on entering the national pie-making competition and using the prize money to leave her husband. There are, however, complications in this grand scheme, for instance an unwanted pregnancy and a handsome doctor. Waitress is as sweet as the various delights that appear on screen throughout the film (think masses of berries, chocolate, custard and caramel). Jenna is happiest when cooking pies and some of the film's heartiest laughs come from the hypothetical pies that she creates in her head from time to time. Examples of these include ""Baby Screaming its Head Off and Waking Me Up in the Middle of the Night Pie"", ""Earl Murders Me 'Cause I'm Having an Affair Pie"" and ""I Can't Have No Affair 'Cause its Wrong and Earl Will Kill Me Pie"". It is quirky moments like this that make Waitress a delight to watch and certainly this is in a different league to the usual trash that the genre of romantic comedy is typically associated with. It should also be noted that Waitress isn't just a movie for women. If you watch this with your boyfriend or husband they may act uninterested, but secretly they'll be delighting in the intricacies of Waitress's delightful characters and sheer charm. Hell, if all else fails they'll enjoy looking at the food. The verdict: Waitress is everything a romantic comedy should be. A tasty treat for the senses that will leave you more satisfied than a fat kid on cake.",Waitress

It was well shot, the cast was damn good, and the idea surrounding it is a solid one. But this movie hits a point where it just begins to fall apart. All the quirky dialogue and cute supporting characters just get lost and you watch this young, beautiful waitress go from an interesting look on a woman dreading her pregnancy to a joke within a 15 minute period of time. What I found disturbing is that the message that it sends to its audience by the end of the film is that a woman cannot be happy unless she either has an affair or gives birth. For the greater portion of the movie she has this frown on her face that obviously is the result of having a failed marriage and a baby on the way. When she starts seeing the doctor who's delivering her baby there is an instant smile that is plastered across her face.

I figured if the entire feature was completely terrible, hey, it would still be about pie, and I would not feel completely ripped off when I finished it.But as it began, my opinions began to differ, and I realized- this was not just a movie about everyone's favorite desert.Waitress is the story of Jenna (Keri Russell), a young woman working at a small town diner. She has a gift for making pies, which she names after whatever happens to be on her mind at the time.Her life is nowhere near perfect, however. She has a cruel, sexist and slovenly husband named Earl (Jeremy Sisto) who controls her life completely. She dreams of winning a pie contest and earning enough money to escape the unhappy marriage.Jenna's hopes are crushed when she finds out that after a night of drunken debauchery, she is now pregnant with Earl's baby. With nothing else to do, she visits the Gynecologist- Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion) and after a few appointments, the two begin an unlikely love affair.Waitress is a bittersweet, homey movie that will warm your heart and make your stomach growl. Go out and see it- but make sure you have a slice of pie waiting for you afterwards- trust me, you'll need it.",Waitress
163,sperlingsanatomy11,A Delicious Treat,10,15 June 2007,"""Waitress"" is close to being perfect. It's mix of whimsical comedy and wit make it a gem that is a must have in your DVD collection. I'm surprised by how irresistible the film is.Keri Russell delivers a heartfelt performance as the pregnant pie-guru who wishes to start fresh. Cheryl Hines is even funnier than she is on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" as another sassy waitress. Adrienne Shelley, may she rest in peace, proved herself to be a film triple threat with her evident skills in directing, writing and acting. Her character adds a lot of humor.Nathan Fillion is very convincing as the kind doctor who cheers up our heroine. Andy Griffith is just as memorable as Keri, and his character known as Old Joe delivers the lesson of this sweet film: Start fresh when all else fails.""Waitress"" is a great charmer with few flaws. As adorable and delectable as it is, I don't see it winning any Oscars this year. Not because of it's quality, but because films released this early in the year tend to be ignored come awards season.Another shame is that Adrienne Shelley couldn't live to see this masterpiece she created. She is undeniably talented, and it pains me that someone with such a great gift died over the millions of directors who create comedies that turn out to be terrible.",Waitress
164,akakakak83,Interesting watch that falls far short,5,27 May 2009,"This is a film worth seeing, simply not one I will feel the need to watch a second time. It has its moments of humor, the emotions-as-pies motif is unique and interesting, and if nothing else, it's different, but it falls short.It felt extremely disjointed: the overall tone seemed to erratically waver from one scene to the next, as did characterization when it wasn't wholly one-dimensional.The tone of the movie oscillates wildly from one scene to the next. Starting with a dark but humorous tone, the plot quickly wends its way into some very depressing and unsettling territory with Jenna's physical abuse. The emotional abuse at the hands of her husband's utterly flat character (discussed below) becomes more asinine as his characterization does, losing its dramatic impact. Jenna's musing stays dark, but loses much of its intended humor when those dramatic moments it contrasts begin to fizzle. In another film, this might be a frank portrayal of a bleak life, but in ""Waitress"", it comes off as unsure.Even if the tone is unsure in a negative sense, the plot is unpredictable in a positive sense. It is unclear what will happen to Jenna, and that holds your interest. This makes it all the more disappointing when an obvious deus ex machina saves her from her dreary life at the film's end.Russell's character is well acted, but unsteadily written. Though I understand the sad dynamic of an abusive relationship, I had trouble suspending my belief in Jenna and Earl's continued relationship. While it is mentioned that he has changed since marrying, and Jenna does plan to leave him eventually, her character is SO no-nonsense and direct with everyone else that I couldn't reconcile that side of her with the one who stands abuse from an imbecile. Earl's character is one I do understand because we're absolutely hit over the head with his defining traits. His repetitive speeches declaring his neediness lack any subtlety. After abusive, needy, and obtuse, we're left with no more words to describe his shell of a character. Each time Sisto enters, his character reiterates that same information about himself and my attention drifts.Though Dr. Pomatter's character is also a bit flat, he serves his purpose in the movie quite effectively. He is nice, nervous, and drawn to Jenna; that is all he really needs to be. He's well acted by Fillion, who has a good sense for comic timing and the charm necessary for the role.If you're interested in seeing it, I encourage you to do so, but with the understanding that it has a wealth of shortcomings.",Waitress
165,inthewilderness,Torture.,1,7 October 2007,"I thought I was going to have to start scratching my eyes out during this movie to make the time pass. There were no ""up's and down's"" in this flick. It was completely monotone. I could have watched the first 5 minutes of this movie, then left and come back for the last 3 minutes and not missed a thing. So boring. It reminded me of a low budget soap opera. The acting was okay. But the storyline really didn't go anywhere. I felt ripped off seeing this movie at the theater. It's definitely one I could have waited for to come out on TELEVISION. I saw that it received 8 out of 10 stars and that's why I went to see it. I'm not quite sure what everyone enjoyed about this flick unless it was their great popcorn or they received free tickets to the flick.",Waitress

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked some of the characters. Some of it may not be realistic, but I can suspend my cynicism and go with the flow of the story. I recommend it for a refreshing story of small-town life that isn't cliché. The music is pleasant too, not some major ploy to try to market the movie with a new theme song everyone will associate the movie with later. The song that the director wrote stands up well with a catchy lyric. It's a movie that has memorable comedic elements in a story that touches the soul. Everyone in the world has a hobby and has a dream, even when life seems bleak. It's that kind of story.",Waitress

We, the lucky audience, are fortunate to watch her along with Becky and Dawn, her co-worker waitresses, as their lives unfold in the little pie shop. Jeremy Sisto is convincingly creepy as the controlling husband, and Andy Griffith does a fun star turn as the cranky owner of the diner. All of the actors, of course, including Keri Russell, are funny, eccentric and real. What more could we ask of the screenplay and the direction?

While one must assume that this was intended to be that way, the movie still turned the corner towards ""cheesy"" way too hard. Really... waaaaaayyyy too hard. Actually, my brain felt violated and offended.However, there are two person I enjoyed somehow: Old Joe (Andy Griffith) and Shelly herself (as ""Dawn"", especially when she confessed about her new boyfriend).

Jeremy Sisto making you hate him and feel sorry for him at the same time, but then does something to make you hate him all over again! The rest of the supporting cast just meshed so well, and I really felt like I could drive down the road a bit and find these people who frequented the diner. I just have to say Andy Griffith was the cat's tail!As I said with the ending, it was more of a ta- ending as opposed to a ta-da ending. It gives closure and understanding, but I suppose I wanted just a smidgen more.",Waitress
170,Tiina_Heinonen,May contain charm,10,28 June 2009,"Waitress'Waitress' is essentially a story about a young mother-to-be writing a letter of apology to her unborn baby. Set in a Southern town, it centres around a diner where pies are not only made fresh and in abundance, but treated as objects of worship. With their small and unfulfilled lives, three of the kooky waitresses share a sisterly friendship and act as each other's lifeline when unwanted babies and other such misfortunes come knocking. Making pies helps, too. Those familiar with Keri Russell's work on 'Felicity' will find the voice-over, knowing looks and self-awareness something of a flashback, but will here be positively surprised by her character's lack of wallowing and indecision. Instead, Jenna is frank, fearless and fun; she knows she's stuck in a life whose prospects are soul-destroying; and she's kind but never a people-pleaser. She deals with her pregnancy and the subsequent romance with her doctor in the most charmingly confused way possible. The secondary characters are equally well-written, each characterised by the choices made and dead-ends that have resulted. However, 'Waitress' is one of the most entertaining and hilarious cinematic adventures out there. Though carrying something of an indie, small-scale film rep, it boasts a top-notch cast list: Russell is a revelation, Jeremy Sisto fantastic as a sleaze ball allergic to women with brains, Andy Griffith exactly as endearing and spot-on as you'd expect, Cheryl Hines superb as the outrageous tell-you-like-it-is best friend with a boob complex, and the writer-director Adrienne Shelly as the other best friend with a bad complexion. From the dialogue to the sub-plots, from the score to the overall pace, the film is very solid throughout. It might have easily won a number of awards had it chosen to emphasise the sadness and played up its smallness. But it's more classic Hollywood than anything else. Indeed, it doesn't defy conventions in any way – rather, 'Waitress' reminds us of the reasons most of us secretly wish Hollywood wasn't so much about TMZ, retouchers and lawyers. There is no point in denying that it all feels terribly sweet and wholesome at times. Luckily, though, the film never apologises for its positivity – nor does it ever get sickening or fluffy. It's simply an utter joy of a story told well.",Waitress
171,egbertsouse1,Perfect any day movie,9,31 May 2007,"Certainly did not find this little gem just a ""womans film"", (my view as a guy). I stumbled into it, as I missed the beginning of the movie I actually was going to see. Not even the cashier or ticket-taker knew any of the actors, (no poster was visible).I just sat back, resigned to see what I had paid for. After 15 minutes into this film I was hooked. Not a bad actor in the cast. You really do not know which direction it is taking, (I thought I did) as it really goes down several roads. Just a delightful, enjoyable, fun movie that also can make you think about life in general and the journey. 90 minutes that really passed too quickly.",Waitress

Sort of an afterschool special for the WTV set. I did love the pie pieces throughout the film, but the characters were waaayyy too stereotypical. The very real, claustrophobic, relationship of the main character was just dropped at the end with no unpleasant traces to show for it all as if the filmmaker ran out of time and was tired of the story.

In fact I have no strong feelings about it.It's clearly not a comedy (It's not funny)and its defiantly not romantic. Its a drama about bad relationships and babies.Its incredibly predictable (everyone knew the second the baby came she would suddenly jump to her senses and get rid of her abusive husband) The film can be defined in 5 words : ""pregnancy, abusive husband, south, pies"" their you have it, the entire movie.The main character was entirely unrelatable (southern pregnant waitress cold pie maker ?)but very easy to feel empathetic too (very sad situation).In all the film isn't bad in fact its rather well made, bleak but impressive. The main problems I had were with the script (unfunny and predictable).",Waitress

It shows us all sorts of different relationships and what may or may not be the way things are. It deals with one waitress ,who's reality is not as easy as pie, but baking them is. She makes up some great pies and it is the way she does it that is charming and funny. I enjoyed the connection between the three waitress and how they bonded through the movie. I loved Nathan Fillion and Keri Russell scenes together, they had get chemistry! I think it has a great unconventional ending for a romance that is heartwarming. I found this movie funny,romantic,charming,empowering,and enchanting. I saw this movie twice already. It is a must own in my book.",Waitress
176,lmayper,Waitress finds love in the place she least expects it,10,28 May 2007,"After seeing the trailer for WAITRESS last month, I knew I wanted to see it. The film delivered everything promised in the trailer and more.Keri Russell stars as Jenna, a waitress trapped in an unhappy marriage, who dreams of leaving her selfish husband before discovering she is pregnant. Jenna works at a diner where all the pies are made fresh, and she concocts unique creations with names like, ""I don't want to have Earl's baby because it's going to ruin my life Pie."" Becky, played by Cheryl Hines, and Dawn, played by Adrienne Shelly are Jenna's quirky and endearing waitress friends at the diner. Dawn thinks she is an ugly duckling that will never find love, and Becky's husband has become an invalid, but both claim they wouldn't trade places with Jenna in a million years. The dialog between Jenna, Becky, and Dawn is hysterical. Jeremy Sisto gives a convincing performance as Earl, Jenna's immature, jealous, and controlling husband. He does show his sensitive side at one point, when he finds the money Jenna has hidden and suspects she may leave him. Nathan Fillion plays Dr. Pomatter, the new obstetrician in town, with whom Jenna forms an unlikely bond. What begins as a torrid affair, ends up helping Jenna realize she deserves a chance to be happy. Andy Griffith is terrific as Joe, a crotchety old man universally disliked by everyone except Jenna, who sees through his cantankerous act.The movie did have a bittersweet happy ending, which brought me a few tears, a little for the death of a beloved character, but mostly for the tragic loss of writer/director/actress Adrienne Shelly in November, before WAITRESS was released.",Waitress
177,fredames,A Highly Overrated Movie,3,8 December 2007,"If the director of this movie had not been murdered, I doubt that it would have received the number of positive reviews that were made about it. Andy Griffin plats a sort-of grumpy old man, and does a nice job of it. The rest of the cast is, well, adequate. Not really their fault, though, since this is one of those movies where ""...there is no there, there"". The plot is essentially non-existent, the outcome is quite predictable, and there is really nothing about this movie that would cause me to recommend it to a good friend. It is just another feel-good movie for the easily amused. I would only recommend that you see it if you were in serious need of a popcorn fix, and there was nothing else playing at some other theater in your area. But be prepared to be bored.",Waitress
178,DavionMtrx,"A Two Thumbs Up Pie, with Whipped Cream and a Cherry on Top!!",10,11 May 2007,"Life is all about the pursuit of happiness, or so it is stated in the Constitution of the United States of America. And in the latest independent film, Waitress, directed by the late, but-oh- so-talented Adrienne Shelly, the constant search for something uplifting and inspirational floods the screen in a blend of humor, forbidden romance and saliva-forming pie delicacies. Opening at Sundance to rave reviews from critics all around, the film has since been traveling nationwide for free screenings in an easy attempt at 'word-of-mouth' marketing. If people don't already have a mouthful of pie to stop them from talking, you'll be hearing wondrous comments about this story. Jenna (played by Russell) is a small-time waitress at a pie shop in a small-time town in that little slice of America we all believed to be dormant. But when her abusive husband (Jeremy Sisto) gets her drunks one night and impregnates her, her world is ready to turn upside down. Jenna had always dreamt of an escape from her present life; a fresh start. Cue Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion) who jump-starts Jenna's lust for life and true love as her replacement gynecologist. With a bun in the oven, Jenna's baking endeavors skyrocket with the hopes of winning $25,000 in a pie contest and one last shot at escaping her terrible husband. Whether it be on her own or in the arms of her doctor is an intense decision she must decide.Keri Russell, according to my insight and sources, seemed to fall off the face of Celluloid Earth once her Felicity series ended. Aside from a run of small roles in big/mediocre films, none have really heard any from her. She reminds us how beautiful those homegrown country girls can be: how defenseless, how passionate and how much they can offer intellectually, spiritually and on a culinary level. Keri Russell is back, and ready to bite!!Nathan Fillion is known to too many as a wisecracking captain of a starship in outer space, so seeing him as a nerdy, anxiety-encompassed gynecologist was almost a stretch. But his subtle and not over-the-top acting brought the beautiful degree of chemistry between Russell's character and his. It was his moment to shine in a situation he wasn't used to, and his light burned bright. His comedic timing was spot-on, and sharing the screen with Russell left us craving more intimate moments not shown so such on the silver screen anymore.Jeremy Sisto is the controlling husband we all love to hate. He wears his insecurities on his sleeve, continually forcing his wife to remind him that she loves him and will never do anything behind his back. The brute of the film, he talks himself out of his emotions and talks himself into thinking he is right all the time. The headstrong type are usually never right; though the casting choice left the audience wondering how much one can really despise Sisto's character. A stellar performance indeed.The ensemble supporting cast was mixed better than any dessert I could ever construct. The on screen personas provided by Cheryl Hines, Andy Griffith, Adrienne Shelly, and even Eddie Jemison left each scene standing alone on its own. Every character in this gem is working hard to find happiness although some search in the wrong places; sometimes through lust, sometimes through spontaneous poetry and stalking while sometimes laying a hard hand on the one they walked down the aisle with years ago.In this film, there is a sexual revolution for one woman and her doctor. In this film, there is a life to be given to one baby. In this film, there is nothing but good-ole pie to eat. Waitress is a humble return to the romantic comedy genre; one not relying on humor to carry the film or its romance. Like the pies created inside its running time, it takes just the proper blend of all the ingredients to make everything taste absolutely perfect. Order up!!",Waitress
179,xanthoula53,really dumb movie,3,3 May 2009,"This was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, and even now I am amazed that I watched it the whole way through. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. From the start to the end, it was one big cliché, extremely predictable with not one surprise in the entire film. From the over the top ridiculous boyfriend of Dawn and the wedding in the pie shop, the wife of the doctor being in the delivery room. I even found the scene where the husband finds the money and wants her to tell him it's for a present for him to be offensive to the many women who live with abusive husbands, as it made him more of a joke than the cruel character that an abusive husband is.And the main character lacked any depth. And the obvious flaws, like the doctor saying he was going to do an epidural when she was obviously way past the time when one is possible. The delivery had no sense of realism.This movie was just plain lousy.",Waitress
180,yellowbrickopera,"Warm, realistic, and touching",9,12 September 2009,"Every once in a while, I find a movie that's not very well known and give it a chance. I, like many other moviegoers, believe that some of the most priceless gems are the hidden ones. While it's true that the movie reached critical success, it wasn't widely received the way a bigger budget movie might have been. But the amount it took to make the movie wasn't even relevant. The film was funny, poignant, and the overall effect was beautiful.The movie's ultimate success has a great deal to do with the clever screenplay that Adrienne Shelly crafted. The dialogue was rich with sweet nuance and multiple interpretations. She knew how to make the characters multi-dimensional and make a seemingly simple plot move along seamlessly. Jenna Hunterson came off as a complex young woman trying to adapt to a lifestyle different than the one she would have picked. She has a strained relationship with her husband and hardly a penny to her name, and yet she doesn't lose her sweetness or her resilience. In addition, Earl would have been so easy to portray as a cookie-cutter bad guy. Several movies depict an openly aggressive man and a battered victim of a wife, but Adrienne Shelly refused to settle for mediocrity. She gave Earl a longing and a heart beneath his calloused exterior.The other element required in a quality movie is a talented cast. Nothing can kill a great screenplay than substandard actors. Luckily, all of the roles were carefully picked, casting actors who should be more well-known. Keri Russell just sparkled as Jenna, bringing out all the warmth and sweetness in Jenna as well as the strength and tenacity. When she smiled, she brought the entire audience with her. Jeremy Sisto was incredibly convincing as Earl, and intelligent enough to maximize on his good qualities as well as their detestable counterparts. Nathan Fillion made a charming male co-star, and Cheryl Hines, Andy Griffith, Eddie Jemison, Lew Temple, and the late, lovely Adrienne Shelly rounded out the cast as the beguiling but big-hearted pie shop workers and customers.I'd say that this is definitely worth buying on DVD and watching over and over again. There's a magic element to this movie, like a fairy-tale but much more realistic. With the great marriage of script and cast, Waitress is a treat to savor.",Waitress
181,mdfbianchi,One VERY Disturbing Implication,2,4 July 2016,"There is something painfully dark and disturbing about this movie - a film about a waitress (duh) that becomes pregnant by her abusive husband and begins an affair with her gynecologist - that bothered me from the time I stopped watching it. It wasn't the husband, who was so cartoonishly evil that he removed any emotional punch of the abuse storyline as he played less like an actual person than a method actor in the midst of a very poor production of A Streetcar Named Desire. Nor was it the tired trope of women cheating for reasons that humanizes and makes us understand them while men do it because . . . well, men cheat. (The lead character's husband is abusive and selfish in bed - of course - and her coworker's affair is justified by her husband being in a vegetative state and sleeping in a separate room. Both of the men they have affairs with have blameless, wonderful wives they are apparently happily married to.) Nor even the implication that the only good thing a man can do is die as the only major male character not abjectly terrible serves as a deus ex machina who manages to write our saintly heroine an enormous check before having the courtesy to kick the bucket and not be seen again.No, actually, those tropes don't bother me because I could as easily point to a zillion zany guy comedies where women are shrewish, joyless nags or soulless objects of desire who appear long enough to showcase either their fronts or rears and then return to the factory floor to be pulled for the next showcase. It would by hypocritical to find my moral outrage for that.What is uniquely ugly about this film is a device wherein a woman appears in several scenes with her unruly, awful, out-of-control 6-year-old boy - who spends every second of screen time ruthlessly tormenting his poor mother. These are meant to show what Waitress fears about childbirth - and it is apparently having a boy. The implication seems to be strongly that had she not gotten her 'happy' ending of having a girl in the film's climax, she would have simply remained miserable.It is a gross hatred of boys, an equivalent I couldn't imagine in another film. Men are not awful, this film says, because of a patriarchal society that indoctrinates them. It is not the actions of her awful husband or the philandering doctor that ruin a woman's life, but the mere act of being born with a penis. I think the 'pro-life' message so many Christian conservatives are finding in this film would not exist if they did not imply early and often her child would be a girl. I wonder if the writer/director of this film was going through a rough spot in her marriage when writing this? Working out feelings about her father? I read before her tragic death she had a daughter . . . and thank god for that, because I would worry even more about the implications if she'd actually had a son. (I hope, if she did, this aspect would've changed.)Ultimately this disgusting aspect drags a mediocre film with a couple of lights to a level that makes it, well, kind of awful.",Waitress
182,breannerae,The Pies Hold the Only Delight.,2,24 January 2008,"I just could not get behind this movie. I think it's a good example of why the writer does not always make the best choice as director of their own work. Someone removed from the writing process could have given this movie the heart that it needed. I feel that, as is, it takes its audience too much for granted. I'm not going to love Jenna just because she's the main character, and played by the (physically) adorable Keri Russell (whose acting chops leave much to be desired -- the caliber of her performance was on par with that of a high school play). I did not find much to like about Jenna -- she was just a mopey, husband-hating, victim of an unwanted pregnancy; there was no charisma, no like-ability. Then we met her husband (Jeremy Sisto did a great job playing this role), who I actually did feel empathy for -- he was such a sad figure, wanting so desperately for his wife to show him some love. Of course, he was also pretty terrible to her, but we didn't see that until later, after my low opinion of Jenna had already formed. This was the movie's biggest mistake and number one for reasons why I was never able to connect emotionally to Jenna or her story.",Waitress

186,SomethingFortheBoys,I don't know why everyone loves this movie so much.,3,2 June 2007,"I had a chance to see a movie for free and decided from the tag-line, ""If only life were as easy as pie,"" that perhaps Waitress would be worth watching. I was wrong. It was as if someone had jotted down an OK Lifetime Movie of the Week story outline and hired a writer to flush it out with predictable jokes, idiotic (not to mention extraordinarily mundane) moralizing, and stock characters like the mean husband, the sassy waitress, the nice doctor, the crotchety old man, and the almost interesting but overall boring heroine. And then, to top it all off, they thought it be a good idea to have an open casting call at a small community theatre. (They probably also asked everyone at said open casting call at community theatre to bring a tape of their favorite obscure music to insure that the movie would have an eclectic soundtrack.) As much as I didn't care about one single character or how the plot twists (that you could see coming from Beirut) would end up, there were a few bright spots. One of which were Jenna's recurring daydreams about recipes for pies, which were usually creative and entertaining, and another was Keri Russell (or as I like to call her, Felicity)'s nuanced facial expressions. Her acting on the whole was mediocre, but when I found myself cringing or furrowing my brow at the various inanities in the movie, Russell's visage showed the same emotion and actually the same exact expression as mine. On the whole, the movie was not that good, but it did inspire me to go to a diner and have pie afterwards. Yum.",Waitress

The three main actresses (Keri Russel and her two waitress friends) have unmemorable, unfunny, un-ANYTHING performances, and the only person on screen who stands out is Keri's (sorry, i don't remember the characters name) husband, but only because i wanted her to shoot, stab or maim him three minutes into his introductory scene.All in all, one of the worst movies of the year, if not ever. If you like your movie to be entertaining, avoid this at all costs.",Waitress
188,flatmate200,Painful,4,19 June 2010,"I am a very patient movie watcher but I regret that I forced myself to watch this one to the end. Many reviews state that this movie is romantic: the main character is caught in a marriage marked by intimate partner abuse. She then has sex with her OBGYN who is married. They are desperate and awkward (they just jump onto each other all the time, and smear lipstick - I guess that symbolizes passion) but it does not look like romance to me. Her colleague cheats on her disabled husband with the mean boss in the business who later turns out to be not so mean. The other waitress plays the ugly duckling who ultimately goes for the stalker like weirdo: Romance? You judge.I found the dialog very awkward, stilted, and forced to the point that the characters seemed unrealistic and clichéd - and the acting - though often decent - fell flat. I think that marks bad writing.Here and there, there was a little humor but it certainly did not make me laugh out loud. So this movie was NOT really funny. The story line included a lot of unrealistic elements. It does show the typical cycle and problems in Intimate Partner Abuse, the difficulties and danger of breaking free, especially when being poor. However, it abruptly turns to a very unrealistic happy end. While tremendously ambivalent about her pregnancy, after giving birth she suddenly falls in love with the baby and suddenly has the power to reject the abusive husband. What a cliché: A dying old man gives the victimized sweet woman a big check and she can open her own pie business while the father of the child was never seen again. Clearly, this movie does not compare to movies like Juno or Little Miss Sunshine. Someone even rated it higher than the work of the Coen brothers - well, that one really made me laugh.The pies looked good - though this movie does not create the sensual experience of food as many other movies succeeded to do.",Waitress
189,Debbie-Lowe,A legacy of which to be proud!,10,9 June 2007,"I did not expect much, but this film says so much more than I expected, especially from such a young filmmaker and cast. I am so saddened that we have lost this wonderful young woman! The metaphor of motherhood is FACT, as the mother of three at the age of 55. THAT is the moment of definition. One does not have to give up oneself; one does have to redefine oneself after birth (sorry guys). One does not have to give up the father, but if there is reason to do so, THAT is the moment. This is not about $$$$, but YES, having the means to make one's OWN life does matter. I thought I would just ""laugh,"" which I did, heartily, but in a manner that was thoughtful and fulfilling. I felt bonded and satisfied in a mature manner. I will be buying this one! MY THANKS to all involved - Deb Lowe",Waitress

Although very amateur (the lighting and shots seemed student film quality) and extremely predictable (knew from the start that Earl was going to get his due and that Old Joe would save the day), Waitress is visually fun. I agree with many critics on this website that this film would most likely not be getting the recognition it has if not for the tragedy of her death but to me, what's the harm. Again, the writing is weak (dialogue is empty), the characters are rehashed and often stereotyped. But again, the effort and heart is there and I'm glad that Ms. Shelley had a chance to fulfill a dream.",Waitress
191,icanrun19,I thought the movie was awful.,1,16 May 2007,"The movie glamorizes domestic violence. There is so much Domestic violence in our world. The movies need to make stronger statements as how wrong DV is, and women must be given more power, self esteem, and self worth. For Jenna to make promises to Earl, tolerate his slapping her around, is terrible. She needed tools to get out of the relationship ASAP. I do not believe that glamorizing the domestic abuse is a good thing.It is so unethical for a doctor to have an affair with one of his clients. He can lose his license. Again, the movie made something so unethical look wonderful.The waitress that had an affair with the owner of the restaurant was vulgar as well. If she didn't want to be married to her husband that had a disability, she should have divorced him.This movie had some cute lines in it. However, the lack of morals and ethics of the movie left me cold and I have told everyone I know that the movie was disgusting and amoral.This was a terrible movie and I am glad that I saw it for free. otherwise, I would have demanded my money back.",Waitress

I thought it was sweet, but then it also had a slightly dark sense of humor that didn't allow for any nauseating over-the-top ""awwwwww how cuuuuuuute"" moments. The interaction between the characters was very real, so much so that it was in itself gently humorous. And of course the plot was very well played. I won't say anything else about that, however, because I don't believe in spoilers. I was just genuinely impressed with everyone in the movie, especially Keri Russell, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has some appreciation for love, life and real people.",Waitress
193,girdnas,Why is Waitress being so poorly distributed?,10,1 June 2007,"Today I looked online to find what theater in my city of Colorado Springs, Colorado was showing Waitress. To my surprise, none of them were. After some calls and questions to the various theaters I found out that none of them are going to be playing the comedy due to the limited distribution to our city. Come on. This is a feature film with well-known and talented actors and actresses that deserve recognition or at least a chance to be seen alongside the big blockbusters of the summer. Not to mention that we viewers deserve to have it as a choice when we walk up to buy our tickets. I feel this is unfair to the movie and those who made it. I have tried to contact the distributor of Waitress to make my opinion known without success. Luckily, the art theater here in town has picked up the movie so I will be going to see it but I already know it will be an excellent comedy. The online reviews are excellent. I am still fully disappointed with the major theaters here in town for not showing this film because it will not get the exposure it deserves. Nathan Fillion for the win!PS - I've seen the movie since earlier and was not in the least disappointed. It was a comedy but with so much more and the acting was top notch. So, BUG was distibuted to every theater in town and Waitress gets the short end of the stick? LAME! The theater was packed, by the way... Go see Waitress!",Waitress
194,truthiness8,Predictable and a bit nauseating,4,19 June 2007,"This movie was written by a woman who had a baby, for women who have babies. If you are a mother, you will most likely swoon over it, perhaps rather mindlessly, simply because it validates your life choice. Everyone else - be prepared for the usual tripe that if you're a woman, having a baby will make your life all shiny-bright and wonderful. It was not having a baby that made Jenna's life better. It was the big check from Joe. Without that check, she'd just be a miserable divorced woman with a stalker husband, making minimum wage as a single mother. While there were a few truly poignant moments in this movie and it was ""cute"" and entertaining, if you're expecting any more than total fluff, you will be sorely disappointed.

This was entertaining... funny, sad, and thought- provoking! Truly a deep movie thinly veiled by a comedic facade. I would recommend this movie to anyone. The characters are well-developed and believable. Real people of all ages should be able to relate to the depths of emotion and the drive for independence depicted in this film. Human traits of good, evil, love, lust, friendship, strength, weakness, fear, and betrayal are present in the genuine personalities of the characters who give life and meaning to this movie. The joy of freedom was so beautifully portrayed by the heroin who chose to be the leader of her own life and to be a strong role model for her daughter.",Waitress

Well, guess what, it was not even close to this expectation at all. Subtle and flowing warmness throughout the film grabbed my curiosity and it also kept me smiling until the very end. When the tragedy comes, as it was not lightly touched by the talented director, we get completely lost-when to smile or cry. With the hint of mixed emotion, a series of twists towards the end is sort of leading us to the so-called ""Happy Ending"". However, it is not the one we used to know. Among the all great actors and their superb performances, the moment Cal (Temple) answers to Jenna (Russell) was the best for me. Not only the great script but also because of the hidden force of Temple as an actor.",Waitress

Me my mother 44 and father 44 thought it was awful and so did my brother to. Don't Waste your time watching this crap movie. It is about Jenna who is married to a very controlling mean man named Earl who does not let her go anywhere she works at a pie diner and she makes good pies. The reason the movie is bad is that its just a bunch of ockward conversations and nothing happens in the movie. When they speak one person might say something then its a small pause for like 5 seconds and the other one say something like they are retarded or so.,Waitress
198,jared-holcomb,Don't waste your time,1,3 January 2008,"The story line in this movie was nothing more than a string of infidelities glorified. The movie lacked a substantial plot and ended abruptly giving no real closure to the story at all. I continued watching hoping that there would be at least some redeeming value to the adulterous characters only to be sorely disappointed. In fact, it was blatantly obvious that the moral of the story is that infidelity will help free you of all pain in your life. How absurd. I would advise anyone who is even considering wasting their time with this movie to not do it. I have relinquished two hours of my life that I will never be able to get back. It may have been the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. No exaggeration.",Waitress

If it were not for some decent acting by most of the cast this would be given a 1-star- rating by me. If they had dealt with the husband differently, I may have given it 4 stars.On the positive side, Andy Griffiths was outstanding as a lovable old curmudgeon, Keri Russell did her best with ludicrous situations, and Nathan Fillion (I love him!) was so one-dimensional as a super unethical doctor. He can't help being charming, but that's really not his character here Jeremy Sisto makes us really hate the husband.Generally it feels like a huge mess. I don't recommend it.",Waitress

That being said, I'm completely stunned that it took me until tonight to actually see 'Waitress'. I'm going to lay the blame for that on the fact that I currently find myself residing in a backwater Indiana town (long story) but it also may be the reason I found this film so charming. Having just days ago sat through the dreck that was the latest 'Indiana Jones', this film reminded me that film at its base is a true art form. Keri Russell and Andy Griffith were absolutely stellar.Just as an aside, I saw a foreign film by the name of 'Monster Thursday' that reminded me a lot of this film...it was also excellent.Anyhow, thats it...gotta run as the hillbillies around here seem intent on leveling the entire county with their frickin fireworks!!",Waitress

Adrienne Shelly wrote a fabulous lullaby for the movie and her daughter is super cute at the end. earl is definitely hate-able, but then again no one in this movie really has the right to judge anyone else. Joe, the diner owner, is a fabulous character and he pretty much made the movie for me. The pie names are a nice technique to move the narrative along and a good feel for the moments throughout the movie. I think the love story is great but doesn't lead you to a typical ending.

203,grandtommy,Moral of the story: Use a condom!!,2,17 October 2008,"Moral of the story: Use a condom!!This is supposed to be a romantic comedy? There is no romance whatsoever as it relates to the protagonist. Her actions are based on loneliness, lust and confusion. The entire film revolves around miserable people... the only characters in this film who walk away happy are Jenna and Dawn. Sure, you are left with a happy ending but what about real life? What about single mothers? What about women who are still in abusive relationships? Life isn't so happy-go-lucky and not all of us are fortunate enough to receive some grumpy old man's inheritance and leave our husbands.Seriously, if the main character had used protection we wouldn't have this mess of a movie. Before giving birth Jenna addresses her child as ""Damn baby"" in letters and apologizes for not wanting the little girl. Use a condom and avoid getting pregnant woman (this means don't have sex when you're wasted)!! Then upon seeing her baby she decides to change her life around. So fickle, such a poor representation of women.I did have a few laughs but not in the way the laughs were intended.My favorite scene from the Waitress:Jenna unwraps a gift from the doctor while in his office. The gift turns out to be a pie-dish.Jenna: ""You shouldn't have done this!""Oh my god. Come on now, really? There are a lot of things that shouldn't have been done in this movie. What harm is a pie dish going to do now that you've already (1) referred to your child as ""Damn Baby"", (2) slept with the doctor, (3) cheated on your husband, and (4) did a terrible job of hiding money from your husband.Predictable movie with poor developed characters. If you want to see a film that revolves around an unwanted pregnancy that is more true to life watch The Good Girl.",Waitress
204,merrymary,a film not much further developed than its slugline,3,7 January 2008,"Another example of a pretentious indie film person forgetting all about character complexities, secondary and tertiary stories, and overall preoccupation into making a ""heartwarming"", ""redeeming"" movie, that the filmmaker hadn't got much farther than pure idealism. The Southerners are mightily stereotyped; women ""discover"" themselves through trashy enterprises such as backtalkin', simpleton behavior, obsession with unhealthy food, fightin' and cheatin' and especially the undercurrent notion that women are only happy when they have a baby. Keri Russell is very wooden in her character, and handles her singular inner conflict (the characters are very sophomoric and plain) with a blank stare or a pasted smile.",Waitress
205,emberAZ,I love this...,10,6 September 2008,"It was really fascinating watching Jenna be nice to the terrible husband. I didn't do that but I know a few people in awful relationships and I'm pretty sure women do it all the time. It amazed me when she kissed the doctor. Personally, I wish I would do that but at 65 it's not likely. I never did it as a young woman either but it seems like a lovely way to connect with a nice guy. I figured she'd really like the little baby girl even though she was so unhappy about the pregnancy because of the way she talked about her own mom all the time. She became a really good mom too. Dumping the bad husband was so clear and so refreshing. I know a few women who live with guys like that and apparently they don't go there. Watching all the pies being made throughout was also fun and interesting. All in all I loved the movie and plan to buy it.",Waitress

Beautifully written and acted, a movie with heart and a story. We all walked out singing the sweet song at the end of the movie. (I hope the soundtrack comes out soon.) Yes, there were some predictable plot lines but who cares? When a movie is handcrafted like a good pie (ok, slightly hokey but so is the movie), it stands on its own.Keri Russel is lit like an angel and the storyline between her and her doctor is sweet, slightly silly and tinged with sadness.

Thanks for making a fun movie that's not afraid to show real 'flawed' people in real situations!! I would recommend this movie to anyone who is sick of phony perfect main stream characters that really don't have any problems. The late Adrienne Shelly did a great job directing and acting in a supporting role. Cheryl Hines adds her great comedic flare! She's also good in Scrubs. I'm glad to see Keri acting in a main role again. She's such a naturally lovable personality on screen as she was in the TV show Felicity. This movie's perfectly fitting since she is currently pregnant! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!",Waitress
208,nothalfright,A sweet and charming film with a great cast.,8,28 June 2007,"The premature and tragic homicide of actress/writer/director Adrienne Shelly is a well known tale, and with a film like Waitress arriving after the filmmakers death, it is hard not to treat the final work a bit nicer and judge a little less harshly than you would another film. As it turns out though, Waitress is a well-made and charming picture that does not need to be handled lightly to enjoy. The script is solid, with dialogue that feels natural and a plot that maintains your interest and does something new without venturing into any territory too intense. While it can be characterized as a romantic comedy, the film does not come across as formulaic, and really sets itself apart from the typical Hollywood ""chick flick."" The collective cast is great, with Nathan Fillion playing the slightly neurotic gynecologist guy-on-the-side charmingly, Jeremy Sisto nailing the role of abusive bastard of a husband, Andy Griffith as a misunderstood old man and restaurant owner, and lastly Keri Russell in a potentially Oscar-worthy performance as Jenna, the lead who finds herself stuck with an unwanted pregnancy in an abusive relationship with nowhere to go. I highly recommend Waitress, for a sweet and yet unconventional film that will make you wish you had many more pictures by Adrienne Shelly to look forward to.",Waitress

Maybe I'll be saving someone 90 minutes. This movie is so totally AVERAGE. That's it. Average. Not spectacular or thought provoking, not even really that horrible or boring. Just plain average. Yes, this is an indie film without the cheesy Hollywood dialog (this word is misspelled, this website won't let me spell it the right way - damn them!) and plot twists. Does that make it deep and informative? Does that mean that all the characters are well written with clear motivations and interesting personalities? Absolutely not. This is a film about a pregnant waitress with an asshole for a husband, stuck in this small town. She starts an affair, dreams some big dreams, then has the baby and starts fresh in the end. If that summary sounds shallow that's because the movie itself is shallow. There is NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! None at all. Keri Russell's character is not given any meaningful dialog - anything which might explain how she got into this rut, why its so important for her to get out, or even how it feels to be in it. She just keeps saying she ""doesn't want to talk about it."" That's ridiculous! This is a movie....talk about it. Let it out. Its called emotion, it makes for good storytelling. As for the side characters - they're mostly just props. I saw one review say how ""Human"" everyone was. NO WAY. No human beings here, just single-note characters. Her husband is a prick, that's all. The doctor is a nice guy, that's all. The two waitresses are quirky and weird, that's all. The only real exception is the Andy Griffith character, who puts on a tough guy act. BUT WE NEVER LEARN WHY!!! Wouldn't it have been interesting to learn why he acted so tough???Also -- side note -- I really thought Keri Russell was a bad choice here. She is too New York Beautiful for this role. She just didn't come across to me as a small-town Southern girl. Also, her character would have to be pretty low self-esteem to stay with that A-hole, and she just didn't convey that. Also, this was supposed to be a comedy, and I laughed maybe twice.

So, after the movie ended, I looked up the cast and crew and noticed that Adrienne Shelly who played ""Dawn"" had died at a really young age and saw that she was also the writer and director. Wow!

I also have enjoyed Nathan Fillion in Serenity and the short-lived show Firefly that preceded that. But even with those expectations I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It seems like in the past few years movies have become (or maybe they have always been) incredibly predictable. You go see a romantic comedy and it's almost like you can write the next line. I don't know about you, but I kind of like not knowing what is going to come next. That is part of the intrigue. The characters in this movie were diverse, funny, and completely endearing. In Waitress the dialogue is surprising and different. I really enjoyed the quirkiness of the characters. The crowd I viewed this movie with spanned many generations and it seemed to me that nearly everyone was laughing and enjoying themselves. I would recommend this to guys, girls, whoever...if you go in thinking it is going to be like every other movie you will really be happy when you leave the theater. I am definitely going to see it again when it is released this weekend.",Waitress
213,consciousme,'Waitress' is a little bit country...,9,8 June 2007,"'Waitress' is a little bit country, and a little bit off-kilter funk, tragic-romantic, dysfunctional comedy. An amalgamation of peculiar characters that converge into a brilliant, well balanced blend of interesting human ingredients, sorta like those edible ones Jenna (Kerri Russell) uses to create the magnificent pies she's known for. Jenna's husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto) is quite disturbing. Veteran actor, Andy Griffith who plays the role of Old Joe, is a certified scene stealer, while Ogie's (Eddie Jemison) 'spontaneous poems' will indeed put a smile on your face. Nathan Fillion as Dr.Pomatta is convincing as mister nice guy awkward, gradually building to become the picture of a slightly flawed knight in shining armor. Dawn (Writer/Director; Adrienne Shelly R.I.P.) is big screen 'Ugly Betty' incarnate. Becky (Cheryl Hines; Curb Your Enthusiasm) is satisfyingly humorous. And Cal (Lew Temple) is a side order cook slash restaurant manager who's much smarter then he let's on.
