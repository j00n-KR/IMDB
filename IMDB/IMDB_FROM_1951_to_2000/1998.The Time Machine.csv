0,TheLittleSongbird,Style over substance,4,30 December 2010,"HG Wells's story is simply marvellous, and was done justice by the excellent 1960 film. However, while not terrible, this remake isn't particularly good either. Granted, the special effects are amazing as are the set design and sound effects, and Uber Morlock, with Jeremy Irons giving the only good performance in the film in the best-written scene, was intriguing. However, it is a case of style over substance. Also it is a rather poor adaptation of the book, with the story rather jumbled and anything that was so interesting and intriguing is diminished. It is also disadvantaged by bad pacing, so the film is rather dull too. The script is pretty awful, the direction is misjudged, the characters are shallow and the acting isn't great with the worst offenders being Samantha Mumba whose presence jars with the period and Orlando Jones whose comic interlude in a future library happens to be one of the film's worst scenes. All in all, watchable but disappointing. 4/10 Bethany Cox",The Time Machine
1,Leofwine_draca,"A mildly watchable effects film, but unsurprisingly not a path on the original",4,14 November 2016,"A curiously hollow remake of the 1960 George Pal classic; although watchable this is a far cry from the original movie which starred Rod Taylor in his finest performance ever. The film does make some unnecessary changes to the book/original film, but also goes out of its way to pay homage to some scenes memorable from the original movie – especially the shot at the end of that film, where we see a Morlock decaying into dust. This shot scared me senseless as a kid, so I was impressed to see it re-done on a bigger budget and with better effects in this version.The tacked-on romantic aspect of the story is deeply unnecessary and only serves to cloud the underlying adventure that the film contains. Another problem is with the far too short running time. An extremely fast pacing means that you never have time to sit back and contemplate what you've seen, as something is always happening or being explained. The end result is that you end up having forgotten most of what you have seen. Finally, the characters are one-dimensional and interchangeable, with a cast seemingly picked for their looks rather than their rightness for the role. Guy Pearce is a great actor but walks through this by barely trying, and Samantha Mumba looks fantastic but doesn't play a character – more of a clothes horse (or not, as the case may be). Jeremy Irons turns up unrecognisably (and with good reason) as the Morlock leader, in fantastic makeup that makes him resemble Emperor Palpatine in RETURN OF THE JEDI. Sadly his screen time is far too short, so he only gets to menace us for a brief while.The one thing that makes THE TIME MACHINE worth watching at all is the quality of the special effects. The first time travel scene pays homage to the original film in a fantastic way and it only gets better from there. The disintegration of the moon is another scene-stopper and the Morlocks are great creations, a mixture of imposing puppets and CGI-enhanced monsters. No qualms there whatsoever. The action sequence which shows them herding up the Eloi is also a great moment in the film. Sadly, the rest is rather mundane filler, but when your film looks this good then you can't complain too much. I'd stick with the original though.",The Time Machine
2,SnoopyStyle,Well made but a letdown,6,1 April 2014,"Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is a scientist living in 1899 NYC. He proposes to his girlfriend Emma, but she's killed in a robbery. Four years later, he builds a time machine. However when he tries going back to rescue Emma, she is killed in a different way. Disenchanted, he travels forward in time to 2030 to search for a way to change the past. However he finds nothing about time travel. He jumps forward another 7 years to find the world in collapse and chaos after the moon is destroyed. He tries to use his time machine again but an explosion knocks him out. The machine keeps running until 802,701 AD when he regains consciousness.The movie works well for awhile, but the future world of Eloi and Morlock is a bit of a letdown. It takes the H. G. Wells world and makes a Planet of the Apes movie out of it. In the end, the well-made movie is let down by this. Also there is an uncompelling action ending. The movie just has nothing profound to say, and is a barely functional action movie.",The Time Machine
3,gavin6942,Maybe This is Why Guy Pearce Stopped Getting Good Roles,5,6 August 2006,"I have not read the H. G. Wells story of the same name, so how much blame I can give to the original author and how much blame to the screenplay writer for the plot I am not certain. Some elements are interesting while others remain completely ludicrous.The story is of a man who loses his one love and becomes a time traveler, partially with the intent to save her (very much like ""Timecop"" in a sense) and in the grander sense to find out why man cannot change his history. The elements I found most interesting were his attempts to travel in reverse, creating somewhat of a ""what if?"" scenario. The future world, however, was rather boring and less interesting the farther in the future he went (contrary to my assumptions).The usual time continuity problems exist in this film that you have to ignore to enjoy the film. Although Guy Pearce was very nice in ""Memento"", he was just alright here... so my enjoyment was minimal regardless. Another time problem exists outside of the continuity (a library in the future has the mai character's collected writings despite no such writings existing) and reference is made to the Wells story, which seems really absurd if you think about it.The Morlocks did not impress me. The computer animation was a turnoff, I felt the creatures were far too removed from humanity to be believable, and the leader was more of a nuisance than a respectable villain. Not to mention his relation to the main character was quite vague.Overall, I was not impressed. The same story with a different director and with a slightly different morlock vision might have been very nice, but enough elements of this film were not to my liking that I cannot offer a positive recommendation.",The Time Machine
4,jboothmillard,The Time Machine,4,14 November 2009,"I had the opportunity to watch this on a plane to Florida, America, I had to see if I missed anything good, or not good, from director Simon Wells (The Prince of Egypt). Basically scientist and inventor Prof. Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is determined to prove the theory of time travel is possible, and after the death of his to-be fiancée Emma (Sienna Guillory) this becomes a desperation. Four years past, and without the knowledge of friend David Filby (Mark Addy), Alexander has succeeded in creating a ""time machine"", and the first place he goes is of course the day Emma was killed. Even after stopping the potential event to come she is still killed, and he knows it will happen every time he tries to stop it. So he decides to travel to the future to see whether time travel has been proved, and of course have the question of whether the past can be changed answered. He first tries the year 2030, where he stops off at the New York Library asking questions to holographic librarian Vox (Orlando Jones), and he is shocked to see the Moon breaking up just seven year later. Escaping from the devastation he get knocked unconscious, and unintentionally travels to the year 802,701 A.D., where the human race, or Eloi, has developed a new language (though English is still used occasionally) and a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. It is obvious though that the humans live in fear, when creatures known as the Morlocks, and Alexander is determined to help them before he thinks about going back to the past. He eventually meets the Über-Morlock (Jeremy Irons), who gives him an answer to the question to his past-changing question, before being destroyed outside the machine's time shield, travelling through time. In the end, Alexander decides to use the machine's time alternating power to vaporise the Morlocks, and he obviously stays where he feels happy, with Mara (singer Samantha Mumba) and her people. Also starring Phyllida Law as Mrs. Watchett and tom thumb's Alan Young (also starring in the original) as Flower Store Worker. This might have some pretty good special effects, Pearce might be alright, and Jones adds some light humour, but with some lazy sound effects, an underused Irons, and not enough excitement, the 1960 Rod Taylor classic is much more interesting than this lame and too quick-paced remake, but I suppose you can see it once. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup. Okay!",The Time Machine
5,ccthemovieman-1,They Still Can't Put H.G.'s Work Effectively On Film,5,30 August 2006,"This remake of the 1961 is more intriguing than the original version but still nothing worth adding your DVD collection. At least it was better than I anticipated. Neither, however, live up to the author's novel. In two tries, the film world is yet to produce a movie worthy of H.G. Wells' writing. The same goes for ""War Of The Worlds.""This updated version had a couple of things going for it: 1 - It didn't overstay its welcome at 96 minutes; 2 - it has some good monster-like villains who are fun to watch. No, it's not the ""thought-provoking"" film of 1961 but it's far more entertaining. Guy Pearce is a good replacement for Rod Taylor but Samanta Mumbo (who???) for Yvette Mimieux? No thanks.",The Time Machine
6,rmax304823,Flashy story based on Wells' Novel,5,24 August 2007,"The 1960 version by George Pal has stop-motion effects that seem dated now, especially compared to the dazzling images we see on the screen here, and yet I kind of prefer the earlier version. It was dated, pedantic, and simple -- or simple minded, if you like. But that very simplicity made it easier to follow the plot and to understand the points that Wells was eager to make. This version is longer, better acted, but is filled with action, some of it gory, that Pal's version wasn't very concerned with.Neither version, I gather, was that close to Wells' original. Pal's was closer in depicting the Eloi as an air-headed white-bread society with pink skins. This one is more realistic. The Eloi seem to be a mixed race. They look vaguely Polynesian -- what with body tattoos, pareus, and cowrie shells. In fact their culture looks like that of the Samoans and so do many of the Eloi themselves. If you took a sample of genes from all three major racial stocks, put them in a blender, and dumped them out on a table, they'd look like Samoans, which is not the worst fate in the world. Mara (whatever happened to Weena?) doesn't look quite as corruptly innocent as Yvette Mimieux but we can live with that.Guy Pearce is pretty good. He has a commanding face, prognathous and full of masculine bone structure, and his performance is quite different from that in ""L.A. Confidential,"" the only other work of his that I've seen. Jeremy Irons has a bit part as the Uber-Morlock, the brains of the hypogeal gang, so to speak. He's given what I guess are philosophical points to make in his brief appearance but I must be slow because I didn't get them.The problem with these films is that they both throw away Well's reasons for why things turned out the way they did. Capitalism has led to a two-tier society (the eaten and the eaters), and evolution (still a controversial idea) had its way for reasons that Wells spelled out. All of that is missing. We don't get any reasons for the lack of sexual bifurcation in the Eloi, nor any reason for their empty-headedness. Instead, we are given the Eloi as is -- ""Here they are, folks!"" No hint whatever that they are the descendants of the worn-out wealthy class of earlier days.I don't mean that this film should have been a series of lectures on the future physical and cultural evolution of our society. Just that certain questions and answers could easily have been built into the story itself, particularly if some of the violent scenes, unnecessarily long, had been elided. And what the hell is the black, stinky, gooey stuff on those blowgun darts anyway? It can knock down a full-grown man but it only frightens a little girl.Overall impression: Not bad, not insulting, but it looks as if it were the consequence of a meeting of a board of MBAs who began by asking, ""What NEW story is there that we can juice up with modern computer-generated images? The Time Machine? Great! Cannibalism and a destroyed earth -- a bonanza of fireworks!""",The Time Machine
7,ma-cortes,Gorgeous science fiction and fantasy movie based on H.G. Wells classic novel,6,28 June 2004,"Well written and produced film , it is an acceptable rendition from H.G. Wells novel . In fact , a picture of H.G. Wells is watchable in Alexander's house in several shots . Before being filmed by George Pal/Byron Haskin with starring Rod Taylor , Sebastian Cabot , Whit Bissel, and Alan Young who has a tiny role in this second version , 2002 . Here the star results to be Guy Pearce who gives a good playing . The film deals with time travel because his girlfriend -played by Sienna Guillory- has been killed and Guy Pearce who invents a device tries to go back in time with the aim to reborn her .

There Guy Pearce lives dangerous and frustrating experiences . As he travels forward into time , it reveals a dark and dangerous society.This exciting movie mingles noisy adventures , franctic action , a love story , drama , breathtaking special effects and it results to be entertaining enough . Originally scheduled for December 2001 , the release was modified to March 2002 because of a decision whether to change a scene involving a visible meteor shower which fell on New York . The financers were concerned that such a scene may stir records of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center . It provides an interesting and adequate adaptation by prestigious screen-writer John Logan , co-producer too , who equally wrote the Eloi language .Guy Pearce stars the main role giving a cool acting , he even did most of his own stunts . In fact , Guy Pearce broke a rib and suffered wounds during the shooting when he tackled the Morlock from the side . The support cast is agreeable , singer Samantha Mumba is nice , Mark Addy is fine , Jeremy Irons plays an incredible villain person and Orlando Jones delivers a humorous acting , as always . The cinematography by cameraman Donald McAlpine and musical score by composer Klaus Badlet are excellent , direction by Simon Welles (H.G.Wells'descendant) is first-rate . However , Gore Verbinski was brought in to take over the last twenty days of shooting , as Simon Wells was suffering from real exhaustion and extreme stress ; later on , Wells went back for post-production . Rating: 7 , entertaining and charming remake . Better than average , the picture contains all the ingredients that make it a good Sci-fi movie . It's still highly amusing and maintains its sense of wonder.",The Time Machine
8,hitchcockthelegend,Fetid.,2,11 November 2013,"Great-grandson of H.G. Wells, Simon Wells, constructs another interpretation of the great author's Time Machine. Starring Guy Pearce, Mark Addy, Samantha Mumba and Phyllida Law, what unfolds is a weak attempt at philosophical sci-fi that is pumped full of CGI to appease the undemanding Multiplex hoards. As grieving time traveller Alexander Hartdegen (Pearce) propels forward 800,000 years for his date with the apocalyptic future, where a two tier class system involving the weak willed Eloi and the animalistic Morlocks is the order of the time, we the viewers are treated to cheap action movie conventions and a laughably bad extended cameo by Jeremy Irons.H.G. Wells' cunning subtexts and social commentary is given over to a digital bastardisation that ultimately is charmless. 2/10",The Time Machine
9,Theo Robertson,Pretty Good Remake,7,22 October 2003,"I was interested in seeing this remake simply to find out if it was as bad as a myriad of critics have suggested it to be . I did love the 1960 version and I am not keen on people remaking my favourite movies , but surely last year`s remake of HG Wells romantic fantasy wasn`t going to be as bad as painted was it ?Herbert George Wells wrote the source novel so why not call the hero Herbert or George ? It`s also a Victorian sounding name so why`s the hero got a name that resembles Steve Martin`s character in THE MAN WITH TWO BRAINS ? This screenplay just like David Duncan`s from the 1960 version lacks an opening hook but it does speculate that even if time travel did exist it would be impossible to change ones destiny , an interesting thought . ScreenwriterJohn Logan adds a post modernist sequence featuring both HG Wells and STAR TREK . I didn`t think the humour worked very well but I had to admire his cheek , and since everyone cycles everywhere Logan suggests that in the mid 21st century America has elected a president from the green party which no doubt caused civilisation to collapse . Like most other movies set in the far flung future there are illogical gaps in the screenplay . For example remnants of the present day would still exist . Put it like this : The pyramids of Egypt are a few thousand years old and at the present rate of degeneration they won`t exist in a few thousand years but Alexander goes 798,000 years into the future and the skeletal remains of 21st century New York still remain ! , but as I said this is a common flaw in time travel stories as is the ridiculous notion that hundreds of thousands of years into the future people will still be able to understand and speak English , so this can be forgiven on the grounds of dramatic license . My only real criticism of the screenplay is that John Logan borrows a bit too much from Duncan`s earlier screenplay , otherwise this is a fairly good adaptation on Wells groundbreaking novel . Adding the ubermorlock is an inspired idea that works very wellI`m in two minds who to credit / criticise as director . As you may know Simon Wells left the project days before the project was completed and was replaced by Gore Verbinski so for the purposes of this review I`ll refer to the director simply as "" The director "" , and the director does manage one show stopping moment as the camera pans out from Alexander at the end of the 19th century across an ever evolving landscape eventually stopping on a lunar colony . The most controversial aspect of the film seems to be the casting or more especially the casting of dark skinned actors as the eloi , but I fail to see what the problem is . The eloi live on the surface in bright sunlight so why shouldn`t they be dark skinned ? It`s also in keeping with the social darwinism of Wells novel . The eloi have evolved due to environment the same way as the ubermorlock has evolved , and social darwinism is totally amoral so there`s no right or wrong , or good and bad involved . I do wish people would stop playing the race card . As for the ordinary morlocks they`re superbly designed with some great make up involved but the director throws a massive spanner in the works by having them running a hundred miles an hour and being able to jump great heights which suddenly makes them unconvincing which is a great pity , they would have worked better as men dressed up rather than CGI supermen . I did like Jeremy Irons as the scene stealing ubermorlock though . A word of warning for those of you who suffer from photo sensitivity , sadly once again this is a movie that heavily features strobe lighting . I`m not epileptic which is just as well because I wouldn`t want to risk a seizure watching THE TIME MACHINE . Sadly there seems to be more and more films being produced with this technique in style used and sadly I`ve had to keep saying - Stop using strobe lighting in movies . It`s totally irresponsible for directors to do this .To sum up the 2002 remake of THE TIME MACHINE was light years away from the debacle I`d been led to expect . It`s fairly good in its own right but not as good as George Pal`s 1960 version , maybe because it lacks the charm of the former , a charm that movie had in abundance , but this version is still pretty good as remakes go",The Time Machine
10,poolandrews,Unspectacular Hollywood time travel adventure.,4,11 December 2009,"The Time Machine starts in New York during 1899 where Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) proposes to his beloved girlfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory) who accepts, unfortunately just after they are attacked by a mugger & Emma is shot dead & dies in Alexander's arms. Jump forward 'Four Years Later' & Alexander has built a time machine which he uses to travel back to the night Emma was killed in order to save her but she is still killed, only a different way this time. Alexander realises whatever he does, however many times he goes back Emma will always end up dead one way or another & he yearns to know the answer why so he travels far into the future to discover the truth. However after having destroyed the moon two new races have evolved on Earth, the human like Eloi & the monstrous Morlock's that eat the Eloi. Alexander decides to stick around & save the Eloi.Directed by Simon Wells who is actually the great grandson of author H.G. Wells who wrote the original The Time Machine book on which the original The Time Machine (1960) film was based & it is in fact the 1960 film that producer John Logan's script is based upon here rather than Wells original literally source. While all three share the same basic story & ideas this remake adds the subplot about Alexander's fiancé Emma being killed & that's the reason he invents a time machine rather than just because he is clever & he can. The script is a mixture of sci-fi, action adventure & drama none of which really grabbed me or engaged me that much, sure there are a few pretty special effects, a few nice action scenes & the moment when Alexander's question is answered regarding why he can't save Emma is actually quite intelligent & makes sense it never really captured my imagination & I was never really moved by it either. The time travel aspects of The Time Machine feel very similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) in the sense you can't change the past but at the same time the future is not set only The Time Machine isn't anywhere near as good a film as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character's are alright although I thought Guy Pearce just looked too young to be a brainy scientist capable of inventing a time machine & there's never any real explanation behind it's mechanics either as it's like one moment there's no time machine the next he has invented & made one & it works perfectly. I reckon the Back to the Future trilogy offer far more thrills, laughs, excitement & general entertainment value than The Time Machine ever does & while I will stop short of calling it a bad film since it moves along at a decent pace, tells a reasonable story & has it's moments I wouldn't call it brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a cheeky little reference to the book & original film which are both name-checked here.The benefit this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects & in particular CGI which leads to scenes of time rapidly passing around Alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings being built, new ridges, canyons & mountains being formed & a elaborate pan back which ends up in space as we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon. The effects work is good, there are one or two moments that look a little below par but generally speaking the effects are good. I saw The Time Machine on telly & the station playing it badly pan and scanned it so the left & right edges of the frame were cut off the screen thus cutting off part of the year on Alexander's time machine dial so I actually didn't know what year he went to. Apparently director Gore Verbinski took over the last eighteen days of filming as Wells was suffering from 'extreme exhaustion' while the IMDb says that the time machine itself was the biggest & most expensive prop ever built for a film at that point which I find hard to believe & Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but like a trooper carried on.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 the production values are high with a lovingly recreated period New York & good effects work although amazingly The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for best make-up but lost out to Frida (2002). The acting is mixed, Jermey Irons puts in a good performance in a terrible make-up job that has him looking like a reject from a Lord of the Rings film while singer Samantha Mumba makes her big screen debut here & is simply terrible although Guy Pearce is quite good & fairly likable.The Time Machine isn't a particularly bad film or a particularly good one, just a somewhat unremarkable one that is watchable & passes an hour and a half but not much else. Watch Back to the Future (1985) again instead.",The Time Machine
11,lastliberal,Do you know what it's like to remember everything?,6,27 January 2008,"H.G. Wells story of the time machine is familiar, and this version is not as good as others and maybe better than some. The 1960 version won an Oscar for special effects. The effects here were great also, especially the Morlocks.You have to remember the Morlocks and the Eloi, especially if you saw Gary Sinise in Ransom. he was obsessed with them.This version was directed by H.G. Wells' great grandson Simon, who also directed The Prince of Egypt and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, wrote Chicken Run and worked on Shrek 2. He did a good job.Vox(Orlando Jones)was an especially great character and I loved seeing Sienna Guillory (Eragon, Love Actually) again, even though she had a very small part.

12,zardoz-13,Too Much Tock--Not Enough Tick!,5,7 July 2008,"When DreamWorks Pictures and Warner Brothers teamed up to film H.G. Wells' pioneer pulp science fiction yarn ""The Time Machine,"" they made it a family affair and hired the author's great-grandson Simon Wells to helm their $70-million plus movie. Previously, Wells directed two animated features: ""Balto"" (1995) and ""The Prince of Egypt"" (1998), so ""The Time Machine"" challenged him as his first attempt at a live-action outing. Not surprisingly, Simon says in his introduction to Ace Paperbacks' new edition of his great-grandfather's venerable novel, ""The film we set out to make is not a verbatim recapitulation of the book. We did not intend it to be. I do not feel it is the duty of filmmakers to simply put books on film. That would seem to undermine both media."" Apparently, something undermined Wells because 18 days before shooting wrapped, he succumbed to extreme exhaustion, and Gore Verbinski of ""The Mexican"" replaced him. Yes, ""The Time Machine"" surpasses the dreadful ""Mexican."" In fact, the new ""Time Machine"" depicts its subject matter with far greater verisimilitude than its Oscar winning forerunner. The lengthy, snail-like end credits reveal that scenarist John (""Gladiator,"" ""Any Given Sunday,"" and ""Bats"") Logan drew on David Duncan's script from the original 1960 M-G-M epic, directed by George Pal, starring Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux, Alan Young, and Sebastian Cole. Indeed, Pal's version rather than the Victorian 1895 novel (serialized in 1894) inspired Wells and Logan.Nevertheless, Wells & Logan wrought several changes that not only differentiate their mediocre remake from Wells' original text, but also from its juvenile cinematic predecessor. Indeed, the slickly done remake sets its sights much higher than the original movie but ascends to pretentious pinnacles without achieving a cathartic effect. Sadly, the 2002 version of ""The Time Machine"" qualifies as strictly second-hand hokum. Loyal Wells' readers may bristle at the liberties that the filmmakers have taken with the source material. First, they shift the story setting from London to New York City. I suspect they did so because an episode similar to the shoot-out in Central Park would never have occurred in England. Second, they give the protagonist of the novel a rather geeky name: Alexander Hartdegen. In the original, the hero was Herbert Wells. Third, they saddle him with a fiancée. In the novel, the hero lived as a bachelor with little interest in the opposite sex. After all, he pays matronly Mrs. Watchett to clean and cook for his intellectual pals and himself. Neither its opulently hallucinogenic computer-generated special effects nor its realistic looking 19th century production values can redeem this murky, moribund melodrama about the moral consequences of time travel. According to ""The Time Machine,"" you cannot alter antiquity.In 1899, an eccentric Columbia University Professor, Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pierce of ""Memento""), plans to wed his sweetheart Emma (Jessica Lange lookalike Sienna Guillory of ""Love Actually""). After Alex gives Emma a ring, an armed assailant robs them. Alex tangles with him. During the fracas, the thief wounds Emma accidentally, and she dies in Alex's arms. Four years elapse as Alex toils in his laboratory to create a time machine so he can go back and save poor Emma. Although he prevents Emma's tragic murder, Alex fails to save her when a runaway carriage collides with her and kills her. Tastefully handled as this sequence and the previous one were, the effect borders on hilarity. Grief-stricken, Alex wants to learn if mankind can reverse the past. He hurtles his time machine and himself into the distant future. Civilization has atrophied into two primitive societies: the peaceful, cliff-dwelling Eloi that appear straight out of director Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" remake. When a beautiful, deeply-tanned Eloi dame Mara (Samantha Mumba of ""Johnny Was"") saves Alex, he falls for her and helps her people oppose the aggressive Morlocks.Altogether, ""The Time Machine"" sticks to the basics of producer George Pal's opus, but Wells and Logan have dispensed with H.G. Wells' socialist commentary. The worst thing that Alex complains about here is bowing to the fashion dictates of the day and wearing a bowler hat. Meanwhile, ""The Time Machine"" departs even farther, including a disaster involving the Moon instead of a meteor and an explosive ""Stargate"" ending that obliterates the depraved Uber-Morlock adversary (a long-haired Jeremy Irons of ""Dungeons & Dragons""). Irons relies on his scary white make-up and black lip-liner to churn up chills, but he doesn't appear long enough on screen to make much of an impact. The phony Morlocks make a mild impression as the dastards of this film. Stan Winston, who designed these evil creatures, blew it on these thugs. They have faces like wooden Hawaii masks. Indeed, they look cool when they kidnap their victims and descend like the Martians from ""Invaders from Mars"" (1953) into the earth. Not only have Wells and Logan turned the classic Wells' tale into a turgid tearjerker, but they also have concocted a laughable, anti-technology manifesto, too!",The Time Machine

15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Nice to look at, not terribly much more",6,29 October 2007,"Ah, time travel... a concept that has fascinated man-kind for many generations(offered as evidence, the fact that Wells wrote about it, a man who died half a century before this film was made), led to many an interesting debate, theories, and yes, some good stories in various forms of media. Is time fluid, is it a straight line, can we truly change occurrences, and is time travel even a realistic possibility? However, for how many good, thought-provoking, food-for-thought-serving, awe-inspiring stories there are done, there are, of course, also many that are... not. This isn't really bad, it's just not great, either. It looks good, no argument there, and it does manage to be exciting and entertaining some of the time. The filming and editing help show gorgeous scenery as well as add intensity to the scenes that aim for that. The pacing is reasonable, if the film seems longer than the 90 minutes that it is. Acting ranges, but isn't too bad. Not sure I realized Orlando Jones could play it so straight. The special effects are amazing, almost without exception. The production design is excellent. The film definitely creates some beautiful imagery. Direction is done by Simon Wells, H.G.'s great-grandson, and that's about all there is about him... he did a few animated features, including Prince of Egypt, none of which I believe I have seen. I've neither read the original nor seen any of the other versions, so I can't say how closely the story is followed. All in all, entertaining enough, and definitely good-looking, so if that's what you're up for, hey, go for it. I recommend this to fans of the people involved and those who enjoy looking at visually appealing imagery. 6/10",The Time Machine
16,view_and_review,Not Much of an Improvement Over the 1960 Version,5,5 February 2021,"""The Time Machine"" is based upon a book by the same name written by H.G. Wells. It was made into a movie in 1960 starring Rod Taylor. I wanted to see what improvements, if any, were made to the 2002 remake.TTM 2002 was modernized, but I don't know if I can say that it was improved. There was one positive: it was reassuring to see people in the future who looked a little more like me. In the 1960 version you had a platinum blond race of Elois and a beastly race of Morlocks. The future now is no longer so homogenous.The main character in TTM 2002 is Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce, who may be remembered as the bad guy in ""Iron Man 3""). The time period: 1899. The city: New York. When Alexander's fiancé Emma (Sienna Guillory) was shot and killed, Alexander holed himself up and worked on a time machine to, presumably, go back in time to save her. That would lead to the Grandfather Paradox which asks, ""If you go back in time and kill your grandfather, would you exist?"" In this case the question would be: ""If the impetus for Alexander to go back in time was to save his fiancé, then he saves said fiancé, did he ever go back in time to begin with?""Enough of that.He failed anyway.He then went into the future, first to the year 2030, then to 2037, and finally to the year 913812 where he found the Elois who were being farmed by the Morlocks. There he met a woman who he'd have to save named Mara (Samantha Mumba). The same thing occurred in the 1960 version, but this time it was a little less fanciful romance.In the end, Alexander saves the day, which is still some fantastical nonsense. I guess it was better that he didn't go back to his time of 1899 only to realize that he wanted to be in the year 913812 as the hero did in TTM 1960, but it still reeked of the age old great white hope saving mankind BS. Maybe instead of remaking TTM they should've gone in a totally different direction with the time travel idea.",The Time Machine
17,neil-476,Enjoyable,7,15 May 2011,"This decent remake of the 1960 version of HG Welles story strays slightly further afield than its predecessor but, nonetheless, has much to recommend it.The visual aspect is terrific. The special effects are all excellent, as is the set design. The Morlocks are, broadly, well realised (especially movement) although the faces don't entirely convince.The cast, too, is good, if not outstanding (Guy Pearce's traveller is excessively anguished and over-earnest, and Jeremy Iron's urbane albino mutant strays into pantomimery). Samantha Mumba's Mara is a spirited move up from Yvette Mimieux's Weena, and this further move away from the novel is likely to be the reason why they gave her a name change.It is pleasing to see Alan Young again, the sole cast member to appear in both films,40 years apart.The variations in plot line all work dramatically, and the film as a whole is good fun.",The Time Machine
18,deloudelouvain,Entertaining sci-fi.,7,12 January 2020,"First of all I didn't watch the original movie neither did I read the novel from H.G. Wells so I couldn't compare this movie to either of them. To me this version was good enough to entertain me and that's the most important. It's an interesting story, not flawless but it doesn't really matter as it's all science fiction, so the couple details that make no sense are just irrelevant. A good cast, an entertaining story, not spectacular special effects but good enough to make it look real, that's all it took to make The Time Machine a good movie.",The Time Machine
19,SimonJack,"A fast track, but tedious and lame time machine",5,28 September 2021,"Warner Brothers moved the location of the H. G. Wells story, ""The Time Machine"" from London to New York. It added many characters to the story, and more stops in time. It changed the names from the book and 1960 film version. And, it ramped up the speed and action, adding much more for the action, fright factor and horror.And, for the special effects, it's mostly CGI that is so obvious copy and paste that there's no sense at all that one could be in any of the locales shown, with the cast. The major rewrite of the story doesn't serve it well here, and movie buffs agreed in 2002. The film grossed $124 million worldwide, against an $80-million budget. So, it lost several million dollars. (The film maker's take for movies is about 50 percent of the gross ticket sales.Except for those who get adrenalin charges from fast action films, this one probably won't appeal to or appease most audiences. And, it 's not a very good representation of the Wells novel.",The Time Machine
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,It was alright,5,3 February 2004,"I have seen the original Time Machine, and it didn't do anything for me. So, I heard of the remake, and I thought maybe it would be better. Boy, was I wrong. As for the remake, it's not too bad. But I perfer the original over this. Maybe I just have a weak heart for the classics. And Orlando Jones, uh uh.

How original. Duh.Slammed by the critics and panned by the public, ""The Time Machine"" features good visuals and art and a plot which is so convoluted that it's easier to just go with it than to try to follow it.

22,dromasca,Another Disappointing Version of A Classic,6,8 September 2002,"H.G.Wells' 'Time Machine' is probably one of the most often adapted to screen books. I have counted 14 titles in IMdB, and there are other with different titles as well - I remember 'Time after Time' - a good one about 20-25 years ago.This 2002 version is not one of the best. 'DreamWorks' studios continue to build their vision of a grim future, with lonely characters trying to save the day. I start to suspect that Spielberg's hand is behind many of them - this version looks in mood and atmosphere very much like 'A.I.'. However, as a film it lacks originality, and the message makes it quite heavily to the screen. Decent acting, a curious mix of conventional decors with already seen computer effects, Jeremy Irons playing a pale pervert monster - this movie does not bring anything that we have not seen before.I would also ask what is the audience of this film? In order to make it pass the puritan American censorship criteria it is almost totally cleaned-up of any bad language or sexual content. However, the effects and the monsters appearances (actually this is how mankind might look 800,000 years from now!) are that scaring, that I would try to avoid having my kids watch it if I see any early adds. Thus the audience might be limited to not much more than the sci-fi fans. I am one of them, but are we that many to justify this movie?",The Time Machine
23,g-bodyl,Good Fun!,8,3 September 2013,"The Time Machine is a fun, sci-fi remake that is more deserving than people give it credit for. The acting many be a little hammy, but this your good B-film that is out there for people to enjoy, not to rip it apart. The special effects are pretty good and the creature designs of the Morlocks are spot on.Simon Well's film is about a professor named Alexander who decides to build a time machine so he can save his fiancé from death. But after it was deemed impossible, Alexander heads to the distant future where he is to save mankind.The acting is actually pretty cheesy and hammy. But Guy Pearce does an okay job in his role. I liked Jeremy Irons. His makeup is pretty good and reminds me greatly of the villain from Hellboy ll.Overall, this is a decent sci-fi film. The special effects are good and the story itself is not bad. I find it pretty ironic how the great grandson of H.G Wells would direct a film based off his novel. I rate this film 8/10.",The Time Machine
24,ericstevenson,It doesn't hold up,5,2 February 2017,"I was interesting in seeing this movie if only because my brother likes it so much. I even went so far as to see it with him and he wanted the volume up and everything else. I had heard pretty bad things about this movie and wasn't expecting something great. After watching the film, my brother basically said that he realized it didn't hold up. That's nostalgia for you. I guess if I read the book version or seen the original movie, I would have liked it. There are definitely good scenes in this movie, but it just comes off as way too silly. It tells the story about this guy who travels back in time to save his girlfriend's life, but she dies anyway.He then comes to accept that he can't save her, but then travels into the future to find out why he can't. Then he accidentally travels much further where people live in tribes and there are these giant noseless hairy people who hunt after them. The worst part is that half of the movie takes place in this time. I wanted to see more of a futuristic setting. It was just silly with how these guys look. Their leader is some white and blue guy who looks nothing like them. This film was just too silly for me to take seriously, but I do like the scenes where the main character accepts his fate. Time travel fiction can do much better. **",The Time Machine

26,tabuno,Enjoyable Romp Through Time,7,27 January 2019,"10 March 2002. I enjoyed The Time Machine and its focus on simplicity and special effect instead of heavy time travel contradictions and fancy plots. This movie was straight backwards and forwards dealing with materialism and love - straight and simple. This was a feel good movie in a time (our time) of confusion, fear, and war. Too many critics looked for something really deep, tried to tear it apart because of its apparent lack of scientific continuity. But really the essence of this movie was human relationships and I thought the movie it made its point even though it took 800,000 years to do it. I felt with the characters. The only real problem I had was how a language could be kept so pure after so many years - of course they may have had help from a local library.",The Time Machine

I view them as an entity on its own. The visuals and make-up are simply incredible. The time travel scenes are sensational! The time machine itself is a beautifully designed machine. Quite spectacular, really.The film has a lot of flaws and scenes that causes one to raise an eyebrow. Mara's explanation of why they keep English alive is simply not believable. There really is no reason for them to speak English. Why do the Morlocks mark their victims? Why don't they simply randomly pick them? What is the purpose of marking them first?Despite these and other flaws, I absolutely love this film.",The Time Machine
28,Movie Nuttball,Great film! Below is My thoughts!,10,30 August 2003,"I just watch the Time Machine for only the second time but I appreciated the film much more than I did before! The effects is very good, the acting is good, the sets look very realistic, and the story is fantastic! Guy Pearce was good and I thought Orlando Jones was good. The music is extraordinary. The truth is I cried when this wonderful part was at the end credits. It starts when the credits say about Stan Winston Studios. It was of course in the film when Guy Pearce lost his necklace in the Time Machine. Also it is located on the original score track number six ""I don't belong here"". It is really an emotional piece of music composed by Hans Zimmer's colleague Klaus Badelt! I really liked this short but epic picture. Great for time traveling movie fans!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:The following is in My opinions and My thoughts.This movie has an important message I believe. To make it short a person should appreciate life even if it isn't a perfect world. A person should look up at the sky and look at the moon and think how beautiful it looks and what ever time it is whether the sky is a twilight, a cloudy, or what ever kind of sky and thank the lord that he/she can look at it. Us people should be very thankful that we have all of the great trees and animals to live together in the same world. The person should make life better for a better future just not for the person but for everyone around the person. We don't know how the future will be in several years or decades or even further. We should start and use ours minds and stop being cocky and thinking we know everything when we really haven't even begun to learn. Think about, We don't know what God and his heaven looks like. Heck, we don't even know all of the species of fish and other life forms in the ocean. Sure we humans have existed for thousands of years but how long have we had our great technology of today such as televisions. video games, and of course electricity. This hasn't been around long at all compared to how long our human race has. We should all appreciate everything and think before we leap. I just think of things that are important and that most that don't care. This is My thoughts! Thank you for reading!",The Time Machine

In the 1960's Puppettoon Director George Pal assembled a great and memorable cast which included Rod Taylor, Alan Young and Yvette Mimieux. From it's inception, the film resonated with audiences everywhere and was a definite Classic. In 2002, Simon Wells (The great-Grandson of H.G.Wells) decided on a re-make of the original. In this updated version we are given Guy Pearce who plays Alexander Hartdegen, the time traveler, Mark Addy who plays David Filby and includes Alan Young in a brief appearance as a Flower shop keeper. There is little in the way of comparison as few Classics can ever be excelled. Therefore the next best thing is to highlight the new offering. The original had a a beautiful Eloi named Weena, the new one has Samantha Mumba as Mara. Weena had innocence, Mara has intelligence. The original Morlocks were green skin creatures, the new ones resemble the Sphinx edifices of the original. The original time machine was small, compact and comfortable, the new one resembles a "" Cappuccino maker. "" The visual action in the original was Victorian, romantic and sympathetically dramatic, the new one is bleak, dark and apocalyptic-ally blurred. Jeremy Iron's is as always incredible and masterful. All in all the new version is good, highlighted with visual effects, explosive features and dramatically action oriented.

32,generationofswine,An Honest Review,5,1 July 2017,"I don't know how to approach this one.""The Time Machine"" is one of those stories that, rereading it, beings back vivid memories. One of my best friends in high school loaned it to me, I stored it away in my backpack for about a month and then...when we had a field trip to The Board of Trade, I scrounged it out and read it on the train ride.It was one of those stories that is so short I could rip through it in the hour and fifteen minutes between our small town and Chicago. To this day, every time I go back to it, it brings me back to 1997 and, to this day, I distinctly remember finishing it about the time the train stopped and I remember walking into the crowded city feeling like I was in a different world. The story had moved me out of reality so much Chicago seemed jarring.And then they made it into a movie, a remake of a movie and, watching it, I don't know, I didn't have that same sense of being in a totally different world that the book gave me...And the movie, in my mind, has to live up to that experience in some small way. Or at least give you that feeling that same feeling that the world was still spinning that one gets when they walk out of a movie and discover that it had rained.It's an engrossing story and The Time Machine didn't seem to whisk me away like the book did. I can't help but feel it deserved better.It felt like I was watching a movie and, honestly, it gave me the same since that Jackson's King Kong did, it felt like it was trying and horribly, miserably failed.I left feeling ""meh,"" and that was after being excited walking into it, I mean, I read it in 1997 and they made a movie in 2002 and, I was expecting the same feeling. I had waited long enough.So, I don't know, I may be overly harsh on it just because I loved what the story did to me so much, the first time I read it and now, as an adult, it doesn't take me to another world, it takes me back to 1997 again, and high school, and that hour fifteen minute train ride to Chicago.So ultimately, it could be a halfway decent film that I just hate because the story had such a jarring effect on me when I first encountered it.",The Time Machine
33,ianlouisiana,Not quite such a lot of Morlocks this time - but still pretty poor.......,5,21 May 2009,"Mr Guy Pearce surely couldn't have meant us to take him seriously with Jim Carrey's teeth set in Johnny Depp's face?What was he thinking of? Loping around like an anxious primate Mr Pearce was presumably meant to represent an absent minded professor but to me he resembled nothing more than Jerry Lewis's Nutty Professor. Whilst Mr Rod Taylor in the 1960 version could only go forward in time,Mr Pearce goes back in time at first to prevent the murder of his fiancée.Having failed in this he virtually commits ""suicide by Time Machine"" and shoots forward to the unimaginable future.Here he falls in love with a lady of the ill - used Eloi and comes up against the Morlocks who may have improved in appearance but have not improved in habits. Certainy the Special Effects are a far better than in the original,but despite all the whistles and bells ""The Time Machine"" still fails to realise on the screen. Perhaps,like the work of Mr Ray Bradbury,the writings of a genius like Wells cannot be adequately imagined except in the mind of the reader. There are some nice visual jokes scattered round the laboratory but,diverting as they may be,they hardly make up for the pedestrian - like plod of the movie as a whole I'm afraid.",The Time Machine
34,JoeB131,Everything that is wrong with remakes.,3,2 May 2011,"This movie shows everything that is wrong with remakes.The thing is, the 1960 version is perfectly fine as it is. There was no reason to remake it.So what we get is what we see in modern movies, at least ones after Star Wars where they try to shove as much stuff into the screen as you possibly can.Subtley is lost. In the 1960 version, they didn't need to hit yourself over the head with the fact the Morlocks were eating the Eloi. In this one, the hero has to fall into a charnel pit, and swim around in a pool of human bones after finding the butcher's shop and the meat hooks. Oh, wait, we also need to get Jeremy Irons in there to do a bit of exposition... because someone might have missed the point.I do want to say something about the lead actress. While Weena in the 1960 version is a blonde, whiter than white chick, the character of Mara and all the other Eloi are mixed race people. Mara is played by a Irish-Zambian actress who had the right look, but the woman couldn't act. (I mean, it made sense that they would all start breeding out and racial distinctiveness would be lost after a certain time.) Of course, in Wells version, the Eloi were as twisted and different from the narrator as the Morlock were. It was a commentary on class differences of Wells' time leading to evolutionary differences. The working class (Morlocks) would eventually turn on and eat the rich (Eloi).Oh, yeah, action. Lots of action.",The Time Machine
35,arthur_tafero,Courageous Effort - The Time Machine 2002,6,16 November 2019,"The remake of 1960s The Time Machine is a courageous effort. Guy Pearce is a better looking and better actor than the original. The blonde, however, is not as sexy as the original actress. The production values and special effects, of course, are superior after 40 years, but the American movie viewer is not the same as they were in 1960. The special effects and storyline were far more wondrous 40 years ago, as American audiences are far more jaded and used to massive special effects in the current time period; even in 2002. The strength of this film, however, is not the acting or the special effects. The strength of this film is its philosophical commitment to the future, rather than the past. The protagonist accepts the tragedy of his past and moves on with his life. That is the real message of the film. All of us have difficulty in accepting this reality, but sooner or later, we come to accept it and move on (at least most of us do). As the song says ""Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone"". The film has elements of Apocalypse Now, with its use of shadows and faces, and elements of Blade Runner with its philosophical conversations about the future vs the past (instead of robots vs humans), and elements of the original production sensibilities.

36,noralee,Not a Thrilling Ride on this Machine,4,13 December 2005,"I have a Scholastic Reading Club copy of ""Time Machine"" on my shelf so I guess I read it when I fell for my first Aussie actor, Rod Taylor, though I don't remember the book at all, but I've seen the old movie a lot of times. I was surprised this one was set in NYC, not London, especially as everyone's accents wandered around from American, to upper class American, to pseudo-Brit (at least it gets points for shooting in New York State -- upstate). The new time travel motivator as his dead fiancée worked well.The special effects during the time travel of the cities and climate changes were entertaining, and the art direction of the world of the future was creative, though, gee, some folks manage to still speak good English.Guy Pearce's hair got better looking as he went into the future. I'm sure the NY Public Library will be glad to know it survives, though its interior looks more like the Metropolitan Museum. Orlando Jones was surprisingly good as a cyber librarian.But ho hum on the battles with the underground enemy, even when led by Jeremy Irons. Sorry I had to laugh at him fighting with Pearce, even though Pearce is supposed to be a nerdy scientist and a chunky stunt double was doing the heavy lifting for Irons. With all of Irons's make-up, this was practically a voice-over and his ""Scar"" was scarier.And like all standard sci fi, damsels in distress in the future will be thin, beautiful and dress like Britney Spears (does that mean this is the future?), though this one is a teacher so has some brains too.Just not much of a thrilling ride on this machine.(originally written 3/17/2002)",The Time Machine

38,drystyx,"good action, plot, and likable hero equals good movie",8,23 February 2008,"There are a few malcontents who hate this movie, but it hard to see where they are coming from. This is a remake of a movie where a guy invents a time machine (how did you guess!) The original was a bit flawed and fragmented. This one tried to put together a lot of pieces. Rod Taylor usually played very unlikable characters, but he was likable as the inventor in the original. However, Pearce is perfectly cast as the inventor who travels through time. At first, he uses it for personal motives, and finds that no matter what he does, he cannot change the past. Whether or not we agree with this concept, the film goes about in a very clever way of showing its position on the matter. Of course, it is only a matter of time before our hero goes deep into the future. What he finds there is possibly a letdown for some movie fans, but given the premise of the movie, it is well done, except for the savage beasts that are just way too super, and look more like a geek's video game version of reality. But the director doesn't dwell much on their super powers, and it is easy to get past this flaw. Our hero is a very likable genius, and we travel along on the journey with him, the sign of a good movie, and good directing. In fact, the supporting cast is also very good. This movie has good atmosphere, and a pleasant feel. It is much better than the original, even given the expectations of the times, and the original was a good movie.",The Time Machine
39,EdgarST,Good remake,9,22 December 2003,"A better movie than what I expected (due to reviews that compare it negatively to the 1960 version with Rod Taylor and a mute Yvette Mimieux.) The story, centered around a scientist who wants to ""fix the past"", moves forward 800,000 years, where he discovers the outcome of the struggle between those who claimed the supremacy of one race over the others... As well as in the 1960 movie (which was anti-war), this one also has a ""message"", dealing with ethnic groups. I think H.G. Wells would approve what his grandson (director Simon Wells) did with his novel, as well as George Pal, the director of the 1960 film (there are a couple of tributes in this new version), which was fun, but not as great as some persons say.",The Time Machine
40,screenman,Another Failed Opportunity,6,2 May 2009,"By the third millennium, special-effects became sufficiently sophisticated to finally bring Wells' tremendous novel(s) to the screen with their full visual, visceral and narrative impact. Yet here again; just like Speiberg and his 'War Of The World' a director thought he knew better than the original and decided to 'screw around'.I'll begin with some praise. The time machine as a vehicle was wonderfully realised. Instead of an 'armchair with a spinning parasol' from the 1950's movie, we had something that was both mechanical in a 19th century fashion, but with an 'optical-visual' update that made it seem wonderfully contrived. The effect was dramatic - a great amalgam of science and fantasy that did HG Wells proud. I particularly liked the telescopic mounting-steps.But then there was the story. The soppy, predictable romances both in present and future might have been concocted by Disney. We had the idealised Eloi community - and far more human-looking than Wells imagined - with a politically-corrected mixed-race heroine yummy-mummy who might have been born next door. That is; if you lived in the 20th/21st centuries. Their idealised circumstances were given emphasis by rather stylistic Polynesian tribal music scores. Everything is apparently sweetness and light - or is it? And, of course, they've had the good sense to carry on speaking English with American accents. As you would after 800,000-odd years. Hmmm.The Eloi are just so nice, it makes their contrast with the Morlocks that much more civilised when the latter finally appear. Moral issues are simplified for the crass modern viewer. Here the Eloi are a sensible, practical self-sufficient people in their own right. And, of course, they're human. Morlocks, by contrast, are hideous, strong, violent carnivorous hunters. Unlike those envisaged by Wells; these Morlocks can come out in daytime, and they possess superhuman strength and agility. There's no ethical dilemma here. Or is there? later we discover that the Morlocks themselves employ a caste system like that of termites. And our time-traveller finds himself introduced to the grand-wizard-Morlock-bloke-thing who is seriously brainy. He can even read minds. Why, it's Jeremy Irons reprising his intellectual bad guy role in such a beautifully-coiffured blonde wig that whatever the Morlocks may lack in table-manners they evidently make up for in hairdressing skills. He has rather disagreeable plans for the yummy-mummy whom he also holds captive. To his credit; he offers to let the time-traveller go - with no strings. But that would mean abandoning the yummy-mummy to a fate worse than death or something, and in true comic-book fashion a hero can never do that.Instead, he sabotages his time-machine, destroying the Morlock enclave, and presumably gets to screw his yummy-mummy into an indefinite Morlock-free future. Though whether he will sire any offspring is a moot biological point; 800,000 years is a long period of gene isolation. Four of my stars go to the machine. The other two are for sundry effects and sets. But the rest? Well; script and plot were complete junk. Acting was 2nd rate. As to Wells' classic novel and idea? All of his imaginative and thought-provoking concepts were jettisoned in the name of a bog-standard hero-saves-hapless-'maiden', romance-against-adversity tale as crass as 'Pearl Harbour' and as predictable as 'Titanic'. Mediocre; worth a single watch, but no substitute for the book.What the hell's wrong with directors these days? With a little more thought, this could have been great.",The Time Machine
41,tomsview,Future schlock,4,21 February 2013,"With a heavy-handed forward pressure on the crystal lever, H. G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"" eludes the latest cinematic attempt to capture the story's mix of Victorian charm and vision of man's future – despite being helmed by H. G.'s great-grandson, Simon Wells.With the effects available today, one could be forgiven for thinking that this time everything would favour the filmmakers. There was also the advantage of being able to view the 1960 George Pal version, thus avoiding some of the pitfalls in translating the story to the screen. But therein lies the problem because the script is only loosely based on the original story; it is as though the screenwriter's knowledge of Wells' tale came from a chat over coffee with somebody who had read the book twenty years before.The film that emerged is so derivative of other movies that the source for these should have been listed in the end credits. Following in the footsteps of fellow Aussie, Rod Taylor, from the 1960 version, Guy Pearce plays the Time Traveller, Alexander Hartdegen. The filmmakers introduced some original touches to the story with varying degrees of success. After an early sequence involving the death of Hartegen's fiancée, and his attempts to journey into the past on his time machine, he decides to go forward to learn of the future of mankind. He discovers that due to a failed attempt to colonise the moon, it has begun to break up causing great changes on Earth. During a stopover on his journey in the New York Public Library, Hartdegen discovers a holographic, animatronic teacher, played by Connie Ray. Although the robot is used to explain what is happening to life on Earth, he also does double duty as a wise cracking commentator seemingly inspired by Robin William's genie in Disney's ""Aladdin"". Hartdegen presses on to the year 802701AD and stops. Almost immediately he becomes involved with the Eloi who live in clifftop dwellings. But now the film departs from the novel not just in detail but also in basic motivation. The Eloi already speak English while their civilisation is presented as a cross between 1970's hippie culture and the tribes from ""Stargate"".The female lead in the film, the exotic and full figured Samantha Mumba as Mara, fails to measure up to the more petite Yvette Mimeaux who played Weena in the 1960 version, but it's hardly her fault; there is no build-up or tension involved in Hartdegen's discovery of the Eloi world.Worse is to come. The other essential element in Wells' tale is the Morlocks; those subterranean dwellers that prey on the Eloi at night. It is the Morlocks that provide the strongest sense of deja vu. Not only do they seem to have lost their fear of light, essential to the plot in the original story, but they also embody nothing less than a reunion of old friends; there are traces of the creatures from ""Alien"", ""The Mole People"", ""Planet of the Apes"", and do we detect a little Freddy Kruger in there? The familiarity becomes uncanny when we meet the Uber Morlock played by Jeremy Irons. If Anthony Hopkins ever relinquishes the Hannibal Lector franchise, Jeremy Irons could use his role in this movie as his CV for the part. Eventually, the battle between the Time Traveller and the Uber Morlock owes more to the ""Terminator"" series than to H. G. Wells.The ending, rather than Wells' death of the sun, opts for a ray of sunshine instead with Hartdegen at last finding a home with the Eloi. He encourages a thirst for learning among the Eloi children and introduces them to a teacher, the Connie Ray character who has endured through the centuries; better in fact than the time machine. ""What if"" is a phrase that is repeated throughout the film, and it could serve as the plaintiff cry of anyone who loves the original story, enjoyed the Pal version, but always hoped that a contemporary filmmaker would finally do the story justice – I'm afraid we have waited in vain.",The Time Machine
42,MartianOctocretr5,Disjointed mess,2,26 April 2010,"How could H. G. Wells' own great-grandson destroy his ancestor's work so completely? This debacle betrays all thought and soul of the original story, and settles for loud noise and uninspiring visuals.The 60's version addressed the danger of a nuclear exchange, and the horrors of war in general. But what was this thing on about? The time traveler tries to change events in order to prevent a personal tragedy. He fails. Many times, thanks to cheap plot contrivances thwarting his efforts. The voyage to the future consists of lispy-voiced holograms, the moon cracking up (somebody explain to these film makers just what the ramifications of that are), mechanical goof-ups with the machine, and a cartoonish ghoul that looks like Willy Wonka minus his top hat. 800,000 years from now, he's using a fake British accent, and gadgets from modern day are still functioning. The overall look of the thing is just ugly, without artistic purpose. Then there's more stuff getting blown up, for no particular reason. Pointless and boring; goes nowhere.",The Time Machine

However the rest of the movie was really boring.  I never though ""what if"" like I did when I saw the origional Time Machine.  The scene where Alex goes down into the Land of Morlock was lame. It looked like Pirates of the Carribean from Disney Land. I felt like I was at at theme park and not a good movie.  Guy Pierce was paid well for this no doubt.  His worst movie to date is this.  His best is The Count of Monte Cristo and Ravenous.  Also, what's the deal with that black babe?  As if people would look like her in 808K years.  And the evil Jeremy Irons was like Darth Maul.  You could not get to know his character so it was no big deal with him.  This move was a waste of my (time).  I wish I had a Time Machine to go back to yesterday and avoid this movie.

You just don't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters or there plight. And because of the way its constructed it's impact is kind of dependent on it. That being said this story of a scientist who builds a machine to try and go back in time to prevent the death of his love is a little formulaic and by the numbers. As you would guess it's something he really can't do and accidentally ends up travelling far into the future where cannibalistic humanoids hunt the remaining population. One of the tribe is played by pop singer Samantha Mumba. As it stands it's a fun film but not very memorable. That being said there are far worse ways to spend 90 minutes.Budget: $80m

Ugh, was I wrong. 'The Time Machine' is what it is, Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a early century mathemticican who is obsessed with building a time machine to go back in time to rescue his fiancée from death, when that proves inconclusive (she just KEEPS dying lol), he decides to go AHEAD in time to find out how he can change the past. WHAT? That doesn't really make a lot of sense. Methinks he should have done the Bill Murray thing and just keep trying.. Or is a Final Destination factor in place **whatever**, anyways, Pearce, conveniently knocked out for reasons too stupid to discuss here, goes like 20,000 years into the future, where the people don't speak English anymore, are hunted by beings down below, and yadayadayada.

47,mentalcritic,Exhibit A in the case that Hollywood is too remake-happy,3,5 June 2006,"Remakes are a lot like sequels to Hollywood. With a little bit of work on a new script and some updated effects, a pre-existing audience can be made to cough up a little more cash on an idea they saw executed a few years ago. It's a pity that nobody in Hollywood seems to have the sense to say ""this idea is not going to work"", because it could have saved a lot of unnecessary grief on this remake. I do not know whether director Simon Wells believed his relation to author H.G. Wells necessarily qualified him to remake an adaptation, but he has proved himself very wrong here. The biggest problem with this update, in a nutshell, can be stated as sometimes, less is a whole lot more. Where George Pal glossed over small details in the late Wells' novel, Simon Wells embellishes them, and in so doing, highlights the reasons why Pal left them on the cutting-room floor. Perhaps the most embarrassing part is the use of Jeremy Irons as an über-Morlock, waxing all philosophical as the leader of a race that is meant to represent regressed humanity.For the most part, the structure of the story is the same. An inventor creates a machine that allows him to travel back and forth through time. Eventually, he comes to find himself in the distant future, and discovers a people as much in need of guidance as he is in need of a place to fit in. Sadly, Wells feels compelled to add an extraneous and unnecessary storyline concerning repeated trips into the past to save a young woman from dying. Not only does it add nothing to the story, it serves to highlight the paradoxical nature of the central theme. Ask anyone who has written or filmed a time travel story, and they will tell you that if there is one thing you do not do, it is give the audience a chance to think about, much less dwell upon, the paradoxical nature of what they are seeing. Another problem is that too much material is presented in too little screen time. The 1960 film was a lean ninety-nine minutes because it made good use of the time it had. This 2002 remake is ninety-six minutes long because plot threads are discarded so fast that development is an impossibility.Not helping matters is the casting. A soap opera actor is simply not the right person to credibly portray this unconventional hero. Jeremy Irons does his best with a terribly-written part, and it is quite amusing to see him eat the scenery. I think his agent had a lot of explaining to do after The Time Machine premiered. One of the few touches that is comparably brilliant with the 1960 film is Orlando Jones as Vox, a virtual history teacher who fills the hero in on the way the world of the eight thousandth century came to be. I prefer the ring-spinning sequence in the 1960 film for its creepy and impersonal atmosphere, but the Jones-Pearce exchanges have a certain human touch going for them. Which you prefer will obviously depend a lot on how you like to have your exposition delivered. Had the rest of the film been made like this, we would be judging it on its own merits rather than how it fails compared to its august predecessor.Getting back to how the film feels too cramped for its own good, a pertinent quote is when the hero tells us he could come back a thousand times and see the woman he is trying to save die a thousand different ways. Jeremy Irons later explains that this woman's death is set in stone, because otherwise our inventor would have no reason to build his machine. These paradoxes keep spinning about in the plot without any sort of attempt to divert us from the fact that the hero is like a child who wants to control the fate of everything around him. One could interpret the ending of George Pal's film as the hero deciding to leave behind that which he cannot change and embrace that which he can. If this point was what H.G. Wells intended to be in his story, then it was obviously lost upon Simon Wells. Simon spends so much time trying to conform a story that is both timeless and yet rooted in the time of writing to modern ideas that he loses much of what makes the novel a classic that may well be read into the year 800,000 and beyond.Adding insult to injury is the attempt to tie in the hero's experiments with Einsteinian theory. Einstein had many ideas that turned out to be incorrect, but had he lived into the twenty-first century, he would have found quite a perverse delight in cataloguing insultingly stupid film physics, of which The Time Machine circa 2002 has an overload. The 1960 film had our inventor travelling through the ages in order to witness first-hand the proof that time does indeed change space. This version seems to just have man's endless quest to have a beautiful woman to bounce upon as its primary motivator. Not that this isn't a noble motivation for some things, but it sucks as a motivation for experiments that could alter the very fabric of the universe. Roger Ebert also inadvertently sums up another brilliant facet of the ring sequence from the 1960s film: ""Convenient, that when humankind was splitting into two different races, both its branches continued to speak English."" So much in this film is left unsupported or unexplained that it is literally a small wonder that it makes sense.I gave The Time Machine, circa 2002, a three out of ten. Even if it were the first-ever production of a film based on H.G. Wells' novel, it would be a sad excuse for a film. With its 1960 predecessor to be compared to, it is a sad day for humanity.",The Time Machine
48,jhclues,Where Would You Go? Well...,2,10 March 2002,"Novelist H.B. Wells was a man of vision, so it's somehow ironic that all these years later his own great-grandson, Simon Wells, would direct an adaptation of one of his novels, and bring it to the screen with such a lack of imagination.  Because, despite a bit of flash, `The Time Machine' that Wells gives us is just another Sci-Fi movie that doesn't mean much, and simply isn't that entertaining.  And the problem lies in the fact that Simon, unlike H.G., lacked the vision he needed to make this a viable commodity; he lost the metaphor, and with it, the film.	Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) has invented a machine that-- he hopes-- is capable of time travel; and for it's maiden voyage, he visits the past in an attempt to alter a devastating event in his personal life.  When he comes to the conclusion that it is impossible to change the past, however, he decides to try the future where, perhaps, he will find the answer to his dilemma.  But what he finds, 800,000 years in the future, is a civilization turned against itself, with a society defined by two distinct factions:  Those who live on the surface of the earth, and those who dwell in the darkness beneath it.  And all that's left of the world Alexander knew is a few remnants of what is now an ancient and inexplicably inconsequential past.  It's now a world of light governed by the dark; a world in which it is doubtful that he will find the answers he seeks.	Very doubtful, indeed, because throughout the film Wells is seemingly unable to figure it out himself.  Early on, you have to wonder what it is, exactly, that he's trying to tell us here.  Where is he going with this? The initial sequences, in which Alexander goes back in time, plays out like an episode of `The Twilight Zone,' but then the film switches gears and blasts! into the future, propelled by fairly anemic motivation on the part of the protagonist.  The screenplay (by John Logan) is uninspired and unimaginative, with a plot that is so convoluted it fails to maintain much interest.  It's one of those movies that, while you're watching, you keep waiting for it to really kick in and get started-- and it never does. Instead, they take us to a future with a setting that looks borrowed from the remake of `Planet of the Apes,' where we're introduced to a bunch of people, the Eloi, who live on the sides of some cliffs, but aren't particularly interesting by any means.  There's nothing especially enigmatic about them, nor are they apathetic to what's going on around them.  If they were either of these, it might spark some interest, but it just isn't happening.  	And when we meet the Morlocks, those who live underground, it doesn't help matters any.  These are supposedly the other half of the human race, but there's nothing about them that looks human at all; they look  more like beasts born of a Wes Craven/Stephen King collaboration.  But then we meet the `Uber' Morlock (Jeremy Irons) who is one of the more highly evolved members of the family, with powers that one would think could've enabled him to improve their living conditions a bit.  By this time, however, you've probably finished your popcorn and could care less.	As Alexander, Guy Pearce gives new definition to the `absent minded professor' character, and does it in a way that is unconvincing and with a presentation that is rather pretentious.  In a film that demands you suspended disbelief in the first place, his portrayal does nothing to help in that regard.  It's hard to believe that the Alexander Pearce creates has the resolve, resourcefulness, drive or tenacity to undertake such an adventure as this.  And there's nothing about him that would lead us to believe that those in the future will be any better off for having encountered him.  He just doesn't come across as a guy who's going to make a difference.  It's obvious that Pearce was attempting to create something unique with this character, or at least had something specific in mind, and for that you have to give him credit.  But as it is with any artistic endeavor, it doesn't always work.  And this one didn't.	There is a positive aspect to this film, however, and it's the performance of singer Samantha Mumba, as Mara, the girl of Alexander's future.  She has a definite screen presence and an affecting, natural delivery, all of which should insure a successful career as an actress, should she decide to pursue that path further.  The fact that she was able to create a memorable character in such an insipid film as this speaks volumes about her ability and talent, and hopefully, she will opt for more work in film.	The supporting cast includes Mark Addy (Philby), Phyllida Law (Housekeeper), Omero Mumba (Kalen), Sienna Guillory (Emma) and Orlando Jones as Vox, a kind of hologram/encyclopedia (and another of the more ridiculous aspects of this film, especially after you think about it for awhile and really put it into context).  A film that will be remembered primarily for wasting the talents of Pearce, Jones and especially Jeremy Irons, `The Time Machine' is a misfire destined to be one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of the year.  And it's a shame, because the filmmakers had all the tools with which to work, but didn't know what to do with them. Even the F/X were disappointing, which is surprising, given all the resources available to a big-budget production such as this.  It's interesting that the tag line for this film is `Where would you go?' because the answer seems so obvious.  But if there's any doubt, let me jump in here and say, `To any movie other than this one--'  I rate this one 2/10.",The Time Machine
49,TOMASBBloodhound,Word of mouth may have gotten it wrong this time.,8,13 March 2009,"The Time Machine seemed to die a quick death at movie theaters when it was released back in '02, and this is a shame. I happened across some of it in the middle of the night a few months back and was intrigued. I just saw all of it and came away somewhat impressed. Just read Ebert's scornful review to get an idea of the negative press that must have sunk this film. True, nothing we see is really plausible, but.... HELLO! This is a fantasy. It is science fiction. Well, thankfully the science really doesn't matter here.The story is somewhat based on the H.G. Wells book of the same name. Apparently the director of record here is his great grandson. I have never read the book, but it would seem unnecessary when it comes to understanding this film. Guy Pierce plays a young scientist who designs a time machine, hoping to go back a few years and save his fiancé who dies in a mugging. Using Einstein's theories, he does so. But no sooner does he think he has saved the woman, than he discovers that fate may not have any regard for our scientific accomplishments. In order to figure out why this is, Pierce next travels into the future. First into the year 2030, and eventually some 800,000 years later! What he finds has happened to humanity is enough to make anyone shiver. It seems that humans have destroyed the moon, and this eventually led to great problems for earth. Humanity ended up splitting into two subspecies. The Eloi, who are brown-skinned and peaceful as any romanticized depiction of Native Americans. And the Morlocks, an underground-dwelling and ferocious bunch who feed on the Eloi. Jeremy Irons is their supreme leader! He is the most advanced creature in the film. He can even read the minds of those he encounters. The rest of the film deals with Pierce settling in with the Eloi and trying to free them from the Morlocks. All of this in just over 95 minutes!! The film has many, many good things going for it. The special effects of time travel will be what you remember the most. Watching the earth change around Pierce while he sits inside the protective cocoon of his machine is quite a sight. The machine itself is an impressive creation rumored to be one of the most expensive movie props ever built. The acting is terrific in most cases, too. Guy Pierce has never quite become a huge star, but he has the talent to be one. And look out for Orlando Jones (the original 7up ""up yours"" guy) who plays a helpful hologram who has all kinds of needed information for the characters. The music is better than average, and the locations (past and future) always look good or even frightening.I'd be the first to tell you to give this movie a look. It isn't too long, and it is full of interesting happenings. And keep in mind that it is a fantasy. You aren't supposed to believe it for a minute. Honestly, have you ever seen a film about time travel that you thought was in any way plausible?? I though not. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Time Machine

Professor Alexander (Guy Pearce) builds a time machine and ends up in a remote future where two races inhabit Earth, the friendly Eloi and the monstrous Morlocks.As an adaptation, it's disastrous: all social subtext has been completely erased. The Eloi are kind, helpful, loyal, environmental-friendly and graceful, while the Morlocks are a bunch of beastly subterranean cannibals. This robs the movie of any deeper meaning than a typical good versus evil struggle.Performances are acceptable, but characters are so flat they fail to register.

53,nicholas.rhodes,Runs out of steam after the first thirty-five minutes !,6,22 February 2006,"The original Time Machine film of the 1960's was a classic and a memorable film with an emphasis on time travel and good period reconstitution. This ""remake"" if it can be thus termed does not give me the same impression ! The first thirty five minutes,i.e. the time our hero takes to actually reach the year 802701, are quite thrilling what with him trying to thwart the death of his fiancée, visit to a science museum in about the year 2030 and the awesome possibility of a broken-up moon wreaking havoc on earth. The main voyage through time, where our hero is unconscious in his machine and the modification of the earth's crust etc is well-done, special effects and soundtrack-wide ! So much for the good part but that only represents 35 minutes of the film. Once he has arrived at his final destination, things become frankly quite boring and soporific, and the whole set looks like some kind of prehistoric adventure film - you almost forget that it was a time-travel film in the first place and time travel doesn't even enter into the script. I was hoping that he would end up returning to his own time at the end of the film but there was not even that saving grace ! One feels that in this film, the time-travel aspect was just a starting-off point for a banal adventure film depicting conflict between two classes of people, the Eloi and the Morlocks whereas in the original film, these same creatures/beings were part of the film without necessarily dominating it to the same extent, and in the remake there is certainly a lot more unnecessary violence than in the original, presumably to satisfy todays audiences' thirst for this. In the year 802701, apart from English people are speaking another language. We are not told what this language is, and there are no subtitles during the passages where the people are speaking it - an INCREDIBLE oversight on the part of the film director as how is ANYONE supposed to understand. The introduction of Jeremy Irons as a super Morlock or whatever he's called is also superfluous and overblows the whole affair. I can understand the film pleasing a certain type of person who enjoys adventure films of the 21st century but I cannot see it over-pleasing true time-travel addicts as the final hour is little given over to that aspect. But I do have the film on DVD and usually watch those first thirty five minutes before turning it off or putting on something else. The passage of time throughout the initial voyage is impressive and reinforces my anguish at the fact that in the earth's history, our own passage as human beings on this planet for a tiny fraction of the total time the planet has been and will be in existence, is something VERY VERY difficult to accept !",The Time Machine

Jeremy Irons wasn't on screen very much, so don't get your hopes up if you're a huge fan, but he did a great job with the time that he did have.

57,Antagonisten,I don't know what to do,2,15 February 2005,"Sometimes, maybe once a year. I see a movie like this. A movie that had some potential (decent setup, decent story, good actors) but still failed so totally. A movie where i don't know whether i should laugh or cry.The inventor Alex Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is struck by an unfortunate accident in which his lover is taken away from him. Desperate to reverse time and stop the accident he begins construction of a time machine. When he uses the time machine though something goes very wrong and he is thrown hundreds of thousands of years into the future.Right from the beginning it's obvious that this is not a low-budget movie. The technical quality is quite refined and the special effects look very nice. The story however is a complete mess. After what i understand this is an update of a 1960's movie, and both movies were based on a novel by H.G. Wells. In that case i have to say that H.G. Wells probably didn't do his best work here. To say that the story is implausible is the understatement of the century. A complete mess would be a better description.Of course it's hard to say how the film-makers treated the original material (i haven't read the novel). But still they must have been able to do something better with it than this. This just makes no sense whatsoever. Also Guy Pearce is completely wasted here. He's a good actor when he get's the chance to show it. But here he just looks more or less stunned through the whole movie. Not to mention Jeremy Irons who appears in heavy makeup just before the end. I don't know any other actor who can travel so fast from amazing to crap. Here he is dealt an impossible role and probably tries to handle it as best he can. The end result though is just as much crap as the rest of this movie.This is an 80 million dollar, 1,5 hour long endurance test. Avoid it. 2/10.",The Time Machine
58,EmperorNortonII,"""Time"" For Good Visuals",7,26 March 2002,"""The Time Machine"" is an interesting movie.  Although I can't be sure how close to the original story by H.G. Wells it is.  The story follows Guy Pearce as Prof. Alexander Hartdegen, who comes off at first as an ""absent-minded professor,"" easily carried away by the idea of technology. When his fiancée is killed, he tries in vain to prevent her death by going back in time.  Failing to change the past, he goes to the future to seek answers.  The story does leave a little to be desired.  It never shows Prof. Hartdegen building his time machine, or explains just how it works.  The most interesting thing about the movie are the special effects.  Here, the visuals are used well in representing the passage of time.  First, in the changing of seasons quickly, then in styles of fashion and architecture, and ultimately, in geological changes.  The visuals catch the eye, but can't quite save the script.",The Time Machine
59,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: disappointing, see it anyway",6,8 March 2002,"As a fan of the original book, I went on opening day, with perhaps my expectations set too high by how The Lord of the Rings honored its original book. The result was disappointing.Guy Pearce as usual did a fantastic job, and the visuals were pretty good (eerie how jaded we're getting about visuals, isn't it), but we've seen better.The opening bit, without giving away the story, was compelling. There was chemistry, we came to like the characters, and the late 19th century scene was engaging.Unfortunately, that's where it ended. The characters in the rest of the film went flat. There was no chemistry between the main characters. The main plot twist of the story is simply given away in a knot of exposition rather than felt. There is a lack of tension between love interests and between enemies, which left me bewildered when the film ended. Wait, was that the climax? Perhaps the film being a little cartoony had something to do with director Simon Wells' background in animated films.There should have been a lot of awe in the film, as our hero finds and reacts to new circumstances. That didn't come across emotionally. The Eloi (forest natives) stand around too much and we don't get a feeling of being put into the environment. Nobody gets dirty and a few nonsensical things pop out.There are some deep questions that don't get their due. In fact, I think there was probably too much 19th century and too little of the rest of the film; things were a little too rushed for us to feel an emotional stake in what was happening. In a way, that reminded me of the recent Harry Potter film.Also, the CGI monsters detracted from the film rather than added. Sort of goofy action, as in The Mummy (1999).Who should go see this film?-- science fiction fans (you know you want to)-- action fans who didn't think The Mummy was silly-- Guy Pearce fans-- people who like computer graphics and think time travel is coolOverall, it wasn't bad -- I give it a 6, better than campy, but not satisfying. From the strength of the original book, a better movie was certainly do-able. Don't worry, I'm sure the original story will persist and in another few decades there will be another remake.",The Time Machine

Tropes flash by with blinding speed as Guy Pearce's sallow traveller flings himself into the future. Some of the timelapse effects still look good and the ""fractured moon"" is a beautiful image but the real star is that beautiful machine with its gleaming brass tubes, little red-padded chair and the spinning, glimmering fresnel lenses that propel it through time.

Consider the lame performance by Guy Pearce (who is almost always reliable), who is miscast in this film.  Guy stumbles through the film, doing everything wrong.  There is also the lackluster direction by Simon Wells, who is clearly incapable of directing live action. There is the film's short length; just when it starts to make a bit of sense -- it ends. The film has a few nice special effects, ONE decent action scene, and that's about it.  A complete waste of TIME and MONEY.

69,OldAle1,The worst act of ancestor-defilement I can imagine,2,25 April 2009,"I would never have re-watched this atrocity if not for a discussion series I was hosting but....the sacrifices we make. Wells' film has even less to do with his great-grandfather's novel than the 1960 version, in fact changing the whole motivation of the main character so that he can even more readily dispense with any of the philosophizing and social theorizing that has helped to keep the novel still relevant and interesting today.In this film, the setting has been moved from London to New York though it's still the Victorian '90s. Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is a physics professor about to ask for young Emma's (Sienna Guillory) hand in marriage when she is killed by a mugger. In grief, he sets about inventing a time machine so that he can go back and save her. Wouldn't you? Four years later he's ready, but he quickly finds out that he can't change the past, as that would keep him from building the machine and that would be a paradox. Of course, the paradox of his machine appearing 4 years before it was built in his laboratory or the possibility of him running into himself are never dealt with at all, and this sets up the bad action/thriller pattern in place for the rest of the film: throw logic out the window and when something needs to happen just do it and hope the audience won't notice.He quickly decides to go off into the future. No real reason why -- no discussions of mankind becoming noble and true, as there was in the novel -- nope, he just wants to get out of Dodge apparently. After a longish stop in 2030 where he meets a holographic librarian (Orlando Jones) and somehow glosses over the fact that he apparently died in 1903 - the year he left - and a short one in 2037 as he witnesses the moon break up (cue cool digital effects) he is knocked unconscious on his machine and stays in a daze while the world changes around him, until finally awakening in the year 802,701. Given that 36 minutes have passed by now out of the under 85 (leaving off end credits), you know the action's going to have to come fast and furious and the strangeness and wonder - that still excite this lover of the novel - are going to be in short supply.Suffice it to say that he quickly meets the Eloi, the surface people, led (more or less) by Mara (Samantha Mumba) who is the only adult in the tribe to speak English which is learned by all of them as kids but forgotten by most; she's the teacher though and of course remembers it, can speak intelligibly and is able to lead Hartdegen eventually to the ruins of the library where, miraculously, the electronic librarian still works. But wait, there's a cog in the machinery! Alongside the wonderfully mixed-race Eloi (the sole interesting touch in the film) there's a race of dead-white monstrous super-ape-like thingies, the Morlocks, who are faster, stronger, and like to eat Eloi-flesh. The Eloi of course just accept that their old, feeble, and sometimes others just get taken away - despite being reasonably smart and sophisticated in this version (in the novel and the 1960 film the Eloi are quite feeble and it's not at all surprising that they can't or won't fight back). In short order Mara is captured and our hero has to venture down below where he meets the supreme Morlock, an idiotic conception who can read minds, is super-strong and controls the other Morlocks but who of course gets bested rather quickly by the monkey-faced Pearce/Hartdegen. He's played by Jeremy Irons who I will say seems to enjoy these kinds of cheesy things, at least he's having fun making his big paycheck and probably knows it's crap.And here comes the best/worst part: after dispatching the leader by moving his machine forward in time while super-Morlock is hanging on outside of the machine's ""sphere of safety"" (my words, none of this is ever explained) and aging the Morlock to death in a few seconds, the time traveler comes back, frees Mara, and sets the machine to blow up, which it quickly does, turning all of the Morlocks underground to dust just as the protagonists reach the surface and safety. So, uh, he saves the day by basically blowing up his machine despite not, uh, really possibly knowing what the consequences would be. This, like virtually the whole of the rest of the film, is just thrown at us with no explanation, and now our hero is presumably left to start a new world with the (of course) beautiful and intelligent Mara, having in a few days forgotten all about his past.Pearce is awful, looking like an ugly sad puppy through most of the film and never being remotely convincing as a man of science; Mumba is nice to look at but that's about it. Some of the art direction and sets are kind of cool, but in a very self-conscious way: look, isn't this awesome! Like the Eloi village, a bunch of weird shell-shaped structures on a cliff face that really don't seem feasible or likely. Not that much of anything in the film as a whole seems feasible or likely, for that matter. It's just, rush ahead, and hope nobody notices how stupid it all is.

The special effects are really awe-inspiring and Guy Pearce was fine in his role. I also liked the fact that it didn't run on too long. 90 minutes of escapism is just what I needed, and it's what I got from this movie. The movie isn't always completely coherent, in fact there are some logical errors (just read any review by a critic), but don't take it too seriously and you'll have a decent time with it. It's certainly a lot more fun that TOMB RAIDER or some of the recent Hollywood blockbusters.",The Time Machine
72,Indy-52,provides just enough goofy entertainment to give you your money's worth,7,3 May 2002,"With adaptations of household-name, classic novels to movies, you can either take it very seriously and adapt it faithfully, perfect examples being the two recent mega-hyped fantasy films released around Christmas last year; or you can treat them like Disney does, with the screenwriters taking absolute liberty with the source and turning it into the latest action-packed special effects extravaganza, like that little action movie remake involving apes from last year. At least THE TIME MACHINE knows it belongs in the latter category and makes it clear from the beginning. The setting is no longer London, but New York; the Time Traveler, played here by Guy Pearce (MEMENTO), is now given a name, professor Alexander Brantdegen; the set-up is completely different from the novel, this one involving the professor's mission to find a way to change the past so he can prevent his fiancé from dying.THE TIME MACHINE never takes itself seriously, and in its beginning sequences it's a pleasure to drink in the laid-back, predictable storytelling, completely tongue-in-cheek style, and popping your eyes out at the marvelous special effects showing Alexander traveling through time to the year 2030. The time machine itself is a wonderfully-designed prop, and combined with the detailed set design by Oliver Scholl it makes for some really satisfying eye candy. Also, watching disasters happen to the Moon as a result of our excessive nuclear explosions there is a visually exciting moment. Orlando Jones provides some good fun as a compendium of all human knowledge, a hologram guide in the museum of 2030 where Alexander goes to find information, particularly when singing parts of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, or strangely mentioning that a novel called ""The Time Machine"" was actually written by one H.G. Wells at the same time Alexander built one, and that a movie was made out of it in 1960. This is the moment when THE TIME MACHINE almost lapses into self-parody, and it's not the only moment that will leave you shaking your head. Things get increasingly ridiculous when Alexander arrives in the year 802701 following an accident with his machine: he discovers that as a result of the Moon splitting up, for some reason we have divided into two separate populations. One are the friendly, suntanned Eloi living above ground, the others the ugly Morlocks living mostly underground and using the Eloi as a food resource. This second part of the movie completely loses the innocence and appeal of the first, turning into a clone of the likes of PLANET OF THE APES and BATTLEFIELD EARTH. And when Jeremy Irons appears near the end as the Über-Morlock, their leader, you know the film has little intention of maintaining the sense of fun it started out with, and simply ending with a typical, preposterous explosion that neatly resolves everything.Fortunately though, director Simon Wells (H.G.'s great-grandson) still handles this obligatory material with some originality and visual flair, more or less holding our attention even when the cheesy-looking Irons character drones on in exposition, explaining the Morlocks' origins, and giving a big chase scene at the end a dizzying visual treatment. He also knows how to end his movie on the right note, with a final scene that's old-fashionedly appealing and original at the same time. There may not be much of a point to this ""re-imagining"" of the famous tale, and it can be awfully cheesy and uneven in parts, but the bottom line is that, much like last year's PLANET OF THE APES redux, this TIME MACHINE provides just enough goofy entertainment to give you your money's worth.

74,peeedeee-94281,A Muddled Mess,2,16 September 2019,"I haven't seen the 1960 version for a while, so I decided to watch this version with a fresh open mind. Sadly, this movie is as bad as people have described it. So Guy Pearce plays Alexander Hartdegen, a professor and physicist who through a tragedy is somehow inspired to create a time machine. No build up to that, no mention of how long it took, or what background he had to show he was capable of building such a machine. And it appears nobody even knew he was building it, even though it clearly took a lot of metal and parts. Or what even powers it. Lots just left to the audience to assume it works because it just does.
In this version, he tries to change the tragic past, but sadly as fate would have it, the tragedy happens again. Of course, no one finds it strange his huge contraption is parked inside of his house in the past, not his housekeeper, not even his earlier self.
Anyway, he decides to move forward in time to 'find the answer' to why this tragedy kept happening. At some point, the earth is damaged due to man's manipulation of the moon, and that is why the planet is in the state it is 800,000 years later when he comes to after being knocked out.
As luck would have it, he comes upon a time when some people can still speak english. How can that be? lol. Okay, I remember the same thing happening in the 1960 version, but by 2000, you'd think there would be more attention to detail regarding the idea that a language would have changed in 800,000 years. Then we see the apparently primitive people of the time are able to build ikea quality homes on the sides of cliffs (no apparent reason why they would build them there, as opposed to just on flat ground).
The morlocks in this movie look like skeletor from He Man. And then there's the random leader of them played by Jeremy Irons who has enhanced powers, and also speaks perfect english.
Alexander Hartdegen is captured by the morlocks and has a long, pointless chat with Jeremy Irons, then he is allowed to go on his way in the time machine. So instead of going backwards and you'd think change the fact the earth destroyed it's moon, he decides to fight (yes FIGHT) Jeremy Irons by dragging him into the machine with him as it hurtles far into the future. Eventually the machine is stopped and we get a glimpse into the far future, which still doesn't make sense. It's still an underdeveloped world, but now it's barren.
Again, you'd think Alexander Hartdegen would go back to his own time, or at least to the future time pre-damage-to-the-moon.to warn of that, but no, he doesn't do that at all. Such a strange plot choice, I'm not sure if that was in the original HG Wells book, it certainly wasn't in the 1960 version.
Another annoying point is Orlando Jones cyber character - how is he powered? Hundreds of thousands years later, and he's still able to operate? Not only that, they move one of his screens to the Eloi village later in the movie?! Huh?
Anyway, this movie has very little science or logic to be recommended. I think the 1960 version is a more pleasant, and less cynical version, of the movie and outshines this terrible 2004 movie by a long shot. I see the director's track record should have been a red flag as to how this movie would turn out. We get the same results today, going cheap on the director on a big name movie, and the end result is trashy.",The Time Machine
75,BillBayard,See the old one or wait for a new one,3,18 July 2021,"Growing up I saw the 1960 version of H. G. Wells' The Time Machine numerous times and remember enjoying it, but I haven't seen it in decades and really have no ""adult"" perspective on its quality though I do even now kind of remembering thinking how silly the Yvette Mimieux character was in her perfect makeup and hair. I'm not sure sure how many times this has been filmed, but clearly the 1960 version and this one are the most prominent. While the 1960 version might still have some nostalgic value if nothing else, plus an Oscar for what was then considered the pinnacle of special effects, I really am not sure, but this version is just poor. I saw it in 2002 and didn't remember a thing 19 years later, so I watched it as Guy Pearce is seldom in completely uninteresting films, but he is here and he himself is not ever really interesting either. I guess it kind of starts off okay, but it rapidly declines and for a long time time the main character seems to even forget why he is time traveling, though it is brought back near the end as he understands why and decides to stay in the most primitive and uninteresting time in human history. In all honesty, he has no way to time travel anymore as he gave that up fo save yet another woman which is where we came in. The oddest thing about this bore is how Pearce goes from a drab looking and milktoast of a man to a dashing, handsome and brave hero by the the time it is over. The most interesting character in the film isn't even human played by Orlando Jones.

76,seawalker,"Very good, minor flaws",5,6 June 2002,"I approached this film with trepidation, mainly because the George Pal version of the classic H. G. Wells story was so good.  I needn't have worried.  This version of `The Time machine' is really very good, although with some minor flaws.If the most interesting parts of a remake of a classic film were the changes that have been made to the story, I would say that all of the changes in this film were for the better.  The old cliché of a scientist dedicated to knowledge and discovery had been done to death and wisely they gave this scientist a personal reason to build a time machine.  His grief at his inability to change the past, and the time paradoxes inherent in within this, were well displayed.  Similarly, the events that destroyed the earth prior to the final 800,000 years journey were changed from the normal global human war, another cliché, to a more realistic man made ecological disaster.Good points.  I liked the idea of the synthetic librarian.  I had never seen Orlando Jones in any film that I had liked before, but he fitted perfectly into this film.  I liked the jokes.  Did anybody else spot the quick L. A. Confidential reference?  And Andrew Lloyd Webber  don't even think about it.The Morlocks were genuinely frightening.  Was this really only a (UK) PG certificate, letting young children see it without any adult supervision? Certainly the hunting scenes in the forest were better than the similar scenes in Tim Burton's `Planet Of The Apes' and much more exciting.There was another good performance from Guy Pearce, showing previously unseen action man tendencies.  And he was more of a Victorian scientist than Rod Taylor ever was.  I'm not sure if Samantha Mumba can act, but she did not jar and was not out of place.  Flaws.  Not enough Jeremy Irons, but everyone has said that.  It was probably too slow for the multiplex crowd, and too short as well.

Not so good are the Morlocks and the underground scenes.A curiosity, at one point Irons [chief Morlock] while speaking to Pearce says ""I am the inescapable result of you"" suggesting that somehow the Professors jaunts were in some way responsible for the evolution of the Morlocks.

He actually rolls his eyes at one point.The Eloi can speak English even though that is a dead language 800k years old and Mara amazingly learned it from letters on stones but has a perfect modern American accent. She says they all learn it when they are young and then forget it? Everyone? Why would such a small group of people have two languages? And why didn't they learn it from the Vox?If the kid knows where the Vox is why haven't they used it since they speak English to learn the entire history of the world and how to make guns and airplanes and every other invention ever made?The hologram librarian also has emotions which makes zero sense. He is depressed and angry, why would we invent a computer who has emotions? I'm also not sure how it is still powered after 800k years, if it were self powered then that would sure solve the worlds energy issues.The Morlock are wild violent creatures up top but are industrious workers down below.

Simply up-dating the special effects is not enough. Much like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", this remake was a great disappointment. There are rumors that Forbidden Planet will be remade. Let's hope the producers do a better job than this.",The Time Machine
81,fredericksmith1952,"Four generations later, we have a revision of this classic science fiction film by none other that the great grandson of H. G. Wells.",8,29 February 2012,"Four generations later, we have a revision of this classic science fiction film by none other that the great grandson of H. G. Wells. While entertaining and well presented, this film bears only a superficial resemblance to the original of 1960. Underlying the plot is the question of Fate. Why can't you change the past? The concept of Eloi and Moorlock are somewhat consistent with the original film and the novel, but their roles have significantly changed. The Eloi are fishers and farmers, and they live in cliff dwellings made of bamboo and other natural materials. The Moorlocks are still subterranean creatures, but now they are divided into castes, some bred for hunting, others bred to control. Where the hunters are physically superior, the controllers have mental powers which allow them to keep the hunters under control. Our protagonist is Alexander Hartdegen, not H. George Wells, and his motivation for creating the time machine is love, not commerce or scientific knowledge. The addition of Orlando Jones as Vox allows for the failure of Hartdegen to return to the past, since he contains all human knowledge from the 21st century and some beyond. Guy Pearce presents a believable character, and Samantha and Omero Mumba are excellent in their roles as the brother and sister Eloi who discover and befriend him. Mark Addy is Philby, and an excellent addition to the cast as Hartdegen's mentor and friend. Jeremy Irons portrays the Moorlock Leader with a rare and insightful talent that only he can generate. While his character is not evil in the sense we normally believe, he is still a thoughtful being who offers Hartdegen the opportunity to return to his own time. Rated PG-13 for violence, this film is highly entertaining but certainly not destined to be a classic. It is, however, an interesting revision of the original plot with some well thought out twists and turns, and the romantic angle of the film is sure to keep the ladies interested.",The Time Machine
82,saarvardi,"A heart-breaking, thought-provoking Sci-Fi adventure, even if somewhat flawed at times",9,17 March 2007,"Guy Pearce took advantage of his Memento fame to appear in two 2002 medium-sized hits  The Time Machine and The Count of Monte Cristo; only to drop off the face of (cinematic) Earth later on. In this moving remake, however, we get to watch him in the roll of the haunted Alexander Hartdegen, a tormented science professor who cracks the equator that discovers time-travel in 19th century England, only to find out he can't save his beloved fiancée from dying. This tragic twist sends our protagonist looking for his salvation in the future  flash forwarding to as far as the 8,028th century. Capitalizing more on the love story, this H.G. Wells adaptation fails to take proper advantage of the Eloi and Morlock sub-arc, but still remains intact as a heart-breaking, thought-provoking Sci-Fi adventure, even if somewhat flawed at times.",The Time Machine
83,Pavel-8,Save time and skip it.,3,31 March 2003,"**Warning! Plot Spoilers Ahead!**Science fiction admittedly isn't always supposed to add up completely.  But at the very least it should make you forget your questions.  ""Time Machine"" is the worst kind of sci-fi.  Many plot holes and questions, both large and small, pop up throughout the movie, and there is very little to take your mind off those issues.The core problem with this movie is that the two story arcs that should carry it are deeply flawed.  The major plot line is Alex's search to answer why he can't change time.  Wouldn't a scientist brilliant enough to invent a time machine be smart enough to see the inherent flaw? Going back in time to change something that drove you to invent the device that allowed you to go back in time to change something that...see what I'm getting at?  Circular logic.  Disappointing that a scientific mind would miss that. 
The other primary theme is the good versus evil portrayed by the Eloi and Morlocks.  The good and evil are not distinctly portrayed.  Yes we know which is which, but only by appearances, as in cartoons.  Even when Jeremy Irons finally explains everything, we don't care.  We don't know any characters well, so we don't have any emotional attachment to anyone. 
Speaking of Jeremy Irons, he and Orlando Jones appear in the movie simply to explain some of the things that occur.  Nothing wrong with a little exposition, but it ought to happen in the flow of the movie, rather than feel as though a timeout is taken for comprehension purposes. 
Other unanswered questions: What did the purportedly poisonous Morlock darts do?  A number of people were shot by them, yet then continued on as usual. How did the time machine cause such a great explosion?  Was there an unmentioned atomic bomb built in?  Was that the purpose of the Einstein reference?  How did Alex and company get to the top of the hill so quickly? They were watching an explosion that they were in the midst of only seconds earlier!?  I've seen slow-moving movie explosions, but that was ridiculous. 
Bottom Line: A time travel movie featuring fearsome creatures should have a wow-factor, or at the very least be fun.  ""Time Machine"" was neither.  3 out of 10 at best.",The Time Machine

The end of the movie seems hasty and somehow leaves a big question mark.

88,Kirasjeri,"GOOD, ENTERTAINING FUN - but the 1960 Version is Still Tops",8,8 March 2002,"This version of the H.G. Wells classic is quite different from the wonderful 1960 movie starring Rod Taylor. As such, it remains entertaining but is rather more superficial. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it. This one is set in Manhattan instead of London, and the Wintry scenes of New York a century ago were nicely done.  Instead of bemoaning the current dismal state of the world as in the 1960 version, our current hero, well-played by Guy Pearce, seeks to go back in time to prevent the untimely death of his beloved fiance. When he discovers this is impossible, he seeks resolution in the future. The special effects of course are good as he moves into that future, although the Geologic changes depicted could never have occurred in less than tens of millions of years.In the future, 800,000 from his present, following a calamity involving the destruction of much of the moon that nearly destroyed Earth (that in lieu of the nuclear holocaust in the 1960 version) he discovers the Eloi, now cliff-dwellers, who are indeed still there, although now instead of looking like blonde blue-eyed Aryans they are a nice Politically Correct cafe au lait color. Curiously, there seems to have been no change or improvement in this species despite those 800,000 years - evolution has apparently ceased. But that was how it was with the 1960 film; in fact, this type of Eloi is more intelligent and active-minded than the nearly brain-dulled zombies Rod Taylor discovered. They must have been more intelligent as they somehow got the steel handcuffs off our hero that had been placed there in the earlier scene in the past.This version is far kinder to the Eloi: our hero never feels rage at how they squandered the knowledge and history of civilization. Yes, books have crumbled, but there is a photonic human-like computer device, a remnant of the New York Public Library which contains every shred of information ever collected. How its power source remains  up and running in a Stone Age world is never explained. ""Self-contained power"", perhaps?!The evil Morlocks are still around, and have evolved, but instead of menacingly appearing at night, or sounding sirens resulting in the Eloi marching catatonic and transfixed to their cannibalistic doom, the Morlocks now attack in broad daylight - and they are very muscular and athletic. In fact, we discover that those are just one type of Morlock - others include those who have emphasized their intellectual development instead of brawn, and Jeremy Irons does a great job as the spooky albino-like head Morlock, the ""uber-Morlock"". The scary hidden menace of night, in the Taylor version, in the world of the Eloi is missing from this film, unfortunately.Our hero's final battle was quite different from the other versions, and featured an altering of the future/present I still don't entirely understand. But it was compelling and dramatic.I missed the thoughtful tone of the 1960 film in which Taylor (as ""George"") discussed Time as a Fourth Dimension, and had a close relationship over the years with his friend Filby, and later his son. The scenes where he stopped his Time Machine inside his old boarded up house seventeen years into the future are, regretably, gone - too slow for today's audience, as perceived by the producers. It all created for me a nostalgic even elegiacal emotion I missed in this movie. The end scene where Taylor returned to bring back ""three books"" for his life with the Eloi is not in the 2002 film.
The well-known symbolism in the Wells' book, and somewhat in the 1960 version, of an Upper Class feeding off the labor of the Working Class, cannot be seen at all in this current movie. That despite it being ably directed, at least in part, by his great-grandson, Simon Wells.
The performances are generally quite good. Besides the wonderful Mr Irons, Guy Pearce is excellent as Alexander Hartdgen. Samantha Mumba is credible as the the replacement for Yvette Mimieux's Weena - now called Mara. Her actual younger brother plays her film sibling. Although she is an Irish singer, she is also half African, thus satisfying the PC need for the correct complexion. Mark Addy is limited by the script as Filby; in the 1960 version Alan Young was wonderful in that role.Scenery, sets, art direction, and special effects are all quite good.This film was entertaining and enjoyable. I just wish it had also been also as thought-provoking for me as the 1960 Rod Taylor version had been. I know comparisons can be invidious, but they can't be helped when remaking a classic. Nonetheless, worth seeing.",The Time Machine
89,rooboy84,7/10,7,17 November 2002,"I enjoyed the time machine, Guy Pearce was great in it. Far too short though, and lack of action and variety of worlds prevented it from at least an 8.

90,Lupercali,Watchable.,6,4 June 2004,"The back of my copy of this movie has a review by Bill Diehl of the ABC Radio Network, who says 'The Time Machine is ""An action-packed, mind-blowing time travel adventure."" Who pays these people to write things like that? I mean, honestly, sometimes I go through the new releases looking for a movie that Roger Ebert HASN'T given ""Two thumbs up!"".  Let's just say that if Mr Diehl is so impressionable that his mind is blown by this movie, he'd probably have to be committed to a mental institution if someone played him '2001' or 'Eraserhead'.Alright, this is not a bad movie. It's about what you'd expect. The 1960 version with groovier visuals and production values, but less atmosphere and imagination. There are a few nice touches that save it from being utterly plain: the holographic librarian, and the final scene(s), which are rather nicely done. I guess I'd have to say rent something else instead, but if you've really run out of promising candidates and it's a choice between this and 'Zombie Island Massacre', go for this one. Lupercal gives this one 55%, which translates to 'watchable'.",The Time Machine
91,clydestuff,"""More 2003 Razzle Dazzle, still doesn't beat the original""",4,1 April 2003,"*****plot spoilers*****I really wanted to like The Time Machine.  I have always admired Time Travel movies, especially the original George Pal version of The Time Machine.  As It turned out, I didn't dislike this version, but it never did much in the way of drawing me in enough to care about what happens on the screen.  I think part of this lies in the beginning of the movie.  Guy Pearce wants to go back in time to save his girlfriend from being shot, which is his motivation for building The Time Machine in the first place.  Every time he tries to save her though, she still dies but in a different way.  While these scenes do well to supply motivation, (and believe me we have nothing against that, as too many characters in too many films never have any motivation) too much time is spent on this part of the story, so that in the long run, it does nothing more than take time away from Alexander's journey to the future. Part of the fun of the original was watching Rod Taylor's trip through time, until he arrived to the point in the future where he met the Eloi and The Morlocks.  The only interesting stop in Guy Pearce's journey is where he meets the librarian Vox,  which is merely a setup to run into Vox later in the future.  I had more fun watching Rod Taylor, crumble disintigrating books in his hands, and spinning gold rings to find out what he wanted to know.  Even the Morlocks in the 60's version, with their hokey makeup and grunts and groans were more entertaining than these gophers.I wish we had found out more about the Eloi, before the Morlocks had arrived on the scene.  I wish they had come up with something better than having the moon explode to cause all that destruction.  I wish the whole journey through time had been more entertaining.  I wish Guy Pearce hadn't needed the whole girlfriend bit to motivate him.  I wish I could go watch the original Rod Taylor version......wait a minute...I can...I own that one too.....and that's my advice to you.",The Time Machine
92,liderc,tawdry patriotism and a bad script - what more to ask for?,1,27 April 2007,"Stay far away from this movie. Except of some basic ideas it has nothing to do with the classic novel by H. G. Wells. Acting is so-so, although to be fair the actors don't have much of a chance because of the silly script. Well's critical novel is made into a cheap quasi Sci-Fi movie that is also stupidly patriotic. Of course the big good American guy can save those helpless little bush people of the bad bad guys and restore peace and order and all that on his own, of course. Yeah right. Jeremy Iron's appearance marks the most complex dialogue sequence of the movie (he is a bad bad guy that tells the good guy why everything happened that way) and his performance is probably the best of the movie next to the Hologram guy, whose second appearance is allowedly a clever plot twist. The only good direction takes place in the last scene of the movie when the future and the past are cleverly faded into each other.

93,jvframe,Time Wasted,1,26 March 2002,Quite simply a very poor effort compared to the original (with the superior lead performance by fellow Australian Rod Taylor and tastefully kitsch effects).Guy Pearce is really annoying as a slack-jawed ninny for the first part of the film. But this must have been just what the director wanted - or it would never have made the final cut. The story line is tragically laughable - a significant part of our preview audience even laughed out loud as a woman was run down by a runaway carriage. I had to agree with them.Jeremy Irons will be haunted to his grave for accepting his role and most of the audience will be haunted by the thought of the million and one other things they could have been doing with this part of their lives.The only consolation is that it's comparatively short.,The Time Machine

They are replaced with a cheesy futuristic look at the 2030s, in which the moon breaks up. However, the impressive scene when the world whizzes from that to 800,000 years on seems to make up for it.One perhaps should not be overly critical of a film that has such a troubled history - director Simon Wells (HG's great-grandson) was replaced by an uncredited Gore Verbinski - but you'd be better off with the wonderful 1960 version.",The Time Machine

96,lhhung_himself,Unintentionally faithful remake,5,29 July 2002,"The 2002 version of Time Machine is remarkably faithful to the 1960 original. First off both the films are fun, if mindless pieces of Saturday matinee fare. You know, eye-candy special effects, a few gross bits, a little romance - i.e. something that goes perfectly with sticky floors, greasy popcorn and the girl in the tight sweater.However, what is really interesting are the differences. Even more striking than the obvious technological advances in special effects are the how films reflect the attitudes of the time . In the 60's version, Rod Taylor is incredibly self-assured (to the point of being an idiot), almost evangelistic. It doesn't take great insight to see the anti-Red undertones or how that missionary zeal would soon lead to Vietnam. In contrast, Guy Pearce completely sleepwalks through his role (seems like he still thinks he's in Memento...) and his aim is not to change the world but is personal - a familiar Private Ryanization. The calamities in both films are also very revealing. In the 60s cold-war version, it is of atomic satellites and nuclear war. In the post-Soviet version, we know longer fear the bomb directly but still fear how technology might hurt us through environmental catastrophe. Finally, the addition of the Jeremy Irons character in the present version reveals how much of a leadership cult our society has become. Leaders are all that matter now, not the people who implement the fiats. Bill Gates and Saddam Hussein are worshiped and reviled in contrast to the 60's where the cadre of talented engineers at Chrysler or the people in the evil Communist empire would have been credited/blamed.It would be interesting to see what the remake 40 years from now would look like.",The Time Machine

The only question I have is while he is attempting to figure out how to defeat Emma's death in the timeline, it never occurred to him to put her in the time machine with him and go back a hundred years? Then, her death could still happen on schedule, no reason to defeat fate. Of course, the rules could be written differently, but why not at least try?It seems as a time scientist the possibility would have occurred to him, and I would have liked to see that option explored.

98,joker-4,The Hollywood Machine,5,23 July 2005,"Simon Wells' TIME MACHINE, H.G.'s descendant, predictably runs as is expected: basic Hollywood story of lost love, good vs. evil, and all around just so generally safe - which can be read as ""mundane."" The film is surprisingly (mercifully?) short, clocking in at barely 100 minutes. And what starts out as a horribly, horribly, horribly acted (even by the remarkable Guy Pearce, who is a great actor and has the resume to prove it), shot and executed beginning does become exciting once the hero jumps into the time machine for the first time. Although the story then does become nominally better, what jump starts the film, surprise-surprise, are the time travel f/ x. Two of the best f/x houses in Hollywood today, ILM and Digital Domain, show the audience what Dr. Alexander Hartdegen is viewing as time moves around him - and it is a beautiful treat. Especially enjoyable are his brief stops in the (for us 21th Century dwellers) near future years of 2030 & 2037 before hightailing it to the year 802,000. In that time period the audience is treated to the Morlocks, who come across as being both cool and creepy. Stan Winston's f/x house combines both make-up and CGI to make these creatures among the true stars of the film.In typical Spielberg/Dreamworks fashion, the story caters to more adventure than, oh, bother, realism or even straight storytelling. Once in the far future, for instance, watch as a Columbia professor/bookworm becomes an action star fighting Morlocks, scaling walls and rousing the troops ala George C. Scott in PATTON... or at least Charlton Heston in PLANET OF THE APES.Ah, and Dr. Hartdegen possesses a COLOR picture of his girlfriend/fiancée. Wow! A full-color picture in 1899.

It was a lack of clarity on the part of the writers, on how to get from point A to Point C.  The ending was satisfactory, but did not follow logically from the set up. Blame fuzzy thinking.    Spoiler ahead...The main problem occurs in the sequence toward the end where our time traveler confronts the ""brains behind the bad guys"" What follows is so poorly conceived that even the effects can not mask the lack of clarity. The bad guy offers the time traveler the chance to go back, he sees himself married with his dear lost wife, and with children, but because he did, the results turned out to be the circumstances that brought about the bad guy?  Huh?  I could have the writers spell it out, and it still would not make sense. This is a very serious error. a fatal flaw, if you will.

101,smashattack,I've always loved the concept of time travel...,7,17 November 2002,"Yet with time travel comes the inescapable un-definition of reality:  the paradox.  Which is seen in The Time Machine, and is one of only two downfalls the movie has.Spoilers.First of all, the graphics are great.  I love it while Alexander is traveling through time, seeing progress as it could never have been seen before.  I was impressed with how real it all looks, even though it is going so fast.  The clarity of everything in those spans of time makes the movie much more understandable and beautiful.I really love the plot.  Alexander Hartdegen loses a loved on and goes back in time to save her.  Yet he finds he cannot save her, so he goes into the future to find an answer.  His travels take him to VOX, a computer version of Orlando Jones who is extremely intelligent and has a snappy attitude, and the crash landing of the moon.  That moon looks really cool, even in a scene later in the movie in which fragments are still floating in orbit around Earth.  Alexander eventually finds himself in the year 800,000, where mankind has split into two groups.However, this conflict between the Morlocks and the Eloi (much like the Moiety in Riven) is way too short.  Thus being the second downfall of the movie.  The time traveling aspect of it is extremely interesting, not just to think about, but to watch.  Yet that is not enough to keep me fully satisfied.  The conflict is great, but too short.I really like the music (in fact, the day I wrote this is the day I bought the soundtrack).  Klaus Badelt is paving a road that is extraordinary.  He gives some excellent melodic themes for Alexander as well as a theme for time travel itself.  The Morlocks' drum-beats are reminiscent of John Williams' The Lost World score, which I really love.The Morlocks could be better, too.  They are mostly puppets, which is kind of a disappointment since it is so easily recognizable.  But they are freaky enemies, good enough for the show.Guy Pearce is one great actor.  I really like his performance in this movie, as the intelligent scholar, ambitious yet nervous, who is in love with a beautiful woman who gets caught up in unexplainable events.  He really portrays Alexander well.  The other actors do good, too, but not as great as Pearce.Combining drastically beautiful scenery, great graphics, an excellent score and a great set of actors, The Time Machine is a really good movie.  I recommend it to anyone who likes the sci-fi genre.",The Time Machine

The original is a good movie, and this doesn't really need to be it. Instead it takes a story, updates and tweaks it just a bit and creates a delightful world of it's own. Sure, there are a few plot holes, and yes, there are a few scenes that could have done better. But they aren't hell-worthy trespasses, and are forgivable for the sake of propelling the plot forward.Other than the spot on casting, which is enjoyable and fun and really well portrayed, what brings you into this film are the sets and sceneries. This movie came out before CGI was used to replace the world rather than augment the world, and so you have real sets in real woods and real costumed creatures, and it just pulls together nicely. The music fits incredibly well to capture the tribal setting that humanity has found itself back into without it being too anachronistic.All in all a fun, enjoyable film to watch, and much better than a lot of movies that have been coming out lately that force the narrative, rather than letting the story unfold.",The Time Machine

If if wasn't for the immense talent of Guy Pearce, Jeremy Irons, Orlando Jones, Sienna Guillory and Ms. Mumba, this would have been another CGI-laden piece of pseudo-scifi crap. The love story was brought to the foreground more than it was in the 60's version. The comedy provided by Mr. Jones was much appreciated. Ms. Guillory is beautiful and wholesome unlike most of the young actresses of this era. Ms. Mumba was a breath of fresh air as a woman of color in a major role.

After seeing the original I found it to be both extremely lame and somewhat slow and drowsy, so, After watching the original I wondered how well the remake could keep in the same story line(previding that mankind didn't destroy itself with nuclear war during the 60's as the old film suggested).Having said that I knew there were going to be changes to the plot(they just had too for it to make sense).My point being, that I expected it to be totaly different from the original,move at a faster pace, have better specail effects, and have a slightly different story line.I didn't expect all the splenderous costumes and the absolutely beautiful early 1900's New York backdrop- that was very pleasant surprise. the actors did very well. The plot followed the origianl much closer than I expected it too, however they added a new demention to the story(the idea that he was going through time to save his girlfriend - and when he couldn't he went searching through time to find out why he could change destiny). I didn't have a problem with them writers and producers adding that to the story. If anything that gave it a deeper meaning. I thought everything was well done in this film. My only real complaint is that it didn't last but only 90 minutes. and because the film is so short, when you see the first credits come on the screen you are sitting there thinking to yourself ""Is that all of it?""",The Time Machine

107,leftistcritic,Exciting but protagonist is self-serving,4,25 January 2019,"This is the third major Hollywood treatment of H.G. Wells book, The Time Machine, with the others in 1978 and 1960. The part about him, the protagonist (Dr. Alexander Hartdegen) inventing and building the time machine is interesting. However, his focus is not on making the world a better place but on his own self-serving goal to save his would-be wife Emma (played by Sienna Guillory) from death. After he realizes that fails, he travels into the farther future, encountering a horrifying world, one eventually destroyed by a moon breaking apart. He encounters the Eloi, which are rightly shown as dark-skinned people rather than White folks like in the 1978 film. Unfortunately this film, increasingly becoming an action flick at the end, apart from the message that you can't change the past, has no takeaway at the end. The male protagonist remains in the future and his memory lives on in the past. Unlike the 1978 movie, this does not have a political message or a protagonist who cares about someone other than himself (or his love interest, an Eloi named Mara, played by Samantha Mumba). While I liked the intellectual nature of the protagonist and the library as a place of knowledge, this movie is lacking in many respects, apart from unnecessarily weird mollacks. I would not watch it again or recommend it to anyone.There's much more to say about this film, however. Despite the fact that this film has obvious negatives, it does have a strong theme, at least through part of it, about preservation of knowledge overtime. Hartdegen is an intellectual milleu of sorts but his ideas of time travel are rejected as hair-brained, a bit like Henry Frankenstein's ideas of animating flesh of dead humans again was seen by the university he worked with as the passion of a ""madman,"" leading him to go out on his own. In terms of the preservation of knowledge, the librarian unit, Vox 114, embodies what we can think of the future storage of knowledge, and yet, even in the far future it still exists as a place of knowledge and understanding, a bit like an archives of sorts. So, that part of the film is interesting to say the least.I can't remember good acting by anyone specifically. I can't compare this film to the 1960 film, The Time Machine, by George Pal, but I can say this film was generally horrible for the reasons I have already explicated. With that, my review of this film comes to a close, a film that definitely should be rated a 4 out of 10.",The Time Machine

All the rest of the cast is wonderful as well.And the movie set and computer effects could have hardly been better. Perfect looks, I would say, at least for my own needs.But after watching the whole picture, there is a big flaw in it. To my big surprise, it turn out that the story itself looks quite thin compared to the rest. All these money, talent and resources for this very simple and only very weakly explained end ? What a waste !However, the movie is still very entertaining, with many jokes, I especially liked the last one, and it is quite romantic.I was also amused that the big catastrophe to end our current culture happened in the year 2037 - one year before the signed 32 bit Unix time counter will overflow. Was that an insider joke or part of the original book ?And it was very interesting to see what Wells thought the problems of the future might be.

Throwing CGI at this didn't make any improvement on the previous version.The cast are wasted, and the styling is half-baked, the special effects are no better than a modern TV sci-fi series, and often worse, the nods to the original are only there for people who have seen it, and I guarantee not one of those people consider this a worthy use of 96 minutes of their life.",The Time Machine
110,Dandy_Desmond,Beautiful movie,10,22 October 2008,"First of all i've read the time machine and have taken in the original movie which i enjoyed on both counts. I was bored one day and checked out the remake on a cable channel - with no expectations. I seem to recall this was advertised as a sci fi action adventure but what i got was certainly not that. it was more. i was first impressed with the way the movie looked...grand, sweeping and beautiful. It starred Guy Pearce who i like very much. It had a different story, in which his fiancé is shot dead in central park as they celebrate their engagement .. this drives him on more to build the time machine. however he cannot change the past - and sets off into the future to find out why...i liked this change of direction. We see how we destroy our world with technology. We see how Guy's character finds love again millions of years into the future destroying his machine at the end. We see as he holds hands at the end with his new love standing in the same area his house used to be - millions of years ago, his friend and housekeeper discuss his disappearance and hope he's happy. The idea that different times are happening all the time. 10/10 and an extra mention to Samantha mumba and her brother - they were both excellent in this movie. I think this movie will gain more followers as it gets older.",The Time Machine

Fair play to them that they have tried to create something different rather than just copying the original movie but it has lost all of the magic and charm completely. The original Time machine kept you glued to the screen, it captured your imagination, this didn't sadly.There's plenty of action and thrills but that didn't make up for the loss of the awe and wonder.

I didn't go.  Only now have I gotten around to renting the DVD.Maybe lowered expectations played a role, but basically I enjoyed it from start to finish.  No, it wasn't ""Fellowship of the Ring"" or ""The Quiet Man,"" but it wasn't ""Nightfall"" or ""Slipstream"" or ""The Four Seasons,"" either.In fact, from the start, I liked the characters, felt interested in them, was involved in the lead character's quest, enjoyed the sets and the effects and the music... it was a story that was going somewhere, going there well, and taking me with it.  I was involved, interested, entertained -- what more do I want out of a movie?The effects didn't overwhelm the movie (as in ""The Phantom Menace""), but they were striking.  The images of the Moon stay in my mind.  And, much as ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is my favorite movie of all time, the image of the Eloi's cliff dwellings lingers more evocatively than Lothlorien.Hate me if you must, but not only did I not hate this movie, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.",The Time Machine
114,sampleman411-1,Pay attention to what this movie says!,7,15 March 2002,"After this film's end credits started rolling, someone in the theater audience said, ""the original movie was so much better!""  I beg to differ. This remake is infinitely superior: Pay attention to what it is saying.  It is so easy to debunk a remake.  Yes, the villains are lame, and way too CGI, but the first third of the film makes up for this.  It tells us that, even though we can invent a device to transport us to the past, we cannot change what is destined for us... we can only change our present, and therefore fulfill our future destiny, which is what the main character does here.  You don't find this narrative thread in the 1960 film, and although Jeremy Irons (he plays the villain) only appears in the 2002 version for only a short scene, he tells us pretty much the same thing, albeit crudely, and in his character's merciless way.  See this film with someone you hold dear to your heart, and for God's sake pay attention to the dialogue and what the filmmakers of this one are trying to tell you.",The Time Machine
115,Denver53,"Not terrible, but sort of awkward",6,27 September 2002,"The Time Machine starts out wonderfully. Through events, it asks: Can you change the past? The lead character sacrifices his career (and maybe his sanity) to find a way to travel back and change a certain event that upset him. What he finds surprises him, and discourages him.Unfortunately, he then ends up going forward in time, to the distant future. From here on it is like a different movie. The main character has a new challenge, and a new love interest. The movie becomes one that no longer asks if he can have his past life back, but asks whether he is now happy?The juxtaposition of the two plots is jarring. You care first about the original question, then you are asked to forget it -- and the motivation for the main character creating a time machine -- in favor of a new story line that is not especially convincing.Still, at the very end, the movie tries to pull it all together, even employing a split screen between the two plot ""worlds"" and asking: Is he happy? That ending is touching and makes one think, at least a little. But at least half the journey there leaves you wondering, ""why?""I gave it a 6.",The Time Machine
116,kismit,Bits and pieces of an outstanding film but misses the mark.,6,24 March 2002,With all the garbage sci-fi and video game based films of the last few years this one was overdue for a remake. Unfortunately it looks like we wil have to wait a while longer to have it done right. I am not sure why they felt it necessary to rewrite the plot but this does not follow the original. Some of the changes work but in the end some do not. Some very good effects and the Morlocks were impressive but it looked like they left half the film on the cutting room floor. Too little time is spent in the futuristic setting which itself resembles a Cancun Resort. Orlando Jones was surprisingly good and no fault to Pierce who did not write the script but this would have worked far better as a faithful adaptation of the original with the changes being saved for a sequel. It could have been a winner but....,The Time Machine
117,SILENCEikillyou,If you liked the classic novel... sit back and enjoy!,8,31 October 2002,"This movie successfully portrays H.G. Wells novel (with a few modern updates to what the vision of the future will be... highly effective).  I like this story, having seen the original adaptation, this version was greatly needed. I think this film had what was needed to accurately project Wells' story: technology.  Only with a sprinkling of CGI could this story be depicted visually.  And it was done quite well.  All the way down to the overall appearance of the time machine, itself.  One obviously needs to have the ability to think for one's self in order to follow the depth of this epic.What worked:  Obviously, the much needed technological advances in movie graphic arts.  Though, this film didn't over use this graphics technology; it was very tasteful and powerful.  Also, the acting talent was well-selected; esp. Guy Pierce.  He just has the perfect amount of madness in his looks for the part (while maintaining a certain attractiveness, allowing the audience to be able to relate to him).  This was a stunning visual achievement.What didn't work:  The portrayal of the Eloi could have used some improvement.  Maybe the film could have gone into more of an explanation as to the motivation of the peoples, going to that particular area and most assuredly into the clutches of the hunters.  Still, this might only bother those who read the book... it really didn't detract that much from the enjoyment.8/10 - could have been a little better; though, it was quite good.thank you",The Time Machine
118,dagallop,I enjoyed every moment of this but..,9,21 October 2018,"Before I say anything, yes, I really enjoyed the 1960 adaptation of this movie, yes, it was an absolutely wonderful movie, especially for its time. But..This version doesn't explicitly follow the original story! And, I believe that is a good thing, why because when HG Wells wrote the story he had historical limitations. I don't want to detract from the tremendous imagination he obviously had, what I mean by that is that reading what is really a short story, then adapting that into a feature length movie would be, well, a little boring. In the original there were various attempts to extrapolate the storyline, as well as some 'cutting edge graphics' (for the time). But what this movie achieved was making an entertaining and worthy of a watch, story. With few holes, I'll grant you that, but given that Guy Pearce isn't exactly the best actor (my opinion) and that the lead supporting actress was a newbie, I believe that they carried it off pretty darn well.The special effects were good, the lighting, scenes, directing and acting was good. The score was brilliant! One of the few times that I have purchased a soundtrack! I believe that a good soundtrack can make a movie, in this case it just made it even better.One thing to keep in mind with this movie is that there was clearly a large amount of editing, I don't know if the final edit did it justice. The scenes that occur which leads to the huge future leap are the only bit that makes this movie weak in my point of view and were it not for that I would have put a solid 10 out of 10 stars. See if you feel the same way, I get the distinct impression that the two revolutions of time were probably more at some point and the editor decided to cut those in favor of more special effect, or perhaps to keep the running time down.",The Time Machine
119,villard,Wasting Time,2,30 March 2002,"The 2002 version of ""The Time Machine"" is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects. What a lousy, uninspired bland story, with no imagination. Why so totally rewrite such a wonderful sci-fi classic? Are today's movie audiences too hip for the H.G. Wells writing largely as is? The 1960 George Pal version told a much more endearing story, even with clunky low-budget effects, beach-party looking Eloi, and Morlocks that looked like Smurfs on steroids.The 2002 version must have H.G Wells turning in his grave:1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci-fi cliché. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) that made the 1960 version so endearing. This sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant either he or his buddy Einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma  not have it dawn on him 800,000 yrs in the future  from a Morlock no less, Doh!! What's wrong with time-traveling just for fun & adventure & curiosity -- as embodied in the 1960 version?2. Only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what Pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it. The George Pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of 'travel' though a 4th dimension.3. The director goes out of his way to make Pearce's character look geeky, a worn out old stereotype of scientists. In the 1960 version Rod Taylor was a little nerdy too (at least around Weena) but managed to be swashbuckling, playful and charming.4. Among the key themes of the 60's version -- abandoned in the remake -- is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Blowing up the Moon to destroy humanity is pointless -- and doesn't do much for science literacy. For over 4 billion years the Moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but this is just plain dumb and meaningless.5. Destroying the time machine is stupid too. Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is sort of a cop-out 'machina ex machina' Disappointingly, Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends, a key part of the Wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.6. Having Morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins H.G. Wells' wonderfully spooky, ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night. A true cinematic opportunity lost. Also, Wells depicted the Eloi as frail and childlike. These guys in the movie looked like they could take on Morlocks, if they weren't such big baby wusses.7. The one smart Morlock  kind of a bleached-out Star Wars Evil Emperor -- had potential, but is so lame and aloof he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic high point! In the book the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it, and fight to keep it.8. The goof ball hologram at the N.Y. Public Library is too much. It makes light of the idea of human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the ""talking rings"" that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind. Derailed evolution is serious stuff.Its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket & popcorn and go rent the DVD when it comes out (soon no doubt), at least you can fast-forward thought the dull parts, just like our time traveler.",The Time Machine

The 2002 version is just an FX-adventure, that starts off well and is even thoughtful in the beginning, but then it transforms Pearce in to Van Damme and I think that's enough said. At the end of the movie he looks more like John McClane than a scientist, which would've been fresh. This is not the film's only downfall. I didn't believe the romance between Pearce and Mumba (who does look fine) for a second. Not that I'm a racist, but his wife had just died in a tragic way and the character doesn't seem to be the kind of fellow who'd just start a new relationship right away (even for a rebound).

122,henri sauvage,"""There now: That wasn't so good, was it?""",3,1 April 2002,"If you're a fan of H. G. Wells' original novella -- or of the 1960 George Pal film -- this is yet another dismal proof of Hollywood's positive genius for sucking every last bit of life and meaning from a classic. Though it repeatedly references the Pal film, in every way this movie fails even to live up to the standard of mediocrity set by that first cinematic attempt. George Pal at least demonstrated some respect for the original material, while Simon ""Great-Grandson of H.G."" Wells apparently couldn't have cared less. First there's the addition of a subplot involving the Time Traveller's murdered fiancé: (Spoiler alert) When he completes his time machine and goes back to the past to save her, he succeeds in preventing her death at the hands of a mugger, but then she gets killed by a runaway car, proving of course that ""It's not nice to fool with the space-time continuum"". Grief-stricken, he resolves to travel into the future and find someone who can tell him how to unravel this paradox. (I guess simple curiosity is no longer sufficient motive for a Time Traveller, when you've gutted your story and padding is desperately needed.)The movie then lifts a page from George Pal's film by having humanity almost destroy itself in the near future. In Pal's version it was by nuclear war; here it's a disastrous attempt at excavating luxury colonies on the Moon with thermonuclear devices. The concept is the same, just much, much stupider.When our hero finally arrives in A.D. 800,000+ the movie becomes an exercise in purest gawdawfulness. Wells' story handed filmmakers some of the most haunting images in all of science fiction literature, and this outfit turns one of them into laughable giant Tim-Burtonesque steel cat skulls, then trashes just about everything else. I suppose it was also inevitable that we'd get the chatty holograph played by Orlando Jones, though for whatever it's worth his is undoubtedly the best performance, notwithstanding Jeremy Irons' cameo.For me to describe everything that's so wrongheaded about what this film does with Wells' distant future of the Eloi and Morlocks would take far too long, but here's a couple of quick examples: ""Suspension of disbelief"" doesn't even begin to describe what you need to swallow the notion that -- nearly a million years in the future -- some of the Eloi learn to speak flawless English from a few surviving street signs and public inscriptions. Then there's Irons' campy, glossy-black-leather Head Morlock costume and albino makeup, which make him look as if he's decided to explore an alternate career path as an Edgar Winter imitator, or lead singer in the Whitesnake ""Experience"" (not the real Whitesnake, but an incredible simulation).In addition to his shameless exploitation of his relation to Wells to promote this blandly inept butchery of a classic story, the director also deserves extra smacks upside the head with the 2 X 4 of Justice for blatantly ripping off the famous hunt scene in the original ""Planet of the Apes"". And doing a spectacularly lousy job of it. (Spoiler alert -- though frankly, I don't see how this could be considered a spoiler when the climactic blowing up of the bad guys' stronghold is as essential to hack sf-action-film-making as stink to a skunk, but consider yourself alerted.) After going mano a mano with the Uber-Morlock and rescuing his Eloi chick, the Time Traveller jams the gears of his time machine, conveniently converting it into a Morlock-dissolving mini-nuke, while leaving just enough time for the hero and heroine to escape. Yay! This is the sort of high-Dumbth cinematic sludge that makes you want to lobby for an international tribunal to prosecute crimes against source material, aggravated by contempt for the audience. While I am no advocate for slavish adherence to the original story, if a film is going to use the title of a classic it should at least leave its sense and spirit mostly intact. ""The Time Machine"" may be the most moving, evocative and finely crafted piece that H. G. Wells ever wrote. It deserves far better treatment than this slick but turgid stew of clichés.",The Time Machine

124,AbeStreet,Enjoyable!!!!,8,22 February 2010,"Having never read the book and only having seen the 1970's version of this story for comparison I really enjoyed this film. The set decorations were well done and the film for the most part seamlessly blended physical sets with the GGI locations. The actors all did a fine job. I fail to understand why so many dislike this film.The story, while familiar to many, was still suspenseful and moved at a good pace. It's not an action film and so those expecting non-stop action may be disappointed. Still there is action and great special effects. Time travel is such an interesting concept and is something that most people have day dreamed about at one time or another. I'm sure there are things we all wish we could go back and change. The Morlock's are great and terrifying enemies.Of course there are some nitpicks to be had. Will people still be speaking English 800,000 years from now? Unlikely! Could a computer still be running and functioning 800,000 years from now? I can't imagine how!!! Finally, given the way the geography changed over 800,000 years, which was well visualized by CGI effects, is it likely that the Time Machine would not emerge buried underground or underwater? I didn't find it at all credible that the Time Machine, which does not move physically but only through time, would materialize on the surface after so many millennia.Still, this movie tells a good story and IMO is well worth watching.

I still like the original George Pal version of the film. That one gets a 7 out of 10 for being a better film.But I digress.  I'll start with saying that on the whole this wasn't a bad film, but it wasn't good either. There was one MAJOR flaw with the story and while I'm not 100% sure it's valid I'll comment on it anyway.When Alex makes his second trip back to Save Emma we don'tsee it but isn't there another Alex who arrives at the park to meet Emma. I would imagine as the newly arrived Alex spirits her away the original Alex of that timeline upon finding sheis not there to meet him goes home somewhat disappointed.
Wouldn't that mean he never builds the machine and therefore in that timeline at least he never goes back in time to save Emma unless of course she dies at another time we don't see on camera.Confused yet?  I just think I did a marvelous job of confusing myself. And this is only the first 15 to 20 minutes of the whole film.

But two things stuck in my mind after watching this movie. First, the special effects were great. Second, I really wished that I could have my own time machine, to get back 90 minutes of my life that this movie stole from me.There's a slight spoiler ahead in this review, but there isn't anything in this movie that anyone hasn't seen before, so I wouldn't worry about it.At first I honestly thought that this was going to be an intelligent time-travel story. When the movie starts, it has an interesting premise of a doomed love story about a couple that can never be, and its potential for a moral perspective of one man's desire to change history without understanding its implications. When the scientist is hurled 800,000 to the future, we see grand spectacles of the Earth changing landscapes ... very, very nice. Sadly, once we got to meet the Elois, those trusty old Hollywood formulas rears its ugly head once more (no surprise there). The tiresome good guy vs bad guy plot even makes the word cliche seems so overused and old. You can tell from the pacing and plot that this movie was made in a certain way to get the green light from Hollywood's great formula makers. Halfway through, the nerdy and bumbling mathematician suddenly turns into Mr. Terminator and plays it macho that would make Ahnuld proud ... and of course, along with the compulsory ""run out from the cave to escape the explosion behind you"" scene, the hero saves the day and everyone lives happily ever after.

I've learned to enjoy those sorts of films, not expecting some Schindler's list' every time I go to the movies.  However, with all the wonderful material, the fountain of possibilities and the broad spectrum of the story The Time Machine, nothing becomes of the film.  Yes, I thought the CGI was well done, and captured the time travel pretty well, but that's it. Everything else is horrible.  We have major turning points in the film which last for seconds, while minor scenes are dragged out.  The motives behind everyone's actions are un-realistic.  Characters don't catch our sympathy at any point, and when anything is becoming interesting we cut to something else  leaving what ever was left behind hanging without any further development.  Two of the biggest failure I feel was to leave the story so simple.  The director should give more credit to his audience and fill the film with complicated and challenging material.  Just think about it, Star Trek raises more interesting questions about time travels in 45min episodes, than this film does.  The other irritating factor was the horrible look of Guy Pearce.  He looked like he had been on speed (amphetamine) for several weeks, or that he was anorexic.  This look served him well in Momento, but here he just looks constantly sick.  In general the film should have been more challenging, longer, and with another lead actor! 4/10",The Time Machine

It's a tad slow in the beginning, but it makes up for that once the time traveling starts.  The only complaints I have about this movie are that it's a little too short, there's not a lot of time traveling going on, and it's replay value isn't that good.  It really is a good movie and if you haven't seen it, then you should.",The Time Machine
130,rams_lakers,I'll take the original,1,3 October 2004,"I was one of the many fools who were sapped out into paying for this at the theater, even though I payed 4 bucks for matinée (before 6pm) prices.The remake's story was ho-hum, the CGI Morlocks were lame, the Eloi were rastafarian to mimic today's fads (no I did not think the chick was hot at all), the re-killing of the hero's modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel, overall just a sad, bad remake. I'll take Rod Taylor, Weena, and the fat glowing eyed surfer Morlocks over this junk any time. My estimation is that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids, which does not account for either good taste or a true value of the old classics which are largely unappreciated by today's confused and ever-wanting-more youth. When the 60s version came out (I first saw it in the 70s for summer fun) it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up. You don't have to have an over abundance of CGI in a movie for it to be better. Too much of this looks fake. I can't say enough of how disappointingly bad the Morlocks looked and they ran and jumped around like they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10.",The Time Machine
131,akon5,It really is a waste of a good story...,6,19 April 2002,"The book...what can we say, it is a classic. My million dollar question is, how can someone base their movie in a classic book turn out to be so superficial? let me explain...To be really honest, I really hate saying bad things about this film. It is like a nice cute puppy. You really don't want to do anything bad to it. O.K., inorder to give this film a fair go, lets look at it as a stand alone thing (so no comparison with the book).(Spoilers ahead)The start of the movie was excellent. I really loved it. The acting was good, the film was nicely shot...everthing was going swell...great computer effects...but suddenly, like a time travel into a bad script, the movie turned horrible wrong. The time traveller went into another movie! And what is that movie you may ask? WEll, let me give you a hint, it is a movie with alot of monkies in it. The second half of the Time Machine is exactly the same as the Planet of the Apes. And to make things even worst, those so called 'species' looked like a carbon copy from the creatures taken from the Lord of the Rings. Confused? Well, I am telling the truth.But I guess I am going to far with the assessment of the movie. If you don't mind sitting in a mind and leave your brain out the door of the cinema, by all means, watch this. If you would perfer to leave your brain intact with your head, read the book instead. The book is alot more deeper and philosophical than the movie, I can assure you that.

133,lethalweapon,"Wonderful Movie. Given, some drawbacks, yet brilliant",8,3 January 2003,"The Time Machine... An evergreen classic penned by the father of science fiction, HG Wells. The movie is an excellent adaptation, although it does not entirely adhere with the story. Innovative changes are brought about in certain parts of the story, mostly for the better. But sadly, some changes spoils the beauty of the movie.The portrayal of every character is quite good. And my thumbs are raised for the director and the VFX crew. The makeup for the darker side of evolution from the land deep under, the Morlocks, is phenomenal. I must confess that when I went to see the movie, all I expected was flamboyant displays of Hollywood's technological foray, in yet another attempt to degrade the quality of another classic story. Granted, the story drifted from Wells' classic theme,. Yet, the magic and spell cast by the movie stands in the limelight by its own right.The speed, versatility, and strength depicted by the villains of the piece, the Morlocks, is shown with remarkable craftsmanship. The novel idea by which they sink to the ground, and the manner in which it is shown, is greatly appreciated. And one particular scene in which our hero, Guy Pearce is chased through the woods is a visual masterpiece, as long as you don't mind biting your fingernails.Although the older movie ""The Time Machine"", was thoroughly enjoyed and still remains a wonderful depiction of the story, I would definitely recommend this movie for all sci-fi fans and people who just want to go for a thrill ride.However, the twist in the climax is something I did not appreciate. I really would like to comment on that, but far be it from me to reveal the end. Given, the developed storyline has plot holes of it's own. For example, the story revolves around finding why the hero can't change the past, or specifically, save his fiancée, who seems to die off at a fixed time no matter how he tries to alter the circumstances. An obvious solution would be to take off with his fiancée to a time in the past, where they have a guaranteed long life... Or how about taking the fiancée with him to some time in the future, hence skipping that dreaded time? Don't tell me it can't be done. The hero does travel way into the future, way past HIS reasonable lifetime. Also he is said to have invented the machine in a short span of time... four years, I think, as opposed to the character in the book, whose invention was a process motivated by his pure love for science, supplemented by a lifelong quest. I didn't say these are huge shortcomings in the movie. They are just...there.But still, it is quite an entertaining movie and I would score it an easy 7.5/10",The Time Machine
134,wtmerrett,Truly Awful,1,9 February 2017,If I had a choice to give this a zero I would. It is so badly flawed I almost don't know where to start. It appears that someone thought it would be a good idea to have the Grandson of HG Wells direct this nag. He obviously has no idea how to direct. It is as bad a job as when Stephan King directed Maximum Overdrive and did not understand screen direction. Great writer...bad director. Same here. This movie was so disjointed and had so many story ideas running through it that you had to have a road map to find your way around. The original story line was lost along the way as the plot meandered seemingly aimlessly from one inane sequence to the next. So many holes.....and the audience is without shovels.,The Time Machine

Wells was a very smart writer, with sometimes scary visions of what the future could hold in store for humankind - why ignore all this?Back in the 1960's they had less technology to produce special effects, so they USED THEIR BRAINS, and they had read Wells' book, and apparently understood the message. So in spite of their primitive special effects the film is still great to watch today.Whereas this tasteless, dumb 2002 version will probably be forgotten by next year - good riddance.Antoine",The Time Machine

On the 2nd week of March, Time Machine was 1st at the box office. On the 3rd week of March it was 4th, on the 4th week it was 7th. And it has disappeared from the top 10 since then.It would be nice if studios stopped polluting sites with micro-marketing, particularly as poorly disguised as it is these days.Save your money, do not go see the Time Machine, 2002 version.

139,ShinKyo81,Decent and correct flick about time-traveling,5,3 March 2003,"I like the idea of traveling through time. It's a theme that has enchanted me since I was a child. I got amazed with the ""Back To The Future"" Trilogy and now, years after H.G. Wells wrote one of his best novels, the film adaptation of ""The Time Machine"" is a reality.While it should be an adaptation from the novel, it's better to consider the film as using the main idea of the book in order to create a decent story and plot. However, it's quite a shame it doesn't succeed with this purpose. The film starts with good atmosphere and brilliant recreation of the end of the 19th century. But after the time-travels go on, the movie evolves into a mixture between ""Waterworld"" and ""Planet of the Apes"", filling the action with ""cheesyness""...The strong point of the movie are the special effects: when Alexander (Guy Pearce) travels through time he watches the world change, the buildings, the cities, the landscape... the entire earth. Remarkably done, in my opinion.Also the acting is quite good. Guy Pearce does an outstanding performance as Alexander Hartdegen, the time machine's inventor. He did a great acting in ""Memento"", and now he does it again. Great for him.Special mention to Jeremy Irons, who seems he has been condemned to perform weird and, sad to say it, cheesy characters. Luckly he's a great actor too, so he keeps on his style while performing, though the white long hair and the ""Vampire"" contact lenses makes him look stupid.I don't understand the bad reviews posted in this site at all. ""The Time Machine"" is not an academy award winner, but hey, it's a decent movie, with nice SFX, good acting... and, alright I admit it, a cheesy plot too. ^_^ I bet you a $100 you've seen worse films than this one, so give it a try!
Worth look! 7/10",The Time Machine
140,m0rg16,Fun movie!,7,6 January 2003,"I saw this movie back in the theathers and fell completely in love with it. I liked pretty much everything about it, and in away it reminded me of the Planet of the Apes remake (which I also liked).Anyway, it starts out with Alexander Hardtegen, a teacher and an inventor, losing his fiancée when she is shot by a robber. Since Alexander believes in travel through the fourth dimension (time. This is explained in a deleted scene) he starts building a Time Machine (and a very beautiful one at that) to travel back in time and save his fiancée, but when this fails, and he realizes that he cannot change the past, he travels into the future to find an answer to the question ""why cannot one change the past?"". His first stop is 2030 where he meets Vox, a holographic character who is driven by a photonic sphere that links him to every database on the planet. Or as he explains it to Alexander ""A compendium of all human knowledge"". When Alexander tells Vox of his Time Travels Vox takes him for a crazy science fiction fan and simply ignores his questions. So Alexander travels further into time to the year 2037, where a big boom throws Alexander into his time machine and knocks him unconscious, while the time machine travels further and further into the deepest reaches of time...He finally manages to stop the machine in the year 802701 (or at least that what we are supposed to believe, but if you look at the panel just before you can see that number you can see that he has traveled beyond the 99900000 mark... a miss perhaps?). He finds a diffrent world than the one he left, a world where the peaceful Eloi live in their ""huts"" and hunt and fish for food and stuff that would would expect from indians... who just live for no purpose at all.Soon he encounters another race, the Morlocks, a fiersome monstrous race which hunt the Eloi for food and they look like they have a pretty bad breath. Alexander takes up the fight against the Morlocks and blah, blah. If you've read the book or seen the other movie you know exactly where it goes from there (well, at least if you've seen the old movie, the book tell a diffrent ending) and you know exactly WHO the Morlocks really are.But this movie is interesting and fun to watch. It has some really beautiful landscape montages when Alexander travels through time at the speed of light... or something...The movie is much like the old adventure movies where the man character can take on pretty much everything and beat the crap out of just about everyone and walk from the fight without a scratch, (however Alexander does manage to get quite alot of scratches and scars...). Its very interesting to follow Alexanders journey through time and his final stop in the distant future. The CGI graphics are great, and really fit in too this movie, the actors are good too (even the little kid who plays Kalen manages to pull it off!) and the music is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really AWESOME!!! Beautiful scenes, Ok actors, nice special effects, more than interesting story, cool action and some major things to think about... This is what this movie holds for you.I have seen this movie 3 times since I bought it about 3 weeks ago. Its that good! I give this movie a 9.",The Time Machine
141,Randy_Dreammaker,"The Time Machine"" from DreamWorks and Warner Brothers. A poorly handled story.",5,23 May 2012,"Part of me would of liked to have rated this film below a 5, despite some great cinematography and special effects/CGI. There were a lot of plot-line and story-line problems, I suppose that comes with trying to squeeze a book into an 1 to 2 hour movie.Things that didn't work for me in this film:1. Details of how the time machine is created are lacking and rushed through and lacked anything to build believably that such a time machine could have been built in that era of time .2. A missing element and question on my mind while watching this movie was, ""How was the time machine powered?"" Obviously it was pre-atomic, yet the machine made multiple time jumps and extended length journeys. I think this was a big failure, considering the movie followed in the footsteps of the wonderful movie, ""Back to the future"" and others. That is one key element that Back to the future included that made it more believable.3. The story jumped over to many time periods for a single film. The way that these accidental events occurred were weak. First going back a few years in time to try to save the woman he loves who died. Then into modern future, and jumping yet again 300,000 years into the distant future. It was an interesting idea, it just didn't work to well. We see the world being destroyed as the moon dies, then jump way into the future as the earth regenerates with the birthing of an entirely new humanity and mutant species without any explanation of how that occurs.Did they evolve? Were there survivors from the old earth? And how is it that there is moonlight in this vast future, if the moon was destroyed in the past?4. The ""What If"" question that was supposed to be answered in the future and was carrying the movie, didn't feel resolved at the end.5. Seemed very unbelievable that this incredible time machine had to sit in one location. Obviously it was not bound or limited by a stationary power source, it apparently had an unlimited supply of power (somehow). It would of been more believable if it had wheels or flight.The mere idea that it could go 300,000 years into the future, stopping in several time periods, and not materialize into some kind of solid matter seemed unlikely. Even in the film, the original house was torn down and replaced with new infrastructure.6. The futuristic tribal humans vs. the mutant genetically bred cannibals was a stretch of the imagination.Closing thoughts: The movie ends with a split screen of the scientists with his new future woman lover after he sacrifices the time machine and decides to stay and live in the future. On the second half of the split screen, his best friend and house keeper walk away together when his best friend offers her a job. No police investigation, no inquiry, no concern that her employer, and his best friend has vanished. Really?Too many questions were opened in this movie and not resolved. It may have been a great box office money maker, but it was a poorly handled story.",The Time Machine
142,lwmswm,Mediocre Remake,3,26 November 2019,Saw the original many years ago and after reading the reviews thought I would enjoy this remake. I didn't. I was bored through most of it and thought the revisions to the original didn't make it better. It reminded me of Sherlock Holmes with the professor's friend being Dr. Watson and his housekeeper being Mrs. Hudson.,The Time Machine
143,bronty,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!",1,8 March 2002,"If you loved the early-60's version of ""The Time Machine"", don't waste your time; as with last year's ""The Planet of the Apes"", this has been ""reimagined"", and not for the better. And, just as with ""Planet..."", its lead actor is woefully miscast and leaden; Guy Pearce, a terrific actor of great range, is all wrong for this role, giving a one-note performance that elicits zero sympathy; he's so dour and serious, and lacking in awe of the (supposedly) amazing things he sees that you don't believe for a moment that he's experiencing them. Worse yet, whose idea was it for him to resemble the love child of David Spade and Calista Flockhart?? A handsome actor, here he is sickeningly gaunt, which is, believe it or not, a major distraction. Frankly, the man looks gravely ill and is photographed cruelly. He shares absolutely NO chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with anyone else's. Sadly, even with a proper leading man this movie doesn't stand a chance for it is fatally burdened with both a totally inept director - whole scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized - and a screenplay that is utterly inferior, scattered and at times incoherent - not for a single moment do you care about anyone in this film, for the single fact that there is NOTHING in the way of character development! In the original, you got to KNOW the Eloi, so therefore you felt for them, and felt their terror of the Morelocks; here, as the movie stresses several times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. Unless you're a member of PETA, scared sheep are HARDLY the stuff of entertainment! Samantha Mumba does as well as possible, in her movie debut, but, like everyone else in this mess, most especially Jeremy Irons (if he's the leader of the Morelocks [who look like rejects from ""The Mummy Returns""], why then does HE look like Edgar Winter's long-lost brother?) is COMPLETELY WASTED. Also wasted was the money spent on the endless 'special' effects, which belie the $70M spent on the film; they are uniformly lackluster, obvious and unconvincing. And then there's the look of the film: poorly photographed, its art direction and sets are just ""there"" and its costumes are typical in design. There isn't an original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen. Most of all, it isn't even fun! (The filmmakers use the now-ubiquitous Orlando Jones as ""comic relief"" but, as usual, Jones is irritating, and just HOW does his electrically-driven character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricity?)All in all, this is an empty, lifeless, dull, sterile and confused affair: didn't they ALREADY REMAKE ""Planet of the Apes""??? (At least THAT had the fortune of some strong performances!) *SPOILER!* The final insult (beyond a head-shakingly terrible, not to mention convenient, ending)? Not only do they BARELY feature the changing dress-store figures, they make even the time machine itself an anachronistic, gaudy glass-n-chrome bore! (If ""The Sopranos"" had a time machine, THIS is exactly what it would look like.) Pathetic...",The Time Machine
144,MarshallStax,Compared to what?,6,8 March 2002,"""The Time Machine"", if taken on its own considerable merits, is a diverting and entertaining film with high production values and laudable attention to craft.  It is nice to sit in a theater in 2002 and not be subjected to a film that clocks in at 140 minutes or more; brevity really is a virtue in film.Guy Pearce does what he can with his role of the nervous and obsessed but likeable scientist, but is generally ineffective in communicating the humanity of his character.  Samantha Mumba is the exotic babe in the future (with commendably not-perfectly-capped teeth!)and posts a passable turn. Jeremy Irons brings a lot to his brief bit as the leader of the Morlocks, infusing a dignity and resignation that seems to go beyond the script.  He certainly did not let his make-up do his acting for him.While we could have used a better set-up and some deeper character development, ""The Time Machine"", when taken on its own terms, is a high adventure film suitable for the rating (PG-13).  The effects are uniformly good (and some are amazing), the plot is passably updated from the source materials and the whole affair is not insultingly dumb (like, say, ""Armageddon"") or exploitative.  Extra points for the believable period setting of 1899, where the film opens.If I were thirteen, I would have loved this movie, and the kid in me did. And who cares if there was once another movie with the same name and somewhat based on the same material?  In addition to the widely-loved (I thought it was hokey beyond belief) 1960 George Pal version, there was also a forgettable made-for-TV movie version in 1978, Nicholas Meyer's 1979 ""Time After Time"" which was in essence a re-imagining of the same basic concepts with a different plot, 1949's BBC adaptation of ""The Time Machine"" which probably no-one who has commented on this film saw...  My point is that this ""Time Machine"" is its own film and should be judged based on its own merits. As such, it succeeds modestly.",The Time Machine

Verbiski & Wells will have created a time machine that's undoubtedly set to appear on dvd rental shelves in the very, very near future...",The Time Machine
147,cToTh-2,Interesting...,7,4 August 2002,"All in all, the movie was...okay.  The special effects were great, but the movie seemed to be missing something.  Perhaps it was because my expectations were set higher (thinking back on them, I guess I was expecting the purpose of the time travel would be for scientific reasons and/or to stop a villain, not as a way to prevent the main character's (Alexander) girlfriend from dying).The movie started off slow, focusing more upon the love between Alexander and his girlfriend (the character's name currently evades me and I cannot tell by looking at the cast list).  Then his girlfriend's life is suddenly taken away from them, motivating Alexander to build a time machine in order to bring her back.  Eventually, he built the time machine but found that you cannot cheat death (i.e., he could not protect her regardless what he's done).============================ Spoiler alert(?)If he could not prevent her death, then why not take her into the future, just a few years later?  For fear of paradox?  Well, his travelling back to the past and interfering could cause a paradox.End of spoiler alert.============================ By this time, that's what I thought the movie would be about -- his going back and forth through time trying to save her all kinds of different ways, but fortunately that was not the case.Eventually, he travels forward through time, including to our near-future (about 30 years, give or take).  He was hoping to find an answer that would help him save his girlfriend.  He didn't stay long, but things did begin to get interesting.Then after an accident, he was propelled into the distant future (80,000 years).  The bulk of the movie seems to have taken place during this time. Here, he meets up with a group of primitives called the Eloi and a race of genetically engineered (sub-)humans called the morlocks.Near the climax, the storyline became confusing.  I'm not sure if that was due to the writing or the 90min time frame.  Perhaps on a second viewing, it would become clearer.  But because the storyline became confusing, it lost some of its appeal.  I do not want to go any further for fear of giving away the main part of the storyline.As mentioned above, the special effects were amazing; I just wish that we were able to see more of them, especially the landscape rendering.  Those scenes were absolutely cool.The time machine, on the other hand, was not that great.  They had talked about how it was the most elaborate prop designed to date, but I didn't care for it; it just did not have the ""feel"" of a time machine to it.  For example, consider ""Back to the Future.""  There, they used a sports car to represent a time machine, a device that once it reached a certain speed was capable of tearing through the space/time barrier.For the record, I thought I'd provide my views on time travel.  I believe that it could be possible to travel back to the past, but it would only be like looking through a window:  you could see what's happening but could do nothing about it since it had already occurred.  As for the future, I do not believe that it would be possible because it is not yet written and I do not believe that we are destined to follow one path (i.e., each decision made could create an alternate future/reality).This movie could have been much better.  Although the story is a remake, I think this sort of story should have focused more upon the time travel itself rather than one or two specific timelines.  7 out of 10.============================ Spoiler alert (again)1.  Why couldn't Alexander use the time machine to save Mara from being kidnapped?2.  Why didn't he use the time machine to help save the moon?  Sure, Mara may never have been born, but then neither would the morlocks.  Perhaps he would have found a timeline that could have told him how he could have saved his girlfriend.3.  Aside from the morlocks, why is it that the human race has not evolved after 800,000 years?  Especially considering the environmental difficulties shown to us.4.  How is it that after 800,000 years that Mara was able to speak (near-)perfect English?  Sure, her family was devoted to keeping that ancient language alive, but without regularly using it, you'd think she'd maybe know 1 out of a 100 words.5.  When is the sun expected to go nova or explode?  Will the Earth even be around 800,000 years from now?============================",The Time Machine
148,guyzradio,The machine is beautiful. The movie...meh.,6,27 November 2019,"In 1960, I sat in a theater at the age of 12 and was totally dazzled by the original Time Machine, going so far as to run home and recreate a model of the miniature.In the 2002 remake, the time machine itself is a gorgeous contraption of brass, spinning disks and other parts, light beams, and a force field ball that envelops the machine as it travels through time. In operation, it's a visual treat. That's about it for superlatives.As I began watching the remake, I briefly considered how much the art and technology of movie making has advanced and wondered how the remake would benefit. Unfortunately, not so much -- there was little in the way of refreshing of visuals in the movie. In fact, Alexander's travel to the future duplicates the scene of hemlines rising and falling in the shop across the way to the degree I thought they borrowed footage from the original movie. The fact that Mara and Kalen not only understand English, but speak it as if they grew up in the present day US, is a real stretch. Alexander reaches that conclusion that you cannot alter the past. However, he did precisely that when he went back and changed how Emma dies. 800,000 years into the future, pieces of the shattered moon seem to be in the same positions they were in shortly after its destruction. They should have moved, possibly back toward the moon, or to become rings around the earth. The Uber Morlock just seemed to introduce unneeded confusion and another opportunity for a knock-down fight.To sum up, Time Machine of 2002 is enjoyable for the most part, and deserves the ""6"" rating it received, but is clearly not the equal of the 1960 version that garnered a 7.6.",The Time Machine
149,dimadick,Interesting but flawed,8,19 October 2002,"Since Herbert George Wells(1866-1946)' ""The Time Machine"" happens to be one of my favorite novels I was interested in this film mainly to see how the old man's great-grandson would handle his legacy.This film left me with mixed feelings.Many good points and many bad ones.The Good:I truly enjoyed the 19th centurie scenes with Alexander and Emma.Her tragic death and Alexander's wish to change it provides our Time Traveler with serious motivation that he seemed to luck in the book.His obsession with his work is another good point.When you turn all your efforts towards one point then it is more probable that you will achieve your goals.The scenes while the machine is operating are visualy beautiful.Alexander as a ""wandering fool"" and his amazement at the 21st centurie achievements are well done.The Uber-Morlock was quite impressive, his seing the memories, dreams and nightmares of others seem to have left him with a lot of wisdom.His lack of emotions in a matter of survival for himself and his race is understandable.Why should he be shocked?Humanity has fed on flesh for milenia.We knowed and we don't get shocked by it.Why should he be?He actualy seems evolved rather than devolved as the other Morlocks.The Bad:In the original novel humanity supposedly reached a golden age.The upper-class used the lower-class to achiebe its dream.A life with no worries.The upper-class lived in magnificent towers while the lower class was forced to live below the earth, in tunnels.As time went on the upper-class evolved to the Eloi living in a paradise.Childlike in appearance and in nature.Their luck of problems left them with no need to studie and eventualy all the wisdom of their founders was lost.They were left using achievements they couldn't understand and couldn't maintaine.The lower-class evolved into the Morlocks.Forgotten by the Eloi they were left to feed on each other and eventualy reached the surface and started feeding on the Eloi.Both races were devolved when the Time Traveler arrived.The only person from this time he actualy likes was Weena a young Eloi girl he saved who grew attached to him.In the novel they wander around studying the state of decline the human races had reached.Unfortunately all this history of the two races is lost in this movie.The plot about the Moon falling was rather ridiculous and hardly explained the evolution of the two races.The Eloi of the film are much more inteligent than those in the movie but nothing interesting is truly done with them.I was hoping to see Alexander trying to teach his new roomates some of his wisdom.But nothing like this happens.Why would Alexander be interested in those two races isn't explained.Why would he pass two chances to return to his time isn't expained at all.What gives him the right to kill the Morlocks is left equaly unexplained.The ""Happy"" ending leaves him living in a time that shouldn't held any interest for a science-loving man.Nothing to explore or study.After his experience with time travel I don't think he would just be content left in one or the other point of the time stream.Rather unfortunate progress.It could have been a classic if only the finale didn't resemble stupid adventure movies rather than the original novel or any other piece of fiction with an actual interest in the concept of time traveling.Alas the Wells family seems to be devolving too.",The Time Machine

155,JamieClay,Wasn't as bad as Planet of the Apes but not as good as it could have been.,5,2 September 2003,"To get the review' part out of the way  I felt this was an interesting re-imagining of the original story. The visuals are pretty good; the design of the time machine was nice but maybe a bit too nice, too stylish.
Didn't really like Guy Pearce's performance at all  it seemed forced and very uneven.  I would say this is a fun film to watch on a Sunday Morning as you're waking up, drinking coffee.  The visuals of the Eloi village were wonderful but in contrast the computer generated sequences of the Morlocks running were pretty bad. It was entertaining enough to watch once (maybe on a rainy day) and not nearly as painful as watching Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes.  I use that as a comparison because both films are pretty much `re-imagined' versions of classic films.Nowfixing the story; (semi-spoilers)A line from the film haunts me.  `What If?'Of course many have pointed out that the story is much different than that of the book or the 1960 film, with that said the story could have been more interesting if they had simply made a few changes.  First off  what if the events that lead to the future world of the Eloi and Morlocks had been the results of some change that Alexander Hartdegen had introduced by traveling through time. Uber-Morlock almost hints at this with his comment of being `the inescapable result of you' but there is never a real explanation of that line. If, for example Alex had married Emma but neglected her with his obsession with time travel (perhaps to change some historic moment in the past) and when he disappears, they assume him dead and she marries Philby.  As Alex traveled forward in time he thinks it was the right thing for him to do because they seemed so happy together BUT their grandchild is the designer of the Lunar base that ultimately destroyed the moon.  This detail could have been easily told by the Hologram Librarian without it being too contrived. (BTW - I like this much better than the silly rings of knowledge.) Or even more simply, if through his travels he saves the life of some innocent person that of course brings about the future world.
Either way, this would have played to the classic time travel rule - that even the smallest changes can be disastrous to the future  a little more Bradbury than Wells but what the heck, it at least there aren't no damn dirty apes.",The Time Machine

157,LG72387,"Good effects, bad acting",4,28 July 2002,"The Time Machine is one of those films that focuses solely on its effects. Its concept is to basically make the audience believe that what they see on the screen is real and not some dull fantasy. In the process, the effects tend to erase the emotion of the actors. This film definitely just wants the audience to admire its visual achievements and forget about the actors themselves. Sometimes, this concept is able to work like in such films as Terminator 2 or Star Wars. However, in The Time Machine, the acting is supremely poor with no sense of charisma or emotion and the effects are not good enough for the film to hold together. Guy Pearce gives one of the worst performances of his career and shows very little emotion towards any of the storyline. When his girlfriend dies at the beginning of the film, he hardly sheds a tear. When he is driven into madness because of that incident, he hardly shows madness. The director, Simon Wells (who happens to be the great-grandson of H.G. Wells) picked the wrong man to play Alexander, who seems like a dull and boring professor who is played by a dull and boring actor. The film is supposed to center on a world inhabited by two societies, the Eloi and the Morlocks. However, the film does not exhibit the characteristics of either species and just passes on. Even Jeremy Irons, an Oscar winner, gives a poor performance as the Morlock leader. It is nearly impossible to be scared of this character. The only characteristic that makes him look scary are those nasty bluish eyes of his. Due to the poor acting of this film, you have to pray that the effects are good. I would have to say that they are not good enough for this film but they do overshadow the use of poor acting. If Mr. Wells was looking down on us from heaven right now, he would be dissappointed at his great-grandson for creating a mediocre adaptation of his own work. Lenny's Grade: **",The Time Machine

During his trip to the future he meets some stupid people then smacks his head and travels right to the year 800000.

160,mollidew,"Scifi, time travel and romance thriller",10,2 September 2011,"So many have tried to downgrade this movie but I guess they saw a different movie than I did. It's setting is in the US but so have many of the War of the World movies been located in the US. Adaptations are just that. They are going to be the vision of the book by the screenwriter and associates. They definitely don't want to make it an up-scaled version of the first one. I am old enough I saw both of these movies at the theater. Both are equally good. The second movie is by no means garbage in any way. It is a good movie in its own right and should not be compared to the other one or the book since it is not trying to recreate the first movie nor the book on the screen and is an entirely different medium. I had a hard time getting used to Guy Pearce because frankly I had never heard of him before this movie and he is a little odd looking. He played a much more eccentric professor and wasn't portrayed as H.G. as in the first movie. I like the way they dealt with his fiancé's death. It showed that no one was at fault that it would have happened one way or another.When something is fiction, it doesn't have to relate to science fact. It is a fairytale of sorts. It extrapolates on truths. I don't try to pick apart what could or could not happen scientifically and if anyone does that, it ruins the movie. I liked that Jeremy Irons was a surprise at the ending. It was very dramatic in the way they showed him and unsuspected. This movie had much more depth to it than the first one in my opinion but it takes a few watches to really get into it. The librarian gave the movie the comedy relief it needed and I thought was a good touch to the story.As for the special effects they were outstanding to me and as just an average person I didn't notice any goofs, etc. Most wouldn't notice those types of things. I thought it was stunning and the musical score is what hit me. It is absolutely fantastic. One of the best I had heard in a long time. It should have gotten much more recognition.

It is a well rounded, fun action-adventure without anything sticking out (neither good nor bad), although i did like the villain who sadly appears not for long.Compared to the book and 1960 version, this movie seems rather bland though. Every bit of message you could take away from them, is lost in this movie. The novel/1960-version made you feel alienated among the humans, their culture, their looks, their behavior and the language barrier. I don't want to go into too much detail with explaining and interpreting the contents, instead I just want to give a tip: either watch both movies (this first) or only watch the 1960 version.

162,crothman,Pointless and silly remake.,3,15 May 2002,"Let's count how faithful this remake was to the book.  They both had time machines.  They both had Morlocks.  And . . . well, that's about it. 
All right, you don't have to make a movie match its source material exactly (but why make people think it does, other than false advertising?). However, if you're going to change things, you should at least try to improve matters.The movie fails.  The story is one cliche after another, played as though the writers had never read anything about time travel (it's clear the writers never read Wells -- it's a joke that he's credited).  It plods along, the 90 minutes seeming like several weeks.  And it's filled with howlers.  800,000 years and people still speak in contemporary English?  Because they read it from the ruins of old buildings (and happened to understand a vocabulary of words that would never be on the buildings in the first place)?  Why not just call Mara ""Tiffany"" and make it more ridiculous?As for the end, it's impossible to figure out exactly what happened, or why it occurred.  What ended up killing the Morlocks?  Why?  A good writer would have established that this would work (""Don't touch that!  It will blow us to atoms!"").  I guess they thought the flashy effects would be enough to fool the audience.Speaking of effects, why are the time travel effects so wimpy?  I could understand the reluctance of of matching the effects of the 1960 movie, but they don't even try.  We see very little to indicate the passage of time, just a generic blue-white glow.The story builds no suspense.  The time paradox idea is handled terribly: why exactly does the girlfriend have to die a second time?  How did his going back in time cause it?  If he tried again, why wouldn't that work? The Morlock attack is purely by-the-numbers, as is Jeremy Irons' performance as the head Morlock.What a waste.",The Time Machine
163,Eelco_1977,Good remake!,7,23 March 2002,"Although I still find the original version of 1960 better than this remake, they've done a good job. The original movie followed the book very closely, while this remake is filled with some fresh new ideas. The only thing I didn't like about the remake: 1) The CGI effects of the Morlocks. Last year's remake of Planet of the Apes had the apes jumping in very unbelievable ways. The Morlocks in The Time Machine remake jump even more unbelievable and sometimes very woody (you just can see clearly it's CGI). The only reason why I think that the makers of this remake made the Morlocks jump so high and move so fast is because it should look more scarier. Well, NOT!!!!!! What did I like about this remake: 1) A lot of the CGI effects, but that figures, because it's ILM. 2) Jeremy Irons' performance. 3) The setdesigns. 4) The costumes. 5) The acting. What did I like most: 1) Guy Pierce's Alexander Hartdegen had better reasons for building the timemachine than the Alexander of the original movie; 2) Guy Pierce's Alexander Hartdegen had also better reasons for staying in the year ?????? than the Alexander character of the original movie.

I am aware that the sixties version was quite different from the book, but I still think it is a much more enjoyable movie overall.

Three places are visited, and the majority of the movie is spent in a place that looks like the past that is 800,000 years in the future. This place is based on two different species spawing because of the moon falling.The movie really has nothing to do with time travel. The book cannot be that bad, and I hope that if I get a chance to read it, it will be a lot better. I want to rent the original and compare it!Horrible movie!2/10I give it a two because Guy Pearce is an awesome actor and because Memento is one of my favorite movies. It had two much of Orlando Jones in a serious role, when he is a comedic actor. Hell Jeremy Irons is a major charcter, and only has a 10 minute role. Just two many things happen that either not explained or don't make any sense for the movie. The one scene that comes to mind is where Jeremy Iron's character is going to let Guy Pearce leave in the time machine, and for no reason he attacks him.

166,E-Z-Rider,Far superior to the cheesy 1960 version,7,10 March 2002,"This movie is an engaging, plausible (given the premise of time travel) adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel.  While bringing the original story up-to-date, it also adds some important touches, like giving the main character, Alexander Hartdegen, a strong personal reason for wanting to travel through time.  The acting is quite good--there are no weak spots--and the special effects don't overwhelm the movie.  And, unlike the 1960s George Pal version, it attempts to grapple with some of the paradoxes of time travel.Talking about the earlier version, I can't understand the nostalgia about that banal piece of fluff.  Has anybody watched it lately?  I did and found it far worse even than I had remembered.  It's slow, pedantic, over-acted and drowned by an overly loud and pervasive score that tries to substitute music for emotion and excitement.  The current remake packs a lot more emotion and excitement while being 10 minutes shorter.  With so many films nowadays going over 2 hours--often way over--bringing in a coherent, exciting and satisfying story at 93 minutes is a commendable achievement in itself.  Well worth seeing.",The Time Machine
167,deltaforce7,An almost perfectly bad movie,2,3 March 2013,"MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS. I know that mostly everyone has forgotten this spiritless and pointless failure of a movie that was obviously intended to leave bad impression of H.G. Wells with everyone who never actually read his books. However, I just have to highlight even more stupidities and inconsistencies that this flick is essentially made of. Hopefully, I will not re-hash too much of what so many other reviewers already mentioned. Just to be fair, I want to bring up the only TWO positive points of this movie - the actual Time Machine prop that actually resembled the original concept (as far as its description goes in the original text) and made a solid steam-punkish impression of the Edwardian-era futuristic technology AND the Sienna Guillory's appearance. Despite of not being allowed to do much, she does a great job playing a romantic, cute but serious lady who just keeps popping up in all the wrong places at the worst possible time. Now, to the not-yet-mentioned-flops as I perceive them. 1) Why this movie is called ""THE Time Machine""? Does it imply that this is THE most definitive, most all-encompassing story that beats the original book without even following 99% of the author's story line? 2) We are lead to believe that Alexander's short chat with the steam-powered vehicle driver allows him to learn the way to build a better steam power source. So, upon being called to do so, Alexander builds his totally self-sufficient time-traveling apparatus that evidently uses the power of steam (recall all the steam pressure gauges that machine proudly displays) to provide sufficient energy for a limitless number of time jumps in all possible directions. I mean, since no actual time machine exists yet, it is pointless to argue what it can be powered by or how much of what kind of power is necessary, etc. Although the Back to The Future's time machine that required a carefully balanced mix of high speed motion and influx of great number of Gigawatts of electricity made a more convincing (though somewhat humorous) impression of a time-traveling apparatus. In the H.G. Wells's original novel there was no specific mentioning of the power source employed by the time machine. One just knew that it was not horse-powered and the power source was actually self-contained. 3) What made the script writers think that back in the late 19th century NYC a public place filled with respectable public would be favored by armed robbers? Come on! There was more than enough social segregation in existence during those days that made it practically impossible for a low-life lower class armed robber to even appear in the midst of respectable and well-to-do public. I can hardly imagine anyone insane and lucky enough to be willing or able to carry out a time-stretched armed robbery resulting in shooting a robbery victim to death. Keep in mind that a large caliber revolving pistol produces TONS of noise and police used to patrol such public places ON FOOT (not locked up in cars staring at computer terminal screens like they do it today) at a distance of being able to hear a police whistle produced by a nearby patrol (cops had no portable radios then). 4) Now, the idea of the Moon falling apart from some nuclear mining operation is ridiculous (although beautifully depicted) considering what our next-door space neighbor went through already with them giant meteorite impacts and stuff. 5) WHY the Eloi were turned into some sort of a mixed African/South American tribe living in hanging flower pots is waaay beyond my understanding. No one can possibly believe that such obviously physically capable and inventive group of people would fail to defend itself from some ape-like primitively armed and armorless Morlocks. Obviously, the directors wanted to include some strong but oppressed people of color to the movie, but did not know how and why to do it. 6) Why was the Uber-Morlock character added to the movie? What ""insight"" did he provide? If he was such incredibly powerful mind-controller, then why did he resort to a primitive knife fighting and chocking? That was just ridiculous. 7) What happened to the planet in the far-far away future? We just see a bunch of the Morlock-built scary structures all over the place. Which means that they did not eat all the Eloi at once after all or they got scared of messing with Eloi and started eating one another instead? 8) What made Alexander abandon time travel without clearly learning the reasons why the past cannot be changed? Being a true scientist, would he just drop all his research like this? If one is to speculate about this topic of changing the past, the assuming that the past that already happened cannot be changed, then traveling ""into"" in would be impossible in the first place. Or an attempt to change the past would result in a ""fork"" in the time line thus creating an ""alternate"" reality. But the movie does not bother to bring up any of these theories. 9) What made it possible for the NYPL to nicely survive all the disasters, land changes, ice ages and who knows what else that presumable took place in 800,000-odd years? Even the shelves storing PAPER BOOKS were left practically intact. The books themselves stayed there unmoved! Why? The library was not hidden deep underground and filled with inert gas or something! There would have been absolutely no trace of any library left whatsoever. And so on and so forth. In short, you should really just read the book first and foremost.",The Time Machine

170,angie_l,I read the book so....,5,7 January 2013,"The movie isn't bad, it's actually entertaining and I am not so bothered by the time traveler having made the time machine to save his love. But....HG Wells is one of my favorite authors, not so much that he was an exceptionally good writer, more that he had exceptionally good concepts - many are still relevant to today with some changes for advancements in science. Take the Island of Dr. Moreau and apply it to DNA research. Think War of the Worlds and how cautious NASA is to not spread organisms from Earth to Mars. Knowing what the book is about, I couldn't sit through this movie and just enjoy it because all I can think is, ""That's not what happens!"" Granted the book might not translate well into a movie, I think, it would take more skill anyway. I have seen the 1960's version and it is closer to this version than the book also. So I am going to talk about the book so you can understand my protestations.The book the Time Machine is a joke! Literally, it is a joke, a satire of modern society. Wells was British and he is making fun of the aristocracy saying they are lazy pretty fools who would only be useful if they were food for the working class man. Humanity has evolved into two distinct species. The Eloi are pretty, lazy, carefree and stupid - they are the descendants of aristocrats. The morlocks are industrious, resourceful, and hardworking who due to certain events have been forced to live underground - the working man. The eloi are able to survive because the morlocks provide for them, do you see the satire? The time traveler in the book prefers the morlocks and holds the elois in contempt - yup, he prefers the creepy underground-dwelling night creatures who eat the eloi. Why? Because they are hard-workers as opposed to the eloi who engage in folly all day long. The eloi Weena (now Mara) who follows the time traveler around gets left in the woods to either be burned to death or captured by the morlocks and guess what? The time traveler isn't sure what her fate is nor is he too worried about it. So, leave it to cinema to praise the pretty idiot and kill the hard working man. I'm guessing an American audience is what inspired the change and removed the symbolism. We think of wealth as something attainable through innovation and hard work. We believe in social mobility and don't see being rich as something simply bestowed by inheritance (though sometimes it is). Ane we also don't have an aristocracy. If you liked the movie, you might not want read the book.",The Time Machine
171,slimjack,Don't fix what aint broke.,5,29 March 2002,"John Huston once said that one should only remake a movie if you can bring something new to the project. The Time Machine attempts to improve on the classic 1960 version with advanced special effects  of course - and by giving the time traveler a motive.  He is driven to build the time machine to fix his own tragic past. Unfortunately this attempt at motivation robs the remake of a sense of awe and mystery.In H. G. Well's novel, and the 1960 version, the time traveler is an optimistic and curious scientist. His thirst for knowledge is all the motive he needs to build his machine. When he travels, Rod Taylor's character is actively engaged in the thrill of the experience. His optimism and faith in science is tested by the horrors that he sees.  In the remake, the time machine is a means to an end. Wrapped up in his tragic quest, Guy Pearce reacts to the wonders of time travel with the detachment of a man driving to the local supermarket.  Because of his blasé attitude, all the efforts of the special effects artists seem beside the point  tossed off if you will.In another well-intentioned mistake, the Eloi  a sweet, affectless race the time traveler meets in the far distant future  are portrayed as a gumbo of the world's ethnic types. They have a vibrant culture and seem a robust bunch.  Far too robust, in fact, for their main function in the plot. While this change makes them more interesting and likable than the original's wan and degenerate Eloi, it also makes their relationship with the Morlocks absurd rather than horrifying.The Time Machine has a fine cast that takes the material seriously. No campy winks and nods here, thank goodness. Guy Pearce lacks the doughy he-mannishness Rod Taylor had in the original, but makes up for the lack with a good, focused performance. Jeremy Irons seems hell bent on carving out a second career for himself as the 21st Century's Vincent Price.  No arguments here. We need a new Price and Iron's does cultured villainy with gusto.  As for Orlando Jones, this guy has been the MVP of the last couple of movies I've seen him in, as he proves to be in The Time Machine. The movie truly comes alive in his few scenes as a sad computer program. This guy is good and richly deserves to star in a movie of his own.The Time Machine does have its moments.  The time traveler's interview with the Uber-Morlock is eerie and the movie ends on a spooky and romantic note. There are some nice echoes of the original, from the look of the time machine itself to semi-recreations of whole scenes.At its heart The Time Machine is the type of movie AIP use to grind out by the dozens. Though it is too flawed for an enthusiastic recommendation, it does have the virtues of a good old-fashioned entertainment competently done.  It gives good value for your ticket price, especially if you see it for matinee prices.",The Time Machine

There was warmth and charm in the relationships of the characters and of course, the machine itself was a star. The interaction between George, Filby and, later, Weena, kept the audience involved in the story. The new version lacked any of these characteristics. Guy Pearce slept through his journey to 802,701, missing the opportunity to see the Earth change over the centuries. Obviously other faults with the remake, too many to listI would love to see a remake (1) using the original machine, (2) using the original ""sound"" of that machine and (3), perhaps George's son (with Weena) going back to London to meet with his father's friends to reinforce George's story.

180,nichtssagend,Better than the 1960 version,8,9 February 2010,"I have just seen the 1960 version because I really liked this movie and had high hopes (originals are often better than remakes of course). However, I was disappointed with the original. This 2002 version obviously has better directing, surprisingly better acting, and (unsurprisingly) much better special effects - I reckon the special effects in this movie are good by 2000s standards, whereas surely the ones in the original would have been bad by 1960s standards.What struck me as most surprising though is that the 2002 version's story is much deeper - it deals with the subject of inevitability and explores whether the main character can change the past. In doing so, it gives the main character much more of a reason to go into the future than the original version did (which came across as a fun adventure, coming back just right for tea time).So, the main actors look better, so there's a romance - but hey, they had a pretty girl in the 1960 version, too, so don't diss it because of that. I have not read the book, so I don't know whether the brainy ruler of the morlock is in the book or not - it is never mentioned in the 1960s version, but here makes total sense and is a gaping plot hole in the 1960s version (how could the seemingly primitive morlocks build the machines by themselves?!). The movie has some very good ideas (whether original or from the book, but certainly not in the 1960 movie), like where the people live, the way they live, the changed language, the old library and remnants of the original language.In summary, this *is* an intelligent movie just like the 1960 version, but without some logical flaws. On top of that, it is enjoying to watch, well paced, looks nice and has good special effects.",The Time Machine

To keep this movie to a PG rating Samantha Mumba had to cover up, somewhat, her nice breasts. She wore top that was pretty much see through, but still enough to allow a more permissive ""PG"" rating. You guys may not believe this but we actually like to go topless; particularly when the weather allows. There was a scene in the movie when Samantha should have been not only topless, but nude (due to that part of the story). In fact, it looked like a few parts of the scene were filmed with her at least topless (viewed from her backside so her breasts were not showing), but later she appears wearing a shirt. But, I am digressing. My main complaint about this film is that Guy Pearce did not appear topless!!! A man can appear topless in a film and it not only keeps a PG rating, but even a G rating so why didn't they let him go shirtless???!! I am so upset about that!",The Time Machine

This film has no heart or soul like the earlier version with Rod Taylor. It just limps along hoping to dazzel us with special effects. The so called directors  of this film seem to be interested in effects rather than story telling. The male lead who was quite good in the Count of Monte Cristo as the villian, has absolutely no screen charm or charisma. A fact that I would attribute to poor directing. The earlier film version gave us something to think about, just as the book did. I also want to express my annoyance with how American movie studios feel the need to always make the storys' take place in the USA.

The story was contrived and I never got to the point where I cared about the characters at all. It had great effects, but was a souless machination of a film. It used a corny contrived idea, that of the fiancee (who isn't in the novel) who gets killed as an impetus for Alex to create the machine. This can't work. Since a death was the impetus, then why would he create it if she never dies? This was one of the many plotholes large enough to fly a time machine through that ruined this film for me. Also the Eloi were not builders, they were pampered cattle who existed only as food for the Morlocks. The Morlocks were a subterranean race that couldn't come above ground. These Morlocks are running about in broad daylight, so why did they freaking live underground? Guy Pearce walks around as if in a daze through most of the film, not even evoking the simplest emotions for the most. And what was wrong with the name Weena? Was the unoriginal Mara that much better? Jeremy Irons is wasted as an Uber Morlock since having the character was only for Alex to have a foil, as if the entire Morlock species wasn't enough of one!

Borrowing (badly) from a dozen better fantasy films (Fahrenheit 451, Logan's Run, Planet of the Apes (Both), Groundhog Day, etc,etc,) the film has the history of the world to have fun with and screenwriter Logan picks a Terminator-like single woman with young son scenario nearly a million years hence as the body of the story! And nothing happens for the entire middle section of the film. All you have to realize is that they exploited the wonderful Alan Young (so precious as Philby in Pal's original) for a THREE second cameo in a flower shop.  What nerve,  as it serves only to recognize what an execrable dung heap this is. And after his fiance gets it for the second time in a contrivance that has to been see to be disbelieved, the preview audience roared with amused recognition that a turkey was being born.  I had no idea how much worse things would get.  Guy Pearce looked the anti-hero; bone-thin, sunken-face-expressionless.  Rod Taylor, where are you?

189,warren-1976,A Missed Opportunity.,6,27 April 2007,"The biggest problem for The Time Machine, is its heritage. Both the Wells' book, and the George Pal 60s film. When held in comparison, it doesn't stand favourably. It works best, when you try and distance yourself, and view it simply as a fresh new story.It's biggest mistake, is the time travel. That is the film's central core, yet instead of enjoying a passage of time through various stages of history, we get two VERY brief glimpses of the near future, and then the far distant Eloi and Morlocks. It desperately needed some feeling of exploration, instead of simply bypassing everything in about five minutes worth of montage. The core of the original, both film and book, is the protagonist's vision of how time does, and doesn't change man.It's other major error, is in its motivations, though you can understand why they thought it was a good idea. The film maker's attempt to give the Time Traveller an emotional basis for his efforts, with the death of his fiancée. On the surface this seems a good idea. However, by doing so, we are robbed of not only his sense of exploration and adventure, but his reasons for travelling to the future seem flimsy at best. Not only that, but it forces the film to spend unwarranted time on this subplot, before we delve into the interesting aspects.Thirdly, the finale is so mindless, that it makes little sense. The 'explosion' of the time machine, is so utterly contrived a plot device, simply for an alternative to the old 'blow something big up for the end' trick. How does he know his machine will do precisely this, when he sets it to malfunction? What makes him think he will have enough time to get the girl out and save her by doing this? It just feels utterly contrived, and tacked on for the sake of a wham-bam Hollywood finale.If we do compare the versions, it's surprising how this veers even more from the book (considering it's director's relation) than the Pal version. Lost is the contrast of the practically helpless Eloi, as they simply appear to be a fairly self-sufficient tribal race. The Morlocks, who originally came over as abominations, hideous debased humans (despite the dated make-up of the time), now come over simply as mindless animals. While Jeremy Irons' Uber-Morlock is an attempt, too late in the game, to provide a central villain to defeat.It had real potential, and despite its flaws, is an enjoyable enough romp. Unfortunately, that's all it is, and it seems a shame that even with all the extra time, money and effort, it still couldn't equal, let alone surpass, its 1960s predecessor.",The Time Machine

191,kurt_messick,No time like the present...,8,31 January 2006,"I must confess that I march to a different drummer when it comes to this film. I enjoyed it for the most part, and find it very clever in many aspects. The major drawback comes from the plot - it is far too simplistic for the elaborate care that went into both the visual aspect of the film as well as the nice touches at almost every turn.The plot is rather simple - Alexander Hartdegen, a mechanical physics professor in turn-of-the-century New York (turn of the nineteenth-into-the-twentieth century, that is), has his head in his equations, apart from one thing, his love for Emma. When she is killed in a botched mugging (yes, New York at that time even had muggings in Central Park), Hartdegen drops everything to invent the time machine he'd theorised, in order to prevent Emma's death. He soon makes the discovery that it isn't possible to undo the past (at least not that aspect of the past), but becomes obsessed with finding the reason why. He speculates this is more likely to be answered in the future than in the past or present, and thus goes forward in time. He makes a few stops along the way before arriving at a far-distant future (nearly a million years in the future), in which the human race has evolved into two distinct species - one on the surface, and one below the earth.So far, so good - departure from H.G. Wells' original classic (a great piece of literature) and from the earlier film, but not beyond the pale. The effects here are truly stunning in many respects - the time machine itself is a marvel (the DVD has a feature on the making of the machine), and the time transformation scenes are very inspiring, up to and including the zoom-away shot from the machine into the air all the way to the city on the moon. The Eloi city along the river is also a remarkable scene. The movie rightly won awards, including the Academy Award, for these effects. Unfortunately, effects do not a movie make. This is where the plot failure comes into play.Hartdegen seems to give up far too early in trying to change the past, and his relationships (such as we get to see them) in the future are very stilted. Jeremy Irons (himself an Academy Award winner) has precious little screen time, to deliver what is perhaps the most anticlimactic resolutions I've seen in a long time. The overarching question should be 'why?', but seems to transformed into 'what if?' in an unclear way (the deleted introductory scene, available on the DVD, helps to more firmly establish the question, but, alas, it was deleted). Hartdegen remains in the future (like Wells' and the earlier film's scientists, albeit in a different way), perhaps to help transform the future, but we'll never know (a sequel is not likely).Despite the thin plot, what I found most enjoyable (apart from the special effects) were the clever touches here and there, far too numerous to mention. When Hartdegen arrives in 2030 (prompted by an advertisement proclaiming 'the future is now'), he encounters a user-friendly library computer (personified by Orlando Bloom) with a real sense of humour and humanity. When Hartdegen asks about time travel, the library computer even incorporates Star Trek gestures and sound effects into its discussion (as well as the yet-unwritten musical version of 'The Time Machine', by Andrew Lloyd Weber). One woman in the distant future speaks English (now called the stone language, for the stone engravings that remain from store fronts and the like), but speaks without accent (strange enough, but even stranger that New Yorker Hartdegen sounds more British, as does the Morlock leader Jeremy Irons).Indeed, there are so many little pieces here is seems that the writers spent more time trying to incorporate bits of cleverness throughout the script than making sure the script as a whole had thorough soundness.Another piece I really liked was the music. The sombre brass tones, the triumphant orchestral arrangements, the folk/modern synthesis for the Eloi, and the dramatic scoring really enhanced this film beyond measure. The DVD has bits of the score that replay on a loop sequence during menu screens, and I've sometimes left these on to hear the pieces over and over again.The DVD has one of the better menu sequence set-ups I've seen, simulating the machine effects in visuals and sound, as well as incorporating score elements and special effects. DVD extras include the delete scene, commentaries by many of the crew, several pieces on the special effects (including one on the time machine itself), This is a fairly good film, despite its flaws. Overall I would award it three-and-a-half stars, but will round up to four in honour of the effects, the music, and clever pieces.",The Time Machine

Rest assured that this work of art will surprise even the most skeptical. I have to say that I am impressed. The language that the Eros (?) speak was actually translated....they DEVELOPED a language according to Samantha Mumba (the futuristic Planet of the Apes type chick). Very few directors go to such lengths to make a seamless movie.

On the other hand, I just could not wait to see what they did with it.I found out. I must say, I think this version of ""The Time Machine"" is a great one. Everyone has to wine about remakes all the time. Why?! I think it's cool. You get to watch one of your favorite movies again, but it's reborn! I find I enjoy both 2002 and 1960 versions equally. I like some things better in one version than the other and so on, but really they stand alone as different movies. The 1960 version was what I like to call ""documentary style."" It has narration, it moves a little slower and it's all about discovery. The 2002 version is about a problem, and the characters quest to fix it.The 2002 version is a SOLID film. I have little complaints, but I will share. I think the movie was too short, I would have not minded if the movie was 15+ min longer. Maybe a stop in the 1900's would have been nice. Or maybe I am mistaken? Did he stop in the 1900's? Heh, I guess I will have to watch it again! Call me crazy, but I liked the way the future people lived in the 1960 version, it was creepy. Plus Weena kicked ass man!One could go on and on about each version, but you can just see it for yourself. In ending I would just like to say, I love this version as well is the 1960 version. Have fun with it.I gave both versions 9 out of 10.",The Time Machine
198,lschmalz,Worth the Rental Price,7,3 September 2002,"Although this movie bombed at the box office, I'm going to suggest you see it anyway, for sheer entertainment value alone. Based (in part) on the book by H.G. Wells, and a supposed remake of the 1960's movie, ""The Time Machine"" is the action packed story of a grief-stricken man, who invents a time machine in hopes of going backwards in time to erase the tragedy that has overtaken his life. Now, I have not read the book and I barely remember the original flick, so don't expect any great comparisons to either one here. What I can tell you about this movie is, taken for sheer entertainment value alone, it's a great ride. The special effects are riveting, the Morlocks are truly scary, and the action well-paced. The film's downfall, however, lies in its ending. It's anti-climatic and although you see it coming you are truly disappointed that it actually ends this way. It's like being on a most exciting roller-coaster only to have the last minutes of the ride do nothing more than drive you around at a slow pace. This movie could have been a contender, if it weren't for the ender. Ha, I just kill myself sometimes.",The Time Machine

200,TheLurkingFox,I think the guy who directed the movie read the book eyes closed,1,28 June 2010,"Everyone is saying it, but you probably don't understand/believe it if you haven't read the book. I'm going to repeat it one last time, then give you a little metaphor: This movie has nothing to do with the original masterpiece that is the original book. To represent that statement, let's take a famous, good book that everyone has read. Winnie the Pooh for example. And now let's give it the movie equivalent of what Simon Wells' The Time Machine (2002) is to The Time Machine (the book).In this movie called ""Winnie the Pooh"":1/ Christopher Robin is named Bryan Jones. 2/ Bryan Jones is a 24 year old young man with a traumatic past. This traumatic past takes 34 minutes of the movie. 3/ He lost his girlfriend in a violent car accident (shown on screen), and is now having delusions. 4/ Winnie The Pooh is a giant robot with machine guns instead of his arms. 5/ Bryan Jones befriend Pooh and together they decide to save the Earth. 6/Tigger has been turned into a hot young female with big breasts who has a romance with Bryan Jones while he saves the Earth.etc. See? That is probably what Simon Wells would produce if he ever had to do a Winnie the Pooh movie. Thank God, after that Time Machine movie, he's probably been barred from a Hollywood set for the rest of his life. Honestly. Read the book. It's fun, intelligent, short (you need an hour or two to read it), is both adventurous and riddled with interesting social and Darwinian commentary without being too geeky. And, as it's now free of rights, it's findable everywhere on the internet or your iPhone/iPad for free! No excuse!",The Time Machine
201,ProphetTenebrae,Welcome to another pointless Hollywood remake,4,25 August 2005,"There isn't much to say about this bland remake of the HG Wells classic. The acting isn't very convincing, the plot itself is rather thin on the ground and you can't help but feel that the whole thing wasn't so much a film but rather an exercise in special effects and such like.About the only redeeming feature is that fact it's that ""perfect"" length for a Hollywood film. 90 minutes. Once it's all done and dusted, you can't feel as though you've wasted too much time on it.I won't lie - the effects are quite nice but really they're just fancy redoings of what one might see in the classical redoing and this has none of the charm or class that had. It's straight from the cookie-cutter and it shows, in short unless you particularly want to switch your brain off for the better part of 90 minutes, don't bother.",The Time Machine

Did it make me feel bored or irritated? NO.  Frankly, when I saw the trailer, I said I will watch it.  Then came the reviews and I was hesitant, but nonetheless gave it a chance.  It was a good try. We, as an audience, have contributed to why such a great novel was turned into this adaptations.  We have no patience and interest to be subjected to 2 hours of big screen social commentary. Is it any wonder then that this film is more of a sci-fi, special effect driven, simplified version?  I am not so ready to blast it, like so many critics have done.  MOREOVER, I say WATCH it on the BIG screen to fully absorb the effects and enjoy it.

I, personally, LOVED this movie. I enjoyed it more then I enjoyed the book, mostly because the book was pretty depressing. The ending manages to be creepy, cool, exciting, and follow the book to a certain degree (the inside of the morlocks' cavern looks just as it should). The Time Machine was a character in itself and the human characters were well acted, but the movie belongs to the time machine and Jeremy Irons. He was SO creepy and really deserves to be nominated for best supporting acter. In short, DON'T see this movie if you are obsessed with the book or the 1960's version, but see this movie if you are not a member of the time machine cult.P.S.

I have read a lot of reviewers who said that this is ""the stuipidest movie of the year"" and things like that. But it remains one of my personal favorites. no, it is not the best movie this year (well, so far mabe) but it is a great film. I acually liked this better then the book. for several reasons. one, this movie explores time travle MUCH more then the book, where time travel was not evan the focal point, just a way for H.G. Wells to show a cultual parralel. In this movie, he goes back and forward for a reason besides that the plot requiers it and see's that every thing we do affects the future adn that changing it causes use to take differnt paths in the future. Second, this movie has a MUCH MUCH better ending then the book. the ending in this had me cheering and smiling at what had happened. the book was extremly depressing and sad. call me crazy, but I don't like endings like that. besides that this is a heck of a good movie, splendidly acted and with jaw-dropping special effects. It also is very intriguing adn has a message just like the original. My favorite sequence is the scene with Jeremy Irons. who plays the Uber-Morlock. yet another ingenuis addition to the original story. he is very cold as he calmly speaks about how this works and how it came to be and brought every thing that confused use and the characters to a close. then they have an extremly well choereographed fight on the time machine. Simon Well's has inherited his great grandfathers genious and updated it in a movie with breathtaking visuals, supurb acting, adn a message that is really great to think about.

Wells' classic ""Time Machine"" is ""What if?""... and I wound up asking the same thing after seeing this near miss.  What if the very likable Rod Taylor of the 1960 George Pal classic version could have time-traveled into the 2002 production and replaced the dour, brooding Guy Pearce?  What if the fetching Yvette Mimieux were able to encore her Eloi fair maiden?  What if the new Morlocks had more of the scary design of the original subterranean monsters and less of a ""Neverending Story"" look (remember the giant turtle)?  I loved the new model time machine.  And the fast-forward special effects as the hero flies into the future.  But as the credits rolled I felt the casting could have been better, the script could have been tighter, and the make-up effects could have been more inspired. A timeless story and some wonderful special effects, however, saved the film. For these reasons, I give ""The Time Machine"" (2002) a reserved thumbs up.",The Time Machine

I've always been curious about time, time travel and paradoxes, so I thought I'd give this movie a watch. I have nothing to compare this film to because I haven't seen the original, but this particular film went from great, to somewhat boring. I enjoyed the atmosphere throughout the first quarter to half of the movie, and then it went very far-fetched and uninteresting (to me). I wish this film stuck to the 1800's - 2000's era because that's where the interesting story-line was. I wanted to see more time traveling as well, because the scenery changes throughout the years were very intriguing and borderline eye-candy to a sci-fi fan. The characters were pretty average and difficult to grasp onto. Visuals were nice. Plot wasn't overly enjoyable. It's worth a watch once, but I don't think I'd watch it again.

Although the beginning was a little too cute and contrived, the rest of the film does make up for these shortcomings.However, I *HAVE* read Wells' original, and trying to draw inevitable comparisons do hurt.  I was hoping to see a true-to-the-story version of the film with the modern effects that are really needed to make it sparkle.  The effects were there, but where was the story?Unfortunately, H.G. Wells' story was quite absent.  Some of the names were taken from the original work, but they were applied to beings that simply didn't match up to his vision.I can only hope that the proposed upcoming War of the Worlds will be a better translation - and hope also, since this has been done more than a few times before, someone else will come along with a version that will do justice to a great tale.It is worth watching - as a rental - but don't expect to see the book made a movie here.",The Time Machine

216,chainsmoker,I'll skip this ride,3,12 March 2002,"Picture this: You buy a bus ticket to Pittsburgh.  You love Pittsburgh, can't do without it, can't wait to get there. But halfway through, the bus driver decides he'd rather go to St. Louis. So he steers the Greyhound in that direction. Pretty frustrating if you're that ticket-buyer, right?That's the feeling you get after watching THE TIME MACHINE. The problem lies in the through-lines.What's a through-line? Think of it as your main plot (or conflict, or quest) pushing your story forward. Of course, some scripts have many plots: guy wants to rob bank, girl wants to marry guy, guy's brother wants to raise trained seals for Circus Vargas, etc.  But one of these must stand tall over the others so you know what your story is about.  The through-line is the spike holding your shish kebab of a script together. Without it, your story is a rambling, disconnected series of incidents with no direction whatsoever.Now THE TIME MACHINE doesn't make the goof of having no through-line. It makes the goof of having two through-lines.  This causes the movie to change direction more abruptly than that Greyhound bus.(Spoilers are coming so if you haven't seen the movie yet don't read any further.)The first through-line involves Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) going back in time to save his fiancée's life.  When he discovers in a FINAL DESTINATION-like twist that you can't rewrite history, Alexander travels to the future for help.But what he gets is a new through-line. The subterranean Morlocks are chomping down on the helpless Eloi, and Alexander is the only one who can stop them. Soon all thoughts of his fiancée and changing the past are gone. Now it's about sticking it to the Morlocks and changing the future, pure and simple. In effect, the first through-line has been dropped mid-stream for the second.Now don't get me wrong. Both the fiancée and Eloi-Morlock through-lines are solid in and of themselves. The problem comes from trying to use both in the same script. They are too different from one another to mesh into a coherent whole; it's like two TWILIGHT ZONE episodes were slapped together and sold as a single feature. And shifting from one ""episode"" to another can't help but create a disjointed, meandering quality that ultimately stalls out the narrative.So what's the lesson? If you have many stories to tell, just make sure to tell them one at a time.",The Time Machine
217,christopher-45,What a waste of time,4,1 June 2002,"Apart from the special effects with the geological changes being the most impressive, what a waste of time the movie was.  To many open ended items, like why didn't he go back a third time to try to save Emma.  And before he gets to 800,000 A.D. he only does one stop, instead of three in the original movie so no sense of change.A couple of nice touches from the original 1960's movie, but the movie gets lost long before Jeremy Irons appears, what WAS his characters function about.  Mumba looks pretty and is effective but is just a reason for the hero to go through the heroic numbers in a typical Hollywood action packed light show final.Even the ending was left you hanging.

219,weejockxxx,Disappointing,1,2 February 2015,"Well, that was a waste of time. Having finally got to see the Guy Pearce version of The Time Machine I can honestly say I wish I hadn't bothered. The Rod Taylor original didn't follow the book totally but this one just seemed to throw the book in the bin. Instead of a man tired of the inevitability of war we have a 'hero' who is obsessed by his failure to save his girlfriend from dying. Having travelled into the past several times to try and save her he now decides to travel to the future where he finds the beautiful Eloi menaced by the dreadful Morlocks and that's where the similarities end. For a film that was made 42 years after its illustrious predecessor, it seems even less scientifically accurate. If the Moon had broken up lie was shown in the book, it would have exceeded Roche's limit and most probably hit the Earth with catastrophic effects. The Morloks were shown to be mindless beasts ruled by a man who wouldn't have been out of place in a Die Hard movie. Jeremy Irons should have been ashamed to appear in this film. Just how was the Uber Morlock supposed to have come into being? I won't even dwell upon the overt racism in this film but just suppose they had done it the other way? Put all that together with Pearce's totally characterless performance and this film is nothing more than a sombre mess. The only saving grace was Samantha Mumba who at least tried to inject some humanity into her role.",The Time Machine

Guy Pearce turned in a medicore performance, I've seen him do better (see Memento or LA Confidential).  Also, the story lacked development for me.

Correct on all counts, The Time Machine far from disappointed me. Guy Pearce gives a terrific performance as Dr. Hartdegen (my one complaint about the film is that the book had no name for the traveller while that movie does, and Samantha Mumba dazzles me with her appearance as well as her abilty to actually act (how many pop princesses really can?  Moore? Spears? Prince?).  Jeremy Irons short role as the head morlock is short but sweet. It can be noted that the eroding rocks look magnificent and sell the movie to many, because I know it did me.  One small complaint besides the named traveller would be that Simon Wells (relative of the great H.G. Wells), an experienced director of animated film, made The Time Machine so short. But given that most animated film is short, I chalk that up to him being able to tell a story in a more cliffsnotes-esque way.  By no means best picture of 2002, but by no means a waste of time.  I recommend one viewing just to see for yourself.",The Time Machine
222,smokskren,Mediocre at best.,4,18 March 2002,Throughout the entire movie it seemed that plot was trying to be true to the original but there were enough variations that it felt disrupted. Good special effects.  Missing what I felt were very important parts of the original.  Perhaps an adequate movie if one had not seen the 1960's version.,The Time Machine
223,Citymars,"The Good, The Bad, And The Eloi",4,11 April 2002,"The new ""Time Machine"" retains its Edwardian time period and much of its familiar plot, but has been transported from London to New York City.  The time traveler's name is now Alexander Hartdegen (there's a limerick in there somewhere), a part well-played by Guy Pearce, who, befitting his genius character, looks a bit drawn here.One fateful night, absent-minded scientist Alex nearly forgets an important date with Emma, his hoped-for fiancé-to-be.  Beautiful Sienna Guillory makes an impressive though brief appearance as Emma.  She lights up the screen with her presence (her resemblance to Jessica Lange is so strong, she could be her daughter).Unexpected events upset Alex's plans and set him to work creating a time machine and after four or five self-denying years of intensive labor, he succeeds.  It's a nicely designed contraption, too, one that puts its own stamp on the archetypal ""spinning"" design from the 1960 film.  It looks right, like it actually might work.  Suspension of disbelief is further aided by several early allusions to Alex's brilliance (for example, a humorous reference is made to an unknown Albert Einstein needing his advice).So into the past Alex rushes, with barely a beta-test or concern.  And when he again hooks up with Emma for their date, does she notice any change in him?  After so long a time (on his part only) of sleep deprived obsession, mightn't she have said ""Darling, you've aged five years overnight!""Alas, Alex soon discovers that destiny cannot be altered (for some reason this revelation provoked audience laughter, though I thought it was handled skillfully enough).  Dejected, he journeys into the far future, stopping once or twice to explore mankind's progress.  In the film's first of many unintentionally comic missteps, he leaves his machine unattended in an improbably empty urban space, where no one interferes with it.  No thief, vandal or policeman gives this big, expensive-looking curiosity a second glance in New York?It's during Alex's initial excursion into a near-future Manhattan that we enter Truly Heinous territory.  Alex visits the New York Public Library and meets Vox, a holographic librarian (a miscast Orlando Jones).  When Alex asks this talking ""encyclopedia of all the world's knowledge"" about time travel, Vox scoffs at the concept as nothing but fiction, citing H.G. Wells' famous book and the 1960 movie.  Vox claims to be tortured by never forgetting anything.  Indeed, when he ultra-improbably meets Alex 800,000 years in the future, he recalls their previous conversation but does he mention that ol' H.G. was uncannily prescient?The film continues to lose its bearings as tens of thousands of years pass. Rivers form, mountains erode, yet when we arrive in the year 802,701, words chiseled into 20th Century NYC stonework are still clearly legible! Apparently, humanity has not changed all that much, either.  For one thing, their background music sounds like the ""Lion King"" soundtrack (and I thought the faux-tribal music in ""Return of the Jedi"" was embarrassing).Alex soon meets one-half of humanity's descendants, the Eloi, including beautiful Mara (Samantha Mumba) and her young son, who speak English.  This seems ludicrous even after we learn that virtual Vox continues to hold court in the nearby NYPL ruins (that is one amazing computer warranty!).In the 1960 movie, the Eloi were appropriately weak and passive, like effete teenagers.  Blonde and blandly good-looking, they reflected fears of the future based on the dominant youth culture of the time.  The new Eloi also reflect popular culture.  With their tribal tattoos and glistening dark skin, they are like fiercely beautiful MTV rockers.  Yet despite prominent muscles, they remain inexplicably defenseless against the evil Morlocks.Alex and Mara bond just in time for her to be carried off (in daylight?) by the flesh-eating Morlocks.  Alex heroically follows into no-man's land, where he encounters the Über-Morlock (Jeremy Irons).  In a rush of exposition, the telepathic Ü.M. explains how Man became two races, but the scene is totally confusing, and at this point both Mr. Irons and the plot become superfluous.Strangely, actors Yancey Arias and Philip Bosco are also prominently billed, yet neither, as far as I could discern, appear in the movie.  Perhaps their deleted scenes contained material that might have helped hold the film together? Spoiler Alert It's absurd to quibble by this point (spoilers ahead!), but the film loses all remaining vestiges of credibility in the final minutes.  For example, Ü.M. warns that without his powers there would be no control over the Morlocks, who would otherwise quickly exhaust their food supply (people). Nevertheless, Alex dispatches him -- and we must pray, all remaining Morlocks -- by causing his machine to meltdown.  How did Alex know how to destroy his machine, what would happen when he did, and that all the Morlocks were in range?   And how lucky he and his Eloi friends were to so narrowly escape the blast radius!  Also, the overall time concepts lacked sense.  Alex changes the destiny of Mara and the Eloi so why was it impossible for him to change his own destiny?There are some excellent visuals in ""The Time Machine,"" and nice special effects.  Turn of the century New York is very pretty, as is the hanging cliff-village of the future.  The best effect is too brief and involves Earth's moon breaking apart.  Later, when we see the partially disintegrated moon and its detritus in an orbital ring around the Earth, it's very cool.Unfortunately, there's not enough of this, and not enough creativity or playfulness in the time-travel itself.  In a movie largely dependent on special effects, that's the stuff that should have been enlarged upon. There's a great money shot showing the growth of a technological Earth, but it comes too soon.  The small, changing details as seen from the time traveler's point of view were much more effective.",The Time Machine
224,marktucker7777,An okay ride that's okay to miss,4,5 March 2002,"The notion of time travel is so phenomenal and cinematic that it is sorry to see this film be ineffective.  ""The Time Machine"" fails primarily because it lacks any signs of a coherent story.  Even with the ultra-talented Guy Pearce in the lead role, the drama isn't quite dramatic enough, the action isn't quite adventuresome enough, and the special effects just aren't special enough.  There are some fascinating shots and set design choices, and Jeremy Irons is fantastic in his all-too-brief villain role.  In the end, this is one thrill ride that it's okay to miss.",The Time Machine

The impossible library computer was fun, and the evolved descendant of the soulless tyrants who have run things since the Stone Age was a wonderful addition. The moon stuff was stupid of course, and quite unnecessary as we're doing a fine job of destroying ourselves without tossing in something that couldn't result from mere nuclear construction work and should have reduced the Earth to gravel. All things considered, a fairly entertaining graft of current outlook onto a Victorian concept. I doubt Mr. Wells would have taken major issue with it.

That is why I was so let down by this new version. It disappoints on many levels. Firstly, because the end result is far less than the some of its parts. It has a great potential story, first class actors, and special effects. Unfortunately, Wells combines these into a rather muddled maudlin second rate movie. Secondly, Simon Wells managed to distill out the essence of the story, which is really about class struggle.See it if you have bored 10 year old children to entertain. Otherwise do your self a favor and re-read the original book, which should take all of an afternoon.

It takes a heck of a screenwriter to write in a beautiful, young woman, the ideal of love across time and space and think, ""Okay, so, their love is eternal, and he's come across the very fabric of reality for her, and they're staring adoringly at one another; it's about time she got knocked out of frame by a team of horses.""  It takes a heck of a director to shoot the scene where the man looks back at the woman with cathartic contentment and say, in the editing room, ""Okay, great.  That's the look of love and devotion I want, to drive him to do the impossible . . . now . . . cut it . . . there!  Make it look like the buggy hits her like Lawrence Taylor after some crack!  Excellent.""This movie offers all this and more.  It has a woman in a full-length dress, corset, and bustle being run over by a stagecoach in a comically brutal fashion, and then it has a fairly poor science fiction movie.  Pretty good, ya?  In conclusion, if you're a fan of brutal stagecoach blindsidings, where the driver doesn't flinch, the horses don't slow down, and the woman doesn't even see the one that gets her, this is the movie for you!

With that in mind, I was truly hoping this would be as good if not better.  It looked promising for a while.  The time transition scenes were handled really well.  It's only when the lead character arrives 800,000 years into the future that things go downhill.  I know this is a sci-fi movie, but to me that means things should be fantastical or challenging to the mind, not moronic, illogical, and plain stupid.  That's what the last half of this movie offers.  I won't give away any spoilers, but I literally slumped in my seat from disappointment when we were first introduced to the Eloy and certain ""logistical"" issues that would exist between a man from 800,000 years ago and the natives of the future-present were fixed with a total lack of imagination or realism.

But after the plot of the film switches to using the time machine and moves foward in time, I was forced to think, ""Okay, so if he's moving forward in time, that must mean that his lifetime had to have already occurred and is now in history books, right?""And when the film takes us 800,000 years into the future to a post-apocalyptic society, my concept of reality was thrown out the window. At the same time as wrenching my mind, the film managed to make the story very entertaining, although the predatory race of humanoids is quite beyond the stretches of believability.I rated the film a ""7"" because it shows great potential to expand on the concepts of time travel and its implications on different layers of time.

The movie seems a little slight and rushed, but it is not at all bad as a short science fiction story.  With a little too much digital effects it will become dated, but it is still worth the trip for science fiction fans.  In the late 19th Century and American scientist invents a time machine in an attempt to modify the past.  In spite of his being able to get to the past, he cannot alter anything of substance. Instead he explores the future and finds that it has undergone the same split of humanity that Wells predicted, Eloi and Morlocks.

236,scarlet caulfield,A Disappoint to Say the Least...,7,10 March 2002,"It's just a shame when a film based on one of the most enduring novels of all time performs so poorly in the story department.  Obviously something went wrong.Perhaps my expectations were too high.  I just couldn't imagine that H.G. Wells' great-grandson would botch his novel so badly, and I was very excited for this movie because I love Guy Pearce.  He is one of my favorite actors.But this adaptation just did not work, and I blame Simon Wells' direction and whoever so poorly adapted the novel into the screenplay.I enjoyed the first half hour and the last five minutes, however the time traveling sequences make up the bulk of the film, and that is where the story lagged the most.In the first half hour these characters had feelings and motives, but that was all forgotten when the director decided to rely on awesome special effects instead of simple storytelling during the time traveling.  Visually this film was stunning, from the machine, the effects as time passed, the costumes, and the scenery, but there was practically nothing beneath all this glitz to truly capture the viewer's interest.Also the time traveling sequences made absolutely no sense.  There were so many inconsistencies.  Yes, this is science fiction, but there was absolutely no logic dictating how time travel works in the film because I suppose the director didn't care enough to include that.  Perhaps he thought if he created something pretty enough it would distract away from the lack of sense in the story.Another thing that truly bothered me was the way Guy Pearce's character seemed to be almost schitzophrenic throughout the film.  When does a humble physics professor turn into an action hero?  He was fighting a genetically engineered warrior and talking about starting a rebellion!  He changed that much all in the course of two days?I walked out of the theater with so many unanswered questions, the primary one being, ""If H.G. Wells had a time machine, would he travel to 2002 and boycott this empty adaptation?""  I think he would.I gave it a 7 just because the visuals were extraordinary and the performances were fine throughout.",The Time Machine

There were some problems in this movie that could have been fixed. Guy Pierces erratic acting to portray an absent minded professor was a little over the top for me. I felt the event for him to built the time machine happened a little too soon in the movie. The effects that describe what happens when one goes through time were very good though but i wanted more out of the movie than effects. I guess the first plot point of the movie is when he bumps his head and travels to the future to meet the Eloi. I felt this happened too fast in the movie,the director or screenwriter should have taken their time in getting Guy Pierce from one end of time to the other, although could make for a boring movie but the development of the adventure would have been better (only an opinion). The Morlocks looked good and I liked Jeremy Irons bit part in the film. I have to see it again to have some things explained to me about the creation of the Eloi and tha Morlocks. I have only seen a small scene from the 1960 film so i guess i have to look at that one and compare the two.

242,grimdodger,Many plot holes and unanswered questions but not that bad.,6,7 July 2005,"Time Machine, well I think there is no need to explain what the movie is about.. It is that classic struggle of a man whose mind is beyond his time and that mind sets off when his one and only love is killed, so he builds a time machine (made of wood) to save her but apparently time is seriously related to fate.. Then he says ""let's test if it goes forward"" and travels to our distant future and when audience learns that we are stupid enough to dig moon with explosives he knocks himself unconscious, gets into his time vehicle and sets it to full throttle.. Surely, the faaaaar future (say like, 800000 years) is in ruins.. But can there be a future for him there? OK, story is a little suspicious.. I admit that I haven't read the book but since the book is a classic, the story was taken apart and manipulated into many other forms so that now when author's grandson tries to make his grandpa's story into a motion picture he is accused of using a banal story.. Ironic.What I really enjoyed in the beginning was the laboratory of our mad scientist.. It was filled with interesting stuff and proves that art department did a lot of work. There is a nice reference to Einstein and so on.. Then comes the scene where he travels to future and that scene was beautiful, a glory for CGI, totally professional. Just that scene worths the entire effect of the movie.. OK, enough about the spoilers..Guy Pearce is not bad as usual.. He looks good in a suit. Samantha Mumba as well, but she looks in that torn apart dress.. Jeremy Irons is of course always great but his downfall was the little screen time given to him.. I think Orlando Jones was really interesting as the holographic interface 'Vox', making him the best in the movie. Also Mark Addy's last scene was great..Overall, movie loses most from having a overused storyline and confusing the audience.. What were those things? How could they know what happened to Earth and speak English after 800000, or how Vox could still stand (even though his future scenes were really really nice).. Not to mention there are tons of inconsistencies with time travel (compared to what we learned from sci-fi and Harry Potter), and cast was not mindblowingly great.. But these aren't unique for this movie; there are tons of other movies who have stupid stories and impossibly good endings.. And when they are subtracted movie mixes different eras pretty nicely, and one enjoys if the movie is watched without great expectations (or 'high') Considering that I still have some good memories about the movie (I watched it twice: 1-when it was out, 2-five minutes ago) and the great effort made by art and CGI departments the movie deserves at least 6 stars, since Guy Pearce looks slick in suit I make it 6.5/10",The Time Machine

The advancement of time as seen from the machines cocoon works well, but from then on in it all goes pear shaped. After an all too brief stop in the year 2037 where we learn the ludicrous reason for the downfall of mankind we fast forward 800000 years to a society split into two groups- the peace loving Alia and the Morlocks whose evolutionary cycle has seen them develop into a  cross between an extra from Michael Jacksons Thriller and  a pitbull terrier( in less than a million years I might add). The Alia( who have kept their human appearance but reverted to living like cavemen), have accepted their lot in life as food for the Morlock,who in turn are governed by this ""Uber Morlock"", played by Irons- who appears to have ridden off on his own evolutionary bike and came up with a Klingon/Emperor Palpatine cross together with telepathic powers. Oh, and in these 800000 years the only remnants of our society are  a holographic library database(which has developed emotion)presumably  running on duracell batteries with a million year plus shelf life,a remarkably unworn Brooklyn bridge sign and an unweathered stone shop sign for Tiffanys all of which survived an ice age and the aforementioned 2037 cataclysm.Time machine has the look of a film which had Freddie Kruger as its cutting editor- its all over the place, jumping from once scene to the next without thought, no character build up and baring only the slightest nod to the original story and instead looks more like the mess of the Planet of the Apes remake.",The Time Machine

The depiction of England in the 1880s was charming and quaint, Guy Pearce well cast as the absent-minded Alexander; the love interest, Emma, lovable, and her death very tragic. These assumptions were further enforced by the impressive time-travelling effects. The portrayal of fashion changes was particularly witty. But things went downhill from the moment Alex got knocked unconscious and travelled 8,000,000 years into the future. For starters, the Eloi village was suspiciously similar to LoTR's Rivendell, and the resemblance of the Morlocks to the Uruk-hais was all too clear.Mara's acceptance of Alexander is too convenient and illogical. He drops out of a time vortex, 800K years from the past, talks funny, wears weird clothes, is frowned upon by all her friends - and she lets him sleep in her house without a second thought. Alexander, on the other hand, undergoes an amazing transition from a nerdy, forgetful professor to a heroic hunk who risks his life to save someone he just met the day before. Wasn't he supposed to have been hopelessly in love with Emma for the past 5 or more years?The movie doesn't manage to give any satisfactory answer to the question ""why can't one change time?"".

Forward is certainly possible, if one brings one's own entropy to zero. But a backward movement is not possible, there is not even a theory for it.

There were so many different ways they could have gone with the plot to make it interesting, but none of the subplots were followed through on - they were just introduced and passed over. It felt to me like they were trying to fit the movie in a designated time slot, so they had to cut out all the good parts. From someone who likes 90% of the movies he sees, I give this one a 3 of 10.",The Time Machine
262,Chanpuru,I didn't like it until I realised it was a spoof,3,6 October 2013,"Surely this movie was a joke. It simply must have been a spoof. For anyone who is unwisely considering this movie instead of the book or at the very least the Rod Taylor film...all I can say is please reconsider. If however you have already read the book, seen the Rod Taylor movie and are assuming this might be a worthy way to spend a few hours, all I can say is that your sock drawer needs tidying and your refrigerator could do with sorting...anything rather than this soiling your eye-balls with this rubbish.********Potential Spoiler (if it's possible to spoil this dross) *********I won't bore you with a blow-by-blow account of every failed detail...instead let's simply cut to the last act of this film and say it left my mouth hanging open. Both the Eloi and the Morlocks are totally misrepresented in a shambling travesty that completely undermines the conclusion of the story. Firstly the Eloi in the novel are supposed to be a child-like, naive race that kind of resemble human cattle, superficially living in a paradise but actually reverted back to an almost brain-dead state of obliviousness. But that's not quite the oppressed 'noble savage' bullsh*t we get in this film, making their wicker village in the trees and speaking perfect English, ending up like a cross between a sh*t Endor and that bloody atoll in Waterworld. With the Morlocks however, the only problem was the way they look, act, sound, move......oh to hell with it, everything is wrong with them!!!! They look like a cross between the trolls in Fraggle Rock and that annoying naked brown lump called 'Station' from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey. Savage and terrifying?? Only if you are a 5 year old bed-wetter who hides behind the sofa watching Scooby-doo. Instead we get these boggle-eyed muppets jumping out of the ground like a budget remake of Michael Jackson's Thriller. Sweet Jesus!! Oh and as the cherry on that cake we finally have a bleached Jeremy Irons desperately trying to pretend he's doing Shakespeare or something......rather than p*ssing his career down the same drain that Dungeons and Dragons offered him. Jezzer - in future, just say no.Avoid this film like the plague unless (like me) you enjoy classic Hollywood mistakes.",The Time Machine
263,NikolaiDante,A very good attempt to update the original 1960 film,6,10 July 2002,"This was a very good attempt to bring the story up to date. It also introduced an important element that was sort of lacking in the original story & film - why DID the Traveller build the machine? Watch the film to find out.It was well structured with each little section leading onto the next, it even explained the reason why the Morlocks went underground. This time the Eloi were not simple brain-dead creatures and the Morlocks were not clumsy, light-fearing fat humans. The Morlocks were physically superior to humans (800,000 years of evolution) and the chase sequences are beautifully crafted.I felt that the acting was pretty good with some very familiar faces. It was lovely to see Alan Young, who played Philby in the original film, getting a cameo as the florist. My only gripe was that although Jeremy Irons was excellent as the Uber-Morlock, he didn't get long enough in the film.The sets are out of this world, especially the Eloi's cliff hanging dwellings and the field of rotating 'windmills' was something else. My wife, who isn't a great sci-fi fan, said that the Time Machine itself was awesome and I have to agree. It must have taken weeks to build and was a beautiful piece of craftsmanship - I only hope it is or will end up in a film museum.The special effects are beautiful and well used. The use of lighting when the Time Machine moves is very well done and the sequence where Alexander travels 800,000 years into the future with the changes in geography and such is a wonder to watch. The effect at the beginning of the film where the moon is breaking up looks very realistic. The music is great too, the haunting vocals when you first encounter the Eloi send shivers down your spine.The is also a lot of little throwaways to be spotted in the film, such as references to Star Trek, the original film, Asimov and many more - see if you can spot them all!In summary, this is a nicely crafted film and I'd recommend it.",The Time Machine
264,Merrie117,Really out there!,3,13 October 2002,"This movie was just weird!  The beginning really drew me in. It was romantic, set in the Victorian period. But then when the main character travels 800,000 years into the future....well, it was really hard to make any sense of it all. Trekkies probably get it.",The Time Machine
265,Ken Colangelo,Good but little to do with the book,7,16 March 2002,"Surprisingly good but nothing to do with HG Wells - there are Morlocks and he leaves around 1899 but that's about it.  Great time machine though and the time travel sequences are all they can be.  No giant star nitwits in the cast, no catch phrases, that alone gets it a 7.",The Time Machine
266,msc23,"Flawed, but Definitely Entertaining",9,13 March 2002,"I understand that this movie has its flaws: it doesn't explain time travel, it seems to transition too quickly to adventure mode in the middle, and the characters are not well developed.  Well, at least in the first case, we already have ideas of how time travel works from millions of other movies, so I don't think a rehash was necessary.  I liked the introduction of the idea that Alex invents time travel for the sole reason of correcting something in the past.  I thought this brought a nice link to the story, because it reflects how we would like to change our past or what we have done.  We know that we can't change what happened, and even though Alex can time travel, he still can't change it.  I thought this drew a nice parallel, especially when he was frustrated when he learned that time travel did nothing to improve his situation.  So then he travels into the future and ends up learning that he can change the future.  Likewise, we have the power to learn from our past and mold our future.The special effects of time travel were visually stunning, one of the best parts of the movie.  The time lapse of different ages, the fast forward of construction, destruction, and terrain evolution were all incredible.  The music was also motivating and nicely coupled the particular eras.Overall, I know this movie has flaws, but so did the original book!  For example, the original Time Traveller built a micro model of a time machine for the sole purpose of a small demonstration... which works only once and he doesn't know when it will pop out of its travel.  This is like making a mini Enterprise that can warp around the universe in the 20th century without means of mass production and scaled down architecture - it is engineeringly unfeasible and unimaginable.  So I would give this film some space in what it considers science and enjoy it for its pure entertainment factor.",The Time Machine
267,Inferno666,"Too short, yet visually stunning...",9,5 April 2002,"The whole concept of time traveling has always fascinated me. Since I many years ago sat the amazing film trilogy ""Back to the future"", I've been eager to see any film that has anything to do with this theme.On to the film... I saw the film 3 hours ago, so still fresh in memory! The first I want to say is that it is visually stunning! Apart from Fellowship of the Rings, I have never seen such amazing animation. The scenes, in which we see the travels through time, are so beautiful that you just have to give a lot of credits to the animators. Brilliant work.Now, the story about the distracted professor who wants to go back into time to prevent his loved one from dying, is fine and well done by H.G. Wells. Also the part about evolution is nice, and the little trick concerning how we human beings are destroying the world is also fine.As for the roles, gorgeous Samantha Mumba has her debut in this film. Except for her being a definite attraction and a pop singer here in Europe, she also displays a fine talent for acting - me and my friend enjoyed her acting - Samantha may you get many acting jobs in the future!Jeremy Irons as the over-morlok is also fine. It is a brief, restrained role, but well played - as always when Jeremy Irons acts, it is brilliant.Finally, Guy Pearce as the ""nutty professor"" Alexander, who after the death of his loved one devotes his life into inventing a time machine, is well done.What I liked very much in this film, is the morloks and the speculations of evolution. These superhuman beings, who are superior to man in all ways, are really fantastic done. Too bad they are not more seen so much in the film as one could hope, but the fighting scene with Alexander and a morlok is funny and adds a bit action to the film.The film is too short. Jeremy Irons' scene where he and Alexander are having a dreary conversation, could have been a bit longer and perhaps a little bit more interesting, as well as the film could have been extended at least a half an hour.Go see it, if nothing else, then to see sexy Samantha Mumba! Whee.My score : 8/10",The Time Machine
268,shades033,A rather bland attempt at a special effects movie,6,24 March 2002,"A few years back, Dreamworks announced that HG Well's classictime travel story, The Time Machine, would be brought to the bigscreen for the first time in almost forty years. In the long-awaited adaptation directed by Simon Wells, thegrandson of the writer, Guy Pearce plays Alexander Hartdegen, aprofessor at Columbia University, who decides to build a timemachine after his fiancée, Emma, is killed in a robbery. After hisplans to return to the past to save her life fails, the Time Travelerfinds himself racing farther and farther forward in time until hearrives 800,000 years into the future. By that time, the human racehas evolved into two distinct species: the kind-natured andinnocent Eloi, and the brutal, subterranean Morlocks that kill andfeast on them. Having nothing better to do, Alex decides to take itupon itself to right the wrongs of this inhumane future.The Time Machine clearly falls into the genre of science-fictioneffects movies, a genre that has been fairly prominent in the lastyear with The Mummy Returns and Planet of the Apes lastsummer and the more recent The Lord of the Rings. In principle, aproper sci-fi effects movie is one where the visual effects takeprecedence over the story and acting. Surprisingly, this movie hascool visual effects and a decent story, yet it still manages to falter.The movie sticks fairly close to the original story, while payingtribute to the 1960 movie by George Pal and taking artistic licensewith the reasons for the time machine being built. It quickly cuts tothe chase with Alex taking his first jaunt in the Time Machine onlyfifteen minutes into the movie, sparing the viewer of a long set-up. 
There is an innocence to the first half of the movie, as Alexexperiments with time travel that harks back to the simplicity of theera in which the story was written. The second half, where Alexlearns the harsh realities of the future and tries to protect the Eloifrom the Morlocks, is more like your typical modern-day sci-fimovie. While The Time Machine could not exactly be considered boring,it's also not particularly entertaining. It keeps you interestedenough to see what happens next, but there are no laughs andnone of the emotion necessary to help the audience connect withany of the characters. The CGI itself is quite good, especially inshowing the passage of time, but it also seems detached from thenon-CGI. The time-travelling effects are the obvious draw, as is theimpressive attention to detail while recreating various eras. It wasfascinating to see a 19th Century New York with the streets filledwith horse-and-carriages, and the near future of 2030 showed abit of creativity. The most beautiful scenery is in the future world ofthe Eloi, where the world looks like something out of Riven (Iprobably could have done without the Survivor theme music,though.) It would have been nice if Alex had spent a bit more timein each era, as the two eras he visits before arriving in the farfuture are barely touched upon.The Morlocks themselves look awful. The CGI versions of thecreature look cool enough--a bit like the pygmies from The MummyReturnsbut the rest of them look like men in bad costumes andHalloween masks. They are not even remotely frightening and arealmost laughably bad. It's hard to believe that the legendary StanWinston is responsible for this B-movie moment in what wouldhave been an otherwise impressive movie visually.In general, the script and dialogue are okay, though there are a fewweaker moments between Alex and his confidante, Dr. Philby(played by Mark Addy). Of course, the Eloi have their ownnonsense language to make sure the viewer has no idea how badthe dialogue would have been if their scenes were left in English.Their silliness is almost as annoying as the Gungan-talk in StarWars Episode 1. The talented Guy Pearce is one of the few saving graces thatkeeps this movie from being painfully unwatchable at times. Atfirst, he comes across as a 21st Century Jimmy Stewart, hammingit up as the hapless and bumbling professor, but over the courseof the movie, he gains his confidence and his footing in time travel.Either way, he's much better as a leading man in a genre wherethe effects take top billing, than Brendan Fraser or Mark Wahlberg. Another standout performance is Jeremy Irons as the creepyUber-Morlock, looking very much like an albino Marilyn Manson.Although his time on screen is minimal, he makes the perfectlyevil nemesis for Pearce. On the other hand, former 7-upspokesman, Orlando Jones, plays Vox, a compendium of humanknowledge, and one of the most annoying synthetic beings sinceJude Law in AI. His character seems unnecessary to the story, andhe fails to add the humorous factor that seemed to be theintention. Technically, this isn't a bad movie and it keeps the viewerentertained, but there's so much potential, and the movie fails tomeet up to expectations. In an attempt to keep the film down to the90 minute mark, Wells has left out the sort of characterdevelopment that would help the audience relate to the characters,and he fails to take advantage of the possibilities of time travel.While the movie tries to express a message, it's never very clearwhat it is--don't try to change the past? Evolution is bad? TheMorlocks are just stunt men in ugly costumes? And the ending thattries to wrap things up in a neat little package was justaggravating.Clearly, Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings has raised the baron what constitutes a great effects epic, and The Time Machinefalls well below the bar. While the visual effects are decent, as isGuy Pearce's performance, the movie fails to deliver on what HGWells set-up as an excellent premise. Rating: 5 out of 10",The Time Machine
269,MoonRaven,Meh? B-Movie!,2,11 March 2002,"I have no idea *Possible SPOILERS ahead*This is the perfect example of a B movie to make fun of and rip apart. Dare I say MST it, for fun I mean really, I'm going to travel through time by pulling a Crystal Doorknob, ohhhh, I can travel through time by spinning some things attached to a chair! And it glows! heh, and the Morelocks look like Orc rejects from the Lord of the Rings. Yet the same blue lipstick guy (see D&D) well at least this movie isn't as painful to watch.
The Eloi city was very well thought out, I did like the look of their city. But, it looked like an expensive set up for some Olympic game opening (don't ask), what was with the Lion King type music in the background. I was really expecting Tarzan to show up at some points, it was that wacky. This movie was all visual with no point, all icing no cream filling.
Also the idea of time travel in this movie is VERY flawed, hence more of the reason to call this a B-Movie. Good if you check your mind at the door. And knowingly make fun of it. Wait for the cheap seats. And fun ripping it apart! A rather fun cheesy movie.......Rating: 5/10",The Time Machine
270,bittersweet_smiler,"I had high expectations, it has its moments, but was a bit disappointing",8,9 December 2002,"I had high expectations for this movie seeing that I am a lover of anything related to time travel, and I'm also a bit of a sci fi fan. Even though there were a lot of things I liked in this movie, I found a few things here that disappointed me.Spoilers here.There was a good lead-up to the time traveller's life in the 1900's and his reason for travelling (even though by viewing other comments it seems that this was not taken from the novel and was adapted for the movie), and I liked the visuals of the construction of a moon colony in the early 21st century and the progression of human civilisation in 2030, even though the computer database seemed a bit ignorant and closed-minded.However, I noticed a lot of holes in the plot. In the travelling time from 2037 to 802701, the time machine moved through time and its surroundings moved through erosion and temperature extremes and other changes in environment, which in my opinion was visually and perceptively fantastic. However, I don't see how the effects over time would allow for parts of New York to be preserved for so long when the surrounding earth was completely wiped away, nor do I see how a computer could last for so long without running out of power or being damaged beyond repair. Also, I don't see how humans could have survived or evolved if humans were apparently wiped off the earth (or at least from New York) due to the destruction of the moon. The movie doesn't point out how humans survived or where they came from and the lead character doesn't seem concerned with this, nor does the movie show any humans from 2037 to 802701. Also, I don't think it's plausible that the English language would have been handed down to descendents for over 800,000 years.I think the movie was far too short as I feel that a lot more could have been explained and questioned and elaborated on in this movie. In a way it sort of inspires me to create my own remake. Even though I like the ideas that were used in this movie, there's a lot of things I would do differently and would add. I wanted to see a lot more of the happenings from the 1900's and beyond to see the perceptions from the moviemakers.If you regard all the holes in the plot and a few weird bits and pieces, this is a fun and interesting movie. If it confuses you or annoys you a bit then don't worry because it's not that long and it's over almost as quickly as it starts. 9/10 for subject matter and perception, 7/10 for plot holes and stuff that just didn't make sense. Overall, 8/10, and I'm being a little generous because I like time travel movies.",The Time Machine

It doesn't drift too far away from the original story and the scenes that are added are very good. However, by the end of the movie, you can't help but want it to be a little bit longer - it definitly needs a few more time travelling scenes.But the time traveling we do see is fantastic and the effects are great. Also absent from the film is the part, in the book, when the Time Traveller travels forward in time and witnesses, pretty much, the end of the world.

All the time, in time machine related stuff we get to see almost the same things, like somebody goes into past or future and all that... But I think this movie was different! The story starts with a scientist often criticized by people near him... They don't like him, think he is crazy except his gf! But he succeeds to make a time machine. He travels into future, 2027 (I guess) and likes the future and makes a robot friend! Curious to know he travels a little more, to 2037, and this is where the real thing begins! The MOON has broken down and fallen on earth (half of it). Can you imagine such a creative idea? I liked it. People are going here and there trying to save themselves and in quick hesitation he loses his consciousness and time machines takes him thousand of years ahead. Ice Ages have passed and when he wakes up, entirely new world! What's interesting now is, two breeds of human have developed, normal humans (like us) and humans went underground because Earth couldn't support all humans after moon broke down. Another great twist in the story. This is about the story. Then he travels some years ahead (maybe centuries) and founds in a whole new world, where minds of humans have been captured a superhuman, the leader of Underground humans! Another great idea! But second half has simply very sweet music composition! A very nice supplement to a wonderful storyline!Good work by all the leading actors, Guy Pearce, Samantha Mumba, Jeremy Irons and Orlando Jones as robot, all are great!Sweet, simple, creative and refreshing! Well, actually a nice story, very different one!Take my words, you won't get disappointed, you'll feel refreshed after watching it!I had watched it on Star Movies 2-3 years back and it's still fresh in my mind!8/10 thanx vipin",The Time Machine
274,adavis-6,Great Diversion- if you can get over a few things,6,25 February 2003,"This film is currently making its way around satellite and I recently saw it for the first time.In general, the film was both enthralling and thought provoking.  The plot, although somewhat predictable in some parts, also caused the viewer to contemplate the larger issues of space and time and whether or not it is possible to alter the events of time.As for the story, you have to separate yourself from the book or the original film for a while and evaluate the movie as a single works.  I believe when one does so; they will probably find a story worth telling.  In order to enjoy this, one must also suspend reality.There were several `very honorable mentions' in this movie.  One was the holographic librarian (Vox) played by Orlando Jones, who sets my mind to smoking when he asks, `Do you know what it's like to remember everything?' The other was the Uber-Morlock (a sort of half David Bowie half alien from Signs) played by Jeremy Irons, who makes some very meaningful statements on the ethics of slaughtering people for food.If you are a Sci-Fi nut, and if you can get over the fact that 1) this is not very close to the H.G. Wells book, 2) is not that close to the original film and 3) does not make very convincing explanations of how Alexander travels through time then this film is a great diversion.",The Time Machine
275,jeeves-1,Awesome but wanted more.,10,10 October 2002,"This movie intrigued me, philosophically, almost as much as the Matrix did. There is so much more that could be explored in this movie.  Of course, I am at a disadvantage in that I have not read the book.  Perhaps it might not go amiss if I read it...For some reason, I found myself comparing this movie to an episode of Star Trek: TNG.  I know, strange...  But, the exploration of different topics in this movie where handled in much the same way.  In my opinion, this is a negative in a movie.  In Star Trek, you know you have 45 minutes to get through the story and issues etc.  But a movie?  For all intents and purposes, in a movie you have all the time in the world.  I think there could have been MUCH more done in this movie with the Morlocks and evolution and that whole ball of wax.  But, again, I haven't read the book, so, going on such tangents may not be a part of the original.So, despite that, what a great movie!  Very entertaining.  There is something about watching glaciers move at high rates of speed that is just cool.  It is also a treat to see Jeremy Irons playing a quasi-evil guy.

276,thebarnacle,The Time Machine is about 15 years too late,6,5 March 2002,"If you want to enjoy this movie, and I mean really enjoy it, well, then I guess it's possible.  You'll need to do a complete shutdown of any sort of logical process going on in your brain.  You need to smile knowingly at the many ""witty"" one-liners.  And finally, you need to embrace the random blue villain as an actual evil presence. The problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. Should we go for scifi, perhaps a little romance?  Naw, lets just make an adventure.  In this respect, the movie is a complete failure, because there are movies that do it a lot better (Back To The Future comes to mind presently).  If graphics and mindless entertainment are your aim, then perhaps this movie is for you.At the advanced screening I went to, people were cheering and clapping in the end.  I wanted to hit them.(******Major Spoilers Contained******) Logically of course, there is the Jeremy Irons pointless villain.  There is the fact that people are speaking perfect English 800,000 years into the future.  The stupid rubber monsters who live in caves and can come out into the light with no problem (I really like Iron's explanation as to why they live below ground...oh yeah, there is no explanation).  Glass that supports the hologram incurs 800,000 years of damage in the form of a crack on one of the plates.  People living on the sides of cliffs for protection when it provides no protection.

I saw this newest version of The Time Machine and was absolutely impressed by the special effects, but if it weren't for the special effects, there would be absolutely no reason to see this movie.  Poor direction, lame acting (surprisingly from Guy Pearce whom I really thought was great in L.A. Confidential and the fantastic Memento), a poor script and just plain silly ideas get in the way of making this a movie to see.  800,000 years into the future and he runs into a number of people that still speak English?  Give me a break.  Enjoyed Jeremy Irons' performance even if I would not have known it was him unless I had seen the credits.

Contrary the case, then you will be all the time like: ""hey, something is missing here"". What i hated at most about this movie is that it was affected so much by the political and social issues that didn't exist back in 1960 when it was first made. In 1960, paranoid self-called anti-racist groups didn't exist so you could safely make a film entirely without black people and nobody complained, unlike today when you have to meet certain standards such as making sure to include an obligated minimum of individuals of each race in a movie which is the case of this film where the once blond and blue-eyed Eloi had to be replaced by black mixed with south-Asian and Latino so these audiences wouldn't feel left out. This is without doubt the stupidest aspect of this movie and one of the things that makes it so superficial and clearly a 2002-year movie.It has however certain things that complement the original, like the presence of the uber-morlock which is a great character, although maybe a little too fictional so its completely normal it was not necessary in the first version, he just wouldn't fit because of its realistic tone.",The Time Machine

They also might mention that looking like a dead fish in the supermarket does not display nearly as much emotion as he seems to think it does. Based on his performance, he should play a part in a different H. G. Wells classic, ""The Invisible Man."" As the invisible man. This way, we won't have to watch him try to act. Still, not one line was delivered well throughout the whole movie, so that may not help. The director failed to watch his actor. Still, the effects are decent for the most part. There are the usual inconsistencies in the science that you find in H. G. Wells (or any 19th Century Sci-Fi author). The changes to the script to bring it up to date were stupid, and you could have cut at least an hour out of the movie and made it decent.

281,Sten,Simon Wells Spits on his Grandpa's Grave,1,29 July 2003,"H.G. Wells is spinning.  No doubt about it.Really, this would have been a decent sci-fi/adventure movie, if it hadn't been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson.  I kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel. What resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardization.The novel is a great sci-fi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it (probably because they read it when they're very young) is that it's overflowing with social commentary.  The Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of Victorian England, and the overall message of the film is that EVERYTHING DECAYS AND DEGENERATES, a satiric jab at Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever. There's no love story, no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman....in the novel, the Eloi are 3-foot-tall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal.  The Time Traveler does befriend an Eloi woman but it's clear he thinks of her more like a pet, and anyway she's killed before the novel ends.This movie first tries to give us a totally stupid backstory as to ""why he wants to travel through time.""  The treacly romance and the Lessons He Must Learn are enough to make film fans vomit.The journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster.  OK, not bad, but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates, as in the book.  More a reflection of the times, I guess, as the George Pal version had a nuclear war take place.The general story?  Ugh.  A total misrepresentation of the novel.  The Eloi are too competent and warlike.  The Morlocks are too intelligent.  The UberMorlock is an embarrassment, and there's no setup.  He just shows up in time to be killed.  Yawn.Samantha Mumba does OK.  Guy Pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain.  (Reportedly he broke a rib while filming this.)

282,Trevor-6,Not really an improvement over the original...,7,17 May 2002,"It's not really an improvement over George Pal's 1960 film, except for the vastly superior effects, but the 1978 made-for-TV version is practically an embarrassment next to this updated take on H.G. Wells' classic story. Directed by Wells' great-grandson Simon Wells, whose previous experience is solely non-Disney animation like Prince of Egypt, the story follows Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) as he first travels back in time to try to save the life of his fiancée (Sienna Guillory), and then forward in time to find out why he failed. Most of the movie takes place some 800,000 years in the future, when humanity has been divided into two sects, the peace loving Eloi and the Morlocks, who hunt the Eloi for food. I found it a little hard to believe that so many New York City artifacts survived all those centuries (the Eloi use them to teach their children English), but I was willing to let it all slide because the movie was otherwise enjoyable. Don't listen to the critics, if you like science-fiction, you'll probably enjoy The Time Machine.",The Time Machine

From the preview the visual effects didn't look that good, but when you are in the theatre watching the film they show their impressiveness, if that is a word. The acting was very strong from Guy Pearce and Samantha Mumba. Yes, that is Samantha Mumba the singer, now also actress.  I think she has a very promising acting career ahead of her.

At least with a brick wall, I know what to expect.I've seen the earlier versions of The Time Machine.  All this movie had to do was remake it with new CG technology to make the travel sequences a bit more interesting.  And, with Guy Pearce as the lead, we just might have something.  Well, what you get is pretty bad.....no, make that downright awful.  So bad, my wife fell asleep within 30 minutes.
In all fairness, the first 15-20 minutes had my attention.  The story was moving along and his motivation was logical.  However, the moment he got off his little Time Taxi and landed in 2090-something...the story fell to pieces.  It was getting silly, lost, ridiculous, laughable, stupid......ever seen Highlander 2?The rest of the movie is just one big spoiler.  It is NOT a satisfactory remake of the original.  As many other users have commented, there is just too much missing and everything seems rushed.  AND WHAT IS IT WITH THE HOLOGRAPHIC GUY???  You've just GOT to be kidding!!  It was the most idiotic script mistake and it played as corny as you can get.  DID YOU SEE HIM PAT THE SKULL ON THE HEAD??? ""Alas poor Morlock, I knew him well"".SO dissappointing.

Apart from the future image of human devolution this is hardly thesame film. The beginning attempts(and mostly succeeds) to capture theatmosphere of the original but ultimately loses it's way. The Time Machine itself is quite an amazingly constructed brass and glass creation but it'sincomprehensible design is nowhere near as memorable as the Pal version.Considering the theme this movie has all the trademarks of something that ran out of time. The effects are visually interesting and the results of Stan Winston's Creature Shop are as usual excellent. The characters have little time to develop though before we are rushed back and forth into the future. Along the wayscenery changes, the Moon falls apart (probably the most interesting visualeffect of the future) and just when the story starts to build momentum it just well, ends. Of course the benefit of the short running time is that it doesn't outstay it's welcome. However, like movie popcorn when it's over it does leave you feeling empty, unsatisfied and in search of something a bit more fulfilling.Acting is competent but apart from Guy Pearce nobody else has enough screentime to make any significant contribution. Samantha Mumba breaks the curse of teen pop star to actor transitions by actually being watchable and her kidbrother is okay too. Orlando Jones (Evolution) is an entertaining if totallyunrealistic diversion who thankfully isn't as annoying as Chris tucker in the Fifth Element. Watching Jeremy Irons you could be thinking it's David Bowie from Labyrinthand you'll be wondering why he bothered to appear in such a ridiculous role as well. Maybe the script writers had been watching ""Beneath the Planet of theApes"" that night and (for lack of any other dramatic conclusion) thought hewould be a good thing to stick in near the end.

***SPOILERS AHEAD***When the movie finishes before you expect you'll be left with a myriad ofnon-paradox related questions.Why did the producers at the test screenings fail to notice the entire audience unintentionally laughing at the supposedly sad scene near the beginning?

It is very difficult to feel anything for the main character and as for the rest of the cast, only Jeremy Irons leaves a lasting impression. Going that far into the future only to see something from TV (the lost world) showed a lack of imagination (the cracked moon was nice). Did not live up to the hype.",The Time Machine
291,jmorales22,Wonderful adaptation of H.G. Wells' story in the context of a century later,7,9 March 2002,"Although some might disagree, I think some things had to be changed to make the story fit the modern age, and I think this movie did so nicely.  If you watch the original, it's obvious some of the culture biases that were prevalent at the time of its making.  Weena, the leading-role eloi woman, was a blonde hair/blue eyes.  I think it's great that they picked someone with darker skin for the leading eloi role, and Samantha Mumba did a fine job, without adding any pop-bias in it (which I was concerned about; I for one don't want pop culture to seep into our moviegoing experience, especially movies that I'm actually interested in seeing such as this one and the Matrix.)  She's no Aliyah though, which is good, nor does she have the lack of acting ability of a Britney Spears.  It's been predicted that at some point in the future, we may all have the same skin color of Vanessa Williams, so this is accurate.  Also, this movie took time to explain why the Eloi spoke and understood English... something the older movie didn't. Comparing the two movies, you can also tell the effect that the feminism movement has had on our culture.  In the original, Weena was a complete ditz, totally incompetent and incapable of making her own decisions.  In this new one, Mumba's character is smart and competent.  I also liked how they kept the relationship between Mumba's and Pierce's characters largely plutonic.  Something else that's changed since 1960 is the end of the Cold War, so Wells' apocalyptic scenario didn't seem as likely.  The moon destruction thing was a great change I thought, and looked awesome.  In the 1960 version, the Morlocks would sound an alarm that used to be used during the war to get people to go to bomb shelters. The eloi would mindlessly march into the Morlocks' place. Again, since this seems less likely now, the Morlocks are changed into fierce hunters, the kind our protagonist can't single-handedly take on and destroy. And they they look awesome.  The addition of the Uber-Morlock role fit well in my opinion, and I loved the fact that despite knowing the original story, I didn't know how it was going to end.  The climax was very exciting, and the resolution was moving. Lastly, I was a bit apprehensive about the special effects, thinking they would overuse computer animation (which can look as fake as the special effects they used in the 1960s), but it turned out to be tastefully done. The time travel scenes looked amazing.  Great job to everyone involved. 7/10.",The Time Machine

296,apaglia,Is This Film Still OK Despite Not Being Faithful To Wells' Original Story?,7,19 September 2006,"I remember going along to the cinema when it was released, full of anticipation of what modern technology in films could do with a story like The Time Machine. I exited the cinema totally disappointed. Surely Simon Wells couldn't allow such a thing to happen to his great grandfather's novel? Where was Victorian London? Where was the after dinner experiment with the model? Where was the real time-traveller? Just details from the original, but it conjured up a flavour which the modern film totally rejected. Even the great political lesson of the widening of the gulf between the haves and have-bots was overlooked. Rather naive and strange in these supposedly enlightened times.And yet, just a year later I was buying the DVD. Make no mistake, the novel is a wonderful creation and the 1960 film is a vastly simplified, yet colourful rendition of the book. And yet, I really like this version too. Admittedly, I have got over the shock of seeing H.G.Wells' story torn to shreds, and now I just like the film for it's own ends. It's no masterpiece, but there are some simply stunning pieces. The time travelling sequences are magical; hugely aided and abetted by a music soundtrack that is quite the best thing about the film. You'll be humming this one for a long, long time. The acting is actually reasonably good throughout. I thought Guy Pierce gave a pretty good account of himself, and Sienna Guillory makes for a excellently tragic Emma. I liked and was frustrated by Vox (Orlando Jones) simply for the fact that he resembled a latter day Internet so well. The snippet where he asks Alexander if he would like to hear a song from the musical of The Time Machine by Andrew Lloyd-Webber (who although immediately saying NO because it's not what he asked for, gets ignored and he has to hear a rendition) is so reminiscent of present day search engine answers that have almost nothing to do with the enquiry, and yet are almost forced upon the enquirer.There are areas of the screenplay that don't tie together well but, as H.G. would have said, ...take it as a story, what do you think of it? Well I find that I do enjoy The Time Machine as a story, and if I want the real thing I read the book. There's always the Wells estate authorised sequel, The Time Ships by Stephen Baxter that could be filmed. Now that would make an excellent film. Just don't play around with that one too much eh, filmmakers?",The Time Machine
297,jameswardtemporary,An 'ok' film that will be a little disappointing to fans of the original..,5,16 September 2014,"The time machine is an exceptionally...OK film, when it exists purely as a standalone movie, that is.. As a standalone film its a vague adventure/action flick with (the impression of)a mediocre budget and not-quite-professional writers and producers. The concept is novel and has some great scenes but overall is not completely coherent and lacks direction as to what it wants to be. A reasonable family film that's worth a rental at least one time if you're out of things to watch....But as a remake, the film is on the disappointing side of the 'ok' spectrum. The movie seeks to improve on the original 1960 version, and where as it does so with good special effects (albeit it few and far between)good characters and some interesting scenes, in every other case it either doesn't improve at all or exacerbates the issues of the original 2-fold.The films main issues is that it tries to add to the original films foundations with poorly thought out ideas, and this makes the whole thing incoherent. For example, Where as in the original the travelling through time was done because...why not? and Maybe the future holds new possibilities (the actions of an inquisitive mind), the remake unnecessarily creates a love-interest who's objectively nothing more than 1. Filler 2. A shallow vessel for reasons to travel in time.The love interest is brought in 10 minutes into the film, they share a 3 minute scene and then the dies. Cut to several months in the future. Now that he built the time machine he goes backwards *exactly once*, meets her again and she soon dies a second time. Based on that, he travels forwards in time with the question of 'why can't I change the past?' and that question is asked exactly once and shes never thought of again. End of love interest.One might think that the above was an 'in a nutshell' detailing, but unfortunately it isn't. It may well have been a word-for-word from the creators storyboard. There was literally no reason for this character to exist, nor this need for a reason to time-travel, and this is an example of what the remake 'adds' to the original..Also for a film about time travel, we see very little 'legitimate' time travel at all. The main character stops in the future exactly twice before the final half. Once for 5 minutes and once for 50 seconds, before landing in a time where the world has reverted to greenery and tribe people..So wheres the artistic and scientific concepts of the future? Wheres the ideas of future technology? society? buildings? language? The only science-fictiony and star-trek-ish examples we see are within 3 meager scenes. Its incredibly disappointing how little of the 'future' we really got to see.Instead we're treated to a second half of a film based around technologically illiterate forest dwellers who use fire as light and branches as building materials.. Don't get me wrong, I understand that both this and the original are attempting to follow the book, but the creativity opportunities for film were greatly lacking..The last major issue was the second half of the film, almost in its entirety. As said earlier, the film lacks direction and this is where it occurs the most. At some point the film devolves into a cheesy action flick with fighting and choreographed action scenes against generic cgi. The 'bad guy' and his minions were equally generic and their agendas were simplistic. The film ends on an attempted high-note, but the generic standards of the whole second half leave you uncaring with its predictable resulting character accomplishments and new love interest. The end. All very straight forward and lacking imagination. Not much else to say without giving up all of the remaining plot.In a nutshell: The good points:-1. Actors were both believable and were well suited for their respective parts. 2. The Special effects for the time travelling were excellent. 3. The idea(s) behind the few future scenes were interesting 4. When they're not trying to 'add' to the film, it is a reasonable homage to the original and worth a watch at least one time. 5. As a stand-a-lone, its not terrible, and there are great scenes at times.The bad points:- 1. What it adds is pointless, genetic and makes the film feel rushed and unguided. 2. Creative opportunities were missed in plenty of obvious places. 3. The second half of the film turned into a generic action flick, almost as if the two halves were different films. 4. Its just an 'ok' remake, it could have been a lot better.5/10",The Time Machine

299,nethaven,One of the only worthy remakes,10,3 March 2006,"Remakes have been attempted many times in the attempt to capitalize off an idea twice. Most of them fail miserably, and those that do the job decently often do not offer any more than improved effects. Not so here.H.G. Wells' story has had some liberties taken with it in this version. Again, most who attempt to stand on the shoulders of a great writer (The wretched Planet of the Apes remake comes to mind) stumble futilely. In this case, there is a deeper message than the original story. The latter part of the movie drags a little bit before getting to that crux, but it's worth it. As a product of the times, H.G. Wells apparently sought out to write a story colorfully in order to voice his grievances against the inevitable idiocies of war. That message seems to still be an important one, but this movie goes beyond that and says something about the human spirit, and a thought-provoking perspective that makes fate, not just war, an inevitable result of the limitations of our own consciousness.There are also things which are done better in the original of course. This version gives the future a little bit too much hope, and strays further from the original story than the 1960 version did. However, that is just Hollywood's typical smudge...the story is still poignant. The soundtrack is also very good.One thing it could do without are a few line gimmicks like referencing Einstein just to illustrate the time traveler's intelligence...but again, this is minute enough a detail that it is simply amusing and just shows the script was written dumbed down a little throughout, which is typical.This remake is an exception because it adds something good to the original, making them very similar, yet very different, such that both movies are compliments of each other. The only other that I've seen do this is The Parent Trap (in my opinion anyhoo).",The Time Machine
300,mrcornel,"""nice suit...very retro""",8,9 March 2002,"Well, I saw The Time Machine (2002).The movie is 1 hour 36 minutes, and judging from how rushed the ending felt, I have a feeling that there was a whole lot cut from the film which we may end up seeing as ""deleted scenes"" on a future DVD.The special effects were surprisingly understated. Some people were complaining that the FX sucked, but I thought they chose wisely not to overuse the CGI and it showed. The time-lapse CGI was quite excellent I thought. Most everything else seemed to have been done with animatronics.The plot bears rather little resemblance to H.G. Wells's novel really. Judging from the fact that Simon Wells (H.G.'s great-grandson) directed it, I'd imagine it was a conscious effort not to merely ""remake"" The Time Machine but to update it for a modern audience. Whether that suits your tastes is debatable, but I haven't seen the 1960's George Pal ""horror"" version so I don't have a basis for comparison to the first film.Guy Pearce does a good job running around through the action scenes without bugging his eyes out too much, and the camera sometimes lingers on him while he emotes reasonably effectively. Samantha Mumba doesn't actually have that much to say. The best character I thought was Orlando Jones (the ""7-UP guy"") as a prissy librarian AI who serves to move the plot along by telling Guy Pearce stuff about whatever age he's in. Jeremy Irons looks like someone took a rubber spinal cord from a skeleton, painted it purple, and stuck it on his back, but he brings a sort of pained resignation to the villain character, the ""Uber-Morlock"" (who isn't referred to by name at all in the film).The pacing of the movie was good, and for his directorial debut Simon Wells seemed to understand how to frame shots and use wide-angle photography effectively. Sometimes the camera gets all shaky during scenes when characters are running, this I thought was the only thing that bugged me about the direction. The film benefits from imaginative set design: the future New York in 2030, the Eloi cliff village, and the Morlock lair all looked pretty damn cool.Overall, I thought the film was a little vapid, and sometimes the pseudoscience just becomes preposterous. For example, how the hell does the time machine manage to always stay rooted to the same spot, even though it's conceivable that the landscape could have changed enough that it might reappear 3 miles up in the air, or 3 miles underground? How is it that when it reappears it always seems to be tucked into a nice little alley, like in 2030 New York? Why don't passerby pay any attention when Guy Pearce just appears in a blinding flash of light in 2030? How the hell does English get preserved in an exactly intelligible form for 800,000 years when all the Eloi seem to have is concrete bits of storefronts and statue plaques? How does the Orlando Jones librarian computer get power for 800,000 years? And finally, when the time machine ""blows up"" at the end why does it only vaporize the Morlocks in their lair and nothing else?Overall, The Time Machine (2002) was a fun movie, but I thought it could have benefited from being a bit longer and rushing from place to place. The plot is shot full of holes, but that's to be expected from a movie that involves a guy traveling through time in a steam engine machine built in the 1860's. The acting was decent, and for once there aren't any annoying one-liners every couple of minutes. Pop culture references abound, but aren't too distracting, with the exception of the Orlando Jones librarian wishing Guy Pearce to ""live long and prosper"" (cringe) and walking away to the sound of a Star Trek door opening (cringe again).Rating: *** out of **** (3/4)",The Time Machine

I especially enjoyed the sense of loss and time that sometimes permeates... bittersweet on the plus side.,The Time Machine

But this movie just had me shaking my head the entire time.  The special effects were decent but not great.  The characters were not at all sympathetic which made it really hard to care at all what happened to them.  And poor Jeremy Irons, a great actor reduced to a freak with his spine and brain sticking out. The only likeable thing about this movie was Orlando Jones.  I cared more what happened to his computer being than I did the humans in the movie.  Please don't waste you money on this one.  You'd be much better served to wait for it to come out on video.",The Time Machine
307,f-w-taylor,"Great, at the second watching",8,6 January 2010,"I saw this at the cinema when it was released and thought it disappointing. Like others, I remembered my love for the HG Wells novel, and the brilliant 1960 George Pal interpretation. But, 8 years on, I watched it again on TV and was much more impressed. There was a lot more homage to Wells and Pal than I detected the first time,even a cameo by Alan Young who was so good as Philby back then, and the performances and effects now seemed super too. Jeremy Irons is always great, but this was might actually be his finest achievement - not the makeup, certainly, but the way he turned a rather hokey role into a masterful requiem for the human race. No other living actor could have done as well and this time around I found it very moving. Samantha Mumba spoke for humanity in an entirely different way, and almost made me forget how fetching Yvette Mimeux was in 1960. Guy Pierce I felt wasn't right; maybe it was just that he reminds me too much of Cliff Richard, or perhaps it was the fact that Rod Taylor was so perfect in the role. The plot was fairly true to Wells in spirit, except for the contrived ending with no scientific or even pseudo-scientific basis for the way jamming the machine produced a convenient time warp that wipes out the Morlocks. I'm not usually so fickle, but what would have been a 2 or 3 rating eight years ago is now an 8 for me. Mind, you, much of the credit goes to Wells, the greatest visionary the world has ever known.",The Time Machine

310,DocRedfield,Those not taking the time to see this are missing out...,9,12 March 2002,"With all the advertising for this film there really wasn't a LOT of people in the theatre tonight when I finally got to see the new film version of H.G. Wells 'The Time Machine' (we saw the actual time machine prop and many design and behind the scenes pics last AUGUST of 2001 at the San Diego ComiCon), and anyone who ignored those ads missed out; this movie was a lot of fun and had some very engaging themes and ideas to boot.  While it may fall short a tad on some levels  it still had some great sci fi ideals seasoned in here and there, and the themes running through it were strong. It is typical of modern blockbusters in its adventure, but then it also has touching moments of reflection (Alexandre, the time traveler's, ""what if"" moment where he 'puts aside' designs for the Time Machine to be with a family) or startling imagery that is either beautiful (the Eloi homes) or disturbing (the cracked moon).  And it all begins with some gorgeous and insightful victoriana.  The morlocks, which looked all-too CGI in the trailers were instead mostly quite creepy Stan Winston animatronics, and Jeremy Irons as the ubermorlock was cold and freaky.  The themes that carry along in the film are pushed home by a wonderful score, Guy Pearce is cool as always, Samantha Mumba is hot, and Simon Wells (H.G.'s great grandson) direction is visually driven by the design and effects work.  There are some cool George Pal (Original TM film version director, as well as War or The Worlds) nods, and some interesting ideas and characters, notably the Computer Librarian Hologram, as played by Orlando Jones, who reflects on 800,000 years of solitude to a man who simply zipped right through it in his machine.  You almost wish you could have seen more of the machine, or the travels, or the characters here and there, but for what this version is trying to be, I think it works throughout, and that H.G. would be proud.",The Time Machine

Pearce's performance seems overwhelmed by all that is going on around him, but Orlando Jones is delightful as a virtual repository of all human knowledge, pop singer Samantha Mumba has a strong, sweet presence as the Eloi teacher who befriends Alexander, and Jeremy Irons is shiver- evil as the creature who prizes his own survival above everything.",The Time Machine

Pearce's performance is genuine and warming, the story is very watchable on screen accompanied by a beautifully natural score.This film is not and never will be one of the greats, but it doesn't try to be.

This film lacks explanation (Did this time machine get its power by solar energy, or something else?), but the whole film seems okay to me, I rate it 7/10.

In many of the earlier scenes, the professor is caught in a profile shot and, with his scrubby beard and jutting jaw line, seriously looks like a Neanderthal! Excellent irony!This movie many have not done well at the box office because folks these days are not as well read. They seem to have been expecting some great NEW story, not realising that the film is based on a story that is just a tad over 100 years old (first written by H.G.Wells in 1895), though this time through it has an interesting twist on things. Instead of building a time machine to prove a mathematical point (that time is just like space) the effort is spurred on by a need to 'fix' the past.. to recover a lost love.
Unfortunately even THIS effort isn't handled very well. After saving her life once, only to lose her in a slightly different way, he gives up! If he were really so obsessed as to spend over four years building this thing, why would he quit after ONE failure?Other than this new twist, the film differs from the book in that there is no return to the 'present' time. His philosophical bent on the search for science drives him to return, to present his arguments, to try to convince fellow scientists and contemporary thinkers, yet in the end realises that it is only HE that understands, and so, looking for further knowledge, heads out.. apparently to never return, though always in control.",The Time Machine

322,DrNorton,A good movie made...worse?,3,11 March 2002,"(MINOR SPOILERS)I saw a press screening of this new version of the 1960 classic Sci-fi of the same name. I have to admit, just as I walked into the new version of (also 1960) ""Ocean's 11"" I kept thinking ""Why make a new version of a movie that's already made great?"". Coming out from ""Ocean's 11"" I felt that the original was better, coming out from ""The Time Machine"" I...had almost the same feeling.I'm not going to talk about the original any more than that. I can't remember it good enough to compare the two, but I'm definitely going to try to get it and see it again to see if I remember it correctly as a better movie than the new version.Basically, the storyline is about the scientist Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) in the end of the 19:th century that loses his fiancée in a robbery turned murder. Obsessed with this, he tries to build a time machine - and after 4 years he manages. Going back in time to save the girl, all that happens is that she's killed in a different way. Instead of going back to his own time, Alexander decides to travel into the future to try to find out why he can't change the past, at least not the fundemental things (people dying for example).Alexander travels into a bright and technical future, where he runs into a computer (Orlando Jones) who defines time travel as science fiction. Then, something goes terribly wrong and Alexander is knocked out while travelling and ends up some 800 000 years into the future. This world is nothing like the one we know, but man has gone back to the state we were long before the Egyptians built pyramids...I'd like to think that the biggest enjoyment in this film are the two famous actors who are least seen on screen; Jeremy Irons and Orlando Jones. Had they been given more space, hade the script been a bit stronger and maybe changed a bit more from the original, this might actually have been a really good movie experience. Now, however, it's just another decent sci-fi flick that will probably go away as just that.I'd give it 5/10 at most.",The Time Machine

325,Mashtoque,"Terrible, but Perfect",8,9 March 2002,"I agree with most of the things people have trashed this movie for.  The script was laughable, the acting for the most part wooden (someone should tell Pearce that acting doesn't consist of shaking some small child when trying to emphasize your point), the intentional jokes were terrible (except for one by Jones), there were more holes in the plot than one could imagine was possible in under two hours, and to add one insult of my own, the special effects were not that good.  The Morlocks moved like jerky wolves.What no one seems to realize was that this is what made the movie great scifi!  I was laughing through the whole thing at how bad it was, and when it was over this movie made you think to try and explain the gaping tears in the plot.  This is a perfect example of what bad scifi should be.  It doesn't need good actors (with the notable exception of Jeremey Irons, who was simply fantastic), it doesn't need a good script.  It should keep you interested while you're in the theater with action and special effects, and should leave room for interpretation.Now, I can't resist a little comparison between this version and the book. Sad to say, this was a more realistic version than the book.  It was that old purist scifi in which there are no characters, just types.  It even went so far as only the woman (Mumba in this movie) had a name, the other characters were 'the Traveller' or 'the Doctor'.  I wouldn't waste your time reading it; I found it almost as tiresome as it was pretentious.  I was so glad to see that in this movie the Eloi had actual lives and art and were able to do things for themselves.  I only wish we had seen something of the Morlock culture.All that said, I had tons of fun with this movie, but I would not recommend it to people who don't enjoy bad action movies or old scifi B-movies.",The Time Machine

327,SandyFury,Very disappointing...,2,17 March 2002,"Normally, I don't go out of my way to see remakes but I figured the Time Machine promised some really great special effects.Since it is a Warner Bros./Dreamworks picture I didn't think I would be disappointed. Boy, was I wrong.Where were the special effects??? A couple of vines growing on the glass? Blah! Extremely disappointing! It got a little better when he goes to the far future I at least thought to myself what a pleasant screensaver that would make.And just who thought up this weak storyline? In the original movie there were many little time vignettes, he went back, he went further back, he went forward, forward, etc... In this version I felt completely ripped off. One half-baked story that was more from a Ray Bradbury story I remember reading about the night and day people than the H.G. Wells story I paid to see.Sure, it doesn't take a genius to figure out you can't go back and change the past to save you're beloved but wouldn't you at least try more than once? If all the scientists in the world gave up after only trying something once instead of trying to change the circumstances then we'd be as pathetic a race as the ones in this story.I had read some review on IMDB before going to see the film that had said Jeremy Irons only had one scene but that it was great. Dressed up as a drag queen/ marilyn manson look alike in an old Billy Idol outfit with some fins is not my idea of a great scene. The special effects when he dies were probably the most exciting of the movie.I normally pride myself on being one of those people who ""gets it"" even when most people are still sitting around saying ""I don't get it"" well today I Don't Get IT! What was the point? What was the answer to the question? How did blowing up the Time Machine in that one location fix everything when Irons had already said there were many pockets of his kind (didn't he?). What was his connection to Irons? I got the feeling there was some great revelation they were unraveling there but I just didn't get it. OK and The futuristic folk living on the cliffs... WHY? Sure it looked pretty but why...The movie showed some promise when Pearce first arrives in the future, the moon colonies, and the only worthwhile save for the picture (if there can be one)...

Maybe I'll go read the book now. I never saw the 60's version so this won't be a comparison review.We're not talking Oscar quality here, unless for a technical catagory or perhaps for Samantha Mumba and Jeremy Irons (except his appearance was too brief).The movie felt like it was a touched by Mary Shelly's Frankenstein (the novel), with less emphasis on madness or morality, rather more about Possibility as an archetype. The main character did something that was impossible -- travel back and forth in time, and yet there is at no point in the film when someone goes... ""Wow! A Time Traveller!"". You'd think it a necessity in a time travel film, to have someone marvel over it! Yet every character just took for granted that there was a time traveller in their midst.I did enjoy the thought of going so far into the future. 800 000 years is far enough to give an idea of what happened to humanity. The Moon catastrophe was well played and brief (so it was not overdone... it was just right). I think the special effects were amazing. The models for the Morlocks were suspiciously close to a combination between a body builder (The Hulk) and an alien (not ET but Xfiles), which presented a mood unlike most sci fi baddies. I liked the bad guys. :)Irons restored himself (from AD&D the mishap.. er movie). As Uber Morlock, he played an evolved predator with psionics. It was a cameo that was just right. Irons portrayed humanity at its finest, that human condition of self-denigration and deliberate hypocrisy. I thought Irons was monstrous without being a monster, although he looked the part. He was electric in the role.Guy Pearce played a perfect time traveller. He handled the whole experience as he should, except they did not show him letting go of his fiancé, which was required and missing. More motivation for his behaviour would have fit better.The best actor in the film was Samantha Mumba, in my humble opinion. She really played the role of Mara well and she manages to bridge the gap between the ancient society Alexander is from and the tribal cliff dwellers at present. If there is a reason for Alexander to remain in the future, it would be to get more of Samantha Mumba's fine drama and pleasant discourse.The photonic library character played by Orlando Jones was just cool. He played it well. They didn't mention too much about how a computer could stay running for 800 000 years, but maybe the OS was not made by Microsoft.Bottom line: see it.",The Time Machine

Guy Pearce does a great job portraying the time traveller, and although there is no Uber-Morlock in the book or the 1960 movie, it adds some life to this already action-packed film.

However, I can still say that I had been expecting more from this film. The story is as follows. A scientist in Manhattan, after the death of his love, builds a time machine in order to save her life. However, he finds this impossible, and accidentally travels 800,000 years into the future, where the human race has split into two: the Eloi, and the predatory, subterranean Morlocks. Overall, if you haven't read the book, you will probably enjoy the film. For the readers: The seemingly Utopian life and childish playfulness and naiveté of the Eloi; the subtlety and terror of the Morlocks; the hero's affection for the young, innocent Weena (and his fight to protect her from the Morlocks); the hero's unrevealed identity and life; and the ambiguity of the whole story, have all but been left out. And, although Hollywood has managed to put in at least some philosophy (very meager in comparison to written science fiction, but amazing for the American film market), the typical recurring romances and shock-value clichés, are all in place.On a happier note, the soundtrack is amazingly beautiful in places. And the shot of the moon breaking up is truly one of the most chillingly, disturbingly beautiful (if not entirely scientifically plausible) I have ever seen in the cinema.

For those of you who did not like it, I have to ask, what were you expecting?  For once go to see a movie, for what it is.  ""ITS JUST A MOVIE"". So what, if it doesn't explain all the fundamental causality issues that are inherit to time travel movies, I'm glad it didn't.  I went in to see a special effect movie with some decent action, which is exactly what it was. SPOILER...The movie also explored some different doomsday scenarios (the Moon disaster) that to my knowledge has never been done before, it was different and in movies today anything different is good.  But then again I'm living in a world where Moulin Rouge is nominated for best picture, I guess people can't distinguish between entertainment and crap.

342,lawfullisle,Interesting but unforgivably flawed (spoilers),5,25 January 2020,"Fine acting, fine effects for its time and budget.The most significant achievement of this movie is its theme about human ambition. Ambition is what allowed man to proliferate the earth, what doomed man and the earth, and what saves the new race of men.The unforgivable flaw is its inconsistent stance on time travel. Time is relative to each individual. He could not save his love, because in his timeline she died, and he would never have gone back to save her if she lived. Of course, there is nothing in this movie hinting at the possibility of alternative universes. The villain gives the correct answer for this universe, that he cannot change the past because he would not go back in the past to change it otherwise.However, at the end of the movie, he zooms in the future and sees the doomsday scenario that happens, and he goes back in time to ""change the future."" Again, this would be changing the past relative to his own timeline, because he had already lived in that future, going back in time would STILL be changing the past. Seeing the doomsday scenario is what drove him to go back in the past. If he went in the future at that moment and saw a hopeful future caused by his returning to the past, he could just stay there and never go back in the past, thus never causing that hopeful future. It's a paradox that the movie does not handle well. He should have gone back in time all the way and lived the best he could knowing everything was doomed or have gone back in time to try to save this new race and fail. Or even better, he goes to the future and instead of fire and brimstone, his legacy of fight and ambition has driven the new humans to conquer the underground race and spread throughout the world, so he stays there to see the dawn of a new age.",The Time Machine

This movie had nary a dull moment and I appreciated it for what it was instead of wishing it was like the book or the 1960 version (personally I didn't enjoy the Pal version as much as some sci fi geeks did, but that's me, everybody's different). Guy Pearce threw himself into this role and gave it all he has as usual. The man really works to entertain. Samantha Mumba did well in her first outing! You go, girl! I like Sienna Guillory too. Simon Wells put forth a good effort with this movie and I want to give him credit. There were some scenes you could tell had been cut but overall the movie zipped by them and you found yourself hit with another beautiful visual effect again before you really missed the scene. The moon scene was totally beautiful. Whoever did that should get a lot of credit, it was awesome!What worked for me was the emotional story of it, how he tried to change the past and discovered he couldn't yet he was able to see that the future could still hold a beautiful promise for him. A very good message and lesson for all of us. Stop wishing for what you can't change and make the best of where you are. For that reason alone I would love this movie.",The Time Machine

He would be shaking in his tomb if he ever saw this stupid movie.It totally destroyed my imagination on what the Morlocks looked like, and if I may say so, this movie has the worst character/monster design I have ever seen.  The Morlocks have less articulation on their faces than the characters in the Jim Henson Movie ""Laberinth"".  It""s pathetic.  My question is, where the hell did all the money go to when doing this film.  Two big studios behind it and the special effects shots are awfull.  You can tell when it's a CG shot or a matte Painting.  The adaptation to the screen is awfull, and it makes the movie shallow when that's the opposite of what Wells tried to convey in his novel. The soudtrack is terrible and it doesn't go with the story.  It sounded more like if I was seeing The Lion King because of the happy music.  The only reason I'm giving it a second star is because the effects used to show the passing of time was pretty good.  But the rest sucked.  Especially Jeremy Irons' acting.

We're all adults - we don't need to be coddled with a consistent mood. Why should a movie that starts whimsical and amusing have to stay that way? It wouldn't have made sense to have the initial 19th century episode scary and full of foreboding. And there wouldn't have been the same shock value when the Morlocks finally did appear. It's not like the movie was continually shuttling back and forth between light-hearted and horrific. So bollocks to the critics who claim not to be impressed. They tend to find fault with populist studio films, anyway. I say some movies have too much going on in plot, set design, and special effects to be brought down by 'uneven tone'.

To emphasise that he's both learned and special, the movie spends the first 10-15 minutes bludgeoning you with inventions and references (such as Alex's correspondence with Einstein, ignoring the fact Einstein was still in Zurich university in 1899 and wouldn't become a patent clerk until 1902).* Spoiler bits * Then the hero's love interest dies, and he spends years obsessing over her. Naturally, the time machine comes out of this.  After that we get some nice special effects, and meet Orlando Jones, and then are flung into the far future.  The far future, though, seems to be in danger.  Alexander forgets immediately his private quest to save his fiance which has driven him for 4 years, and settles in to do some hero work.  The only problem is that, being a time machine movie, Alex avoids the most obvious solution to the problem of the far future -- changing the near future.* End spoiler bits *A short, average hollywood movie with a larger than average plot-hole and reality-inconsistency ratio.

The critics also gave Count of Monte Cristo a bad rating, but i also enjoyed that. (and they gave Gosford Park, a movie which was BO-RING but had an voyeuristic type approach to giving the audience a view of ""the basement"" and the ""main floor"" people, but in essence was a very boring movie.

351,snowling,Fun filled cheese-o-rama!,7,11 June 2002,"Having read the original Time Machine [okay, just the abridged version but hey, I'm pretty sure it stuck close to the original] I ignored the critics' warning of the movie and went to see it anyway. My conclusion is that if I hadn't read the book, I would have loved the movie [I'm easily pleased] but since I have - I was pretty disappointed and kept screaming ""That wasn't in the book!"" at the screen. Usually, in most film adaptations, parts of the book are cut out to shorten it.In ""The Time Machine"", the opposite happens - most of the movie wasn't actually in the book, so that the only thing retained was the very loose plot. For example, the main hero had no name and was just called ""The Time Traveller"". He also had no fiancee. The Eloi were completed change - instead of being short, pale, blond looking people, they resembled some kind of African tribe, with Samantha Mumba's character being the unofficial leader [also managing to get her brother a part too]. Another important point that I could understand was ignored was that none of the Eloi could speak English. Also, in the book they were child-like, and lived in ruins [not demolished by a meteor shower as invented for the movie] because mankind had grown weak due to the lack of war, famine and disease, and only the arts had survived.However, those were only minor changes which didn't really matter so much. The change I found the most ridiculous was the addition of Jeremy Irons' character, the ""telepathic"" Morlock which I just found pointless and made him look like some kind of albino drag queen. Him being pathetic, was enough to make me scream ""Tack-o-rama!""However, some additions were good - I enjoyed the part with Orlando Jones as the holographic librarian, and a glimpse of the world in the future. However [this is my favorite word!] I thought that ending was a little hard to understand for those who had not read the book and know that by travelling through time, you do not actually physically move - therefore Alex's time machine located 800,000 years into the future would be in exactly the same place as it was to start with.In all, I did think that this was a pretty good film, with the usual mind-blowing effects and all. But I found it just too short, so that a few of the book's elements [i.e. the dinner party] could have been included.

The acting is passable and the plot is not overly taxing, a man invents a time machine to try and return to the moment his girlfriend dies to try and save her. Along the way he ends up in the extreme future where there are 2 types of humans, the good guys on the land and the baddies under it. The baddies herd  the good guys and take the hero's new girlfriend! damn. so off he goes to find her and ends up finding his meaning in life.

355,paulosnic,Equals the 1960 version: A worthy remake!,8,11 October 2010,"This is a review by someone who has seen this version of the Time Machine before he saw the earlier (original version). Well, both are good and there is no ""better"" in my opinion. However this version IS better in terms of scenery and visuals. Sound effects are also more in accordance with today's standards.The stories themselves are also different, in two aspects: a) This is more of a love story(-ies) and less of a social criticism story, although it does include the same allegories that the first did, but in a slightly more subtle tone. b) This time the Eloi look much more like the the Avatar's race in character and lifestyle rather than blonde-blue-eyed people in factory/school uniforms.I believe that the younger folks will prefer this version while the older folks will prefer the previous one. That is mostly because this version is faster paced and the characters look, behave and talk more like today's people do and also the ideas that are implied throughout are more relevant by todays standards. Simply put, Samantha Mumba is more likely to attract this generation's men, while Yvette Mimieux is more likely to attract the previous generations. Sienna Guillory on the other hand, reconciles all generations :PPS. The original version getting 2 more points in rating I think is attributed to the originality rather than the superiority of the original. So choose according to your age!",The Time Machine

358,bloodthirstyaction,I remember seeing the preview for this as a youngster... then viewed the film as an adult,7,1 April 2010,"like my summary says, I saw this preview as a kid and was absolutely astounded. The effects, the story, the magic... the film looked amazing. Sadly I never had the opportunity to watch this film, I found myself detained to the educational viewings which I was limited to at the time. Despite these educational shows being a positive influence on my life, I WAS BORED! I didn't want muppets or Bill Nye or Disney movies! I wanted action, suspense, and explosions. So 20 years later I reluctantly popped in this worn out disc which I had gotten from the neighborhood Block Buster and what I got... was THE TIME MACHINE. First of all I have one simple issue with this film. The main protagonist, whatever his name was, is a complete loser who spends all his time staring at mathematics and barely sees the life of day; and for some odd reason he is able to score some really hot chick who loves him for ""who he is"" He has this loser friend who he hangs with... he's a real fat dude. kinda pompous. I don't know if McDonalds was around then but the basic existence of this fat pudgy character is reason enough that this restaurant should be avoided. Then there's some crazy old woman he stays with who is delusional or something for letting this whacked up Bill Nye reject stay with her. Nevermind these unimportant undeveloped characters. I don't want to give anything away but basically the random hot chick gets shot. Bill Nye reject draws some weird math formulas and creates this humungous TIME MACHINE. With this machine you can only guess... Bill Nye reject goes back in time. He tries to save her but she gets ran over by a wagon. Eventually Bill Nye reject comes to the conclusion that he can't change the past so he must go into the future... ""makes sense right?"". Now he goes to the future in his TIME MACHINE, and lands in some futuristic cities. So check this out, Bill Nye reject has this big obnoxious time machine in the middle of the street and nobody notices it. Classic. Now he meets this intelligent black hologram who looks like the local stalker who just escaped from prison. The black hologram talks to him about the time travel being impossible so Bill Nye reject goes into the future again to see the moon blowing up. But in the midst of danger he is able to use THE TIME MACHINE, to escape into an even more futuristic future. Once he arrives here he sees a war between a tarzan village and some creature that look like Demonic Muppets. And trust me, these suckers could swallow up Big Bird in one bite. He fights them gets the tarzan chick saves the world bada bing bada boom. Now here is the best part of the movie... we go back to the past and see the fat dude and the old woman talking about how long he has been gone. Bill Nye reject has been gone about a year and they act like he just left yesterday. COME ONE FAT DUDE DON""T YOU CARE ABOUT SOMETHING BESIDE YOUR DONUTS! If you had been nicer to Bill Nye reject he could have transported you to the present so you can have a Crispy Creme donut. But NOOOOOOO! So the sum this film up what can I say... it wasn't the explosive thrill ride with twists and turns that I had expected it to be when I was young, but it was still a solid good time which brought the child back in me. Well actually it kind of ruined my image of Bill Nye, the muppets, and basically every Disney movie I saw as a youth. But whatever! So if you ever have time and it's rainy outside and you don't have a girlfriend/ life or you're just simply too much of a failure to get out of the house.... pop on the pop corn maker sit back relax and hitch a ride on THE TIME MACHINE!",The Time Machine
359,johnsmart,Brilliant!,8,8 April 2021,"This film perfectly fixes H. G. Well's uber-pessimistic novel. Wells was always of two minds about the future, one pessimistic, one optimistic. As he got older, the pessimism increasingly won out. I still can't forget the silly ""devolution"" of organic complexity at the end of Well's novel. It is so contrary to how nature actually works.This was directed by Simon Wells, H. G. Wells great grandson. So proud of him for having the courage to fix so many of the plot holes and issues with the novel. This is not only by far the best Time Machine film, it is by far the best story. The writing, music, sets, and visuals all shine in this film. I can understand why it didn't triple its budget at the box office like typical Hollywood shlock. This movie is too cerebral for most folks to really like it. It perfectly balances the emotional-relationship and technical-logical urges of humanity.Perhaps to satisfy the bean counters with a shorter un time, or because some silly person thought it was too slow or too cerebral, they cut out this lovely 6 minute opening scene: youtube.com/watch?v=fLRiJm...They clearly should have left it in, as it conveys the unbounded joy of science, and greatly deepens the meaning of the film and the face-off with the Uber-Morlock at the end. I recommend watching it first, then the movie.Two Spoilers:It was brilliant that Hartdegen could not change the past. I'd love to have seen him figure out why that was, at the very end. Perhaps in couple sentences of conversation with Vox. It could have gone something like: ""If I've learned one thing, it's that mind and love are more powerful than matter and logic."" If we can't change what happens to people in the past, maybe we'll learn to value them more."" It would also have been clever if Emma had just disappeared at the appropriate time. No silly carriage accident. Just... vanishing, to everyone's surprise. That would be even more mysterious and logical at the same time. Hartdegen would have been no less interested in finding the ""solution.""To make 800,000 years of tech devolution plausible, they could have used *antimatter bomb invention* and terrorist use of it to explain the Moon destruction, and the persistent Earthquakes on Earth afterward. The easy production of antimatter,, should humans acquire that capability, say, via some access to zero point energy production, would be the most destructive thing that science might deliver to our species in the imaginable near-future. Just read David Langford's War in 2080 if you want the frightening details. Thankfully, it looks very unlikely that violent primates like us will have access to that kind of energy in the foreseeable future. All the Uber-Morlock would have had to say was that his world was the result of ""your mindless pursuit of technology for its own sake."" Hartdegen could then have countered ""Don't you see? You have made a hell in response.""This is a lovely film, with a truly satisfying ending. Vox reading Twain's Huck Finn was a perfect ending as well.

372,martin-kirf,A great Movie,10,3 October 2006,"I think, ""The Time Machine"" is one of the best Movies ever made. Guy Pearce plays his character very good and understandable.The Movie is not just a Story about Time Travel - it is also a Story about humanity and the questions about ourselves and possibly a question that most people has asked to themselves at least once in their lifetime: Wat if?The Movie and the Work of Simon Wells are a grate retell of H.G. Wells original Movie from 1960. The characters are good and the special effects are great. And the Time Machine itself looks very real.I think many people would react like Alexander in the story, when they've lose somebody they love. Perhaps, not quite in the same way - building a time machine - but as a viewer of the movie, you can understand the thoughts of Alexander.",The Time Machine
373,roozle,Surprised by the reviews,9,18 March 2002,"I must say that I am very surprised that this movie is geting eaten alive by reviewers.  I'm not so surprised by the imdb bad reviews, but that's another story.  This version of the Time Machine was excellent.  I liked how it kept closer to the book than the original movie.  More importantly, I felt that it was simply a cool protrayal of the idea of time travel.  I like all sci-fi, even bad sci-fi, but I felt this movie was a 9.Don't take this rating as an indication that I like all remakes.  I felt that the new Planet of the Apes movie was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.The new Time Machine movie explores some of the age-old time travel dillemas, it has suspense, romance, drama, cool sci-fi, great special effects, horror (?) and isn't overly long (96 minutes).  If you like time travel or science fiction movies, this is a must see in the theatre as opposed to vhs or dvd.  Just look past the bad reviews from posts on this site and go see it.",The Time Machine
374,Electra Girl,The critics are lost in the bushes...,8,12 March 2002,"I read the book prior to, but on the same day as I went to see the film. I'd been hearing bad reviews throughout the week, but regardless, found myself somewhat interested and looking forward to it for the most part.Obviously, I didn't expect it to be bad, but I also didn't expect it to be more than it was (a fun, sci-fi, adventure-drama) and therefore do not have a vat of disappointed expectations to overwhelm and beat you over the head with with. Terribly sorry about that (and the sarcasm ends here).In any case, I rue the fact that all those who seemingly worship the original H.G. Wells tale are forcing me to argue it's faults, but *seriously.* The book itself wasn't nearly as spectacular as everyone likes to make it out to be. I certainly give the man a whopping load of credit for his vision and creativity at the time, but come *on.*The novel wasn't really even a novel, it was more like a novelette. If you think 90 minutes is short, try 78 pages. Interesting, truly, but hello(!) character development, hello(!) relationships and warmth. I would've welcomed perhaps a little less emphasis on the parlor chat and a little more on what resulted from the `practical application' of all that was discussed. For crying out loud! I would've welcomed a few more actual character names. The beginning was intriguing, the middle seemed sterile and the end felt rushed. I appreciate the quality of inspiration he must have had to come up with such a concept, but the novel itself seemed more a vessel to exhibit said concept and less an actual story.Personally I find anything unjust (whether I'm personally affected or no) absolutely *beyond* frustrating, and so you can imagine how I felt after reading some of these painstakingly crafted, thoroughly undeserved and remarkably grandiloquent reviews.The film was pretty true to the original story and I found it's deviations and expansion quite surprising and welcome. Guy Pierce did well. I was pleasantly surprised with Samantha Mumba's efforts, and don't even get me started on Jeremy Irons. I'm serious. Just don't. *Sigh,* okay, just one word: Mesmerizing. The Morlocks were accurate and creepy as hell and I loved the seamless use of established and newer varieties of special effects. I've always found animatronics and make-up (when done well) far more impressive and effective than CGI, but I very much appreciated how the latter was utilized during the chase and time travel sequences.The story was good. The acting ranged from good to great. The special effects were impressive and Klaus Badelt did a lovely job with an, at times, quite moving score. In my view, the timing felt just right. So basically, I had a rockin' good time ;-) It's exciting, it's fun and, on the whole, quite impressively done. Yay movie!",The Time Machine
375,ippolito-abelli,A worthy message from 21st century WELLS!,10,22 May 2021,"Only a director grandson of H. G. Wells could turn the ending of The Time Machine of 1894, a masterpiece of science fiction literature, into a positive one.Three different centuries separate us from the novel, pessimistic about mankind, about social oppression, but prophetic of the revolutions that would soon fall - with WW1 and WW2!The message of the descendant, director Simon Wells, is instead the capacity of mankind for harmonious integration.This, for example, underlines the black interpreters for key characters, such as the librarian Vox the virtual photonic unit, played by a magnetic Orlando Jones, and his girlfriend in the year 802701 AD, played by Samantha Mumba.The sinister Morlocs will be defeated and the inept Eloi will recover humanity, that is, the ability to fight with one's own strength.The desire to control our destiny is the key to The Time Machine, it seems to explain the perfidious and fascinating leader of the Morlocs to the time-traveling protagonist.But if the past cannot be changed - and we are a troubled fruit of it - the power to change the future still remains only in us.A worthy message from 21st century WELLS.",The Time Machine

The early film I can still recall, and I must have had nightmares for weeks being only about 10 years old when I had to escape images of Morlocks.The movie offers for a thinking person a philosophical edge toward speculation of time travel. Being a Star Trek fan, it is easy to get into logical paradoxes regarding time itself.

Enough changes to the original story to make it interesting and not repetitive of former renditions on film. The special effects were good, but not spectacular. The story line had some interesting twists. As an avid H.G. Wells fan I would endorse the updated story-line to bring the story so far into the future. The explanation of man's destruction being caused by construction (blasting) on the moon is original. An intelligent Morlock leader was a bit of a stretch to the original story-line, but given the overall modernization of the screenplay, it does work. The ""librarian"" surviving the holocaust is a thought provoking idea.",The Time Machine

Spoilers ahead.I had been looking forward to this film for a long time and managed to not read a single review before I saw on the opening night. I think I would have gone to see it even if I had read the reviews I have read now but I agree with many of them that says that this was not a very successful interpretation of H. G. Wells' book.The file was very fragmented and illogical in my mind. I liked the first third and was impressed with the special effects then. The rest of the film did not do it for me. The acting left much to be desired except for Irons as the Über-morlock. How could the time machine affect the bad guys only? How could it affect them at all since in the beginning only the person in the machine travels in time? The special effects in the end where as impressive as in the beginning but could not help salvage the film.I haven't read the book and its possible that I would have understood more of why Hartdegen did what he did and other things as well, if I had read the book but as it was this film did not make a lot of sense to me.",The Time Machine

384,Neosatan,Not bad at all,5,6 April 2002,"Saw this movie on its premier here in Norway, rather poor turn up, but the film didn't let us down too much.The film is based H.G. Wells famous novel and the story is quite familiar. Scientist invents time machine; scientist goes into the future, far into the future and discovers some disturbing truths. The scientist encounters the Elois and later the Morlocks and so on.The film doesn't follow the book very tightly, but the main idea is still there. To not bother you with too much detail, I thought the cast did pretty well. Guy Pearce stars as the scientist, Samantha Mumba the sweet Eloi female he encounters and Jeremy Irons (overplays, again) as the main bad guy.  Note however that Orlando Jones does a marvellous roll as the computer Vox #NY-114, somewhat of a comic relief in the movie.The effects are rather good, especially the time travelling sequences. The time machine itself seems pretty convincing as a machine that real can travel through time. The film is rather short, something it suffers from at the end. As the first half hour or so in the start is rather amusing, the ending is rather quick and snappy. I would give it a seven out of ten, If you like sci-fi you ought to watch this film.",The Time Machine
385,mars4muse,Imaginative rendering,7,11 March 2002,"Warning! May contain spoilers!My wife and I found this version of The Time Machine to be entertaining, imaginative, and thought provoking. If I had only one criticism, it would be that the film felt as if it's makers were trying to fit too much into too little time (no pun intended). Each major plot twist or ""future"" was only flirted with and not expanded upon as I had hoped for or expected. This is not to mention the fact that nothing was explored in the 20th century as in the '60's film. Our time traveler made not a pit stop in even our own time, let alone other key periods prior to 2040, and that one barely elicited a blink in the scheme of things. His extended stop in the distant future could also have been explored with more detail, if only to allow for some additional character development.In spite of all this, I found the film engrossing enough to keep my attention and interest for it's entire duration, if only leaving me wanting more. Unlike other users I've read, I was very impressed with the special effects and felt them to be done in a way to enhance an imaginative story line rather than being over done as a means to make up for a flimsy script or plot as in so many other movies made these days. I was also very impressed (as was my wife) with the sets and artwork; the 19th century scenes felt like something out of a Currier and Ives painting, and the time machine and scenes surrounding it during it's travels were just short of astounding.As for the Elois, I was struck by the simple, yet seemingly spiritual and passive culture represented in the film. (Loved the festive music added as a ambiance to create the mood and setting.) And the Morlocks were truly ominous and scary enough to get some cardio-vascular response. It is a shame more was not done with the Jeremy Irons character, although in this case I suppose less is more and was certainly a major highlight in the film.
Not only have I seen the original Time Machine, but own it on VHS, as it warrants repeated viewing time and again. But I would not make the mistake of comparing this entry with the original....more like apples and oranges. That being said, I must say that overall I am partial to the 60's version if only by virtue of it's comprehensiveness and focus. It has a better ""flow"" to it not to mention the fact that Rod Taylor was (in my opinion) in another league as an actor compared with Guy Pearce. And where the original may fall short a tad on special effects by comparison, it certainly makes up for that shortcoming with a killer script and impeccable direction. (I saw the original in the theater as a child when it came out but have yet to read H.G.Wells' book.)I definitely recommend this film and would rate it slightly higher than a 7. Sci-fi/fantasy fans should enjoy it especially. And I commend the producers and director for avoiding the commercial pitfalls plagued by most movies these days. This Time Machine felt like more of a creative effort and less ""Hollywood"" and ""hi-tech"". It does take you in, and leaves you with the viewpoint that although we cannot change the past, we can definately make a difference in the creation of a better future.",The Time Machine

388,The Grizzle,I wish I could go back in time to before I saw this movie,1,14 March 2002,"The idea of time travel has long captivated humans, and thus it is natural for us to expect a movie centered around that idea to in some way reflect that fascination we all exhibit.  The Time Machine, however, transforms what should make a rather enjoyable film into a near mockery of the idea itself.The movie's basic premise centers around one man's obsession with time travel and his determination to change the past.  As he attempts to alter his own future, he in turn adversely alters the future of the entire planet as well.  While this, a basic idea faithful to the book, comes off as rather intriguing, the similarities of the movie's plot with that of the book sadly end here, which induces the movie's descent toward absurdity.Alexander, the main character and creator of the time machine, operates amid an atmosphere of intelligence, surrounded by textbooks and chalkboards filled with mathematical equations, yet throughout the course of the movie he displays no sense of intelligence himself.  As his time travel into the future progresses, the conditions in which he finds himself rapidly deteriorate, but he never once considers traveling backwards.  One might think that after the first five or six near-death experiences he faces he might possibly realize that the future isn't improving, yet this simple revelation never once crosses his mind.The various situations Alexander faces are laughable in themselves.  Most ridiculous is the premise of the moon suddenly breaking apart and crashing into the earth, causing widespread panic and death.  Here, Alexander not only lives through this disaster but also chooses to go further into the future.  Although the planet has miraculously been healed from the trillions of tons of rock that have been hurled toward it, for some reason there are only two creatures left alive on the planet.  One is a race of humans that has shown absolutely no affects of evolution over the hundreds of thousands of years Alexander has traveled into the future (some of which speak English, conveniently enough), and the other is a race of ogre-like humanoids that lives under the ground and occasionally surfaces to consume the human race.After a series of unintentionally hilarious fight scenes and the obligatory rescue mission, the movie comes to a close with some weak attempts to allow some sort of theme to transcend.  All that transcends from this movie, however, is a sense of disappointment caused by the lack of care used in throwing together a less than mediocre cash-in on an original.  The moviemakers' greatest fallibilities lie in their apparent need to introduce radically new ideas that simply are over-the-top, detracting from any sort of plot (or lack thereof).  These alterations are as unnecessary as the remake itself, and thus it will be the original that people are still renting in the future.  In short, don't go into the theater expecting to be amazed or moved by The Time Machine;  instead, don't go in at all.",The Time Machine

Rarely do you find that remakes are better than the original, but this one did an enviable job. I rarely listen to the critics, as they have to feed their own egos as well as find some sort of tripe to print in their articles, to get noticed or talked about.  This film was panned by many. No...it was certainly not a masterpiece of film making.

G. Wells.",The Time Machine
391,guilandros,Quite disappointing overall,4,24 April 2002,"When I went to view the remake of the George Pal version of The Time Machine, I went with an open mind, but also with high hopes. Surely the time (sic) which had passed between the classic version and this new one, would have allowed evolution to take its course and to deliver much of what the original merely hinted at. I was to be disappointed.I have claimed that this new version of The Time Machine, is a remake of the George Pal version, rather than a new interpretation of the novella, as I feel that the major influences on this new work to be George Pal's adaptation and the ""sequel"" novel The Time Ships (with its verbal Morlock), rather than the director's grandfather's work.The traveller in both works, I am proud to say, were played by Australians! (Rod Taylor and Guy Pierce). It was also nice to see Alan Young's cameo in the new version.The original Time Machine film by Pal attempted to assume that its audience MAY think about the film. When the machine was exposed to others (ie The Morlocks), it was purloined and the Traveller on all other occasions made sure that he had secured the craft or stayed near it. Pierce's traveller, likes to wander and has little concern for such security.Taylor's traveller only braved The Morlocks when he knew that fire would subdue them. Pierce's traveller has no such knowledge nor reservations about risking his life. One cannot but feel that this is an unlikely flaw.Similarly, he is easily discouraged that he can't change the past. After working for four years on building a machine, he abandons his desire when he fails in the first attempt.There is, in the new version, none of Pal's passion for our sense of responsibility to the planet; the contempt for the martial and ruthless nature of humans, and that saddened me. What was a story of a perceptive individual's desire for utopia, was perverted into a mixed up intergalactic, ""the next girl will do"" pseudo love story.The special effects are good. Mark Addy and Christopher Lee are wonderful. Guy and the wonderful Phylidda Law are good also, but if you have the choice, miss it at the box office and opt for the video.",The Time Machine

The acting was spot on, the special effects were fantastic, and the time machine prop is a work of movie making art. However, when I compare the premise of the movie to the book or even the 1960 movie, I wonder why the story writers felt that some of the finer points of the story had to be changed. I understand that the future world and the destruction of the moon make that part of the story much more relative to today's audiences, but why did they feel that Alexander needed a personal tragedy to push him to create the time machine. Maybe they felt that creating the time machine out of disillusionment with mankind and pure scientific curiosity was too sophisticated for modern audiences.

Thankfully I had a postive surprise in some ways, but was still disapointed in other ways. The effects and visuals are stunning, the acting is ok, and all technical stuff works. The story is also very good. Where I think the movie goes wrong is in the directing. Some scenes really work, others doesn't work at all. The reason some of the scenes don't work are usually because they seemed shortened or chopped up in the editing-process. People move from one place to another without you knowing how they got there. An example is when the main charachter hangs at the top of a very deep hole. The wall seems to have nothing to hang on to except from the stone he hangs from, and it seems like a moment where you should expect him to be saved by something special happening. Yet, one second later they just cut to him having climbed down to the bottom of the whole without explaining why. This movie is full of moments like this. A lot of things are unexplained, and it seems like the editor or director is rushing the movie forwards on a mission to make it as short as possible. But despite all this the movie is worth to rent on DVD or video because of the effects, the action and the story. Don't suspect a masterpiece, but it's well above average mostly thanks to the production values. Hate to think about the fact that in the hans of a more experienced or better director (and/or screenwriter) this could have been a classic.",The Time Machine

405,nickstranger,Annoying garbage,3,8 November 2006,"If you are a fan of general romance and never read this book, you will probably enjoy this. If you are a fan of the book, stick with the George Pal version. Although it was a bit different from the book, it is still the closest and still rules by far. Why is it that movie makers always think that they can make a story better than the original loved material? There were so many great visuals that could have made this version even better than the original 1960 version, but the script was just crap. The whole idea of the book was totally lost. The funniest part is, this movie was exactly what the book warned of. It is so dumbed down that they needed to add a bad love story to make it into an even worse romance novel. The funniest thing is, when they were promoting this movie they were saying, repeatedly, how much closer it was to the book than any other version with some slight updates. Was I a sucker. If that was the case I would have embraced it, but that was a flat out lie. If I had known what this movie was in advance I might have enjoyed it, but the promoters flat out lied and sent my expectations against them. Why they do this, I can only guess. Do they think that no one knows how to read anymore so we will accept whatever they say? That is so insulting. The billions of people who have read it are then expecting that story. Why call it ""The Time Machine"" then? Do as Blade Runner did. Change the name and say ""based on this original work"". This is as much an H. G. Wells story as the hacked War of the Worlds from Spielberg. Although this story was more believable than that garbage was (Spielberg should stick to comedies and cartoons), it was still a huge let down to me and every fan of the book I have talked to who has seen it. All that said, there actually were some really neat things in this. Visually, this was just amazing. Costumes and FX were just stunning. The acting was okay, nothing great but nothing bad. Same with the general direction. The FX crew was just amazing though. The Morlocks were fantastic and what you would expect a devolved to almost cro-magnon race to look like. How the Eloi lived and looked was also very well thought out along with other visions of the future and past. But a pretty picture doesn't make a great movie. The score I gave this was strictly for these pieces. As for the story, I've read better from children who can't make a complete sentence. General Hollywood schlock with no actual value. They need to start finding writers who have mentally passed middle school.",The Time Machine

A lot to enjoy here from the main performances down to the beautiful film score (which really reminds me of the score to the Hopkins thriller,The Edge). The Morlocks are very well done for a 90's pic (Stan 'The Thing' Winston) both realistic and scary and overall there was CGI but not OTT as it is today - bonus!. We watched it as a family and the kids were hooked which I can't always say. Recommended!",The Time Machine
407,lucassteve2012,The book was much better,4,27 March 2012,"Sorry, but there isn't much to say about this bland remake of the HG Wells classic. The acting isn't very convincing, the plot itself is rather thin on the ground and you can't help but feel that the whole thing wasn't so much a film but rather an exercise in special effects and such like.About the only redeeming feature is that fact it's that ""perfect"" length for a Hollywood film. 90 minutes. Once it's all done and dusted, you can't feel as though you've wasted too much time on it.I won't lie - the effects are quite nice but really they're just fancy redoings of what one might see in the classical redoing and this has none of the charm or class that had. It's straight from the cookie-cutter and it shows, in short unless you particularly want to switch your brain off for the better part of 90 minutes, don't bother.",The Time Machine
408,thomas-owen,Thread-bare plot,5,29 March 2012,"""Time Machine"" was your typical, Hollywood sci-fi movie. An inventor creates a machine that allows him to travel back and forth through time. Eventually, he comes to find himself in the distant future, and discovers a people as much in need of guidance as he is in need of a place to fit in. Sadly, Wells feels compelled to add an extraneous and unnecessary storyline concerning repeated trips into the past to save a young woman from dying. Not only does it add nothing to the story, it serves to highlight the paradoxical nature of the central theme. Ask anyone who has written or filmed a time travel story, and they will tell you that if there is one thing you do not do, it is give the audience a chance to think about, much less dwell upon, the paradoxical nature of what they are seeing. Another problem is that too much material is presented in too little screen time. The 1960 film was a lean ninety-nine minutes because it made good use of the time it had. This 2002 remake is ninety-six minutes long because plot threads are discarded so fast that development is an impossibility.Not helping matters is the casting. A soap opera actor is simply not the right person to credibly portray this unconventional hero. Jeremy Irons does his best with a terribly-written part, and it is quite amusing to see him eat the scenery. I think his agent had a lot of explaining to do after The Time Machine premiered. One of the few touches that is comparably brilliant with the 1960 film is Orlando Jones as Vox, a virtual history teacher who fills the hero in on the way the world of the eight thousandth century came to be. I prefer the ring-spinning sequence in the 1960 film for its creepy and impersonal atmosphere, but the Jones-Pearce exchanges have a certain human touch going for them. Which you prefer will obviously depend a lot on how you like to have your exposition delivered. Had the rest of the film been made like this, we would be judging it on its own merits rather than how it fails compared to its august predecessor.",The Time Machine

Not fantastic and not awful.It was pretty exciting all the way through, the music was super, the storyline was good enough, the special effects were great and the acting was fine. But with that said, the movie has some obvious flaws.We get to see the world and humans in different time settings multiple times, but yet we don't get a lot of information about the ""new worlds"". I got quite annoyed about how little was shared when he arrived on the earth 800 000 years later for example. Who were the people he met, why did they live like this, what happened to the people before? A lot of questions and not many answers. We got to know some of it, but not nearly enough to appreciate the whole travel-in-time aspect.The movie would have been a whole lot better if the the loose ends was tightened properly, but all in all an OK movie.

Sorry, to whoever you are, but how can you write such things about this film? I loved this film - i liked everything about it. The only slightly marred part of it was Jeremy Irons ; he was the only person for the job, but simply seeing him in another role like this was a little depressing, I always look forward to seeing him do something different- such as Lolita. But nonetheless, he was superb in the role.The story is interesting as well as faithful to the book (as much as a book-based film can be). The actors are excellent and everything about it is exactly what I would have wanted.Anyone who wants a lot of entertainment, as well as fantastic music (wait until the end titles, or when there is the pull-back shot of the Eloi's village over the river, it't just awesome) then just watch this film.

414,TomPhil,A really frustrating film: it just could have been so much better,4,8 August 2007,"Having not read the original book or seen the earlier film, and indeed knowing nothing about the storyline of either of those or the current film, I came to this film with an open mind.It's really difficult to know where to start a comment on the film, because the whole thing seems so confused. It seems like there is a point or a message or something in the film, but what that is remains completely obscure.The effects were fantastic and very well judged. The idea was set up really well with the motivation for time travel clearly made out. However, it was downhill from here.All of the time travel seems to have only the vaguest connection to the quest that was set out at the start. There are some nice ideas, but they seem to be isolated occurrences that really do not flow and make the film seem disjointed and lost. At one point one wonders whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon.When Hartdegen arrives in 802,701 A.D., the film becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to discover anything of importance about the Eloi, and while it seems clear that there is something to find out, what it is remains annoyingly elusive. This is quite an odd change from the previous time travel instances and one wonders why all of this has suddenly been abandoned for what seems like a completely new story. So many things happen that there should be an explanation for, but there is no discovery. I really, really wanted to know what the film was ""getting at"", what there was to uncover, but to no avail. Having read a summary of what happens in the book at this point, it seems like there has been a very half-hearted attempt to render this in the film but it has been so simplified and ""dumbed down"" that the meaning and context is completely lost.Just as we hope that we are finally to discover where this is all leading, the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction, and becomes a mindless action film without any real action. It is as if by this point the director has simply given up bothering to put any meaning into the film. By now countless significant things are happening without any explanation. Hartdegen fails to take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason, and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason. The film comes to an abrupt end as Hartdegen decides to stay with the Eloi.In summary, after a good start the film is very disappointing. Too much time is spent on Hartdegen's adventures before arriving with the Eloi. However, the worst part of the film is what I think is the most important part: the setting up of the situation with the Eloi. The whole point is completely missed, and this undermines the rest of the film. After this the film concentrates too much on effects and action and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place. With so many things happening without explanation, the film just seems to get lost and lose direction. However, the finale where Hartdegen decides he is no longer bothered about time travel is the most inexplicable of all.Ultimately, the whole film seemed like a collection of unconnected incidents. The meaning and context was lost, although the gaping hole where it should have been was very obvious. What was so frustrating about it all, though, was that there was clearly so much potential here: it wasn't by any means a bad film, it just so easily could have been so much better. The start was very promising, the time travelling looked fantastic and would have worked had it not gone off on tangents, and Hartdegen's experience with the Eloi could so easily have worked had a few more of the right questions been asked, and had there not been such a temptation to ""dumb down"" and simplify. I just wish I had a time machine so that I could travel back in time and advise against the mistakes that were made.",The Time Machine
415,amyandana,Simon Wells rides Grandad's machine into a parallel dimension,3,30 December 2014,"I tried to watch this film with an open mind. After all, it's not an easy task to turn a short novella into a full feature length film. And, given that this and all of H.G. Wells' stories are told by first-person narration, it would take some careful adaptation to preserve the tone of the book, much of which takes place in the narrator's own head as he attempts to rationalise the world he has been thrust into, as any pragmatic man of science would. If that sounds dull to you, worry not, because this is not a careful adaptation, it's Hollywood. To their credit, they didn't cast Brendan Fraser as the time traveller, but when you see the way they hacked up the script, they might as well have.Spoiler time, so only read on if you've seen it - or don't plan to, which is a fine idea, since this film is now 12 years old and the intervening years have spawned a number of other bombs on which you could waste an hour and a half of your life.I'll begin at the beginning, which is the first thing they ruined. The beginning of H.G. Wells' novel is full of charm and mystery that sets the scene. Time's been kind to this story, unlike some of Wells' work, and there was an opportunity to tell a really good tale here whilst still being trendy and engaging...perhaps even a little steam-punk. The dinner party, the educated sceptics, the presentation of the machine - have been omitted entirely. Replacing it is a done-to-death tale of lost love, which is presented as the reason for the time traveller's invention, because apparently science needs a feminine muse and invention for invention's sake is not enough.Speaking of love, if you were hoping to see how the nuanced, innocent, paternalistic and vaguely uncomfortable relationship between the time traveller and Weena was handled, this simply isn't there either. The Eloi aren't as you might remember them, and the female lead is far from naive and child-like - she's a teacher. You don't need to be a linguist to want to start pounding your head against the screen when she begins speaking perfect English after a mere 800,000 years.It doesn't get any better after that. Cue heavy use of CGI and scary creatures that might as well be LOTR orcs (yawn), another bad dude and a big and poorly explained explosion. Big dumb happy ending, none of the reflective scenes from the end of the book. The addition of the holographic librarian is welcome and adds a sense of continuity and comic relief that this film so desperately needs.If you're not a reader, you may get something out of this film. There are worse in its genre. To understand why I'm SO disappointed, you really have to be familiar with Wells' work. He was a thinker, a visionary, a man of big ideas. His work is philosophical, but Wells takes the role of the observer as he postulates his ideas - he doesn't pause to moralise. This film does the opposite - no room for free thought is left with the viewer; the protagonist rushes in in shining armour so that you may go home comfortable.I had high hopes for this film, given that the great grandson of the book's author was involved in directing it. I'm left wondering if he's even read the original text. Oh, Simon, in a few short generations you have become an entirely different creature from your grandfather. How positively ELOI of you! You could say Wells foresaw this, in his lesser known work ""A Story of the Days to Come"".",The Time Machine

I was absolutely astounded by some of what events transpired throughout his adventure, most of which will come as such a surprise. This is one I can watch again and again!

429,ElErico,Two Words Sum It Up - Great Movie,8,23 May 2006,"The Time Machine is a great movie. Don't listen to most of the other people that over-analyze movies. If they haven't figured out that movies are made for enjoyment and not to be analyzed (at least not the first time you watch it), then they have no place commenting. If you get too deep into the technicalities of time travel, you'll find the movie ultimately unenjoyable.However, there is still hope. If you see the movie for what it is (an action/adventure movie), you'll find that it starts off slowly and beautifully outlines what exactly drives the already extremely intelligent Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) to spend the next four years building a working time machine. Upon successfully going back in time, Alexander realizes that he can't save his fianceé, and so decides to go into the future all the way to 2030.Ultimately, this second 'time shift' doesn't do much for the story besides set us up for future events. Alexander decides he won't find answers, even though he's jumped so far ahead in time that the sights and technology have changed dramatically. Remember the advertisement for the lunar mining operation? When Alexander decides to jump ahead again (originally, he decides to jump another hundred years), an explosion nearly throws him from his chair and forces him to slow down and stop in 2037, where the mining operation has more or less made the moon start to disintegrate as a result of the failed operation. Well, of course, that's not good. After encountering a brief scuffle with the police of that time, he's back into the time machine and through accident, manages to knock himself out for a short while while the time machine throws him forward 800,000 years into the future.Sit back and watch as the scenery changes. It's quite amazing, I thought.Initially, when Alexander awakens, he barely stops the time machine and is apparently picked up by the Elois, a tribe of surface-dwelling humans. At first, it seems that no-one in the tribe understands him, but we learn later that they all know at least some of the English language. Many people don't quite understand why this is, but it's later pointed out that it's tradition to teach the English language (they call it the Stone language). What more do you need to know? I won't spoil the ending, however. You can read other comments for ending spoilers. Grab a copy of this movie and watch it, or better yet, rent it.",The Time Machine
430,djquinlan,"A Wrinkle in ""Time""",6,13 March 2002,"Something I've always found more interesting than the concept of time travel is the means by which movie heroes achieve it.  Since the 80s, filmmakers always seem to turn the most mundane objects into souped up science fictional wonders.  Michael J. Fox had his DeLorean, Bill and Ted had their phone booth, and now Guy Pearce has his chair. `The Time Machine' is the big screen adaption of the classic H.G. Wells novel of the same name, and you heard me right, the `Memento' star journeys through the ages without ever having to get off his rear.  Don't get me wrong though, it's a really cool chair--one of many amazing special effects created by those CGI wizards at DreamWorks. Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegan, a twitchy scientist/inventor who builds a time machine after his fiancée is killed.  He travels to the past in an attempt to save her life, but when he's unable to do so, Alexander decides to try out the future instead.  The time travel sequences that follow are without a doubt the highlight of this film.  The special effects are breathtaking and extremely creative.  As Alexander travels centuries into the future, his machine keeps him in an unaffected bubble as he watches the world around him rapidly move forward.  He witness's seasons come and go, buildings rise and fall, small rivers become massive canyons, all from the safety of his comfy super-chair. Unfortunately, as the movie peaks at the visual level, the actual story quickly plummets.  The plot splinters and seems to begin a completely different movie.  Alexander finds himself 800,000 years in the future.  The human race has evolved into two different species: the simple, peaceful, cliffside-dwelling Eloi, and the hideous, brutal, Eloi-eating Morlocks. Alexander becomes engulfed in the battle waging between the two species and ends up joining the fight. `The Time Machine' is definitely entertaining if you don't take it too seriously.  It is not intended to move or inspire the audience.  It's a popcorn movie, plain and simple.  The film is directed by Simon Wells, whose previous work consists solely of animated features like `Fievel Goes West' (he also happens to be the great-grandson of H.G. Wells).  He keeps the pace of the film quick and exciting, despite the somewhat lazy script he's following.  In his first live-action effort, Wells is also able to generate a solid performance from the always reliable Pearce as well as exceptional supporting cameos by Jeremy Irons and Orlando Jones. The special effects are top notch, and as far as sci-fi adventure films go, this one will definitely keep your attention.  But `The Time Machine' ultimately feels like two movies rolled into one.  During the first half of the film we see Alexander frolicking with the love of his life, and the obsessive madness that overcomes him after she is killed.  Then suddenly he's thrown into the future and becomes the gung-ho protector of an entire civilization.  During the later half, there's barely any mention of the deceased fiancée or his quest to bring her back.",The Time Machine

There could have been a little more in the story line between the two main characters, and I think there should have been more in the development of the time machine; but to do that they should have had an additional 20 to 30 minutes of footage. I believe there could have the story could have contineud the relationship between the scientist and the lady fro the future, and perhaps he could have taken her back to the future, and they could have developed from there.

The whole movie was rushed and incredibly unsatisfying. In the end, I was left with the feeling that our protagonist Alexander should have just left the time machine lever on ALL the way and never stop.And what the hell was wrong with the casting? The notable Jeremy Irons had a pitifully incoherent speaking part(maybe it was due to excessive ear wax in my ears, I dunno, but I thought he sounded unusually unintelligible). Guy Pierce's acting was disappointingly flat (he tried too damn hard in the beginning to act geeky and came out gawky instead, to say the least). And I felt no emotions whatsoever when his lady love died. Also, I could tell Samantha Mumba was uncomfortable in her role as Mara - who could blame her really for the incredibly bad script?For all its shortcomings, the movie did have some really good special effects, of which the image of the broken moon still stays fresh in my mind. A pity that the storyline didn't stick to the book like it should. This one is worth renting out on a rainy weeknight.",The Time Machine

The acting was very good and the main actors were very believable in their rolls. It is not very far from the original version in some ways, just more currant in the filming abilities of todays technology. Compared to a lot of movies made today in terms of science fiction this movie is at least enjoyable and the violence factor was kept to a minimum which is always a pleasant surprise since most adventure movies contain too much violence and not enough content. There is really no sexual content other than the female leads see through blouse which is not really that revealing and covered by her hair.

436,bear2see2002,Good escapism fare,10,11 March 2002,"I'm just going to list the very good things about this movie because it seems that the people who are determined to turn everybody against it are working overtime at making sure you hear about the slightest shortcoming in the film and blow it totally out of proportion. Short synopsis first: Warning-SOME SPOILERS HEREThis is the story of  a man living in New York Victorian times who is an absent minded professor in love with a woman and finally gets up the nerve to propose to her. Then he suffers a terrible tragedy and tries to undo what happened by inventing a time machine to bring his love back to life. Doesn't work, so he travels to future for answers but due to an accident the machine takes him to 802,701 where he meets a beautiful Eloi girl and her brother who take care of him and nurse him to health. They're part of the Eloi tribe who live above ground and are menaced by the terrible Morlocks, who live underground. Alexander finds the answer to his poignant ""What if?"" in the person of the Uber Morlock-the Morlock leader and also saves Mara and her brother along the way and discovers that he has found something more promising in the future than in the past. He falls in love with Mara and she falls in love with him. Now they have to destroy the threat of the Morlocks to their happiness.. Guy Pearce did a very credible job as the time traveler. He had some very memorable emotional moments that showcased his fine acting skills. I hope he gets his due one day from his peers for being such a fine actor and committing himself so devotedly to his roles no matter what they are. Awesome effects made for some fine visual entertainment. Check out the beautiful New York scenes. There's a outstanding scene of the terrible effects of man messing with the moon. You will gasp at the beauty and terror of it, believe me. Good job here. Give an award to the person who created the Victorian era scenes and the Eloi dwellings. Gorgeous. Jeremy Irons-short time on screen but he was creepy and effective despite that with the role he was given. The Morlocks frightened me-they were horrible. Tell the kids before you take them to prepare them for some edge of your seat jarring scenes here. The ending scene where they blend two dimensions of time in one shot and you see a scene from the past and from the 802,701 time consecutively. That was very well done! All of these outstanding things and others pretty much enabled me to enjoy this movie immensely. I realize critics don't like remakes and slam all of them but this one is one for our time. A keeper and time well spent.",The Time Machine
437,pchris2,"What of Waste of ""Time""",2,8 April 2002,"The Time Machine, although packed with pretty good special effects and the momentary high-paced action scene, leaves little for the intellectual movie goer.  Eventually, somewhere in the first twenty minutes of the film (try not to doze off or you'll miss it), the main goal of our lead character evolves. The main character's ""Quest,"" is a seemingly interesting plot but the screenplay writers seem to drop the creative ball after the idea was born missing several opportunities to ""thicken"" that plot and develop it into a movie. There were also far too many times when you were wondering ""How did I get here?"" in the movie and ""why is this character significant?"" But possibly, the most frequent question I heard asked in the theater was ""How do I get my money back?""This is one of those movies where it appears that the CGI budget ate all of the resources of the film and caused the producers to end the film abruptly. If I were you, I'd wait for this movie to come out on cable.",The Time Machine

The scenes with the Morlocks were to gruesome and didn't seem to fit.  Jeremy Irons was excellent as usual and the Mumbas were a nice surprise.

My assumption being that I would be in for a treat of high tech futuristic specical effects. To be honest, there were some, but painfully and obviously few. I think Guy Pearce struggles with this role and his accent wavers from the slightly American to shades of English...very confusing. The 'tribe' he encounters in the future adapt remarkably to speaking english in no time at all. Too many scenes looked fragmented and incomplete. The end result leaves me thinking this movie was not well directed and produced and therefore wasted the potential that the reputed $85m prouduction costs could have delivered.

444,heidibat,Great March film,7,9 March 2002,"""The Time Machine"" is one of the better 'after Holidays-before Summer blockbuster' films.  It wouldn't survive in any other time-slot, but is great for March.  Guy Pierce is exceptionally believable as an awed time-traveler, although the film doesn't draw the viewer in enough to allow deep feelings of sorrow for him. The Mumbas were great, even though they seemed more natural speaking English than they did their native tongue. And it is possible to practice a new language before filming to sound believable (check out Patricia Velasquez in ""The Mummy Returns"").  Orlando Jones was wonderful, and it would be very easy to sympathize with him above all others (you also feel the happiest for him in the end!).  He also brought about the only humor seen in the entire movie. If apprehensive about spending your money to view ""The Time Machine,"" at least consider the wonderful changes of scenery due to the 800,000 years of time passing.  It is awesome to see what all scientists know happened in the past come to life before our very eyes-and in the future none-the-less.  Great March film-seven and a half.",The Time Machine

I see no attraction or desirability in staying in the world of this movie's Eloi.I think H.G's grandson could have done much better.The 1960 version was far superior.

The thing I like most about this movie is that Alexander is so dedicated to saving his fiancé, but is not able to do to the fact that she does not exist out of her time.Some points of this movie are very interesting in some of them you must think a lot about. One part that really stumped me was when he went back into time to save his fiancée wouldn't he see himself there? Or when he wanted to use the Time machine again wouldn't the Time machine already be there (when he wanted to go to the future)...well it's only a movie but a great movie one of my favorites! Even though this movie didn't really make that much money, and wasn't that popular it still fascinates me many ways, I'm always thinking about time travel now how someone could travel through time if it's possible. The thing that really surprise me is that the movie cost around $120 million (both including advertisement and the movie itself)and it only made around $95 million...Well sometimes these things happen",The Time Machine
448,Fyre of Myrddin,Surprises,8,19 March 2002,"I was surprised with this movie.  The critics, in general, did not seem to favor this movie.  So I was not expecting too much when I went to see it. Sure, pieces of it were a bit predictable.  Sometimes the dialogue was a little corny, and they took major poetic license with the book.  But the movie was exciting as all get-out.  You sympathize with the main character. The movie sticks to its themes and doesn't ramble or wander.  It's lovely to watch--the photography and directing are wonderful.  But the thing I like most of all is that this movie kept the tradition of its book in making you think.  It's a big story of what-if on the inside.  It's absolutely fascinating!  The end is satisfying as well.  Overall, a very entertaining, enjoyable watch...I wouldn't mind seeing it again.",The Time Machine

450,gottahib,A good time,10,11 March 2002,That's all I ask in a movie like this and The Time Machine delivered on many counts. Suspension of belief helps. After all we ARE talking about a man traveling through time. If you go to a movie with that theme obviously you're willing to except what's presented as fantasy. A well made science fiction effects extravaganza. Critics don't have a clue. One great thing about this movie was how it didn't try to talk down to the audience. It accepted that everybody understood what they were showing and built it into a very visually moving movie. Some of the scenes were totally shocking and moving. Pay attention to the moon scene. Kind of short in some places like scenes had been cut but the overall effect made it worthwhile-it was simply stunning! Guy Pearce is becoming an actor known for carrying movies now so look out. Never underestimate the power of a handsome Guy! (even though they tried to cover it up in the movie),The Time Machine
451,jollycray,fun and thought provoking movie.,9,11 March 2002,"I liked this movie. Okay, it was far from Oscar caliber, but after reading a few critiques and watching the movie, I wondered whether the critics had some personal agenda beyond merely rating this film. It's a fun, popcorn movie that has some cool special effects. Simon Wells did an excellent job in his first foray into live action. The action scenes hint at his potential at becoming an action/adventure heavyweight contender.  The characters definitely could be fleshed out more, though. The story covers things so fast that at times I felt I was in the Time Machine watching the movie go by in a blink of an eye. The acting was a bit flat in the beginning, but Orlando Jones' character is a worthwhile treat, as is Jeremy Irons'. John Logan's writing style is the same as in Gladiator--beautifully epic but emotionally cold.  The end was poetic and the overall theme was thought provoking. Too bad they didn't wait to release this in the summer--it could have made more money. If you like Stargate, you'll like Time Machine.",The Time Machine

Now my kids loved it, they are totally in love with it. But remember this is a new concept to them and they didn't have any idea it was a remake of a classic 1960 movie. I don't think it would have made a difference. Science fiction movies are my cup of tea and I was kind of looking forward to this one despite the negativity surrounding it. I was surprised it wasn't dumbed down and they took time out to answer the What If? question for this audience. That was a really cool part and made for some nice discussion on the way home. Some remakes are horrible, i.e; Psycho, The Blob, Island of Dr. Moreau, etc but I would never put THIS MOVIE in that category, ever. It was far too exciting, visually stimulating and involving to fit that bill. For that reason I give it a,7/10",The Time Machine

A fact quickly found that you can not change the past, but only the future.  This climax is a bit much as we jump 800,000 years into the future.  Overall good casting by Guy Pearce and Jeremy Irons, but a dense aspect of love, which I normally don't dig in movies.  But how can Alexander (Pearce)fall in love 800,000 years later after only moments of his fiance's death.  A bit cheesy at parts but all together a good time messing with time itself.

454,tonafunny,Relax and enjoy,10,12 March 2002,"Looking for imperfections in a movie like this is time consuming (no pun intended) and pointless. There's no such thing as perfection in this world. This movie is simply a fun thrill ride of special effects and a touching love story that has a happy ending added in. That makes for a good time right there but because it's based on the wonderful book ""The Time Machine"" there's more opportunity for wonder and fantasy and Simon Wells used his vivid imagination to the full to give the audience that. This story has romance, intrigue, action, suspense and edge of your seat twist and turns as we see Alexander the absent minded time traveler on a quest to rescue his beloved fiance. His invention, the Time Machine, manages to inadvertently end up in 802,701 where man has divided into two races, Eloi/Morlock. Morlocks use the Eloi for a horrible purpose and the peaceful Eloi seemed locked in this existence for all time. But once Alexander comes along and starts asking questions as any inquisitive scientist will certainly do, things heat up and the final result of the confrontation of the two races is quite impressive.  Guy Pearce is as always good. Samantha Mumba was adequate, she's very good eye candy (as is Guy ). The rest of the cast do well but I must single out Orlando Jones' character as worthy of special note. Some of the scenes involving him were very funny and really provided comic relief this pretty serious movie needed. And we can't expect a geeky absent minded professor driven by a desperate need to save his fiance from death to be amusing a la Brendan Fraser in ""the Mummy"" I'm so glad Simon Wells realized this and didn't go there. That was a relief.So I'm pretty happy with the result. But see it for yourself. That's all you can do.",The Time Machine
455,mtgirls,Fun and exciting,10,13 March 2002,"Of course critics and die hard fans of the 1960 version were willing to forgive the 1960 version for it's flaws but they will never extend the same courtesy to Simon Wells and his updating of the time travel novel. But I will because I recognize that Simon wells, being a first time live action director didn't have access to resources that might have made the few problems in the film less noticeable. Just as George Pal didn't have the technology to create the spectacular effects and time lapse photography that made some scenes in this movie so memorable, perhaps Simon Wells was limited as well. We don't know all the ins and outs of the film making business but I am impressed that he did so well with what he had to work with. Some may then retaliate by saying he shouldn't have made it at all but I say the love and pride for his great grandfather's novel is very evident in this film. The updating of the novel to include a romantic reason for the time traveler to go into the future was believable. Guy Pearce was effective as Alexander Hartdegan and was able to pull off the nerdy professor to action hero very creditably. Many find it hard to credit his transformation to a courageous defender of his new found love and her brother and the Eloi in 802,701 but remember folks, four long years passed between the tragedy and his machine working a long time in which anger, self recrimination, and grief helped to make him a more focused and determined man. Guy Pearce brought this desperation to the screen very well, in the scene where he first visits 2030 he barely takes time to see wonders around him, so intent is he on finding the answer to his ""what if??"" For the fast pacing in the film I thought most of the actors did a fine job. Nice graphics and a very real look to the Morlocks give a more tense and scary feel to the final showdown between the Eloi/Morlock groups. I agree sometimes you felt rushed and there wasn't time to develop characterizations and relationships but there you have it. ""The Time machine"" worked for me.

That really bothers me.Don't get me wrong. The Time Machine had good special effects but the novel (which I read a long time ago) had depth, dammit. DEPTH.I read an interview with Simon Wells a while ago about the making of the film and he said that he needed to bring the story to a modern audience, or words to that effect. I didn't think he meant that he was going to dumb it down so spectacularly. It also seemed to me that he thought the book was flawed somehow and so needed jazzing up. The Time Machine is a classic, Simon. Leave it alone.Having said that though, the thing I did like that wasn't in the book was the 'why can't I change the past?' question which made him travel to the future. As I said, not in the book- but would have made an interesting story had it been followed through. Instead, it loses focus when the morlocks appear. Its almost as though Simon Wells didn't have the conviction to carry on and instead decided he needed to stick more closely(ish) to the novel. As a result, the whole movie seems very disjointed. Especially when Jeremy Irons appears as the bad guy and then gets disposed of in practically the same scene.I also wanted to see an ending other than 'And everything gets blown up'. I was really hoping that Pearce was going to do something really clever with the time machine to save the day. But no. The film makers needed an explosion to end on.There really are so so many faults and plot holes which Simon Wells and his gang MUST have noticed. They are way too obvious to ignore. They jump at you, wearing bright pink bowler hats and scream, 'Hey, look at us! We are the movie gremlins! We will spoil your film!'.

The 1960 version suffers from idiocy and come on, try selling a movie where in the future everybody has blond hair and blue eyes! I think this version is much more respectable and believable in that regard and I appreciate Simon Wells for having the courage to bring that out. I found this movie so enchanting and exciting, the special effects ` were mind blowing. Some of the victorian scenes are soooo beautiful that it seems to take you right there. Alexander Hartdegan lives in New York during that time and we find him as a teacher in love and getting ready to propose. Guy Pearce brings just the right amount of nervous energy, shyness and resolve needed to make his character believable and Sienna Guillory did well also.The shot of the moon breaking up is so cool, wow. I'd like to see the movie just for that alone again! When Alexander finds himself in 802,701 after a tragedy he meets the beautiful Eloi. They live in one of the most beautifully rendered visual settings of the future I've ever seen, I can't see how anyone couldn't be satisfied with this movie's wonderful imagery. The romantic story worked well, we see him meet up with the Eloi Mara, played well by first timer in movies Samantha Mumba. From then things really heat up with the frightening Morlocks entering the picture and a terrific showdown.I recommend this movie if you're the type who knows how to ENJOY a movie instead of going in just to find fault because it doesn't give science lessons, history lessons, etc. Just a good, feel good, clean movie!

Most people like to dissect EVERY detail of the movie and make sure everything fits. There's no such things as suspension of disbelief. They want a movie to make sense in every way, EVEN when it's dealing with a largely fanciful idea like The Time Machine! come on people, it's not real! I enjoyed the romantic and touching side of the story, where this scientist tried to reverse what happened to his fiancee and I understood why some scenes were obviously cut out because of the reason he invented the Time machine. That error in the film making aside, I realize that when dealing with such a fanciful subject and the cynical audiences of today any moviemaker might get into trouble if they don't watch every little detail. I forgive the film maker because the movie's so GORGEOUS to look at and the action sequences are very exciting. This is pure sci fi fun to me, a sci fi lover. The score is magnificent and the cinematography is awesome! I enjoyed Guy Pearce's intense portrayal of the lovelorn Alex Hartdegan searching for the answer to his plaintive ""what if?"".

Not a social analysis, as the original novel was. In fact I prefer to think on it as a film ""inspired"" in the book, as I use to do will most of ""adaptation"" films. I have been disappointed too often.Strong points: the character's motivation and 3D of some supporting characters of 19th century; special effects (otherwise inexcusable, in this computer era!); the Eloi town; Vox the photonic one.Weak points: lack of tempo at some moments, as well as lack of sense of wonder; 2D of support characters of 800th century; a poorly developed second(ary?) love story (OK, Samantha is cute and he hasn't seen a woman in 800.000 years, is that enough?

The only similarities between this movie and the book are that the future humanoids are called Eloi and Morloks, and there is a time machine. That's where it ends.If you are watching this movie hoping for a faithful representation of the book on the big screen you will definitely be disappointed. I have not seen the 1960s version, but I have no doubt that it could not possibly be worse than this piece of garbage.**May Contain Spoilers after this**It is easier to count the number of things that it has in common with the book than the number of discrepancies. Here are some things that I was completely ticked off about: 1) The whole love-affair, driving him to go back into the past - It never happened.2) He never went to the mid 2000's in the book. That was just made-up for the movie.3) The Eloi can speak English. (WTF??) 4) The Eloi live on these odd structures that jut from the sides of cliffs overlooking a river. The book described them as living in marble palaces, in a lush, green, lightly hilly area.5) There is no Sphinx-like structure.6) There is no green palace. Instead, he re-discovers the museum he saw in the mid-2000s, and all of the electronics are miraculously still working fine after 800,000 some-odd years.7) Instead of coming to his own conclusions about the societal structure of the future-world, the computer guy from the museum simply explains it all.8) There is no Weena.9) The Eloi and the Morloks are dark-skinned, not pale-skinned like they are in the book.10) The time traveller's impression of the Eloi as being fairly stupid is never evident. They are in fact portrayed as just a tribal people.The list goes on. There are only a couple of things that actually come close to representing the true story as laid down by H.G. Wells.If you have read the book, I strongly urge you not to watch this garbage. And if you have not read the book, and you have seen or will soon see this movie, please - read the book. If H.G. Wells were alive today, he would never have let this absolute piece of garbage be published.",The Time Machine
470,kate-brender,Go read the book people! It's good for your brain.,1,29 March 2008,"Worst. Movie. Ever. I can't believe they had to hire Jeremy Irons to give this piece of crap some credibility - and still failed. Did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book that their target audience wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own? (probably). ""Hey, let's make lots of things explode and give Mina big boobs, and have her speak in an adorably fake broken English. That'll make the morons watch."" ""But sir, that's not how the book went at all, I think we're mot being faithful to Mr. Wells' message."" ""F*ck it, we're going to the box office here, never mind some dead author's ideas on human nature. Also, let's add in Orlando Jones with some classic 'Black attitude' as a supporting character, and never mind the interesting conclusion to the book - Guy Pierce has to get some p*ssy at the end.""",The Time Machine

472,film_art,A weak remake.,5,13 October 2002,"This movie definitely does not stand up to the 1960 version starring Rod Taylor, but the failings are in the second half of the movie.  The first half compares favorably with the earlier version (even the time machine seems familiar), but the second half is hard to take.  There are many things that I did not like, but the Morlock hunters CGI movements were totally unbelievable.  Overall it was worth watching once, if only to compare to the earlier version, but I doubt I will ever watch it again.",The Time Machine

The Morlocks looked like a mixture between Iron Maiden´s ""Eddie"" and a very old ET; their movements were as stiff and rigid as the ones of the first Godzilla...More? the movie plot has nothing to do with the book....The performances are far from being good.... the Jeremy iron´s character doesn´t exist....I´m really angry for rented this movie. Please don´t watch it and read a good book instead. You won´t regret it.",The Time Machine

It is a bit darker than the original and for that reason small children might find certain aspects disconcerting.",The Time Machine
475,directorbear,Worst Picture (2002),1,3 April 2003,"While I'm sure worse films have been made, The Time Machine sticks out like a sore thumb. The film, in a nutshell, was horrible. I don't understand why, first of all, the stinkin' thing was nominated for an Academy Award. The makeup was terrible. I distinctly remember making the comment, ""Looks like someone has been going the 'The Lord of the Rings' trash dumpster."" The makeup wasn't the worst part of the movie, though. The story was pretty bad. I correct myself... the storyTELLING was really bad. The director managed to thoroughly and completely convince us as an audience, the the girl he met in the beginning was the one true girl for him. That he could never love someone else. That alone, was good storytelling. BUT, to turn around and (spoiler?) kill her off, have him travel through time, and hit it off with some native girl, hardly did justice to the budding romance in the beginning. There was no closure for that love. Sure, he secluded for several years, but that didn't do it. In essence, he went back, fell for the cave woman, and never thought twice about that former love. This ruined the movie. While Mark Addy WAS pretty good looking, and gave a decent performance, this didn't save The Time Machine. Bad storytelling and terrible makeup earned this movie a ""1"" in my book.",The Time Machine
476,Fernsten27,Great Music,10,20 June 2003,"The movie was pretty good as far as science fiction goes, but the soundtrack was just amazing. I believe that this movie was vastly underrated.

I give this movie an A.",The Time Machine
477,daudebaut,One of the best Science Fiction movie I saw last 4 years with some drama in it,10,22 June 2003,Before I saw it my mind was on something stupid ... a remake after so many versions of the book. But the horror and drama that I found in this movie made my heart go wild. Instead of drinking a glass of tea after a movie ( like I usually do ) i spend some time thinking at my mistakes in the past and what can I do now to change them. Finally the movie was about all of us together ... what could I have done that day ? Think at this and see how your life changes a bit. That will be all from a movie fan from Bucharest Romania.,The Time Machine
478,antivirtel,Excellent movie - but highly underrated,8,22 April 2016,"I was thought, that is is a typical time-traveling Sci-fi until the first time travel, but from the second an on, it was a great one. The whole film is about the basic question: ""What would have been if ...?"" ... I could save my love? or ... I could change the past? - that's why I was just gave 8 stars, I think is is too mainstream, it should have shown us something brand new.The story by the way is very good, but I was thinking, that there were some contradictions with the simple logic, so it seemed to be unpredictable. I had no feelings like that, while watching all episodes of Star Trek.",The Time Machine

Granted the special effects were different (due to a different technological age), but the overall content was well played throughout both movies. I never read the book, but between the two movies from both then and now, I would definitely call this a ""Good Movie."" I liked how they modeled the new version after the old version.  And despite what others may think, I think this was a very good movie. I will definitely be watching this over again and inviting others to do the same.",The Time Machine
480,IAML2K,Are you crazy?,10,15 January 2005,"Are you people crazy?? The Time Machine was a great movie. If you can honestly tell me the effects were not good, then wou have problems. There only two scenes in the entire movie that you can tell are fake. Obviously the morlocks are fake, but can you tell by looking at them? No. And I haven't read the book, but even if the movie is different from the book, it is still a good movie. For one, the time machine really looks like it would take you through time, the computer graphics are amazing when he's going to 802,701, and the whole Eloi civilization is breathtaking. Living on cliff sides?? Genius. The fight scene with Alex and the hunter morlock is awesome, and the encounter with the uber morlock was so well written. All in all, this is a great movie.",The Time Machine
481,rickyt,Better than the 1960 version,8,8 February 2005,"The 1960s version was by far the best until the 2002 movie was released. The 1960 movie was obviously the gold standard for the producers of the 2002 movie to beat as they gave it credit in the film. That's understandable when you consider that the original movie was produced by George Pal, an academy award winning producer of American science fiction movies in the 1950s and 60s.The director of the 2002 movie used discretion when incorporating CG enhancements and enhanced the story line rather than trying to make the movie a special effects bonanza.I was a little disappointed that Alan Young didn't get a bigger part, he was the flower shop owner. He played the part of David Filby in the 1960 version. I was also disappointed that Jeremy Irons didn't have a bigger part, to secure a great acting talent like Jeremy and not use him to a greater extend is a shame.",The Time Machine
482,jlhardy1,The Time Machine,2,19 February 2005,"The movie The Time Machine was an utter failure. The plot line was so far away from The Time Machine written by H.G. Wells that it had no resemblance. I noticed in the credits they didn't even say it was based off the book The Time Machine. As I watched this movie I thought it was so boring. I kept waiting for it to get better but it only got worst.The movie storyline was boring, stupid and predictable. I thought it was so ridiculous how the hero of the movie travels to the year 800,000 and solves all the problems of the people in mere days. He kills every single enemy on the planet like he is superman or something. The director of the movie was hoping to make money off the special effects because that was the only thing that was good.

483,DorinDXN,"best movie ever, some IQ required for watching",10,14 March 2005,"The Time Machine is one of the best films I've ever seen. At this moment I'd say it's the best film I've ever seen. I can't remember a film having that kind of effect on me in the cinema. It absolutely blew me away. It's the perfect SF movie, which is a minor achievement. What makes it incredible is that the perfect credible story not just ""a animate clone"" of the book, seeming to be a good receipt for a good movie. But it require a minimum IQ for watching and is not a movie for the week-end or for fun. The story is: Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) invents a time machine in the late 1800s that takes him 800,000 years into the future. There he discovers that mankind has evolved into two races: the Eloi and the Morlocks ""..one of those staggeringly well-produced, joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next, hastily, emptily..""

(but the dates are the dates from the original book!) the storyline is good, characters are great, and the acting is wonderful. i think Guy Pearce does an flawless job of gradually going from the geeky intellectual to the full blown action hero. I can't think of another actor who could have pulled it off. Samantha Mumba is a nice surprise. i fully expect to see her in more roles in the coming future. i highly recommend this movie and think that Simon Wells did an excellent job with it!",The Time Machine

That would be a perfect romantic ending.After all that was Alexander's aim through out the movie.Then I saw the film again recently and this time the meaning became clearer.Alexander can go back to the past but he can't change it!Too bad.The digital library which survived so long at least should provide some idea of solving this problem for him or at least in his travels to the future discovered from himself, his descendant or anybody how to get back and save Emma.It was a terrific story and would have been an excellent and entertaining movie if only had Alexander ended up with Emma.What if....I wish for a Time Machine Part 2.",The Time Machine
486,pedrocom,"Good, solid movie",8,3 October 2015,"Defiantly matching the first film, if not bettering it. Not brilliant, the eloi have quite weak characterisation and the message of the first film about continuing to explore and learn isn't really put forward at all. The murlocks were better but not as explained as you'd like them to be. On the other hand, the time traveller and the time machine are far better, further devilling into why he is searching through time. The end of the world catastrophe was far more imaginative and the concept of time travel far more well explained. A few people will get mad that its a re-make of the original, which for some unknown reason is a crime, but it's still worth watching. For the sci-fi more than the underlying message.",The Time Machine

Okay, sometimes it lacks credibility and leaves questions unanswered, but generally I loved it.The landscape is amazing, it took my breath away watching the beautiful canyon with the Eloi's dwellings at its cliffs. The view of the busted moon wandering along the sky left me amazed.The music is incredible, I loved listening to Enya while Alexander sits in the boat moving towards the Eloi towers.Jeremy Irons and Guy Pearce give us some quite memorable quotes, especially Irons as the Über-Morlock who radiates charisma, wisdom and a feeling of eternity that compare to none others.In general, a can really recommend to watch this picture, you won't regret it!",The Time Machine
488,zbritton-63869,"Cool movie, but doesn't take 'time' to explain much",1,28 April 2017,"So many inaccuracies and problems with the layout of this movie. I'm giving it 3 stars because 1) when he first arrives ""800,000"" years in the future, the Time Machine clearly says well over 9.8 million years. 2) also when he arrives, Mara says that they all learn the old language, yet they act as if they have no idea what he said. 3) why would anyone detonate the moon? Of course, large explosions are going to have an effect, what about scientific study and the scientific method? I feel as if once Alexander left the 2030s any kind of tech is just out the window, for good. With no valid explanation why. Sure you can assume it's because the moon was blown apart, but come on, there'd be enough remaining knowledge documented to rebuild most if not all of what was there. Which brings to my next point. 4) He had to have everything required to make said Time Machine documented as well. And in the end, when it finally shows back to 19th century, they just leave all his stuff there. 5) Given this fact, from the point he built the Tine Machine it would have already existed, they go about through the different time periods like they don't know what he's talking about happened in the past. Sure ""he disappeared into the future"", but like I said all of his scientific papers with practical application would have been seen and improved on, from that point. With all these points, this movie is pointless, just like this review and my life. Anyways thanks for reading the analysis if you did. *Since this is a semi-nonlinear film, my reasons are also nonlinear. Byte!",The Time Machine
489,TheKrimsonKing,What an awful adaptation of a great classic,1,28 June 2008,This movie is a disgrace. How can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into some kind of half-assed love story. The entire beginning of the movie was not in the H.G. Wells story and didn't need to be. Also the Eloi were done completely wrong. They did build houses or form any kind of real society. They didn't care about each other at all. That was an important part of the story. The way they had formed a world that was without hardship or complex emotions. They were barely even aware of the Morlocks. I don't know why this movie was made the way it was but some stories should be told as they are or left alone.,The Time Machine

I had seen the older one a few years back in school and have read the book at least twice. The modernization of the past movie and book makes this movie very enjoyable, especially if you have seen the old version and/or read the book. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. The movie and other versions of it, I feel, should all be seen. This is because I found it very intriguing seeing the advancement from how the world was when H.G. Wells wrote the novel to the movie that was made years later. The movie made in 2002 enhances H.G. Wells version and the version in 1960. When H.G. Wells wrote the novel he didn't know anything about space travel and computers. Incorporating these ideas in the newer version makes the movie spectacular.",The Time Machine
