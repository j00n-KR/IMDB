0,MartinHafer,Mindless and fun...,7,12 October 2009,"When MISS CONGENIALITY came out, I remember how it got lukewarm reviews (at best) and did so poorly in the theaters that it was offered as a free pay-per-view film with the Dish Network. I assumed the movie MUST have been terrible for them to just give it away and I am surprised I actually watched it. To my surprise, however, it was most enjoyable...though mindless (at times).The film is one of these ones that you simply must suspend all sense of disbelief--otherwise it simply won't work. Sandra Bullock going from tom-boy FBI agent to nearly winning the Miss United States pageant was a bit far-fetched to say the least. But, if you can do this and stop your brain from nagging you, you'll find that the movie is often delightful.Now you may have noticed that I didn't say this was a great film or a must-see. The movie did have some rough spots (despite some people giving it a 10, this and very few movies deserve a 10). The biggest problem for me is that the setup for Bullock's character went way overboard. Sure, we are supposed to see her as a tough lady--I understood that. But they really went too far--often making her seem too tough to be real and, at times, unlikable. First, no lady who is built like that is going to be the Terminator....tough, yes, Terminator, no! Second, when she met the character played wonderfully by Michael Caine, it was as if the director gave her instructions to behave like a boorish pig. Seeing her eat with the manners of a Doberman was just too much--no one is THAT obnoxious when they eat (at least once they pass age 6). Third, the transformation was just too quick.Now, aside from these difficulties, the film was a delight at times because although the script had problems, it also had some very witty dialog and a cute resolution. In other words, it worked despite its flaws. Partly this was because when not acting boorish, it's hard not to like Miss Bullock. Partly this was because she had some excellent support. And, partly this was because this is a silly little film and silly little films are not supposed to be Shakespeare or a Merchant-Ivory production--it's allowed to be slight yet fun.Overall, a nice time-passer but far from a must see or a 10, though Bullock still ""scores"". Also, I've seen this one more than once and it holds up very well with repeated viewings despite its few deficiencies.",Miss Congeniality
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Wonderful comedy, unmissable!",9,18 June 2009,"I absolutely loved Miss Congeniality, it was funny warm and completely likable. The best aspect was the charming and funny performance of the underrated Sandra Bullock as Gracie, in possibly her best role. Gracie is a beautiful woman, but her behaviour like the pig snorting isn't very typical of women. She is excellently supported by a witty, side splittingly funny script, and some lovely camera-work. (the painting scene was priceless)Not to mention the original plot that never marred the feel good nature of the film. The performances of Michael Caine and Candice Bergen were excellent. But if I had one minor criticism, it would be that William Shatner slightly overplayed his part of Stan, other than that it is a comedy you just don't want to miss. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.",Miss Congeniality
2,SnoopyStyle,Sandra Bullock adorable but not much else,6,13 October 2013,"Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) is a rough and tumble FBI agent. She's prone to violent outbursts and manlier than any other agent. When a terrorist threatens the Miss United States beauty pageant, Gracie must gather what's left of her femininity to enter the pageant.Sandra Bullock is a lovely actress. She's great at playing the dorky cute girl. In here she adds a dash of violence and it starts off quite well. Once they transition into the pageant, the jokes don't hit as well. There're too many pratfalls. The jokes are broad and lack any insight. If it wasn't for Bullock's adorableness, there wouldn't be much of a movie. Candice Bergen and William Shatner make a fun pageant organizing duo.",Miss Congeniality
3,Prismark10,Miss Congeniality,4,17 June 2021,Miss Congeniality has Sandra Bullock as kick ass Gracie Hart. A FBI agent who prefers to be one of the lads.The unglamorous and frumpy Gracie is gung ho who finds herself going undercover when a terrorist threatens to blow up a national beauty pageant.Vic Melling (Michael Caine) has the task of turning Gracie into a graceful beauty contestant. Gracie needs to find out just who the baddie is but she keeps falling over her high heels.Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) is the team leader who never trusts Gracie's instincts.Miss Congeniality would had worked if the lead actress was really a butch tomboy that would magnificently turn into a swan.I never believed Bullock was an ugly duckling who preferred beers with the boys and getting into fights.This is a loose and frothy action romantic comedy that is not that funny and has little action. It relies too much on pratfalls.Caine does best as the veteran gay pageant coach but the movie is lukewarm.,Miss Congeniality
4,lee_eisenberg,You'll be having the time of your life watching this movie!,10,18 April 2006,"""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" implied that beauty pageants can make for great humor, but ""Miss Congeniality"" takes it to a whole new level. Starring Sandra Bullock as a sarcastic FBI agent participating in the Miss America pageant to thwart an attack, the movie pulls no punches. I think that my favorite part is when her trainer (Michael Caine) asks her why New Jersey is called the Garden State. I couldn't have come up with a better answer myself! All in all, it's great to see them mocking the Miss America pageant. I agree with a previous reviewer's scathing comments about it (a bunch of stupid models saying how they're going to save the world). You're sure to love this movie. Also starring Benjamin Bratt, Candice Bergen, Ernie Hudson and William Shatner.",Miss Congeniality
5,jboothmillard,Miss Congeniality,7,1 March 2007,"I saw this when I was in secondary school when lessons were cancelled, and then I saw it again, and it is still good. Basically Gracie Hart (Golden Globe nominated Sandra Bullock) has a no-nonsense and hard hitting reputation and attitude, but when she fails to follow orders, the boss is not too confident she can work properly. But when the cops hear about a killer indicating a target at the Miss United States beauty pageant, they decide that someone needs to keep a close eye on the girls. They decide that Gracie should enter the contest as an ambitious participant, she is obviously not pleased that she has to act more lady like. But Victor Melling (Sir Michael Caine) is going to make sure that she does, oh, and the womanising agent Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) has enough attraction for her to have some confidence. Also starring Candice Bergen as Kathy Morningside, Ernie Hudson as FBI Asst. Director Harry McDonald, William Shatner as Stan Fields, John DiResta as Agent Clonsky; Heather Burns as Cheryl Frasier, Miss Rhode Island and Melissa De Sousa as Karen Krantz, Miss New York. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""One In A Million"". Very good!",Miss Congeniality
6,rmax304823,Modest comedy.,6,2 July 2009,"I guess ""unpretentious"" is as good a way as any to describe this rather loose-limbed comedy thriller. It has no particular ambition and breaks no new ground. The FBI discovers that some miscreant intends to blow up the Miss United States beauty pageant so they decide to put an undercover agent into the competition. The only field agent available is Sandra Bullock, a foul-mouthed, ill-kempt, ungroomed, violence-prone, tough-minded babe who smothers her steak in ketchup and chews it with her mouth open. She is dragged kicking and screaming through the gelled hair and the bikini wax and the proper way to walk. Benjamin Bratt is her partner and Michael Caine is the fairy who must prepare her in five days for the Magic Moment. William Shatner is the program's stage manager and Candace Bergen is the hostess.The film isn't a failure but it's a one-joke situation comedy dragged out to feature length and adorned with every gag the writers could dream up. After her thoroughly predictable transformation into a stunning, sexy beauty who emerges from the staging area with Benjamin Bratt, Bullock mutters to Bratt, ""I'm in a bad mood and I'm armed, so don't mess with me."" Then she trips on her high heels and falls down. Behind her, Bratt winces. It's sitcom stuff.Some of the gags are better than others. Candace Bergen must explain to Bullock that the pageant is not a beauty contest but a scholarship program and that they've gotten a lot of criticism from certain quarters -- ""feminists, intellectuals -- ugly women."" And, when asked to describe her favorite date, one contestant screws up her face with doubt and says, ""Gee. That's a hard one. I think I'd have to say April fifteenth, because it's not too hot or too cold and you don't need a jacket."" The real problem, aside from the lack of imagination in most of the comic pratfalls, is that the target of this movie is too easy. I think the funniest send up of Miss America was in Woody Allen's ""Sleeper"", in a scene in which his intelligence is being broken down preparatory to brainwashing. Nothing is more hilarious than Woody dressed in a gown, with a steel helmet bristling with electrodes, hearing the announcement that he is the winner. Tears stream down his cheeks as he goes into his ""world peace"" speech. The scene lasts about two minutes. This movie clocks in at about an hour and a half.The ""world peace"" speech is satirized here too, as are all the other features of the stereotype. However, the people behind the curtain don't want to be TOO hard on Miss America because, after all, people WILL watch it and cheer for their favorite. So when Shatner asks Bullock on stage what she's learned from her participation, Bullock responds that she's found a lot of new friends here and that they're not the airheads they're presumed to be and, gee, they're really swell women.That's not what the movie has shown us, however. Miss Rhode Island and Miss Hawaii almost get into a cat fight over whose state is the smallest. And the worst sins they've ever committed are stealing a pair of red panties from a store because their parents forbid ostentatious clothing. They have no talent that can't be found outside of an ordinary high school and no evident thought processes that extend beyond their body sheaths. I mean, as the old saying goes, you can't have your yogurt and eat it too.What worries me the most is that this purports to be a sarcastic editorial on people of this age and class, but it might actually be reportage. Maybe the contestants actually ARE like this, and maybe there are a substantial proportion of the American population that applaud these posturing empty shells and the values they represent.Yet, to say that these characters are fatuous dunces and the enterprise itself shallow, to say all that, a couple of observations still need to be made. The Miss America Pageant (or ""scholarship program"") is too easy a target. It's like breaking an iridescent butterfly on the rack. And are they so terribly ignorant or is this a representative sample? A Fourth of July Poll in 2011 revealed that one out of five Americans couldn't name the country we achieved our independence from. A 2010 World Public Opinion survey found that Americans want to tackle deficits by cutting foreign aid from what they believe is the current level (27 percent of the budget) to a more prudent 13 percent. The real number is under 1 percent. And, let's face facts, some of the wisecracks are pretty witty. And, above all, William Shatner enjoys himself immensely as the pageant's host. He always enjoys himself on screen, the big ham.",Miss Congeniality
7,Tweekums,A fun comedy where Sandra Bullock really shines,8,26 December 2019,"Grace Hart has always been a bit of a tomboy with a sense of justice so it isn't surprising that she became an FBI agent. Her position is threatened when an agent is wounded after she disobeys orders but when a terrorist known as ""The Citizen"" threatens the Miss USA Beauty contest in San Antonio, Texas she is the only agent who can go undercover as a contestant. It won't be an easy assignment though; Gracie has never worn a dress in her life let alone donned high heels or used beauty products! Once there she is put under the wing of coach Victor Melling and gradually learns what she must do if she is to gain everybody's trust, progress in the tournament and uncover the terrorist.This film doesn't provide too many surprises but that doesn't matter as it does provide plenty of laughs. Gracie is a fun lead character; Sandra Bullock does a great job in the role. She convinces as the tough agent who doesn't care about trivialities like her looks as well as having the looks to convince as the beauty pageant contestant. Michael Caine's performance as Victor nicely contrasts as he does everything the 'correct' way and Gracie needs constant tutoring. There are also fun scenes between Gracie and her fellow contestants and there are entertaining performances from William Shatner and Candice Bergen amongst others. The mystery elements take second place to the comedy but still proves entertaining if not too surprising. It does get a bit silly at times but that doesn't feel out of place in a deliberately light-weight film. Overall this might not be a 'great' film but it is a lot of fun; I'd certainly recommend it.",Miss Congeniality
8,ma-cortes,Funny movie in which Sandra Bullock remains sympathetic and attractive as impetuous FBI agent,6,19 February 2012,"Amusing and entertaining film with Sandra Bullock 's undeniable screen presence . Undercover FBI capable agent Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) is a tomboy and foul-mouthed girl . Generally a nice agent , she is in trouble at work when she does an error in judgment in an undercover operation which turns in a disaster. One of her partners named Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) is assigned by his chief (Ernie Hudson) to lead the high profile case of a terrorist nicknamed The Citizen . Gracie pieces together the tracks to determine that The Citizen's next target will be the Miss United States beauty pageant threatened by the psychopath criminal . The pageant administration , led by previous winner named Cathy Morningside (Candice Bergen) and long time host Stan Fields (William Shatner), provide the FBI with access to the pageant, Cathy in particular is less than thrilled to have a non-credible Gracie disguising as a contestant which she feels will ruin the pageant. The FBI enlist the assistance of former pageant contestant consultant Victor Melling (Michael Caine) , he is called in to groom and turn the agent into a beauty pageant contestant. As Gracie proceeds in the transformation, she gets to know the other contestants (Melissa De Sousa, Heather Burns who will appear in the sequel) , not only as potential criminals, but also as real people. She also discovers that another sinister element is present at the pageant. She investigates against the orders of her superior using all the means to find the dangerous criminal . Then she decides to investigate by his own in the contestant pageant and she befriends the beautiful contestants . Firstly she goes undercover to the contestant in San Antonio , Texas , where finds some clues. She tries to protect her new friends from dangerous attacker who attempts to blow up the pageant .This fun movie displays action , comedy, suspense and is pretty entertaining . In spite of some flaws , silly gags and camp glamour the film works well enough for a respectable light comedy with extra doses of amusement and entertainment . Sandra Bullock is sympathetic and funny as untameable tomboy agent , she shows no signs of having any femininity in her demeanor or appearance and her earnest clowning wins audience attractive. Bullock plays as a hybrid among Bridget Jones and Inspector Clouseau characters . Most of laughters come courtesy of her jokes and fights , both physical and verbal . Benjamin Bratt as her tough, brawny colleague is likable . They form a peculiar duo , making a special buddy movie . Lively , jolly musical score by Edward Shearmur and atmospheric cinematography by Lazslo Kovacs . The motion picture is professionally directed by Donald Petrie . The picture will appeal to Sandra Bullock fans. The following is titled ¨Miss Congeniality 2 : Armed and Fabulous¨ by John Pasquin with the same cast adding Treat Williams , Regina King and Enrique Murciano ; it is another Sandra Bullock vehicle and results to be an enjoyable sequel in which appears similar characters to first part . It deals again about the FBI agent Gracia Hart ,nowadays is assigned by her chief for advertising the FBI and traveling throughout the country along with a bodyguard agent .",Miss Congeniality
9,moonspinner55,There are 100 things wrong with it...but you may catch yourself smiling after thinking it over,6,4 October 2001,"It's over-the-top, it's occasionally offensive--to men, to women, to gays, to lesbians, and to poor Miss Hawaii--but ""Miss Congeniality"" has Sandra Bullock, and she's wonderful. The opening moments, with FBI agent Bullock busting Russians in a restaurant sting operation, are so good that the movie might've played very well as an FBI comedy-drama, with Bullock on different cases. I mean, maybe they should've ditched the pageant stuff, at least until next time. But, no, Bullock goes undercover as a contestant in the Miss U.S. pageant, and the movie turns into your typical makeover thing. Lots of breast jokes, TOO many high heel pratfalls, and Michael Caine as a peculiar makeover artist (he's ""dripping with disdain"" one minute, fatherly the next, then bitter, then cuddly). Bullock has no chemistry with Benjamin Bratt as her boss on the operation (that's not her fault, however) and I wanted more of her home life (and that doomed microwave oven), but what works does work well. Sandra's ""bonding"" paint party with the girls is terrific, as is her friendship with shaky Miss Rhode Island and her attempts to face down snarling Ernie Hudson as the FBI chieftain (who, like in ""Ghostbusters"", gets no funny lines). The movie rests solely on Bullock's shoulders, and she delivers. It may not be comic genius, but it is congenial. **1/2 from ****",Miss Congeniality
10,Quinoa1984,"Not totally good, but it has some charm",6,23 December 2000,"Believe me, I would be the last one to reccomend Miss Congeniality.  It has a conventional (not Congenial) script, dumb supporting characters (even though I can't resist laughing at William Shatner singing at the beauty pageant) and the usual sitcom drek.  But at least it has 2 things going for it, sandra Bullock who here has more charm and sexuality than ever (even if in parts Mel Gisbon in What Women Want has more femeninity than Bullock here) and it is better than Beautiful, the horrible piece from Sally Field.The story has Bullock as a tomboy fbi agent who has to go undercover as a beauty pageant contender to solve a case.  Basic, sure, but the usual dumb jokes (even if a couple are amusing) and dumb characters bring this film to a bad place.  However, Michael Caine is good for a few chuckles as a ""pageant consultant"".  It isn't the worst, but not really compatable to go up against films liek Cast Away, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Finding Forrester.  C",Miss Congeniality
11,michaelRokeefe,Gracie undercover. Gracie under fire.,5,28 March 2003,"This comedy at times is just plain silly. Gracie Hart(Sandra Bullock)is a tomboyish FBI agent that goes undercover as a beauty-contestant to catch a serial killer. Bullock fills the bill perfectly. She is not exactly hard to look at and slips into comedy real well. A diverse supporting cast that features Benjamin Bratt, Candice Bergen, Michael Caine and William Shatner.

14,hitchcockthelegend,The last time I was this naked in public I was coming out of a uterus!,7,1 July 2015,"Miss Congeniality finds Sandra Bullock as FBI Agent Gracie Hart, who must go undercover in the Miss United States beauty pageant to prevent a psychopath from committing untold homicide.The premise is simple, it's a Pygmalion/My Fair Lady scenario that transforms the rough and tough Gracie into a viable contestant for the pageant. Thus we have all the comedy that comes with her literally battling everyone, including her own opinions on pageants, as she is being asked to be something she doesn't believe is in her make up. The mystery of who the killer is who's on the loose is strong for a good portion of film, and even once it's known and drama takes centre stage, it's still hard to get the smile off of your face. The jokes are plentiful, with Bullock finding chemistry with all of her co-stars. She's a very under valued comedy actress, and her ability to bond with an entire cast is marvellous to observe. Reference sexual tension with Benjamin Bratt, the jousting hostilities with Ernie Hudson, the way she bounces off of the other beautiful girls, and best of all the by-play with Michael Caine, who is playing a camp stylist and walks in to lift the laughter roof off the rafters in every scene he is in.It doesn't push the boundaries of comedy, but it's thankfully a consistently funny piece of work, aided by a super cast on form who make a better comedy out of what the screenplay suggested it had any right to be. 7/10",Miss Congeniality
15,CinemaSerf,A Bullock in a china shop....,7,22 December 2020,"Sandra Bullock is clearly having some fun here as the accident-prone FBI agent who is roped into a scheme to prevent an atrocity happening at the upcoming ""Miss America"" pageant. Helped by the camply debonaire Sir Michael Caine as her fixer who manages to pull something of the silk purse from the sows ear, she heads off into this lions den of vacuousness, sexism and silliness led by a wonderfully two-faced Candice Bergen and her amiable sidekick William Shatner. It takes well aimed swipes at just about every stupid, stereotypical and misogynist attitude that surrounds these types of events - but it also demonstrates that many of the participants aren't quite as daft as one might expect. Bullock is on good form, the soundtrack helps a lot too - and as light hearted comedy films go; she and cutie Benjamin Bratt just about pull it off.

17,Uriah43,An Awkward Undercover Assignment,6,18 October 2019,"This film essentially begins with a bomb threat being mailed to the Miss United States pageant in San Antonio by a domestic terrorist who is known only as ""The Citizen"". Naturally, the FBI is notified immediately and it's then that the decision is made to have one of their agents named ""Gracie Hart"" (Sandra Bullock) go undercover as one of the beauty contestants. The problem with that, however, is that Gracie has been a tomboy all of her life and doesn't have a clue about how to act like a lady. So to remedy that a special beauty consultant by the name of ""Victor Melling"" (Michael Caine) is brought in to teach her the finer points of femininity. Unfortunately, this task turns out to be much more difficult than anybody ever imagined. Meanwhile, the further the pageant progresses the less likely it becomes that the FBI will be able to stop the terrorist before he can strike. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a nice little comedy which benefited from a good performances by William Shatner (as the Master-of-Ceremonies ""Stan Fields"") along with the aforementioned Sandra Bullock and Michael Caine. Admittedly, the humor was hit-and-miss at times and the plot was rather predictable at times as well. But even so, I thought the movie was worth the time spent to watch it and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Miss Congeniality

She is assigned to go undercover as Miss New Jersey due to a bomb threat. Enter Michael Caine as an image consultant set to get her ready. Major flaw regards predicting the villain, which the screenwriter makes no attempt to conceal. Pointless action opener hits formula full force. Director Donald Petrie is backed by colorful sets but he is dealing with material that has been done to death. The pageant theme was done far better and funnier in the underrated Drop Dead Gorgeous. Petrie previously made The Associate as well as the low grade My Favorite Martian crap fest. Bullock is funny and certainly present humour but she is introduced in a standard opening then we are suppose to believe that she is hot or not due too her outfit. Caine is also a capable actor but his role as the consultant is pretty standard. Benjamin Bratt plays a moron cop who couldn't see past the makeup. He will notice Bullock in the aftermath, which is pretty typical of these films. William Shatner is featured to overact and he does so non stop, as well as Candice Bergen as a former pageant winner who is less of a winner here.

19,HotToastyRag,Absolutely hilarious,9,24 November 2017,"Sandra Bullock, in her infinite grunginess and masculinity, plays an FBI agent, alongside Benjamin Bratt and Ernie Hudson. When the bureau becomes aware of a bomb threat in the Miss United States pageant, Sandra is sent to go undercover as one of the contestants. She's been sufficiently uglied-up in the first part of the movie, so when Michael Caine gives her a makeover and lets her make her grand entrance in a lavender tube dress, she wows the characters in the film as well as the audience! Miss Congeniality is superbly hilarious, and a fantastic hallmark to the end of the never-to-be-repeated 90s comedies. In this lovely genre, that you can only truly appreciate if you lived through it, there are politically incorrect jokes, hardly risqué sexual innuendo, and underlying old-school values. The very premise that a masculine, ugly woman would have to be given a makeover in order to compete in a beauty contest for work would never get made into a film today. But, in the 90s, it was a great idea, and this film was wildly popular at the box office.Candice Bergen, doing an excellent Martha Stewart impression, and William Shatner, another politically incorrect character, are the heads of the Miss United States pageant, and Heather Burns is one of the airhead contestants. If you really hate Sandra Bullock, you probably won't like the movie. But, if you like her or are neutral, you'll split your sides with laughter. She and her costars are pretty hilarious, and everyone in the audience, whether they're an agent or contestant at heart, will find something to laugh at. Watch the preview, since it's a pretty accurate representation of the film, and if you crack up, you'll want to add Miss Congeniality to your collection.

20,Sylviastel,A Fun Movie that will leave you in stitches long after!,10,6 February 2006,"I have to admit that I wasn't first crazy about this movie. But I watched it a couple of times on television and I still laugh about it. Sandra Bullock is perfect and I can watch her in anything anyway. She is one of the down to earth of today's crop of stars. Well, she plays Gracie Hart or Gracie Freebush (an F.B.I. agent turned pageant contestant) representing my state of New Jersey. I love Benjamin Bratt in the role of the other F.B.I. agent. I love Sir Michael Caine as the flamboyant pageant consultant. It's nice to see Ernie Hudson working again. I love watching William Shatner as the pageant maestro and the multi-talented Candice Bergen as Miss Morningstar. Both Shatner and Bergen are pretty good at their roles in this film. Maybe that's why they work so well together in Boston Legal. This movie has it's moments. I didn't care for the scene which Miss New York comes out of the closet. I felt that was silly and useless. They could have edited it out. Then the guys asked ""Is it okay we say lesbian on television?"" Then the female (let me guess that's she a lesbian too) retorts ""Do you have a problem with that?"" It's kind of the worst part of the film for me and embarrassing overall. But then you get to the crowning which I can't imagine a funnier moment in the film which I won't spoil for those who have yet to see it.",Miss Congeniality
21,SimonJack,Decent comedy before large events were used for real violence,7,13 October 2021,"""Miss Congeniality"" sees Sandra Bullock go undercover as a police officer to stop a bomb from exploding at the Miss Untied States pageant. Bullock was hit and miss in the few comedies she made, but this is one of the good ones. She is a natural for straight-faced comedy. And the cast for this fun frolic and mystery at a beauty pageant is very good with some other prominent actors of the day. Michael Caine, William Shatner and Candice Bergen have very good roles, and the rest of the supporting cast are good.The plot for this comedy crime action picture is quite far out. Before the turn of the 21st century, it would have been thought preposterous. And that may work toward its comedic success at the time.But things have changed in the 21st century. Some real terrorist and madmen disasters at large events make plots like this no longer seem so unlikely. Events such as the Boston Marathon bombing of April 15, 2013, and the Las Vegas music festival shootings of Oct. 2, 2017, are sobering reminders and warnings. Large entertainment and sporting events can easily be magnets for crazy people who want to make a ""statement"" or get recognition for something. So, freedom of movement at events is now restrained by security measures that are needed to protect the public.Most mature adults in modern times should still be able to enjoy the humor of this film.",Miss Congeniality

But everyone at the police station get a surprise after gay man Michael Caine gives her a makeover, and she turns from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan. Of course, now she must compete in the beauty pageant, judged by William Shatner, and along the way she has to be stuck with countless beauty-freak women who powder their noses at all hours. This drives Bullock's character crazy, and I guess that's really all this film is about.Sandra Bullock is one of the most impressive actresses in Hollywood right now, mainly because she is not overly-beautiful--she can fit everyday parts. It's a bit harder to find someone like Angelina Jolie, with big breasts and puffy lips playing a cop (""The Bone Collector"") than seeing Bullock play one, mainly because she can seem very tom-boyish as we see in the beginning of the film. I've always thought that her jaw is (a bit) big. Her facial features seem to be a bit strong, and it kind of gives her a not-too-beautiful look, causing her to be able to play just about any role she wants. Oh, and unlike Angelina Jolie, she can act, too. Another thing respectable about Miss Bullock is that she doesn't seem to have had any surgery done to make herself appear more attractive--someone like Jolie looks like a Barbie Doll more than a human being. Therefore the only roles she can get are in films like ""Tomb Raider,"" yet because of Sandra Bullock's appearence, she can seem to fit any role.Michael Caine wouldn't be my first choice as a gay beauty expert, but his acting is so good that it doesn't matter. It's hard to even tell his character is supposed to be gay, other than a quick one or two references at the beginning of the movie. But regardless of that mess, he seems to fit the part pretty well, and delivers a good performance.William Shatner is funny in a parody role, and provides only more comic relief.""Miss Congeniality"" was a bit disappointing, but with actors like Sandra Bullock, Benjamin Bratt, Michael Caine and William Shatner, you can't really go wrong...can you?Verdict: 3/5 stars -John Ulmer",Miss Congeniality

26,OllieSuave-007,"I love this movie, Bullock was great!",10,17 July 2004,"This is one of my favorite movies. It is full of comedy, action, music, and suspense. This is one of Sandra Bullock's best roles. I loved how they transferred an unkempt FBI agent Gracie Hart (Bullock) into a ""ravishing"" Gracie Lou Freebush so she could go undercover in the beauty pageant. I also especially enjoyed watching the opening where a little Gracie Hart punches out a bully who tormented the boy she had a crush on.Along with Sandra Bullock, this movie has an all-star case: Benjamin Bratt, Michael Caine, William Shatner, Candice Bergen and Ernie Hudson-each giving a delightful performance in a movie about an FBI agent going undercover in a beauty pageant to track down a terrorist group that is threatening to blow up the pageant. It is a fast-paced story from start to finish.Overall, a very enjoyable movie to watch again and again.Grade A",Miss Congeniality
27,theowinthrop,What is the Value of the Modern Beauty Contest?,10,28 July 2007,"A very funny film, with a first rate cast, MISS CONGENIALITY deals with examining the value of an American institution. When I was growing up one of the yearly television events I always recalled was the ""Miss America"" pageant (as well as the other beauty pageant for ""Miss Universe""). Watching Bert Parks' singing the ""Miss America"" song was on the same level as watching the Thanksgiving Day parade or the Superbowl. In fact, when Parks was fired from ""Miss America"" in the 1980s, the pageant lost many viewers out of sympathy with Bert. But that dropping of Parks was an example of what the producers of the show faced in the 1980s. There had been dwindling interest and ratings for several years. Many felt the show was old fashioned because of the idiotic talent sections and the stupid questions (Question:""What do you wish for?""; Usual answer: ""World peace!""). Others, especially feminists, were put off by the idea that the contests were demeaning ""meat markets"" displaying women for sex purposes only - and not really emphasizing women's brains. The pageants are still around, but they lack the exposure they had back in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Even recent scandals have made one question the entire idea more (the best known Miss America of the last twenty years was Vanessa Williams, who lost the title for an infraction of the rules, and subsequently had a successful - and still flourishing - acting career: something that rarely happens to the regular winners).Here, there has been a bombing (and killing) at the ""Miss United States"" beauty pageant. As a result an FBI team is assigned to figure out who did this. The team happens to find evidence that suggests a ""Unibomber"" type did, but they don't know for certain. One of the recent recruits, Sandra Bullock, is to enter the contest as ""Miss New Jersey"". This is done with the knowledge of the contest's chairperson and spokeswoman (and former ""Miss United States"") Candace Bergen. Bergen is not happy about the choice: Bullock is all professional FBI agent, with little in the way of a sense of fun, and absolutely no sense of style or even rudimentary knowledge of make-up. The FBI team, headed by Benjamin Bratt, assigns a former member of the ""Miss United States"" pageant (Michael Caine) to ""prettify"" and prepare Bullock for her assignment. It almost leads to mutual murder. Caine is a man of style and knows what wins contest audiences. Nothing he sees about Bullock remotely covers this. Bullock finds Caine insulting (he admits to a stylish elitism), and she finds the new regimen impossible. Not only must she learn some talent (they finally pick up on her playing the musical glasses, like Ben Franklin's armonica), but she has to walk with poise, be graceful, and keep her weight under control (some of the best jokes deal with her constant attempts at stealing donuts when she is supposed to be eating carrots and vegetables). She is also trying to see the value of the contest. Bullock believes in the modern age of feminism, and works hard at being a good agent. She sees the contest as a sexist, out-of-date affair. She also notes it brings out the worst in the other contestants, most of whom are basically good types but are now taking cheap shots at each other in efforts to win the contest. She is particularly protective about ""Miss Rhode Island"" (Heather Burns), who seems to have self-confidence problems and hopes to improve herself by winning the contest.Bullock is also finding her current job annoying in a non-professional manner: she and Bratt are both attracted to each other, but she can't find any time to make time for him (nor he for her). If they get together it is for the business of finding the bomber threatening the contest, or for Bratt taking a sullen Bullock for training sessions with a snooty Caine. This is hardly a good way to develop a love affair.Finally there is the problem of Candace Bergen - a long time supporter of the contest, she sees it as actually helping the winners by giving them scholarships that can assist them in furthering careers in all professions (and thus raising the image of women). And she resents the all-to-easy dismissal Bullock keeps bringing up when she shows what she thinks of the contest.The film also has it's version of Parks, in it's traditional host played by William Shatner. Certainly not the same as his ""Captain Kirk"" or even (currently) ""Denny Crane"", Shatner's ""Stan Fields"" has a popular following among the older generation, who like his pleasant inane jokes (you can tell after awhile what he's going to say as a joke), and his singing the theme song. His performance is like additional icing on the cake. And a well made cake it is.",Miss Congeniality
28,Lejink,More Miss than hit...,3,9 August 2010,"In which America's latter-day sweetheart, Sandra Bullock, a tomboy-ish FBI operative, is coerced into attempting to become Miss America en-route to foiling the plans of a mysterious saboteur aiming to set off a bomb at this year's pageant. Cue all the weak gags you could imagine at easy targets (chauvinist males, airhead beauties, effeminate beauticians), some romantic interest between Bullock and her slightly girlish male FBI superior and guess how it all turns out by the end.Behind Ms Bullock's star turn, big-name support Messrs Caine and Shatner get to see who can camp it up the most (Shatner wins by a mile!) while among the beauty contestants themselves, no one really announces themselves as a possible new talent.As for the star herself, she gets to pratfall and smart-ass her way through the plot, benefiting from the predictable slow-motion makeover from wallflower to hottie until you get to the slapstick finish with the tagged on happy ending and wonder like me how you could spend time viewing such infantile nonsense.Reese Witherspoon did this kind of thing so much better in ""Legally Blonde"".",Miss Congeniality
29,bowmanblue,Sandra shines,8,29 January 2015,"Sandra Bullock has been known to be a little 'typecast' sometimes – always playing the 'loveable, but kooky' leading lady. Okay, so despite a few attempts to move away from that image, 'loveable and kooky' is what she does best. And she does it very well here.In 'Miss Congeniality' she plays an FBI agent who has to go undercover in the Miss America beauty contest in order to protect its participants from someone threatening the event. I recently watched the X-files – another show centring on FBI agents. I couldn't help but laugh at the difference the 'Bureau' is portrayed in both shows. In the X-files they're all serious and professional, in 'Miss Congeniality' they kind of behave like frat boys at a college party.But then that's what Miss Congeniality is. It's not meant to be taken seriously, nor does it ever try. It's one of those perfect films that you can simply sit down and relax with. You won't need much brainpower to appreciate it. Sandra Bullock is as lovable and endearing as she always is and you won't care that the whole concept is kind of silly. How anyone fails to notice that Sandra Bullock isn't attractive, just because she wears glasses and doesn't brush her hair is beyond me!Although Bullock naturally carries the show as she's transformed from 'tom-boy FBI agent' to glamorous beauty queen (a process that can apparently be achieved overnight – but, again, never mind, eh?), it's worth noting that Michael Caine also has a role to play. He comes close to stealing every scene as the uptight Englishman the FBI have employed to mould her into 'Miss New Jersey.' There are no surprises plot-wise. You'll probably guess who the bad guys – really – are and there's the natural romantic sub-plot thrown in, just because. But, as long as you're only looking for pure entertainment, you probably won't care.This is a great movie to watch with other people. Sit back, crack open the popcorn, put your brain on hold and enjoy. Miss Congeniality is a classic in its own, laid back, easy-going league. No, it'll never be remembered in the same breath as the true cinematic greats, such as the Godfather etc, but then it's not meant to be. Just remember that while you're watching Sandra stumble into things and trip over on her heels.",Miss Congeniality
30,ThomasDrufke,Never Mess With an Agent in a Dress,7,17 August 2019,"I'm not going to lie, I'm a little mad I missed the day of Sandra Bullock rom-coms. She's done great work over the last 7-10 years but it's too few and far between and I can't remember the last true rom-com she's done. I was far too young to see Miss Congeniality when it was released, which makes it more impressive that *for the most part* the film holds up well. I can't defend some of the jokes or sexism clearly shown by Gracie's colleagues. But I enjoyed Bullock's 'transformation' and her dual role, she's always had a keen knack for timely physical humor - see Heat for example. The follows similar romantic beats and deploys more cliches than it needs to, but it works well enough. And hey, I will always be open to more Michael Caine, especially in roles he doesn't typically play.7.0/10",Miss Congeniality
31,secondtake,"Bullock is totally winning, and wins this contest hands down. Worth it just for her!",7,17 July 2010,"Miss Congeniality (2000)A funny plot full of clever hooks, and an amazing, charming, full on performance by Sandra Bullock make this movie really funny. And warm. And fun.It would be a mistake and shame to expect more from it, and there are times where it gets a little too silly for its own good, including some of the last half hour. But what works, works, and the first hour of build up, and of Bullock's transformation (and her sparks of humor and authenticity through it all) are first rate. Michael Caine supports her as he supports everyone in the business, with class and finesse. Benjamin Bratt, playing a kind of distant love interest for Bullock's FBI agent cum beauty contestant, is a little to aware of his good looks and doesn't quite relax enough to make him a star. He could learn a lot from Caine and Bullock, who are both consummate actors capable of saving, and even lifting up, a mostly routine production. For lightweight fare, it's a joy. By the way, the only ""Miss United States"" beauty pageant is an ""on-line"" contest, with a hefty entry fee, and seems to be a commercial and possibly exploitive tie-in to the movie. The famous (and infamous) national pageants are Miss America and Miss USA. This movie is meant to play off the stereotypes of what the contestants are often like, and it provides for some pretty good fodder.",Miss Congeniality
32,CuriosityKilledShawn,Unessential potboiler,5,22 April 2001,"And not too demanding but not exactly a no-brainer. It's the perfect movie to relax to. Sandra Bullock is charming enough as a tough, tom-boy FBI agent and the resulting hijinks as she tries to track down a Miss America killer is amusing fare indeed.The direction, although pedestrian, has enough flare and the script has enough interesting moments to make the by-the-numbers film-making disappear. The characters are interesting too. Benjamin Bratt was my fave but the others, including some of the Pageant contestants strangely enough, were entertaining although not engaging. The film does have flaws (Sandra Bullock's laugh and some over-sugary moments) but for easy on the brain entertainment that neither confirms nor contradicts Sandra Bullock's position as a Superstar. 5/10",Miss Congeniality

OK I thought it was pretty well written for the most part, but it does have it's fair share of Plot holes, however just enjoy it for what it is a highly entertaining film, that's meant to entertain!. I thought it was hilarious when Sandra brought in pizza and took the Pageant contestants out partying and drinking, plus it also amusing when she kept falling and tripping. I am really looking forward to seeing the sequel, and The ending was really cool too, plus Bullock and Benjamin Bratt made a great team!.

Michael Caine is fantastic here, he brought lots of charm and wit, and even though he was rather unlikable at the start, he really grew on me throughout the movie, as I really loved his performance!. Benjamin Bratt is excellent here, he was funny, and had some awesome scenes with Bullock, as I loved how they worked together. Candice Bergen as always plays a great bitch, and here is no different, as she is a wonderful actress!, I always enjoy watching her. Ernie Hudson is good with what he had to do I dug him.

34,The-Sarkologist,The FBI and a Beaty Pagent,3,10 November 2020,"I'm not really too sure about this film. I guess the reason that I ended up watching it was because, well, I haven't see it, and since my Mum seemed to like it I thought I might give it a go. Well, one thing that I can say is that I didn't actually find it all that funny. I could see where it was supposed to be funny, but the reality was that I didn't get any laughs whatsoever.Basically the film is about this rough and tumble FBI agent that goes undercover I in a beauty pageant to try and locate a serial bomber before this serial bomber strikes. Another thing that I should probably mention is that she is also one of these agents that constantly gets into trouble, so basically has to be pulled off of paperwork to actually do this. Needless to say that she really isn't all that thrilled about participating in this role.It sort of surprised me to see Michael Caine in this film, since it certainly did not seem to be one of those films that I would have expected him to be in - I sort of thought that he tended to be pretty picky, that is until I discovered the number of movies that he as been in, so I guess, well, he isn't. Still, I was sort of surprised, not that he was actually playing a particularly bad character, it was just a particularly, well, not that great a film.I guess one of the ideas that comes out is that women who participate in beauty contests (let's call them what they are), aren't actually as bad, or as stupid, as people think they are. The other thing that is suggested is that a lot of these contests have been rigged - like, they have already decided who is going to be the winner long beforehand, and they are just doing it as another form of entertainment (sort of like the wrestling).Anyway, it was fun to watch - no not really, it was actually pretty silly to be honest with you, and I am sort of glad that I have put it behind me now and I can go and do other things with my life.",Miss Congeniality

Maybe mostly thanks to Sandra Bullock's naturally funny acting. Maybe because Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses (just not in 'Murder by Numbers', where she ruined the film in my opinion!). I also immensely enjoyed Michael Caine in this film. The interesting-ish plot was wonderfully done, me thinks. I did find Sandra's bad girl impression a bit forced, as it doesn't really suit her, but the 'transformation' was fun to watch. The whole set-up of Candice Bergen's character together with her son's evil plot was a bit silly, though, and not really believable. It could have been done so much better.

The film is blessed by a strong supporting cast who make the most out of the admittedly thin material. Michael Caine has a lot of fun playing 'Educating Rita' again with Bullock's unrefined agent while also making amusing advances towards a fellow field agent played by Benjamin Bratt. Candice Bergen has a very juicy part too as the pageant coordinator who believes (a bit too passionately) in the importance of the event. The film trips up though by spending too much time on Bullock being excessively manly in nature, thoughtlessly spontaneous and a klutz in high heels. Bullock, after all, shines brightest in the role when using her wit and when interacting with Bratt, with whom she has terrific chemistry. The film does not exactly tread any new ground in suggesting that pageant contestant can be funny, intelligent people too and the crime subplot that overtakes the final third is a little over-the-top, but the film beams with such positive messages regarding acceptance of others and friendship in unexpected places that it is an easy film to warm to.

45,dfranzen70,Comedy isn't only skin deep,8,13 February 2001,"Sandra Bullock stars as a tough tomboyish FBI agent who must go undercover as a beauty contestant in order to sniff out a mad bomber's plot. I know,sounds goofy, doesn't it? One of America's Sweethearts playing an uglier-than-thou role. Trust me, though; Miss Bullock does pull it off. Bullock's Gracie Hart is mousy and sloppy. She chews with her mouth open, spits, burps, and is generally the very picture of uncouth behavior.
One of her colleagues, Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) finally gets the opportunity to run his own operation - stop the series of mad-bombers. He's not especially bright; he's more of a pretty boy who's more interested in playing with the ladies than in working on a case, although he loves the glory attached to success. The FBI learns that the next probable target for this bomber is the Miss United States Pageant to be held in San Antonio, Texas, right next door to the Alamo. After much fruitless deliberation, Eric finally decides an officer must go undercover at the pageant and, of course, he settles on Gracie, who looks (in these scenes) about as sexy as a muddy street. Ah, but Gracie must undergo a bit of a transformation! Enter disgraced pageant mentor Victor Melling (Michael Caine). Victor's task: transform Gracie into a princess. In scenes reminiscent of My Fair Lady (Gracie even calls him ""Henry Higgins"" at one point), Victor shows Gracie how to walk, how to talk, and how to eat like a lady. Mission accomplished! Except for the talent... But Gracie does manage to find a way!What's most surprising about this movie is Bullock's success in playing a down-and-dirty role. As Gracie, she's not supposed to be a cute girl playing a slob; she's a slob playing a cutie. And since Bullock is pretty darn cute herself, she's a cutie playing a slob playing a cutie. That ain't easy, folks. (Not that I know firsthand, mind you.) And her prowess at playing physical comedy is also quite formidable. Case in point: In an early scene, Gracie comes home from work very frustrated. She slams doors, knocks into things accidentally, opens the freezer and takes out a frozen dinner, and tosses it into the microwave. Then slams its door shut and starts away. Only it doesn't close. So she comes back and slams it again. Still won't close. She's getting more and more frustrated - and I'm sure you can all relate to this - and the process repeats a few times. Finally, she wedges a cooking spoon in the door jamb to make it stay shut. I was rolling at that point, and I was not alone in my mirth!Bullock's supporting crew is fine, although I think Bratt was a bit of a pain (character-wise, and no pun intended). Bullock's FBI boss (Ernie Hudson) was fair, but inconsequential. The coolest characters were played by Candace Bergen (as the pageant director) and William Shatner (as the pageant's host, a la Bert Parks). Both were wildly over the top. And yes, Shatner sings.This was a surprisingly good film. Watch it!",Miss Congeniality

Michael Caine also does a fantastic job, adding some class to the proceedings. The script does the rest, which is funnier than it has any right to be.

50,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Most hilarious and glamorous Sandra Bullock movie I've ever seen!,10,17 November 2005,"Wow! MISS CONGENIALITY, in my opinion, is the most hilarious and glamorous Sandra Bullock movie I've ever seen. Even though I didn't laugh that much, I still enjoyed the movie. I thought that Gracie (Sandra Bullock) looked absolutely pretty in the dressy clothing she wore. Even so, if you ask me, her snorting laugh was very annoying, and I didn't like the way she looked with those glasses on. Also, I was surprised to see that Ernie Hudson from THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE was in this. My absolute favorite part of this movie is when Gracie flashes her badge while she is at Starbucks and says, ""FBI. You might want to stay out of this."" That was absolutely hilarious! Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this movie did a good job! Keep up the good work! Now, in conclusion, to all you Sandra Bullock fans who have not seen MISS CONGENIALITY, I recommend it! You're in for a good time and lots of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it today. You'll be glad you did.",Miss Congeniality
51,davispittman,Entertaining cute Bullock movie,7,10 March 2017,"Miss Congeniality (2000) is a funny, entertaining comedy/action movie starring Sandra Bullock. Bullock is great as the lead, she really nails the tomboyish cop turned into undercover beauty pageant contestant role. Benjamin Bratt is good as the male cop love interest for Bullock. But really the #1 cast member here has to be Michael Caine. Caine is just a perfect choice for his role and he delivers a lot of hilarious lines that work well for his character. The writing works most of the time, the lines of dialogue are for the most part very funny and unique to the individual characters. Oh and I almost forgot about Candice Bergen! I think Bergen was a great choice for the villainous role of the bitter beauty pageant director wanting revenge for what she believes was wrong doing. There are many funny enjoyable scenes that most everyone will like. And there are also moments of sincereness/warm heartedness. 7/10 for Miss Congeniality.",Miss Congeniality
52,Enchorde,Actually pretty good,7,30 January 2005,"** And my answer would be; here might be spoilers **Recap: Gracie Hart (Bullock), a tomboy all her life, is now an FBI agent in the doghouse after she disobeyed orders on her latest assignment, which then went out of control. Her partner and friend Matthews (Bratt) save her from desk work when they need an undercover agent in Miss United States beauty pageant. It is believed that a known terrorist Mr Citizen is planning an attack on the competition. Hart, however, despises such competitions and don't own a hairbrush. Victor Melling (Caine) is brought in to train her to become a believable contestant. But her new lifestyle and old one don't really match, and the mission is on the brink of being cancelled, potentially resulting in her losing her job. And when the terrorist they sought is caught, and she still thinks the contest is threatened somehow, she is on her own.Comments: Not expecting much, I was actually surprised. This movie doesn't have any deep philosophical message, but it never pretend to have it. The story might be trivial and superficial, but it is actually pretty funny. The story is given a nice spin, and the clash between Hart's new and former lifestyle puts everything in a comic perspective. Bullock is very good both as her old and new persona, and a very good comedian as well. Both Bratt and especially Caine gives good supporting efforts and Shatner also brings a little something to the movie. With the nice use of story and the comic elements in it and the good performances from the cast this is actually a very enjoyable movie. Good entertainment for an evening at home.7/10",Miss Congeniality

She plays the same character in every movie I've seen her in since that sorry box-office bonanza.  In this outing she is an FBI semi-slob who goes undercover in a beauty contest because without that unbelievable bit of whimsy there would be no movie.  Everything goes downhill from there.  Only saving grace is Michael Caine who plays the part of the audience very well.  I laughed once or twice and was not rolling my eyes. That does not mean it was good, it means there was nothing else on when I felt like seeing a movie.",Miss Congeniality
54,Samiam3,"Cute and pretty, but doesn't quite take the crown",6,29 July 2010,"Miss Congeniality is no dumber than any other low brow Hollywood comedy, but unfortunately, its stupidity is of slightly greater quantity than its humour. I cannot say I wasn't entertained. The film can be enjoyed on some level, but the laughs are too few and when they come, they come as sort of painful wincing jokes (the kind that Curb your Enthusiasm is comprised of) and not so much ha-ha jokes. Some of the jokes actually fall flat. The end result is a cute hundred minute feature, but it is not very effective as a comedy.Of all the crazy places for an FBI agent to go undercover in, how about the Miss America beauty pageant. Agent Gracie Hart has 48 hours to make the transformation from New Jersey middle class schlep to world class, top quality princess. There is the possibility that a bombing might take place there.Sandra Bullock isn't actually that bad on screen. I wouldn't go so far as to say she is funny, but she does what she is supposed to. The movie doesn't. Perhaps the makers were afraid that if they made it too funny, it would be silly. Little do they know that the film is silly enough already.",Miss Congeniality
55,triple8,Rough beginning but it gets a bit better,5,25 March 2005,"I am really both ways on this. The beginning was so bad I almost wrote it off right then. I mean it's as bad as a comedy can possibly be with some of the most unfunny slapstick I have ever seen. But it does get better. Sandra Bullock is so much fun to watch as she's quite the comedic actress that the movie has, at times an odd likeabilty about it even though it's really not all that good.I enjoyed it more as it went on. The problem is the dreadful beginning(or maybe it's me, I am not a major fan of slapstick particularly this much of it and so obnoxious as it is.) But the beauty contest theme, unoriginal as it is, works here, mainly because of Bullock. The plot isn't bad, but at times it gets abrasive.I have no idea why they felt the need to do a miss congeniality two. But for what it was, this isn't awful, what's good to do here is skip certain parts, it's the kind of movie where certain parts are great, certain parts are dreadful. In all honesty, it's only about average, but another lesser actress and it probably would have been dreadful. My vote is 5 of 10.",Miss Congeniality
56,Sherazade,This is a movie that was made to make you laugh and it does just that!,9,22 March 2006,"Okay, so maybe in the beginning Sandy (that would be Sandra Bullock but I love to call her Sandy) plays her character Gracie Hart a little too caricature and overblown in terms of the grotesque tomboyish nature she is trying to bring out in this character, but once that phase is over and she has established to the audience that Gracie's not just your average girl, Sandy relaxes and the laughter begins. Her character Gracie Hart is an FBI agent who is lured into a beauty pageant by her partner and interim boss (played by the ever alluring Benjamin Bratt) to help foil the plot of a recent terror threat the Bureau received regarding the next Miss United States pageant (not to be confused with the Miss America pageant). And if you've seen the way Gracie Hart was just introduced to the audience in the scenes prior to the announcement that she will now be the new Miss New Jersey, then you know that whoever has the task of turning her into a beauty queen sure would be needing tons of therapy after-wards (and that is if they succeed). The scenes play out in such a funny manner that if you do not laugh as Gracie is being transformed into pageant material then, maybe something is wrong with your funny bone. Anyways, if you study the characters very well as they are introduced to the audience when Gracie finally completes her transformation, it won't be too hard for you to figure out where the terror threat came from. But if you're one of those people who can still enjoy films without over-analyzing it, then sit back, relax, enjoy and be shocked by the surprise twist and ending. There is one scene that did bother me though, when the queen was crowned and one of the runner-ups (who turned out to be a lesbian) had an outburst. It was not only tacky, it seemed forced and they should have left that on the cutting room floor. Nevertheless, Sandy and Benjamin have an on screen magic like you've never seen before. As they say about chemistry, you either got it, or you don't. :-)",Miss Congeniality
57,PredragReviews,"""Dirty Harriet""",8,31 May 2016,"Comedy starring Sandra Bullock as Gracie Hart, a tough girl cop who is obsessed with her job, doesn't have time for relationships and despises anything girly. After bungling a police operation, Gracie is consigned to go undercover as Miss New Jersey in the Miss USA beauty contest, resulting in hilarious elocution and posture lessons from an etiquette coach, excellently played by Michael Caine. As she just about convincingly gets through the extensive eliminating rounds, the cynical Gracie gets to know some of the other girls and is gradually transformed in her outlook to femininity and love. Inevitably she spots the saboteur, saves the day and ends the film as a more understanding heroine.The plot idea is extremely thin and it's only the charming performance of Bullock that gets the viewer through. She's ably assisted by the wonderful Michael Caine who pops up in the great role of Victor Melling, the man that must transform Gracie into a beauty queen and William Shatner makes good work of his role as Stan Fields the master of ceremonies. It's great to see these two old actors hamming their parts up for all they are worse. I'll also mention the cute and appealing Heather Burns who as Miss Rhode Island personifies every cliché of the pageant scene and yet still makes a lovely character.

With the regaled Victor Melling (Caine) contracted to refine her rough edges and prepare her for contest, pageant director Candice Bergen recoils at the thought of such a tomboy compromising the exacting standards, poking fun at the almost sacrosanct beauty pageant industry.Apart from the precision professionalism of Caine and Bergen in their respective roles as perfectionists, Benjamin Bratt successfully breaks his ""Law and Order"" mould as Bullock's practical joking colleague, while ex-Ghostbuster Ernie Hudson plays the long suffering police chief.While the momentum sags a little early in the second half, William Shatner fills the void as the flamboyant and faithful right hand man to Bergen, showing his comedic talents first discovered on ""Star Trek"" had not waned over the intervening years. With a cast that seem to be comfortable in their roles and genuinely enjoying the witty dialogue, the laughs are solid and the general tone is enjoyable to watch.

While it is pretty much a basic, by-the-numbers comedy/rom-com, Bullock is a pleasure as always, and the fun spirit of the film elevates it beyond the standard script.Bullock plays Gracie Hart, a tomboy FBI agent with frumpy hair, baggy clothes and a fiery temper. All of her male agents view her as just ""one of the guys"", and she clearly isn't feminine at all. When a domestic terrorist called ""The Citizen"" threatens the upcoming Miss United States pageant, fellow agent Eric Mathews (Benjamin Bratt) accidentally realizes that if she was fixed up, Hart could potentially look good enough to be shoehorned into the competition as a ""contestant"" in order to watch over the proceedings and help with the investigation. With the help of Victor Melling (Michael Caine), a tough yet funny pageant coach, Hart is transformed into ""Gracie Lou Freebush"", the new ""contestant"" from New Jersey. She goes undercover to look for clues and help protect the other contestants.Some strong supporting roles are also played by Candice Bergen as the pageant director and William Shatner as the pageants longtime emcee. Heather Burns also brings some nice laughs as Miss Rhode Island, whom befriends Gracie, and is a total sweetheart, despite her ""ditzyness.""The film, to be perfectly open and honest, is pretty darned generic. Nothing really exists in the film to set it apart from other comedies. It's a pretty bland script, and the concept, though cute, is derivative of other films and of conventions and clichés of comedy. But what makes this film work, and why I love it so much, is because of the great chemistry of the cast, and because of Bullock. She has always impressed me as an actress, and she is flawlessly able to pull off both the comedic and dramatic aspects of her roles. She is one of my favorite actresses, and I have a lot of respect for her as a person. Her giddiness and fun, quirky attitude is what makes this film work.The direction is halfway decent, though a few gags are phoned-in and fall flat. The editing, music and all of that is also very adequate. Like I said, this isn't a film you watch for the plot, this is a film you watch for Sandra Bullock and the rest of the cast.I'm giving this a strong 8 out of 10.

Of course,being 100% tomboy,Gracie is going to need as much work as possible to sand away all the rough edges that are her so as to make her ruse as a contestant more palatable. That means being tutored in being lady-like by a soft-spoken-yet-sardonic(and gay,natch)handler(played with good-humored dignity by Michael CAine).The rest of the cast is filled with notable supporting cast that seems to fill out each character ably,if not remarkably: Benjamin Bratt as a fellow agent and potential love interest,Ernie Hudson as her inscrutable,grouchy boss,William Shatner as a preening,near-oblivious pageant Emcee and Candice Bergen as the ever-smiling pageant producer and coordinator with something to hide. Director Donald Petrie probably didn't have to be there,and the material(the screenplay writers' names escape me)seems to be a mere blueprint for action rather than character development. That leaves the majority of the effect of this film on the shoulders of the actors and the players involved(particularly Bullock,Shatner and many of the other contestants)seem to be moving it along with little effort and plenty of fun. I first saw this movie because a friend of mine--a girl,who wasn't my girlfriend--really liked this movie and quoted it somewhat often. Since I was quietly developing a crush on her,I decided to try this out and found myself pleasantly surprised. That was seven years ago,and I just ran into this by chance on Bravo! the other night and felt like I needed to clean some of the other movie I'd just watched that evening(I won't divulge which movie it was,only that is was more recent and was a very good but very dark,morbid and slightly depressing film)out of my head,so I re-watched this.

Sandra plays federal agent assigned to identify killer from the inside of a national beauty pageant, as she becomes ""Miss New Jersey"". Bratt does well as her fellow agent and Caine excels as delicate coach hired to make her a star. The comedy is played pretty broad (to say the least) but some of Sandra's acting out about having to be beautiful is really good fun. On the other hand, Sandra's pretty damn good looking to be holding down the plain tomboy role. But I still keep coming back so there must be something there. 8 out of 10",Miss Congeniality

The beauty pageant contestants are reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes, which is not offensive but pretty dull.  And most of the supporting cast is one-dimensional, though some are amusing.  I liked Michael Caine as the pageant consultant.  Bill Shatner looks like a total cartoon, but considering the roles he's taken after quitting ""Star Trek""--this is a high point.  And of course, Sandra Bullock shines as usual.  She was perfectly suited in her role as a tomboy, and I like how her character didn't fade out, even after the arduous makeover.  She definitely shows off her knack for physical comedy more than she has in her past comedies.It's hard to find a perfect comedy nowadays, so naturally this movie misses the mark here and there--the running joke of Bullock tripping on high heels wasn't funny at first, and it wasn't necessary to repeat it again and again. But when the movie hits the mark--it does it successfully!  I have to admit, I received lots of big laughs!  And overall, this is just a fun movie--emphasize the word ""fun.""

65,jhclues,Bullock And Caine Get The Ribbon,8,30 December 2000,"There's trouble in Texas and a lot of laughs in store for the audience, as Sandra Bullock stars in the engaging satirical comedy, `Miss Congeniality,' directed by Donald Petrie.  When the possible threat of violence at the `Miss United States' beauty pageant surfaces, the F.B.I. meets the challenge by sending in one of their own agents, Gracie Hart (Bullock), undercover as one of the contestants.  There's one slight problem, however; Gracie is the right agent for the job, but she'd be more comfortable wearing a championship WWF belt than striking a pose in a swimsuit.  Not to worry, though, because pageant organizer Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergen) has just the man to transform her into the beauty she must be, and he has all of two days in which to do it.  The man of the hour (and the Professor Higgins to Gracie's Eliza) is none other than Victor Melling (Michael Caine), who has made a career out of grooming young ladies for the formidable task of competing in the arena of the Most Beautiful.  But with Gracie, he has his work cut out for him.  She's good with her dukes, has a penchant for pizza and beer, has a walk more like John Wayne than a future Miss U.S. and snorts when she laughs.  All of which adds up to a good time for the audience, if not for Victor, as he goes to work. 	The story, while not altoghether original, is entertaining fare that is handled well by director Petrie and is, most importantly, what a comedy should be:  Funny.  For a comedy to work, a number of elements have to come together and gel; in this case, it's a combination of a concept that is credible, dialogue that is clever and gets laughs without being forced, some good physical bits (including a sparse use of slapstick that is effective), and a pace that keeps it all fresh as the story unfolds.  What really puts this one over, however, are the stars, Bullock and Caine. 	The winsome Bullock demonstrates her versatility by pulling out all the stops physically, while creating a character that is totally believable, abandoning the safety net of the glamorous, girl-next-door, America's sweetheart type to make Gracie a very real, earthy person.  And with all that goes on, it would be easy to ignore the emotional development she brings to the character as well, but it is there; by the end of the film we see a different Gracie, one of changed attitude and broadened horizons.  And it works because Bullock makes it sincere and genuine, which makes Gracie an endearing, memorable character.  The same can be said of Michael Caine's performance as the effeminate Victor.  With his usual charm, he plunges into Melling's skin and paints him with fine strokes of nuance and wit, while managing to avoid stereotype as he creates a character that is uniquely his own.  And the fact that Caine and Bullock play so well off of one another takes the movie to a higher level on that regard alone. 	Notable in supporting roles are the likable Benjamin Bratt , as Agent Eric Matthews, who watches Gracie's transformation with great interest; William Shatner, doing a camp turn as Stan, the `Bert Parks' of the Miss U.S. Pageant; Heather Burns, as Cheryl, `Miss Rhode Island;' and Bergen, who gives a winning performance as Morningside, the former beauty queen. Rounding out the cast are Ernie Hudson (McDonald), Wendy Raquel Robinson (Miss California), Diedre Quinn (Miss Texas) and Melissa De Sousa (Miss New York).  A funny, feel-good movie, `Miss Congeniality' is a satisfying comedy that will make you laugh and leave you with a smile on your face, with performances by Bullock and Caine that are worth the price of admission alone.  For a solid evenings entertainment, check this one out; you'll be glad you did.  I rate this one 8/10.",Miss Congeniality

I should have known betterI am a big fan of almost everything Sandra Bullock does. There is one movie I wish she never did - but that is then...this is now. Sandra is extremely versatile. She can do thrillers, suspense, comedy and suspense-comedy (as proved by this performance.) Backing her up on the runway is a cadre of veterans like Michael Caine, Candice Bergen and William Shatner – each outstanding at getting their fare-share of the laughs. The story surrounds FBI agents, Eric Mathews (Benjamin Bratt's character) and his partner, Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock – of course) secretly crashing a beauty pageant to thwart some serious-beauty-pageant crime.

Bullock plays a supertough ""tomboy"" with limited socialization skills, working as a FBI agent.  Undisciplined and insubordinate, Bullock gets to ""redeem"" herself, in several ways, by going undercover as a contestant in the ""Miss United States"" pageant.  That a 30-something with no beauty contest experience would be able to get up to speed and effectively compete at all with woman 19-25 is fairly far-fetched.  That such an unkempt, unsociable individual could do it in 48 hours stretches credibility beyond the breaking point.  Bullock acquits herself extremely well. Unfortunately, she possesses WAY too obvious a natural beauty to convince us she is the ""ugly duckling."" A better choice would have been Cameron Diaz (Have you ever seen her without makeup?). Worse, the film mocks rather than satirizes the beauty contest business, going for easy laughs at the expense of the contestants.  Doesn't ANYBODY remember that Cloris Leachman, Linda Carter, Loni Anderson, Delta Burke, Vanessa Williams and Halle Berry got their starts as beauty contests winners? Producer Bullock may or may not have been taking a cheap shot by casting Benjamin Bratt as her love interest.  After all, guess who Bratt's real life ""main squeeze"" is?  If it wasn't a cheap shot, it was lousy casting.  Bratt seems far too interested in his own reflection to pay much attention to Bullock.Coming off best of the entire cast is Candace Bergen, playing the thankless role of head of the pageant.  At roughly sixty, Bergen has never looked better, and she can STILL hold her own with someone as strong as Bullock.

72,FlickJunkie-2,A good solid comedy for Sandra Bullock,7,8 May 2001,"It seems we have been getting our share of Beauty Pageant comedies lately (`Beautiful', `Drop Dead Gorgeous').  `Miss Congeniality' is by far the biggest production and the best of the lot.  Sandra Bullock (who also co-produced) plays Gracie Hart, a homely FBI agent who goes undercover at the Miss United States beauty pageant to catch a terrorist who has threatened to blow up the pageant.  The story is funny and Bullock shows her range, proving to be an excellent comedian in addition to her proven talents as a dramatic actor.  The writers poke the typical fun at pageants and contestants throughout the film, but they develop a conscience at the end when Gracie gets teary-eyed admitting what a great experience it was.  There is plenty of silly slapstick humor. Bullock does her runway thing with aplomb, and her tongue firmly in cheek. Michael Caine is wonderfully droll as the beauty consultant who is given the impossible task of turning the ugly duckling into a swan.Interestingly, this is not the first film where Sandra Bullock makes the beast to beauty transition.  In one of her early films in 1991 (`Love Potion Number 9'), she plays a geek who discovers a love potion and turns into a knockout.  That film was an early indication of her comedic talents, but she eschewed zany comedy for dramatic and romantic roles for many years after that.  It is good to see her return to it.This is a very light and entertaining film that is easy to watch and easy to forget.  At over $100 million gross it had plenty of mass appeal.  The comedy is silly but fun, and Candice Bergen, Michael Caine and William Shatner provide some terrific moments in supporting roles.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is a good, solid comedy.",Miss Congeniality
73,redkiwi,It had to happen!,7,2 April 2001,"Finally, a Sandra Bullock film since Speed where she is not completely awful and nauseating and makes you want to throw up [and I don't mean since the terrible Speed 2].As the undercover FBI agent entering the beauty contest to try to foil a terrorist plot, she is not only good in her role, she also interacts well with the cast around her -- which has often been all to lacking in some of her other films.I'll not say any more than two words: The Net.A cast of names around her support her well, Michael Caine plays the 'luvvie' role well -- the beauty pageant coach that has a soft spot for Sandra's male colleague also!  William Shatner and Candice Bergen [Murphy Brown] also make appearances, and both look very very old [and Shatner particularly fat also!]Worth checking out, offers a lot more than most Hollywood films at the moment.",Miss Congeniality
74,Peach-2,Something to be said for Sandra Bullock.,7,3 May 2001,"Although Miss Congeniality isn't the most original film you will ever see in your lifetime, it is a fine example of Sandra Bullock as a movie star. This film has been done to death, it has a truly unoriginal screenplay that is packed with cliches to the point of insanity. It might sound like I didn't like the film...that isn't true at all. This movie lives and breathes Sandra Bullock, without her the film is a total bust. Only a few actors can hold a movie together and she definitely has the screen magic that is needed for Hollywood. I'm not trying to take away from the rest of the cast, they are all just victims to a terrible screenplay, but the actors also fall victim to Bullock's unique ability as an actor. She stands out and convinced me that this film isn't a total waste. I wasn't the most excited person in the world when this film appeared in theaters because it looked like a complete chick flick. I don't really have anything special to say about the film as a work of art or entertainment, but I am a Sandra Bullock fan for life.",Miss Congeniality

She's a judo defense expert but can't balance herself to wear high heels..well..funny, but not over again too often and it doesn't make sense. William Shatner shows up as the contest emcee. He's surprisingly youthful considering he retired from Star Trek and doesn't do very many films or TV shows anymore. Too many clues are handed out ahead of time about the real villain..Candace Bergen, the former beauty queen who runs the Miss U.S. pageant. Why not keep it a surprise? We're even clued in to where the bomb is hiding and the plans for it but no one bothers to tell Gracie. She still instantly knows to rush over and save the winner the last minute before detonation.

79,jhaggardjr,The best comedy of 2000!,10,5 January 2001,"What a major surprise this turned out to be! ""Miss Congeniality"" is in my opinion the best comedy motion picture of 2000. This I totally did not expect. Sandra Bullock pulls out all the stops in this film, her best film role in quite a while. She plays Gracie Hart, a tough but clumsy FBI agent who goes undercover as a beauty queen at a Miss U.S.A. pageant that's being threatened with a bombing. Hart's job is to find out whose responsible and to stop the person from blowing up the event. During this time the Bullock character has to go through a transformation from an average-looking woman to a dashing beauty thanks in part to the beauty pageant image consultant (Michael Caine) on orders from the president of the event (Candice Bergen). Bullock is hilarious in this movie. She's very good at playing macho one minute and bumbling the next. She's perfect here. Caine has some terrific moments as the image consultant, and it's great to see Bergen back on the big screen after a 15 year hiatus (her last theatrical film was the 1985 Burt Reynolds directed bomb ""Stick""; everybody knows what she did during 10 of those years: FYI a.k.a. ""Murphy Brown""). Benjamin Bratt (as Bullock's FBI partner) proves to be a good sidekick for Bullock, and William Shatner (Adm./Capt. Kirk of ""Star Trek"") is very funny as the pageant's host. ""Miss Congeniality"" has plenty of funny moments throughout but the reason why this is the best comedy of 2000 is that it's so much fun. I had a real good time seeing it. **** (out of four)",Miss Congeniality
80,bbewnylorac,A guilty pleasure,7,31 December 2019,"Sandra Bullock is the perfect person to play tomboy FBI detective Gracie who goes undercover as a contestant in the Miss America Pageant in Miss Congeniality to find a terrorist. This comedy is never going to win awards but is great fun if you need a pick-me-up movie to pass the time. As her love interest, Benjamin Bratt is almost too perfect, and as the pageant organisers, Candice Bergen and William Shatner ham it up something shocking. However, as Gracie's campy pageant coach, Michael Caine has a lot of chemistry with Bullock - their scenes are always beautifully written and acted. The actors who play Bullock's fellow contestants are great, too.",Miss Congeniality
81,chrisbrown6453,You could miss Miss Congeniality and still go on with your life.,6,17 June 2002,"This would have made a great TV movie, but as a theatrical release it misses its mark. However, if you are looking for a fun evening without a lot of brainpower expended, then this is the movie for you. I have to admit I enjoyed the film and was entertained; unfortunately, at today's rental prices, I would recommend waiting for it to come on TV. After all, it plays like a TV movie.Sandra Bullock is the star of this comedy, and she does a great job. She's beautiful, funny, and plays the part of a FBI agent assigned to a beauty pageant (scholarship program) as believably as possible. The only other commendable performance is that of Michael Caine, Oscar winner from 1999's The Cider House Rules. Mr. Caine plays the part of a pageant coach for Miss Bullock. Bullock and Caine are the only three-dimensional characters in the film. William Shatner and Candice Bergen run the pageant and not once did I ever believe in their characters. The rest of the performances did not take anything away from the picture, but they didn't add anything either.The purpose of this film was to allow Bullock to do a comedy, which she does very well. If you are a Sandra Bullock fan -- or even like Michael Caine -- you will like this movie, but I would still wait for it to come out on TV.",Miss Congeniality
82,ethanbresnett,"A perfectly fine, fun film!",7,24 June 2020,"The plot of Miss Congeniality is pretty straightforward. Following a tip off about a potential attack at the upcoming Miss America beauty pageant, Sandra Bullock's 'tomboy' FBI must go undercover to get to the bottom of things. Along the way her encounters with her fellow competitors challenges her views and biases about women and leads to personal growth on her part. It's the definition of a breezy and light hearted. There isn't anything deep to get bogged down in, its just a good laugh.There are certain elements of this film that do not age well. Namely the rampant sexism which is cringy and uncomfortable at times. Its a film of tired stereotypes, with women and men both being stereotyped in equal measure. Ignoring all of this though, Miss Congeniality is a perfectly fine film. It won't blow you away, it won't bore you, it's entertaining. Simple as.The biggest highlight of this film really is Sandra Bullock. A great actress, and a solid lead for this picture. Her character was quite fun and entertaining, but there weren't many others who were to be honest. Her fellow FBI agents were just copy and paste, stereotypical FBI dudes. There were some interesting and funny characters in the form of the other pageant contestants, as well as Michael Caine's character, but aside from this the film was lacking in good characters. The movie was built around Bullock and her character and didn't particularly look to expand beyond that.Miss Congeniality is a bit of a miracle really. Its a film that should be incredibly corny and not work at all, but somehow it does work. Its a very easy watch, and while never being hilarious it is entertaining. It won't have you creasing with laughter, but will keep you happy enough.",Miss Congeniality
83,TaylorYee94,Shouting feminism at the center of beauty pageant,8,2 October 2020,"The fact that the movie sets the beauty pageant, considered a symbol of sexual objectification of women, looks confusing but is very clever indeed. Even among women, feminism can mean different concepts and actions. One of them is criticism against beauty pageant. Some purse tomboy style, physical strength, and fight against status quo. Others go after freedom to express sexuality or equal treatment. 'Miss Congeniality' depicts both sides positively, especially telling that you cannot blame all the girls who are part of the system. They are doing the best to contribute to the good of the society. Rather, this movie blames selfish people who exploit women for fame and money and system ITSELF, epitomized as Kathy Morningside. While giving this message, it remains to be hilarious, witty, romantic, and cute throughout the movie.",Miss Congeniality
84,roghache,The beauty pageant I can watch over and over,8,20 March 2006,"This is a wonderful breezy comedy, which seems to be on TV all the time. I generally tune in, as it's just sheer mindless fun.Sandra Bullock is perfect in the role of Gracie Hart, a smart but bumbling FBI detective forced undercover as a beauty pageant contestant in order to unearth a serial murderer expected to strike there. At the pageant Bullock is assisted in her sleuthing by fellow agent, Eric, who is reluctantly attracted to her. She also encounters the questionable longtime Miss United States pageant hosts, played here by William Shatner and Candice Bergen. Of course our Miss New Jersey requires an enormous makeover, with Victor (Michael Caine) the witty handler who certainly has his work cut out for him, imparting beauty and sophisticated poise to this awkward tomboy.Can Victor transform Gracie, Pygmalion style, into a radiant beauty queen? (Caine is superb in his role here.) And lots of suspense...just who are the bad guys (or gals) in this scenario? Can anyone be trusted? The best part of the film, other than the endless laughs at Gracie's contempt for beauty pageantry and her utter clumsy unsuitability as a contestant (constantly on display), is the camaraderie that she develops with her fellow contestants, any one of whom could of course be a villain in gorgeous disguise, or indeed alternately, a victim. Suffice it to say, Gracie changes in more ways than one during the course of the pageant.Not rocket science, but the reason this movie shows up on TV so often is, I suspect, because like me, EVERYONE just loves it.",Miss Congeniality
85,Magow-Intermean,Miss Congeniality Review,9,25 March 2019,"A bomber is targeting the Miss America beauty pageant and Agent Matthews selects tom boy Fed Gracie Hart to go undercover as a contestant. First, however, Gracie must be shown the ropes by disgraced pageant expert, Victor Melling.
Over in America, this slight comedy restored some of Sandra BullockÆs box office lustre. A genuine crowdpleaser boasting a charming star turn, Miss Congeniality is indeed difficult to dislike, but hey, sometimes it's worth the effort.Much more believable as a beauty queen than a scruffy, ill-mannered Fed, Bullock snorts sweetly and falls off high heels very well. Which is just about enough to carry the first 30 minutes. After that it would be nice if the script gave her something else to do.There are some incidental pleasures away from the leading lady: the screenplay mines broad comedy from the all-American crassness of beauty contests - although the film won't criticise them too far; the banter between Bullock's bumbling cop chums is amusing; and the growing rapport between Bullock and Caine's gay makeover expert is nicely, if programmatically, played out. Moreover, it's good to see Candice Bergen and William Shatner shine as fading pageant hosts. That said, there is a completely inconsequential feel to the whole exercise.There are too many storylines, too many characters, too much sentiment: Miss Congeniality is a prime example of moviemaking by committee, a disease which kills comedy in particular. Each teeny character has their own little arc, each identifiable audience demographic is pandered to with a story beat here, or a cameo there. Baloney.Do we care whether the shy contestant who befriends Bullock comes out of her shell? Do we care if Caine's character restores his pride and prestige? Do we even care if Bullock and Bratt get together?No matter. This is not a complicated story - it's about a tom boy Fed who shaves her legs in order to go undercover at a beauty pageant, gets into a few scrapes, falls over a lot. And whenever director Petrie remembers this fact and points the camera at his engaging star, his film is good, easy-on-the-brain fun.Gossamer-thin entertainment of the sort that would make for an inoffensive first-date movie. Nice to see Sandy back on home turf, but this is unlikely to give Julia Roberts sleepless nights.",Miss Congeniality

Sandra Bullock steals the show completely (perhaps her best role ever) as she plays the anti-woman who is an FBI-cop but then her worst nightmare comes across when she has to go undercover for some election from Miss America. It leads into quite silly situations that will make you laugh and even if the plot is pure Hollywoodnonsense (and not exactly the cherry on the pie), it's quite enjoyable. As always a cool Michael Caine as well. Don't rent it or so, it's not worth it, but surely see it on telly...",Miss Congeniality

Bullock is an FBI agent who goes undercover at the Miss United States beauty pageant to search for a bomb and solve the scheme started by pageant organizer(Candice Bergen). In the process in this movie you see how that Sandra Bullock is transformed into a beauty queen from her ordinary woman status, it's amazing how some people can cleanup so well.

Bullock is the perfect casting for Hart, and surrounded by an impressive supporting cast too. Caine somehow both breaks his mould whilst remaining within it, typical English gentleman, but a very camp one this time around.Genuinely funny throughout, a likeable character, and an excellent parody of US beauty pageants, Miss Congeniality has a bit of something for everyone. Really simple to follow, feel-good, probably one of Bullocks most famous films, definitely one of her best (although, not quite as good as the perfect action comedy, Demolition Man).",Miss Congeniality

It is just too, funny.When I saw the trailers prior to watching this, it was already funny enough. Sandra Bullock (as Gracie Hart) really bring in a whole new meaning to a beauty pageant. Being an FBI agent, she has to go undercover as one of the finalists for the beauty pageant because the FBI had received intelligence about a plan to destroy the pageant. Who else but Gracie herself? At first when she was being chosen, it was really comical. At times I have to really laugh out loud. I mean, trying to move away from the stereotypes on how many of us often think beauty pageants are like...very refreshing. Gracie trying to learn to be a lady...almost unimaginable from her normal tomboyish self. But then she still managed to transform and when it happened, it even surprised her FBI colleagues.The other finalists had no idea about Gracie's true identity till the day after the crowning of the winner. The winner (Miss Rhode Island) credited Gracie for saving the beauty pageant despite whatever comes her way. Thus, winning the title of 'Miss Congeniality'.So, whoever says that girls don't know how to kick some butt? And doing it on a beauty pageant too? This movie will prove it all.",Miss Congeniality
92,refresh_daemon,Typical comedy,5,3 February 2007,"This is the first of many films that I watched in the airplane on the way to Korea. A couple notes on films on airplanes in general: 1) My tolerance for general badness in films increases on airplanes because it's better to be poorly entertained/distracted than to deal with the utter boredom of being in a flying tin can.2) The viewing conditions are less than spectacular. In my case, everything on the screen was way too red and way too green. Someone doesn't know how to properly adjust the B747 projectors. And you have to listen on weak airline headphones. Well, at least I brought my own Sennheisers to improve the sound a little.Okay, onto the review. I get the feeling that if I had watched this film somewhere other than the plane, I would've disliked it. That said, I didn't exactly like this film. It lies somewhere in between entertaining and making me wish that they played a different movie. Occasionally, the jokes worked and the charm was up. Most of the time, it seemed like a bunch of annoying characters bouncing around on-screen.The story isn't realistic, but that's not really a complaint. The whole thing is ridiculous from the start so it's completely understandable that the film would be generally ridiculous. It doesn't try to pass itself off as a film of any depth either, so there's no real worry there. The problem really lies in that the film isn't funny. The humor of the film squarely lies in the realm of teen comedy, which never really amused me (most of the time). Watch Sandra do water glass tricks. Watch Sandra beat up nameless co-star. Oh look, a small role by... William Shatner? Watch Sandra get turned from boring tough-tomgirl fbi-agent to boring tough-beauty pageant contestant? Honestly, if she were more believable as a tough fbi-agent, maybe it'd work, but her character needs to be both super-tough and super-nerd. Right.I can't say that the acting, directing, story, score, editing, set/costume design, lighting, special effects, plotting or anything else in the film is really standout. In fact, it all just globs together into the murky mess of mediocre 90's comedies. On the plus side, it wasn't particularly painful to watch and is a whole lot more interesting than staring at a headrest for an hour and a half.So there you go. It's a typical mediocre comedy. If you have to choose between watching this and staring blankly at a headrest for an hour and a half, I'd say watch this. If you have to choose between watching this a second time and staring blankly at a headrest for an hour and a half, that's a toughie. I'd go for the headrest. 5/10.",Miss Congeniality

The action scenes were good, but I think there should have been more of them and that's probably the reason why the movie has a low rating and has gotten negative reviews.

96,stormhawk2021,And my Golden Globes goes to...,9,8 May 2017,"Sandra Bullock again delights us with a good comedy, this time massively backed by the public, which led to the realization of a sequel.This movie is made for her, and she is worth it. It totally takes the weight of the plot and full of humor and spontaneity. Far from films like ""Big Momma's House"" or ""White Chicks"", ""Miss Congeniality"" has gags great, both physical and verbal. And is that the Bullock is an expert in the art of making laugh, so much that his interpretation in this film earned him his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Comedy Actress, with much merit since they are never nominated for performances in such films a bit serious.The transformation of a rude FBI agent into a refined Miss is hilarious, and the plot of the film is not very silly, the tape does not fall into the gross humor, or in situations too ridiculous, so it is very hilarious and funny, but not a bomb.As a side note the always effective Michael Caine and Heather Burns (the little blonde Miss who befriends) who dominate the mood almost as well as Sandra. On the other hand Benjamin Bratt as always in his line of puppet that does not contribute absolutely nothing to the tape, honestly the race like actor of this lad is never going to take off ....The American critics applauded the performance of Sandra and the audience went massively to the cinema, everything is said. One of the best films in the Bullock's career, with a sequel that could not keep the bar so high, was difficult.The best: Sandra Bullock, almost takes the Golden Globe. The worst: A romance with so little importance could be deleted.",Miss Congeniality
97,fjhuerta-2,Never let a producer star in his/her film.,3,22 April 2001,"Exception being, Edward Norton (Keep the Faith was a very, very good movie).This film made me cringe at points for being so egotistical. Start from the improbable beginning: a little, bespectacled girl hitting two guys. Improbable, but passable. Cut to the next scene, the same spectacles on Sandra Bullock. Oh, she is conducting a raid! How original! We just got to watch the SAME scene a couple of months ago in ""Hannibal"". So we know what will happen: she makes a mistake, she gets beaten for it, and (but of course) she gets a new assignment so that she can clear her name.Stop me if I am wrong here, but this is one of the longest chain of clichés in any movie. ""Big momma's house"", ""Hannibal"", ""Pygmalion"", ""My Fair Lady"", you name it, it's here.It shows who the ""Producer"" was. She never stops hogging the screen, either eating tons of ice cream (who thought that was funny), or smiling, or insulting anyone. Someone should tell Ms. Bullock that it takes a special someone to be funny and gross at the same time (think Eddie Murphy), and she is definitely not that kind of person. Her jokes are boring, her acting is only so-so, and she never stops being ""the nice one, the intelligent one, the good one"". What a bore. Furthermore, the film lacks coherence and credibility. We are supposed to be watching a ""serious"" comedy, yet when she is having her make-up applied, a megaphone blurts out: ""make up, podiatrist, dermatologist, aisle 25, urgent"", as if in a real hangar. So dumb. I agree, there are times we should check our brains at the door and just forget all about coherence, but that is usually in ""stupid"" comedies, as ""Dumb and dumber"". This film is pretentious AND dumb at the same time.Not to mention the fact that sweet Sandra Bullock transforms ""magically"" from being a brat to a beauty queen without the audience understanding what went into it. We only see her assistant, Vic (very funny performance, BTW) having trouble with her. Oh, and I won't mention the fact that this should be an insult to any feminist. It really is degrading to women, considering the fact that it shows beauty contests as having something to do with intelligence. Isn't this the 21st century?Overall, 6.

The idea that a tough-as-nails lady agent can be transformed into a beauty pageant contestant is far-fetched, but not beyond the realm of possibility.Maybe spoilers in what follows.The idea that an agent has to infiltrate a beauty contest to prevent it from being sabotaged by a terrorist is, I suspect, a bit beyond the usual Bureau procedure, but if one suspends belief just a bit, the rest of the film flows naturally.The transformation of a lady frog into a princess is an enjoyable trip in itself, not only because of the marvelous coaching by the Caine character, but by the procedures to prepare her cosmetically.Whatever else, Gracie Hart remains an Agent. Although she operates at times on intuition, she shows a dogged determination on solving the case -- identifying the threat, and whom it comes from.Sandra Bullock, Michael Caine, and William Shatner all play well against each other.Not serious, but not meant to be.",Miss Congeniality
99,TuckMN,And the winner is...,9,22 December 2000,"Sandra Bullock shines as the reluctant FBI insider in the Miss United States of America Beauty Pageant.  She proves that not only can she handle dialogue well but she also has a real flair for physical comedy.This is an outlandish film that tries (only half-heartedly) to be a suspense  but why let plot get in the way of the laughs?  And the laughs were plentiful.Even though Candice Bergen proved in `Murphy Brown' that she can handle the pace and timing necessary to pull off a comedic part she is superb as Kathy Morningside the power behind the Miss United States of America Beauty Pageant.  She hasn't really made any films since 1986 and she was missed.
Benjamin Bratt is credible as Gracie Hart's (Sandra Bullock) FBI partner  even though in the beginning of the film he was prettier than she was.Michael Caine is sublime as the beauty-queen-maker that is hired to turn Gracie into a believable contestant for the pageant.  He turns in his usual stellar performance.There is actually a message here though I am not certain exactly what it is Gracie espouses the politically correct' view that beauty pageants are little more than meat markets but at the end of the film she is empowered by finding the physical beauty that she didn't know she possessed.There are few quiet moments in this film  the audience laughs out loud during most of it; and for good reason:  it is very funny.",Miss Congeniality

At its worst, the film is formulaic, but in the end it's genuinely funny and entertaining.Besides being one of the most beautiful and sexy actresses working, Bullock once again proves that she is one of the best comedic talents too.  Benjamin Bratt, who also worked with Bullock successfully in Demolition Man, is a perfect straight man.  Michael Caine is flawless, as usual, as the slightly fey manager tasked with turning Bullock from ""Dirty Harriett"" into Miss New Jersey.  Candace Bergen is deliciously bitchy as the pageant promoter who may be a little too personally invested in the pageant, er, I mean, Scholarship Program.  And there is something campy about just seeing William Shatner these days, and he never disappoints.Bullock, who also produced, seems to have hit her stride in movies like this and 28 Days, and if we ever get sick of seeing Julia Roberts get all the good roles, maybe Sandra will get the attention she is due.",Miss Congeniality

Even taking into account that it was 10 years ago when this Rom-Com was released, and most Rom-Coms are forgotten throughout the sands of time by plenty of people for how many there are and how unremarkable most of them manage to be, this one has always managed to stick with me and uphold an excellent reputation, in my eyes, for how wonderful and fun it really is, and is truly one of my favorite movies in general.The numerous upsides: I think the deliverance of all the lines and scenes in this film is just perfect for what it sets out to accomplish. Sandra Bullock was the perfect choice for the role, and all the other supporting actors and actresses are simply magnificent in their parts and bring to you a movie that is meant to be nothing but fun and laughter from the beginning. However, you get a little bit more than what you are in store for. I found myself being completely interested every time I have watched it over the years, because it captures your attention with the storyline and antics and does not let go. The performances, like I said, are amazing and the cast really knew how to work with what they were given. The jokes and antics are hysterical and though many when they hate or dislike a comedy will tell you that the movie was funny in a bad way, do not listen to any bad reception this may receive and view it for yourself with a clear conscience, because it really is enjoyable that way, in my honest opinion.The very minuscule, few downsides: Yes, the movie does get a tad bit mediocre, at times, and at others of course they could have handled the material a little better, but aside from those two matters, I thought the film was, in a sense, perfect, and was completely astonishing and surprisingly hilarious and outstanding to every value it should have been hilarious and outstanding to.I have enjoyed the film for a long time now, I still enjoy it and find it to be a fun and thrilling adventure from beginning to end that I can always watch for the simple pleasure of just viewing it, not to just pass the time. Guys, do not pass it off for just a chick flick, because a few are liable to find this a superbly well time.

Watching ""The Net"" (not too bad but not good either) didn't help matters a lot.To my pleasant surprise, she actually does a fine job in ""Miss Congeniality."" Even when the script doesn't quite work, she never fails to exude an air of strength and charm. The premise-a female FBI agent infiltrating a beauty pageant-is undeniably silly, but she makes it convincing.Michael Caine is terrific as the contest consultant, and William Shatner is a hoot as the clueless host. However, Benjaman Bratt is stiff (though he tries) as Bullock's colleague. There's a hint of romance, but this is wisely kept to a minimum, as little or no chemistry is generated.I've mentioned that the script doesn't always work. To be more specific, it just needed more laughs. The first act is the best, simply due to the abundance of humor.

She also has a gift for comedy and a screen presence that is undeniable. I can't think of any other actress that could pull off this role.The characters in the film do develop well, and you actually begin to care about them.

Miss Congeniality is one of the movies that made Sandra Bullock what she is today, and with good reason- She's great! Yes, this is truly one of Ms. Bullock's finest moments. She is spot-on as a ""dirty Harriet"" of sorts; She's an FBI agent who is assigned to go undercover as a contestant in the Miss United States Pageant. Hilarity ensues. Not only does Ms. Bullock pull off the physical comedy wonderfully, she makes a real character out of a role that could have been very one-dimensional. She lets us actually get to know the character, which only makes the movie that much better. Truly, Ms. Bullock gives one of the greatest comedic performances of all time.And then there's the supporting cast! The supporting cast!!! They are all superb. One of the best casts put together in years. Candice Bergen and William Shatner create one of the greatest comedic tag teams of all time. Then there's Michael Caine. He is the other star of the show. He steals almost all the scenes he's in. What a great actor! Really, this is my example of a perfect comedy, and that's why I give it a 10. The cast is brilliant, the script hilarious.

Bullock' acting is perfectly reasonable in the title role, though due to her looks is hopelessly miscast as a plain Jane whose sexuality is ignored by her workmates to a quite unfeasible extent. The story is a predictable affair of pantomime villains and airheaded beauty pageant contestants, basically providing plenty of opportunities to show bare female skin, Michael Caine just about survives with his dignity intact as an embittered former beauty supremo, and the odd inspired moment does provide a quick giggle, but it's not really very good.

115,ijonesiii,Sandra Bullock's Finest Hour...,8,21 December 2005,"I still say Sandra Bullock has not been seen to better advantage on screen than she was in the 2000 comedy MISS CONGENIALITY. Bullock turned in sharp comic performance as Gracie Hart, an over anxious FBI agent who goes undercover as a beauty pageant contestant when it is learned someone is planning to kill whoever takes the crown. Director Donald Petrie guides Bullock with a sure hand and never allows her to go over the top with what could have been a purely slapstick female version of Ace Ventura...the comedy comes from a well-thought story with likable characters played by competent actors. Michael Caine shines as Victor Melling, the washed up contestant coach who is hired to make Sandra look like a real beauty pageant contestant (""The eyebrows...there should be two!""). Candice Bergen is beautifully bitchy as pageant director Cathy Morningside and Benjamin Bratt is a sexy and charismatic love interest for Bullock. And let's not forget William Shatner, warming up for his BOSTON LEGAL role here as the dim pageant host, Stan Fields. And special mention to Heather Burns, who makes the most of her role as Cheryl Frazier, Miss Rhode Island, the naive contestant Gracie befriends.

But if you do, you will miss some really delightful satire. It's not too farcical to be real comedy, and in spots gets really sly with the message. Sandra Bullock shines as a tomboy FBI agent who has no attraction for men. Wouldn't you know she gets the assignment to be transformed into a Beauty Pageant contestant to uncover the details of a plot to bomb the Miss USA Pageant. There are too many intricate actions going on to detail them here, but be assured agent Sandra is on the ball and finally figures out who is behind the plot. But does she do it in time? See the movie and find out.The photography is well detailed, if uninspired, in revealing the ""anatomy"" of a Beauty Pageant, and direction and editing keep things fairly clear.

118,WCS02,A terrific comedy with sidesplitting moments well worth the admission price.,7,16 December 2000,"Those tempted to walk out after the first 20 minutes (me!) need to take a breath and hang on a little while longer.  After a clever childhood retrospective, it seems tired and languishes with FBI humor we've all seen before.  My wife - who kicked my shin as I motioned for the door - insisted we stay and she was right.  It blossomed quickly thereafter into a terrific comedy with sidesplitting moments well worth the admission price.Though Sandra Bullock holds a powerful box office drawer ever since Speed, she never cast her spell on me.  I've seen everything she's done, but always thought her best work was Speed.  Hope Floats 2nd.  28 Days, 3rd.   Miss Congeniality now seizes the top slot.   Let it be written; let it be done. This is her `coming out' film (for me, at least) to justify her star power. Production control perhaps was the missing ingredient and her secret weapon.A San Antonio Miss USA Beauty Pageant serves as center stage.  An overwrought theme in the eyes of many, it still plays well here.  The villains are true to character from the start - but I'll bet you can't name both of them early on.  The mischievous unveiling adds to the fun.FBI agent Gracie Hart (Sandra) becomes ringmaster to a three-ring circus in this frolic.  Tasked to disarm a terrorist threat, the tomboy agent enters the beauty pageant kicking and screaming from the first bikini wax to the crowning of the winner.  Subtle humor, pranks, witty dialog and goofy antics pasted a grin on my face from the 21st minute onward.  Sandra is surrounded by top-notch star power ranging from Michael Caine and Candice Bergen to William Shatner and Ernie Hudson.  Yet no one upstages another.  They work as an ensemble to delight the audience - and thus produce those hysterical moments.  Chemistry.  Timing.  There's no substitute for it if good comedy is the goal.A dozen memorable lines from other films are reworked and peppered throughout to charm this spoof.  After the first few, I thought `O god . . . tired script  . . .unimaginative writing'.  And then it hit me!   This is irreverence on parade.  Cliché lines can sparkle when they're properly delivered.  Leslie Neilson's personality was the only missing ingredient - who would've been a great addition by the way (note to S Bullock for the sequel, for which there will be an outcry).When I consider a film `Bullocked' henceforth, it'll not be in a negative sense.  Instead: Bullocked (bool´ek'd) positive verb transitive. 1. Enchanted by a  rising star; 2. Well entertained.  As if `worth the ticket price.'My IMDB vote: 7 out of 10.  See it the next time you're taking life a little too seriously.  Now if I can only get my wife to stop her `I told you so's, life will be perfect all around.

It has some funny moments and satisfies the need for lack of cranial engagement through its transparent plot. The physical comedy is fine. Some of Bullock's characterizations are forced. Her character is all over the place: forceful, commanding, dumpy, shy, brazen, intelligent, stupid -- it's written for whatever serves the moment, not for what serves the story.Candace Bergen, William Shatner, and Michael Caine are under-used.

Given the two romantic leads' actual ages (36 or so), Ms. Bullock and Mr. Bratt are young-looking but, in my opinion, not quite ""29 and holding."" We are encouraged to ""suspend disbelief"" as the pageant organizers ""fix"" the contest to allow Ms. Bullock's made-over character to reach the final stages of the 50(?)-state contest.  Mr. Bratt is entrusted with setting up the decoy operation as a ""rookie."" I wondered how old is his character supposed to be?  However, he can generate few ideas of his own to catch the mysterious bomber/""copy cat"". As FBI agents, Bratt and Bullock are no match, though, for the early-retired Pageant ""handler/manager"" (Michael Caine) who knows more about ""falsies"" than does the FBI female agent.  Mr. Caine is much better with his comparable character in LITTLE VOICE who was given more creative tasks to do in that movie as a promoter for the female title character; in MISS CONGENIALITY, Caine seemingly steals scenes with one arm tied behind his back.  My verdict for this film now available on Video is B+ as a politically correct farce/decoy for a rather ineffective bomber.  The FBI supervisor who gets little respect (Ernie Hudson) comes across in more realistic manner than anyone else of the main roles (except the ""Bert Parks""-clone played by William Shatner). The trio of Screenwriters could hardly have predicted that the FBI would look quite so ineffective as it has in the present year.  Mr. Hudson's character claims that he'll look the other way when his rogue pair of agents decide to go it as a duet, unaccompanied in the final act.  If only the real-life FBI could take its humble agents and improve them with some available make-up and pep talks while increasing their self-esteem, Robert Hanssen wouldn't have been operating as a Russian double-agent for so long.",Miss Congeniality

This film has a dull, contrived plot, ropey and derivative dialogue, charicatures rather than characters, and shoddy production values.  And then there's Bullock.The rest of the eclectic cast do their best to steal some screen time, but Miss Congeniality is really little more than a showcase for Sandra Bullock. Five years ago, that might have been a workable idea; Bullock was young, perky and cute then, with real potential.  But she failed to ever show any actual acting talent, and now she's just another name on the huge cut-throat A minus list, starving herself ever thinner in a desparate attempt to land half decent roles.And this might have been a half decent role if Bullock was either a decent actress, or even a decent piece of flesh.  But she was never the former, and is no longer the latter.  I'm so tired of watching actors who happen to have the right face or body struggling with parts that are way beyond their meagre talents.  Bullock is embarrasingly unconvincing in her ""tough grrl"" persona, and is equally improbable as a beauty pageant bimbo, being way too old and frankly tired looking.Sandra is tolerable enough in a supporting role, but she should really step aside and give some actual actresses a chance to do more with leading roles than just pose and grimace.",Miss Congeniality
123,great_sphinx_42,"Congenial, But No Winner",5,19 August 2001,"To say 'Miss Congeniality' is brain-numbingly predictable is to give it an element of surprise it never even thought about having. It is clear from the box cover/poster that this fits into both the 'fish-out-of-water' and 'makeover movie' formulas. Sandra Bullock is Gracie Hart, an impossibly shlumpy young FBI agent who has, her entire life, suffered from the Ugly Duckling syndrome. A letter from the 'the Citizen', a mass-murderer, leads the Feds to believe his next target will be the Miss United States pageant. And of course they'll need an agent to go undercover. And of course it will be Gracie. They reckon she's the only one who'll look half-decent in a bathing suit, so despite her recent screw-up during an arrest, they send her to a pageant consultant (Michael Caine). The typical transformation into Swan commences, and there is, of course, a cute guy (Benjamin Bratt) who never really noticed her before but suddenly realizes she looks pretty nice in a miniskirt. Burdened with a weak script with little to recommend it but plenty of straggling plot points, the movie is still not without a few positive qualities. The performances are good enough, the jokes are cute enough, Sandy Bullock is beautiful and a good physical comedienne. There's nothing wrong with any of that. The problem is that this same movie has been made about 3 dozen times under different titles in the past couple of years alone. And it's been made better. If you are a Sandy fan, happen to love makeover movies or are in the mood for one while in the video store, by all means give 'Miss Congeniality' a try. If you are looking for a movie with so much as a scrap of originality, though, give it a pass.",Miss Congeniality

She is truly fun as an evil villain, and the guy who plays her son is as revolting a character as I have ever seen.One of the fun aspects of this movie is how Gracie really cannot keep her big mouth shut. She is not sure about the whole beauty pageant thing and goes to great lengths to point out that she is not at all interested in participating. However, as soon as she really tries to get to know the other girls, the movie becomes more personal and interesting. Particularly funny is Heather Burns' character, as Miss Rhode Island. My favorite part of the whole movie is when Miss Rhode Island bursts into tears after Gracie has snatched the crown away from her. I was rolling on the floor laughing at that point.Bill Shatner also has some really funny one-liners.I know Sandra Bullock haters would not like this movie, but if someone other than her was in the lead role, the movie would still be funny.

I liked most Cheryl (Heather Burns), who were funny because of her silliness.While other comedies have a hilarious first act and then afterward a weak third act, ""Miss Congeniality"" have most of the time comedy, but the plot also relies on many discussions between Gracie and her crew, which becomes distracting. The film opens with a action sequence and afterward you're expecting more action, but it's never shows up. The ending is also too sudden.

The other stand out performance comes from Candice Bergen as the ever so slightly mad organiser of the show. Brilliant.So it's camp, has some great acting and cameo parts and William Shatner singing through the mayhem. It can't get better than that can it.

Admittedly I expected very little from this film so was pleasantly surprised to actually chuckle out loud in a few spots.

134,helencmm,How can I rate lower a film that gave me memorable laughs?,8,30 June 2019,"A film that kept me company when I was a child. Although I did not catch many references, because of my age of course, I decided one day to watch it again, so I could temporarily bring back my childhood. This was a correct move.I don't know where to start? From Bullock's great performance? Bullock is an actress that can transform in any role. She's a chameleon. She can act dramatic and comedic as well. This film is the proof that she can act as a professional comedian.Caine was hilarious here. He was one with the role. A real Brit!Bratt is undoubtedly a very charming man, something that is depicted here. Very funny and clever as well. He had very good chemistry with Bullock.I liked the concept of Beauty Pageant. I appreciated that they demystified the rumour that all the contestants there are fool and have no knowledge.I also connected this film with Bosson's song ""One in a Million"", which is the soundtrack of the film. When I'm listening to it, it brings me back beautiful memories and scenes of the film.Highly recommended it!P.S. There is no sequel to me. I watched it once and never twice. They ruined the magic of the first. Unfortunately. My opinion is to never watch the sequel.",Miss Congeniality

Sometimes, it is hard to go out to a movie where you don't have to deal with concentrating on plot or watching people get butchered. But this is a movie that is just plain fun. Sandra Bullock stars as Gracie Hart. Gracie is a nerdy FBI agent with no friends. She always messes up her assignments. When Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) gets assigned to a case about the ""Citizen,"" (The ""Citizen"" is a killer who leaves odd notes and things, then strikes. His next move is at a beauty pageant.) Gracie gets assigned to go under cover as a contestant to help find the killer.Sandra Bullock is delightful. She has a certain charm that you can't resist. This movie goes under her ""Best Movies"" category. It is very funny and sometimes hilarious. It is so much fun that you don't really care who the ""Citizen"" is. Bratt, who is so much better than he was in ""The Next Best Thing"", has comic timing that fits right in. As the movie progresses, you have: a smile, a chuckle, a few chuckles, laughter, and then finally laughing loudly. Great movie to see for the holidays.",Miss Congeniality
136,Aphex97,Surprising...,6,30 May 2001,"I was drug into the theater with my girlfriend expecting to hate this movie, but fortunately was pleasantly surprised. Definitely not as corny or cheesy as the TV trailers made it seem to be. It did have some funny parts and was, for the most part, surprisingly entertaining. Not the best comedy I've ever seen, but still much better than many of the romantic comedies I've witnessed in my day. Its faults are the mainly the completely predictable story line, and the cheesy love interest subplot. However, the movie doesn't take itself seriously as it pokes fun at its events (and its cliches) all the way through. Its merits are Sandra Bullock, whose grace and charm on the screen are undeniable. Generally good supporting performances all around by the cast, who seem to be having fun. Many parts of the movie are genuinely funny, and thus it does its job as a comedy. FINAL RATING: 6/10 A good genre movie. Fans of romantic comedies/ predictable movies will no doubt sing the praises of this movie, since it is the best one of this particular genre to come along in awhile.  Doesn't add anything too bold or novel to the mix, but is still a fun movie with a few good laughs. Recommended to romantic comedy fans. Noob Aalox",Miss Congeniality

When I first heard the plot of this, I must admit I thought it didn't sound like such a good idea to make a movie about that topic. But I just saw it and must say I was very wrong. Yeah, the plot is a little thin, but the movie contains so many jokes and funny scenes that you don't care about that. This is the funniest feel good movie I have seen in a long time! The actors were great, especially Miss Bullock ( who is very good at comedy) and Benjamin Bratt, the chemistry between those two is great, it's obvious they are old friends. If you want a fun night out, go and see this movie, it won't disappoint you! Or rent it and enjoy it at home. The whole theater was laughing all through the movie and I think it's so cool of Sandra Bullock that she wasn't too vain to play the first scenes not looking very good. However, once she was ""transformed"" she was such beautiful, that sure made up for it. I think she is one of the best looking actresses nowadays, one of those few that look good without plastic surgery. For a comedy, it's a good 9/10.",Miss Congeniality
138,donlhumphries,Sandra Bullock is great!,9,23 March 2001,"Sandra Bullock has comedic talents, and this movie gives full play to them. She can be regarded as the female equivalent of Jim Carrey, in that they both tend to be ""physical comedians"", ie. relying more on facial expression, actions, and mannerisms, rather than wisecracks or sit-coms.  This film is of the ""My Fair Lady"" variety, with tomboy Sandra as Gracie being transformed into a beauty pageant contestant. While so many women nowadays want to be like men, here's one who ends up going the opposite way - by force of circumstance.  She discovers her feminine side.  The beauty pageant participants are not ridiculed, but are shown to have brains as well as beauty.  Gracie comes to realise that her girlfriends in the pageant aren't bimbos. The whole movie is an FBI thriller, and quite coherent, but comedic also. Sandra Bullock is central to it, of course, and I regard this as one of her best movies.  This seems to be reflected at the box office.",Miss Congeniality

I was afraid that the Pearl Harbor trailer was the best I was going to see that night, but luckily I really began to like Miss Congeniality. Okay, the plot was very predictable, but Sandra Bullock gives a terrific performance and carries the whole film to the end by herself.Bullock and Michael Caine are a perfect comedy team and the scenes they share are the highlights of the film.It's just big fun.

141,strangie,Winner of best predicatable film: Miss Congeniality,7,20 March 2001,"This is a terrific popcorn flick. Sandra Bullock plays Gracie Hart, the quintessential tomboy and FBI agent. She's tough, rough, lacking in ""sophistication"" and not particularly keen on having herself look well kept.  She's put on a case to protect the girls of the Miss America Beauty Pageant against whom a death threat has been case. In charge of the team is womanising Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) who comes off looking a fraction clueless.  Rounding off the cast brilliantly is Candice Bergen as Kathy Morningside and Michael Caine as Victor Melling - the terribly camp pageant advisor sent to help Gracie find some, well, grace!It's predictable, with a solid start, a pear shaped middle and a solid ending.  There are some decent laughs and there's the drool factor (for the girls Benjamin Bratt and for the boys Sandra Bullock). 
Interesting to note that Katie Ford, of the Ford Modelling Agency has a writing credit to this flick and that Sandra Bullock was the producer.",Miss Congeniality
142,Rebochan,"Fluffy, yet fun",10,22 December 2000,"I will not lie.  This film is VERY predictable, and if you haven't figured out who the terrorist is by the time the characters do, you should be ashamed.  I managed to figure out just about every single plot point within the the first half hour.  Needless to say, some movies don't HAVE to be loaded with surprises at every turn to be good.  This film may look like it's simply an attack on the beauty industry, but actually, as Bullock's Gracie Hart discovers, there's more than just looks to the characters. Bullock herself delivers a wonderful performance, relying on her charm to pull the movie off.  Michael Caine basically plays himself in the movie, which makes him quite comedic.  William Shatner, surprisingly, also plays a good performance by playing Stan, the host of the pageant, and again is playing himself-Self-absorbed, ego-stroking, and over-dramatic.  Why not? It delivers the goods.  This film is much different from the usual Christmas weekend films, going for light-hearted fun instead of deep melodrama.",Miss Congeniality

I'm sorry that these people are so far gone as not to be able to see a good light comedy in the best Hollywood traditions without enjoying it. In this movie there is a lot to enjoy, Sandra Bullock a long time favourite of mine manages to get appealling, attractive and offensive into one character (the ice cream eating scene is truly repulsive). The secondary actors fill up the spaces nicely, but, Michael Caine again proves how well he can do every type of role.

While doing aerobics, Miss Texas gives her a look that say's ""you are not going to win""! Stan Fields goes on and on while the building is burning down. Funny! Cathy Mourningside's eyes darting around really cracked me up. Something nobody mentioned was the way Gracie liked to stick her tongue out. Don't know why but I think it's cute.

It's on TV just about every day of the year on one cable network or another. ""Miss Congeniality"" is hardly great art, but it's a lot of fun and holds up better than a lot of similar films. Sandra Bullock is irresistible as ""Dirty Harriet,"" a grungy FBI agent who goes undercover as a contestant at a beauty pageant to foil a terrorist. She''s transformed from nerd to bombshell with help from a prissy pageant consultant (the always brilliant Michael Caine). Bullock's pratfalls are endearing, and her musical wine glass playing is reason alone to see the film. Heather Burns is likable as the beauty queen Bullock befriends, and Candace Bergen and William Shatner are in their campy glory as the pageant's hosts.

150,gkearns,A real gem,10,8 October 2001,"One of the pleasures of movie-addiction is the uncovering of real gems in unexpected places. Sandra Bullock's ""Miss Congeniality"" is such a gem. I've watched it about three or so times now, and every time I find myself looking forward to the pleasure; and afterward, pleased with myself for doing so. Sandra's Gracie is a twist on Pygmalion, but doesn't suffer from the innate trap most such movies are subject to - in opening scenes giving the naturally pretty leading lady the appearance of a less than attractive blah character. Here, they get through the fact that Sandra Bullock/Gracie is truly beautiful early on in the movie, so we aren't left with the impression that somehow she improbably went from a sow's ear to a silk purse. The change is in her character, her personality. She begins the movie as an asocial loner slob, and through the movie discovers the satisfaction of good and close friends. Gracie is an FBI agent who goes undercover as a beauty contestant to investigate a serial killer's threats to the pageant. It's a comedy - a satire. The situations and story aren't to be taken too seriously, bordering on farce, but certainly not as broad or gross as the ""Airplane"" series. And as a send-up of beauty pageants it isn't as outrageous as ""Drop Dead, Gorgeous."" ""Miss Congeniality"" doesn't lose itself in its farce; it always treats the girls with respect. Not only is Gracie a human of dimension, but all the main characters - Benjamin Bratt's and Michael Caine's characters, and the main ensemble cast of girls in the pageant - are made into people of substance. (SPOILER) One of the best sequences is the fun, ""girls' night out"" at a local drum/paint-splatter nightclub; it's a scene that does a great job of humanizing the contestants. The movie is sprinkled with touching scenes involving most of the main characters - poignant moments, which the movie doesn't linger on so long as to make them maudlin. The only ones in the cast whose characters are treated farcically are Candice Bergen and William Shatner; their performances are over-the-top ... deliberately, I guess, to keep the mood of the story light. In sum, what makes this movie good, I think, is that it's character driven. To me, character revelation/resolution is the main priority of any good story; and in this regard, ""Miss Congeniality"" delivers.",Miss Congeniality

From Sandra Bullock as the tomboy turned beauty queen, to Ben Bratt as the lead FBI agent, to Michael Caine who nails the part of the Beauty consultant, Candace Bergen and William Shatner ( I love the way he says ""Texas""!) as the pagaent hosts, they all do a wonderful job.If you get a chance to see another movie this year, check it out!",Miss Congeniality

153,VisionThing,Two stars shine in darkness,4,18 October 2004,"Miss Congeniality does not have much potential, yet some of it is left unfulfilled.The script as a whole is, to put it eloquently, bad. The synopsis has clearly been an act of sheer brilliance to start with: let's take an unladylike female police officer and make her become a Miss USA contestant! Then, one could imagine, this abstract has been sent to kindergarten, where everyone has been allowed to write down one scene, with instructions to stick with the first one that comes to mind from this set-up. Eliminate doubles, and voilà, we have the script!Still, a lot can be saved with casting. Here Miss Congeniality almost succeeds, having two strikes and one miss with the main characters -- not too bad. The leading lady Sandra Bullock turns out to be really good in physical comedy, making many of the not-so-funny jokes and slapstick pieces worth a snicker with small gestures and expressions. And Michael Caine gives her sterling backup; he absolutely shines, making every scene he is involved with enjoyable through his presence and talent. Also, William Shatner gives a delightful and relaxed performance in a small role as an aging celebrity host. Benjamin Bratt, on the other hand, has a wrong character in a wrong movie.In the end, try as they might, Bullock and Caine can not make this movie good. They can only momentarily make you forget it is bad. Of course, if a person falling down repeatedly due to high heels spells divine comedy to you, this one is guaranteed to be a cracker. If not, there are still some rare but really funny bits making it all bearable, if you have absolutely nothing else to do. ** / *****",Miss Congeniality

They happened to have cast the perfect person to play the ""Fish"", and the resulting film surpasses all other films of the same entertaining format.Her down-to-earth attitude, sharp wit, good looks, physical and acting skills pulls off this role as no other actress could have done.A perfect example of what happens when making a movie, any type of movie, when everything and everyone meshes together.If you ever what to just sit down, relax, escape your own troubles and just enjoy the next couple of hours, watch this movie.",Miss Congeniality

The design, and narrative tempo, of the film by Petrie, Lawrence and the rest of the writing team is impeccable. Especially at the end, the climax is magnificently crafted, and in my opinion, a masterclass in film editing. This is how you assist a great actor like Caine in delivering maximum emotion from one, two liners... (or Statners interview after the explosion) The marriage of realism and surreal comedy is top notch, and the film manages to deliver on both fronts, simultaneously at the end! Sadly, the skill-set needed to again, create a piece of art that can stand proudly the test of time, is underappreciated but luckily talent always comes on top.
I'll give it an effort to be harsh and state out the confusing nature of the ""citizen"", which was a very important engine and it was mistreated and forsaken a little, but apart from that, this is a magnificent film, which by the way can be seen by most demographics, regardless of age or sex, and not many films can make such a claim.

Beauty pageants are fertile ground for satire and slapstick, and the creators and actors don't let anything get by them. The cast is great, from Ernie Hudson as Gracie's boss, Michael Caine as her coach, Benjamin Bratt as her love interest, Candice Bergen as the pageant head honcho, William Shatner as the pompous pageant emcee, and the actresses who play the contestants.

Sandra Bullock is all snorts and pratfalls in lieu ofa real character, and Benjamin Bratt is just, well, quite handsomeand not much more. The standouts are Caine, Bergen, andsurprisingly enough, William Shatner. He has just the perfect mixof goofiness and bravado, without letting us see the sweat. Notmuch of a plot, and a lot of 'ads' for Texas don't elevate it from 'fluff'level, but it's okay if you're stuck on a plane with nothing else towatch.",Miss Congeniality

Miss Congeniality affirmed that one more time....she's funny, cute, wit, and just lovely, what can i say... the movie itself maybe seems dumb and silly but i laugh all the way through....Sandra Bullock, keep up the good work girl...!!i am waiting for your next project and hopefully it's Oscar-worthy.....",Miss Congeniality
173,andertonmark,Miss Texas rules,8,11 December 2001,"A good concept, a light hearted script, superb character portrayal by Sandra Bullock adds up to a great little film.What I like most about this film, is the character Sandra plays. Someone I can identify with:- messy, single, free-spirited/rebellious, with her heart in the right place. The story is original. Undercover FBI agents rarely appear in the cinema at a Miss America contest, as a contestant.... it must rank up there with Point Break for best undercover jobs thought up in Hollywood!!!Aside from that the film conforms to the standard hollywood format, and is predictable in the usual way. Negative comments posted on the board will be from people who object to this lack of originality. They are missing the point. This is a delightful story, and its beauty lies in the WAY the story is told, not the story itself. You just have to hear Sandra's snorting laugh to see my point! Overall, great fun, but Miss Texas should have won! (Mary Jo Wright, we look forward to more films with you in the lead role!!!)",Miss Congeniality
174,slammerps,"Too predictible, but a few laughs. May-be woth renting.",6,18 January 2001,"Sandra Bullock all but saved this movie from being a total flop. The movie was too predicable, the ugly duckling story has been done one too many times and this movie didn't add anything to it. It did have a few laughs, not many, but a few. It's a popcorn movie that in my opinion isn't worth seeing in the theater, but I saw it for free so I won't complain. It might be worth renting when it comes to video. No doubt a lot of people will love this movie, but I just didn't.By the Way, William Shatner is the man. And the reason he is the man, is he knows that he is the man, and he's notafraid to tell anyone. Shatner did a great job in this movie. He has great comedic timing.

175,Ely-girl,Excellent!,9,3 July 2009,"Miss Congeniality is one of those fun rom-com comedies that does not come around often. It may be over eight years old but is still utterly hilarious and entertaining. Unlike most comedies these days, this film is not, I repeat, not loaded with un-necessary (crude) jokes, continuous sexual references and bad language. Miss Congeniality is one for the girls!! It is light hearted and extremely funny; entertainment ensures! Sandra Bullock, Michael Caine and Benjamin Bratt make this film what it is. They are simply fabulous. I could not fault any of them. The good thing about this film is that it does not try to be something it's not. It's funny but not-over-the-top funny which is good because a lot of comedies nowadays don't seem to know their weaknesses. It also has it's share of serious elements. The story - An FBI agent - Gracie Hart - reluctantly goes undercover in the Miss United States beauty pageant to prevent a wrong-doing and is transformed into a beauty queen. Disatrous results are a must for a film of this category! When I first watched the trailer for this film, I thought it looked like fun although a little predictable. I was wrong. It is simply full of surprises! The jokes, although not very memorable, were funny (Example: 'I haven't seen a walk like that since Jurassic Park') and has a good soundtrack. Give this film a chance. It is certainly worth it for the laughs. Go on. Give it a go!",Miss Congeniality
176,bakovljev,Awful,1,5 February 2003,"This is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. Even my children (whom I assume it was aimed at) didn't like it.Whoever is advising Sandra Bullock on her choice of scripts needs changing pdq! As good as she was in The Net, 28 Days and A Time to Kill, she is equally ill suited for this film and role.",Miss Congeniality
177,GJBStar,Good Quality comedy,8,12 October 2003,"There are some actresses who produce weighty or worthy pieces of work and there are those who produce popular movies.  Sandra Bullock is an actress who falls into the latter category.  Yet, in this category, she is at the top of the tree and it is in films such as Miss Congeniality that she proves this.For a fish out of water comedy, this is a film that plays to Bullock's qualities - her tomboy image from Speed, her warm humour and her ability to play for laughs and be deadpan.  As such, Bullock is allowed to shine from a castlist containing Michael Caine and Ben Bratt.  However, if I had one criticism, it would be that there are occasions when Caine just appears to be shamelessly mugging and camping it up for the camera to no real effect.There are some genuinely funny moments, mostly centred around the pageant and it is nice to see such a movie which doesn't take itself or its setting too seriously.  Many of the contestants give good supporting performances and as such, it is hard to pick one out.Overall, it is a bit slight but anyone renting/buying this movie would surely know what to expect - familiar, funny and essentially sweet-natured - just like Sandra Bullock herself.8/10 - A good example of the genre.",Miss Congeniality
178,twalker,very funny and Sandra is great!,8,31 January 2001,"My wife and I went to see Miss Congeniality on a Friday night, which is when we normally go the movies. I had had a very stressful week at work and I wanted to see something that would make me laugh. MC was a great choice!Sandra Bullock stars as a rough tomboy-ish FBI agent who goes under cover in a beauty pageant. She has to learn how to be a lady under the instruction of Michael Caine who was excellent in his role. Benjamin Bratt plays Bullock's fellow agent who is a cocky, overconfident ladies man. The chemistry between Bullock and Bratt is right on. As for the other characters, they are pretty forgettable. William Shatner doesn't fit his role at all in my opinion, and Candace Bergen just gets on my nerves in general.Even though Bratt and Caine turn in great performances, Bullock absolutely steals the show. She has the perfect attitude for the part and the funniest parts are the little gestures, comments, and facial expressions that she uses. The movie also pokes fun at the beauty pageant scene VERY effectively and Bullock is the centerpiece of this aspect.MC is a great movie to go see if you want a good laugh. I highly recommend it.Todd Walker",Miss Congeniality

Do not be afraid, it's right out of the ""Private Benjamin"" school of guilty pleasures. You know you should hate it, but you can't stop smiling. It's not perfect, but Michael Caine and Sandra Bullock make this film work and William Shatner's pastiche is over the top enough to make you realise that you really shouldn't be taking it too seriously. It's fabulous darling!",Miss Congeniality

It was funny through at least 85% of the film (it had the entire audience laughing), and the novelty here is that the trailers didn't spoil the gags!  In fact, very little of the film was revealed.  As far as the shallowness of beauty pageants... been there, done that in my high school years... it was pretty true to form.  So what?  I think the point of this movie was that sometimes we have to get out of our comfort zone and judgment of others and their lifestyles that are different than ours, in order to grow personally and maybe see our true potential.We'd give this movie an 8 out of 10.  Don't analyze it... just go and laugh and enjoy the movie for what it is!",Miss Congeniality

I've gotta say, every time I see this movie, it gets better! Sandra Bullock is at her best (when isn't she??) This movie has made me a BIG fan of her! I recommed this movie to ALL!

Throughout the film, from her ""rough"" exterior to her inner ""beauty"", Sandra was the only one you really care about during the whole film, and equal praises go to Ms. Bullock, the scriptwriters, & the costumers for helping us get past the rest of actors who showed up for a smile & a paycheck.In particular for Ms. Bullock, there are quite a few places where I found myself reviewing the film to see her wild expressions or magical smirky-smile.  It was those moments, though, where you realize that  the rest of the cast was placed in typecast roles JUST to make her stand out, and while that's not necessarily bad, it's hard to think Ben Bratt, Ernie Hudson, Candice Bergen, or Bill ... SHATNER! will ever carry a film on their own.  Michael Caine pulls the ol' British card one more time, and it's great to see someone still keep his edge into the later years.All in all, the film is good, because a few outstanding actors & elements have pulled the whole average up from blandness.",Miss Congeniality

I enjoyed the fact that she didn't win the pageant and she did an okay job at portraying the tomboy F.B.I. agent Gracie. I just couldn't get pass the fact that this was Sandra Bullock who is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood.They tried to make her look unattractive but even when her hair is messy and she doesn't have any make-up on she can pull off her sexy demeanor with that smile and voice, c'mon she can't be ugly even if she tried! With this aside, Michael Caine was the true gem in this film! His sarcasm had my crying! This guy was really funny, he had that same wit he portrayed in ""Noise Off"" and seemed to apply it to this flick. Benjiman Bratt did an okay job as a Sandra's conceited rival. The problem was that you can tell that two were going to hook up in the movie before you get to the middle of it.

This movie is truly entertaining and hilarious. I don't remember having such a great time at the movies in quite a while, even if some people think it is predictable, but... isn't that the reason most of us go to movies anyway? To spend a good time, have a good laugh and hopefully forget some of our everyday worries? Well this film did it for me.

Just a few minor problems:  I think they should have made it more plausible for Gracie to get into the top 10. Recall that they were going to fix the pageant, but the fix was canceled when the other agents left, so she had to get into the top 10 on her merits, and did so, even though up to that point in the pageant she had made a total ass of herself.  After she made the top 10 her behavior improved greatly, and it was almost believable for her to be #2, but they could have made her improve sooner to make it more plausible.BTW, people describe this as an ugly-duckling-becomes-a-swan story, but I didn't see that happen.

192,parasaurolophus,A Dark Comedy??,7,29 August 2001,"My wife and I watched Miss Congeniality last Saturday night, and though it was brainless fluff, it was great fun. We chuckled and laughed from beginning to end. This is definitely a fabulous movie to help unwind and have a good time after a hard day at work.I was going to write my comments along those lines, but as I looked back upon the movie, I noticed a shadow underneath it. Intrigued, I studied it, and this veil of darkness grew as I looked closer. Though most reviewers are pouncing on the obvious ""ugly duckling"" transformation into ""beautiful swan"" plot, some shadowy wisps suggest a dark satire underneath the glare of the obvious.As I looked back from a distance, almost all of the characters were deranged, deviant, or bimbos. The only characters not in this class were Gracie (Sandra Bulluck) and the FBI chief. The latter was a bit part and not strongly highlighted. The rest of the FBI team appeared as bimbos with voyeuristic tendencies. Meanwhile, all of the pageant folks were bimbos, weirdos, or ""two-faced,"" and everyone seemed caught in obsessions. I suddenly realized, ""What a wretched portrayal of humanity!"" It was then I also realized that the rough-hewn, but gutsy and savvy character of Gracie was the only one whom most of the audience would empathize. Compared to the others, Gracie was already a ""swan"" at the start of the movie. Only outwardly was she ""ugly.""As the movie progressed, not only did Gracie get sucked into the pageant physically, but there were hints that she might be getting sucked into the mind-set as well. Was Gracie becoming a bimbo? Also, near the movie's climax Gracie made a venomous threat toward the movie's villain which bordered on being maniacal. Was Gracie becoming deranged, too?? Was Gracie's character becoming corrupted and degraded like the other characters? Would she become ""ugly""? Or would she finally extricate herself from this twisted mass of humanity and retain her ""gutsy and savvy"" persona?Is Miss Congeniality a light comedy, built of Pollyana fluff, describing an ugly duckling's transformation into a beautiful swan?Or is that just a façade for a dark comedy, with hints of A Clockwork Orange, describing a swan's degradation into an ugly duckling?Intriguing questions ...

He nearly steals the show and seems to have produced the most focused characterization for his role as rarely seen on any film. What a shame and it is no wonder the producers could not get him for the sequel. Mr. Caine provides a superior support role and was overlooked for his efforts. At the end of the movie, someone needed to convince Gracie to some back inside the Hotel for her ""farewell"" as a surprise, and of course Victor was the one, and the only logically believable character to convince Gracie to come back inside. Victor had a lot of knowledge pertinent to the Pageants, as well as the ""inside"" politics of the Pageants, and applied every ounce of brilliance to transform Gracie to becoming a ""Total Woman"" and his own portrayal of a Support Team Member. Victor's character was so vitally important to this story that without him, there would have been no Gracie the contestant, a crucial cog in the wheel of this movie.",Miss Congeniality

The banter between Bullock and Caine alone is enough to carry the film, and had me laughing out loud at regular intervals.The plot is not much to go on, but suffices.

Sandra Bullock was endearing (if unbelievable) as FBI agent turned Beauty Queen, Benjamin Bratt looked prettier than most of the contestants, but the best performances came from the over-the-top supporting hams - Michael Caine was superb and William Shatner a caricature of himself.  Candice Bergen was also well cast.  Though I agree with earlier comments that the writing could have been sharper and the romance a bit more interesting it is a movie that can be enjoyed with any ""Teens"" in your household (and you won't feel like you're enduring another teen angst or teen party-hardy flick.)

Bullock's FBI agent represents what a lot of women would like to be if they dared free themselves from conventional behavior, and her eventual appreciation of the other contestants' value appeals to women who are put off by strident feminism's criticism of the more traditional point of view.  Men, however, may appreciate less seeing some of their typical behavior towards women (such as the male agents' reactions to having the hidden camera in the contestants' dressing room.)

If you need your Sandra fix, go rent ""Love Potion No. 9"".  And if you need your Benjamin Bratt fix...well, I suppose I pity you.  I mean, I was at a Superbowl Party a couple of years ago where a canned ham gave a more animated and convincing performance (playing a meat loaf) than Bratt serves up here.

Those weaknesses aside, Sandra saves the film with her charming and funny Gracie, ably assisted by the incomparable Michael Caine. The other roles mostly felt flat and forced.

Unfortunately this is all it delivers, a string of mild, feel-good, escapist humour. Admittedly, it is a watchable and mildly entertaining picture, but it fails to create even a single plot-twist or deviation from its incredibly formulatic approach to film making.

212,KateBrad,So much fun should be a federal crime!,10,16 December 2000,"I was afraid I would be disappointed with this movie.  After seeing the hilarious preview for it 6 weeks ago, I had let myself get too excited with anticipation, and feared that like so many other movies that come out now, the good parts would have been spoiled by the previews.  NOT SO with this one! There were a few cliches, but not overdone, as might be expected.  The characters were endearing, a little wacky, and human. This movie wasn't an epic or a tearjerker, and isn't going to change the world.  But it may give you a bunch of laughs and funny one-liners for your friends.  And that is what I hope for everyone.... and also, of course...World Peace!",Miss Congeniality
213,carlostrek,A light funny movie,8,2 January 2001,"If you want to have a few good laughs and enjoy slapstick comedy, this is a movie you wish to see. Sure, the plot is predictable and you can see the ending coming almost from the start, but hey, it is comedy at its most basic level. Ms. Bullock does a good job and the supportive cast are fun to watch. It was good to see Mr. Shatner in a movie instead of that insufferable commercial.My wife and I enjoyed the movie, and at the end of the movie we were happy we made the decision to see this one. The theatre was full, it was on New Years day, and the crowd seemed to have enjoyed the show.",Miss Congeniality
214,jbell-2,Hilarious,10,28 December 2000,"Miss Congeniality was so much more than I expected. Sandra Bullock's last few movies I have found to be rather tepid and childish. I absolutely hated ""Practical Magic"" and ""Forces Of Nature."" I haven't bothered to see ""Gun Shy"" and ""28 Days"" didn't seem to appealing, though after seeing this I plan to go rent it. I think Ms. Bullock is extremely talented, and after her last few films I almost thought she was becoming another Julia Roberts, whom I absolutely hate. Ms. Roberts had her own fluke hits like ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" and ""Conspiracy Theory"" but she generally always plays the same thing. Anyhow, Ms. Bullock is more attractive and talented. Her Golden Globe nomination is well deserved. Michael Caine was very funny (when isn't he when he's trying?) and Benjamin Bratt makes a better couple with Sandra then real life Julia. Candace Bergen was funny too, and it's good to see her acting again. Let's hope the rumors are true that she's going to star with Sigourney Weaver, Bill Murray. & Harvey Keitel in the upcoming mobster comedy ""Wedding Contract."" No one could ever hold a light to the likes of Ms. Weaver (getting off track again) but anyhow, I enjoyed this film, and if you have a sense of humor, you might too. Not to be judgmental, but if you like ""Runaway Bride"" or ""Notting Hill"" better with the clunky dialogue and the extremely bad acting, you need help.",Miss Congeniality

Then, there is this ""miracle transformation"" of ugly duckling FBI agent Gracie Hart into a beautiful contestant...But, it just doesn't matter in this movie! Not with such a crew: Sandra Bullock (role of Gracie really suits her), Michael Caine (this guy is off tha hook... I enjoyed every single line of Victor), William Shatner (superb)...

Not all viewers from European countries turn the movie down so- in fact, when I left the theatre this evening I was under the impression that everyone was quite satisfied- the girls for seeing that question on what a woman can be tackled, the men for all those long legs and bikinis. Have really enjoyed all this- very nice production you did. I actually chuckled during the first few takes when no puns were being made- just the cinematography and the mime were funny. I have a few friends who study movies and really appreciate masters like Stan Kubrick, and they liked being entertained by you.So did I.

I went to this with a friend and didn't expect much, come on now a movie about a FBI agent going undercover as a Miss America, how lame is that. But WAIT! the scripts good the acting is cool and the jokes are actually funny! Whoa!. One for us blokes with the stunning Sandra Bullock and the rest of the female cast. One for the girls in the chick flick genre. I actually came out of this movie over two hours ago and I still smile at the thought of some of the gags.

Top Class!.",Miss Congeniality
222,tlowell-2,Don't Encourage Them,1,27 December 2000,"The producers of MISS CONGENIALITY took absolutely no chances making this film, hiring America's Sweetheart (hereafter known as A.S.), Sandra Bullock to star, and surrounding her with a cast of veterans who could sleepwalk through this picture, and did.  The writing was trite and predictable, and the jokes were mildly amusing at best and absurdly overdrawn at worst. They chose to shoot fish in a barrel by poking fun at beauty pageants, and even then, they couldn't even follow through on this, since the ultimate message is that beauty pageants aren't so bad after all.  Please do not encourage these film makers to film again with your $8.50.I took in this puff piece on Christmas Day because it happened to be the only thing showing at the moment we arrived at the theater.  The film opens with a flashback to the childhood of Gracie Hart, the title character, played by A.S., establishing the fact that even in grade school, she kicked ass and took names.  Why, we never really find out, or even begin to care. She is now an FBI agent, and her lack of social skills and basic grooming apparently also causes her to be a perennial screw-up on the job.  Facing an impending review board after her most recent fiasco, she by chance happens to be the perfect candidate to infiltrate the Miss United States Pageant in the hunt for ""The Citizen"", a bogeyman who strangely never does amount to anything in the film.  I guess they couldn't get Alan Rickman.  In any event, he supposedly has sent a note vaguely threatening the pageant, so off we go.Despite raging protests by her boss, over-acted criminally by Ernie Hudson, Gracie is chosen by co-worker Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) to turn in her t-shirt and sweats and submit to a makeover by ""pageant consultant"" Victor Melling, the foppish Michael Caine.  Predictably, Victor plays Henry Higgins to Gracie's Eliza Dolittle, and before you know it, Gracie's a stunner. This turns Eric's head, of course, and the romantic subplot is given life (barely).Meanwhile, Candice Bergen's pageant coordinator, Kathy Morningside, is cooperating with the FBI to allow Gracie in the pageant while simultaneously plotting to copy The Citizen's M.O. to sabotage it because she is being canned.  Again, we never are given any good reason why, nor do we care. William Shatner is introduced as the Bert Parks-like pageant host, but he mostly plays himself as, what else, an egotistic.......  Gracie flimsily enters the pageant to replace Miss New Jersey, who has been disgraced by starring in a porn video.  By this point, I wish I had rented that instead of going to the movies.The ""plot"" lurches forward, as Gracie works her way through the preliminaries, bonding with her competitors to dig up dirt.  Why the FBI thinks the contestants in a beauty pageant would be involved in bombing it is never made clear, nor does it really matter.  After some mildly amusing pratfalls and silly set pieces in lovely San Antonio, The Citizen is then caught off-screen, and Ernie Hudson barks shrilly for everyone to go home, or ""turn in their badge and gun!!!"" as if we didn't have enough cliches. Naturally, Gracie turns in her badge and gun, like every single cop in every single bad movie, and stays behind on her ""hunch"" that Kathy Morningside is up to something.  Eric soon follows, on cue.Of course, there is a happy ending, with Gracie reverting to her kick-ass form and punching out Miss California (which was pretty funny, I admit) as she and Eric save the pageant, learn something about themselves, and fall in love.  Maybe it would even make Ernie Hudson's heart melt!  Thankfully, we are spared that scene.A.S. attempts valiantly to carry the film, but even her considerable charms cannot overcome the hopelessly hokey plot.  And who would believe for even 10 seconds that Gracie isn't a babe?  This, among other myriad holes, sinks the movie from the start.  Bratt is a handsome man, but other than that, he's an empty suit.  Caine, fresh off his Oscar for ""Cider House Rules"", looks foolishly out of place in this mess.  Bergen must be hurting for cash, and Shatner, well, is Shatner.  Four writers are credited and should all be ashamed.  A.S. is also listed as a producer.  Honey, when are you going to realize you keep making the same picture?",Miss Congeniality
223,punkboyoy,Miss...I want my $ back,1,10 January 2001,"Wow!!  I am absolutely baffled that people find this movie even remotely funny.  The ugly duckling thing is so passe.  What, no one can figure out that Sandra Bullock is hot without makeup?  The woman could be wearing a mud mask and 99% of men would think she is gorgeous.  But somehow the geniuses in the FBI in this film could not?  Her looks however, can only carry a movie so far. And that is about 10 minutes. Heavy-handed direction and a by the numbers screenplay make this movie one of the worst of the year.Only highlight: Shatner was surprisingly good as a cheesy pageant host.  Or was he acting?  Either way I enjoyed his performance.

224,bam9,Not a Shred of Beauty Here,3,20 January 2001,"A heavily flawed vehicle for Sandra Bullock...don't waste time wondering what the movie has to say about the relative nature of beauty - its sentiments are downright ugly. At one point a room of FBI agents are laughing at computerized images of female agents - because the women are homely. Bullock's character jokes that one of her fellow contestants will self-induce vomiting to rid her body of pizza after they've eaten it. How funny! In addition, we have to witness a huge team of beauty specialists attend to Bullock to ""beautify"" her. And it isn't until she's showing off her body and slathering on the makeup that Benjamin Bratt's character pays her any mind.Bullock stretches herself thin here, desperately trying to play a quirky adult ""tom boy."" She eats microwaved meals, wrestles with her coworkers, gets a bevy of pageant contestants drunk, picks her teeth and affects a horsey laugh. This isn't a character - it's a poorly written and acted caricature. Candace Bergen is utterly wasted. Some of the lines her 2-dimensional character has to deliver are laughable and uninspired (particularly toward the conclusion of the film). Only Michael Caine emerges somewhat untarnished from this generic turkey - his character probably has the most depth.",Miss Congeniality
225,pmarring,Survived the drive home 'though we couldn't stop laughing,10,27 December 2000,"Great entertainment!  Sandra Bullock has grown past her other roles as she adds graceful athleticism to an already formidable repertoire.  A delightful performance from beginning to end.  This is an actor who can change personae without seeming effort from one end of the spectrum to the other.The writing is exquisitely hilarious and unpredictable, especially for a comedy with so much physical energy.  The jokes flow so fast and profusely we almost didn't have time to breathe, although kids might not catch a lot of the gems as they whiz by in an ironic insider staccato.Members of my family who have been in beauty pageants laughed the hardest and longest as they recognised truth after poignant truth.And the movie keeps its delicate balance between excoriating the hypocrisy and shallowness of the promotions while acknowledging the intelligence and decency of the women who participate.We made it all the (hysterical) way home although my husband repeated funny lines all the way.Candace Bergen and Michael Caine are excellent too.",Miss Congeniality

I spent a good moment viewing this movie, on its 1st day of exhibition on chilean screens (April 26th).I am certain it isn't a masterpiece and probably not qualify for the Academy Awards, but helped me to forget the every-day troubles.

With Sandra Bullock in the movie, it was at least funny. This is the kind of character that she likes to play. She is not afraid of looking ridiculous, unlike many actresses. Benjamin Bratt, Michael Caine and Candrice Bergin are very good in their characters. The love story is inevitably cliché, but it didn't bother me that much.So for a great acting, a most of the time cliché plot and many funny moments, I give 7 out of 10 to this movie.",Miss Congeniality
228,CandaceSC,Laughing all the way through it ~,7,2 January 2001,"Sandra Bullock stars as a nerdy messy Gracie Hart, a FBI agent who is cornered to wear a dress and some lipstick to go under cover in the Miss USA Pageant to track down a bomber.Don't take this movie serious - It's a comedy and it will keep you laughing all the way through it.  Sandra Bullock uses physical slapstick the way Lucille Ball use too. Her timing is quick and cute and with the help of a gay beauty consultant (Michael Caine) she becomes the knock-dead beauty we all know her as.  But even after the transformation the nerd in her lays close to the surface, which makes her so loveable.  Michael Caine steals the show with his quick sharp one-liners and the way he rolls his eyes when trying to turn this mess into a beauty queen. Her partner (Benjamin Bratt - Julia Roberts honey) could have used a few better lines - But his charm adds a lot to the relationship of these two characters.I gave the movie 7 stars - which is good, I mean we're not talking Oscar material here.  My favorite scene is when she hates the thought of appearing in a swimsuit on stage and is wrapped tightly in a towel and is then promptly pushed on stage by Michael Caine and the towel is torn off and the goofy FBI agent stumbles forward. This movie is so funny. Don't listen to the bad reviews - you'll enjoy Miss Congeniality.",Miss Congeniality

I can't put my finger on it...but for the first time in my life, I really fell for Sandra Bullock.  I found her quite charming as the rough, tom-boy character.  Her eating habits was riotous and (as we all knew) her ""transformation"" was stunning--kind of proving Hollywood is full of NORMAL looking ladies that have great make-up artists and breast boosters.  But there was something different here with Sandra.  Exiting her ""changing hanger"" she showed a beautiful shape--proving women (REAL looking women) ARE beautiful.

231,Davenz,Excellent comedy kept me laughing all the way through.,8,17 March 2001,"This is an excellent comedy which kept me laughing all the way through consistently without the flat patches you often get in longer comedies.
The premise is not so unusual with Sandra Bullock playing an ugly duckling/Pygmalion turning into a swan, however, the performances, especially by Bullock, Caine, Shatner and Bergen make the film.Bullock stars as the never been loved tomboy of the FBI who has to dump her coarse manners and unkempt appearance in order to go undercover at a beauty pageant. Michael Caine is the Dr Higgins figure grooming her for stardom. Shatner plays Shatner, and Bergen is the matron of the Pageant. Benjamin Bratt plays the love interest !Bullock is excellent all the way through from uncouth to gorgeous, and is particularly stunning in her transformed self. Caine is also excellent and the interplay between these 2 and the cast in general makes for a lively pace all the way through, til the final crowning ceremony.A thoroughly entertaining film and well worth seeing.",Miss Congeniality

Yes, it IS a romantic comedy, but those going to see it or rent it probably KNOW that before they see it (unless they were clubbed and dragged into the theater against their will!)  It is exactly that:  A romantic comedy that is very funny but yet does not take itself too seriously.  I feel that not only Bullock was great, but the entire cast was wonderful.  The actors actually seem to be having FUN while making the movie, which makes it even better. So, if you are looking for a deep, serious movie with an intricate plot line, this is not the movie for you.

If you haven't liked Sandra Bullock in the past, after this film, I think it is nearly impossible not to love her.  There may not be much in the movie which keeps you rolling in laughter for hours, but the funny lines never stop coming, and along with that, neither does the fun. Surprisingly enough, although the plot is not unique, the actors and actresses in the film give it to you in a way that is sure to be pleasurable.

Sometimes, you just want to eat that piece of cake, rather than appreciate how awesome it looks.Every time I feel sad, depressed, angry etc. I pop this one in.

When movies like Anchorman get a 7.2 by comparison, I feel like I'm somewhat alien to this planet......Keep forgetting that being concise on this website is not an attribute, so I'll digress. Humor is subjective, so everyone has their own, equally valid opinion, but IMHO Sandra nailed it, was at the height of her comedic prowess in this movie, and it will stand up over time not so much as a great movie (not), but a great performance by Bullock.",Miss Congeniality
251,clara-24,A Romcom winner,9,17 April 2004,"From my first viewing, I loved this film.  It has everything- an engaging (if not particularly convincing) storyline, great laughs, brilliant on screen chemistry between the leads, and most of all, a 100% lovable main character.   Sandra Bullock works her magic yet again, and would have made this film a winner even without her strong supporting cast of Michael Caine, Benjamin Bratt and Candice Bergen. It has some particularly clever quips- I loved `i haven't seen a walk like that since Jurassic Park!', and it should appeal to a wide variety of ages.  It held my attention throughout- always a good quality in a film! And OK, its not particularly thought provoking or realistic, but for what it is- an entertaining romcom- it's brilliant! 10/10",Miss Congeniality
252,lozzer_fizzer,A film to watch over and over,8,4 September 2016,"I first watched this film when I was a teenager, it was my first ever DVD and I love it now as much as I did then. Sandra Bullock makes this film, no one would have been able to portray the character like she did. The comedy is perfect, the timing between characters is good. More than one generation can enjoy this film, my mum, myself and my 9 year old daughter all really enjoy it. The only slight thing that lets it down, is the chemistry between Gracie and Eric just isn't there, it seems forced. But still, if you want an easy film to snuggle up on the sofa with, this is the one.",Miss Congeniality

254,Thunder-31,"some laugh, some grin",7,21 May 2001,"I saw this on DVD at home with my wife, and we both enjoyed the combination of adroit physical comedy, social satire, mock thriller and some good one-liners. Sandra Bullock shows her comedic range. The humor is relatively tasteful, the romance is kept light, and the happy ending is never in doubt.",Miss Congeniality
255,SLA Sierra,Miss Congeniality shines in the spotlight,7,13 December 2000,"This movie makes fun of beauty pageants (excuse me, scholarship programs) so I liked the premise right away. Sandra Bullock plays Gracie Hart, a tomboy FBI agent who has managed to fumble her latest assignment. Benjamin Bratt, as Eric Matthews, is called to lead the investigation on the Miss United States pageant, and chooses to see Gracie in undercover as Miss New Jersey. Michael Caine plays the delightful Victor Melling, the ""number one beauty pageant consultant ever."" William Shatner makes a cheesy appearance as Stan Leigh, pageant organiser.I like Sandra Bullock a great deal, even when she's in cheesy roles, and this movie was able to show off her talents well. She repeated her transformation from dorkette to überbabe that she did in ""Love Potion #9"", but far more successfully this time. Benjamin Bratt was also very likeable in his role, providing a nice contrast with his straight-laced portrayal.Are any plot twists in this movie a shock? Hardly. But this is still good entertainment, with some snappy lines and a few nice sight gags. Thankfully, this movie does not pound jokes/sight gags to death, which would have been all too easy to do. The movie goes forward fairly smoothly, and there are even one or two surprises. This is a good Saturday afternoon flick!",Miss Congeniality
256,bwade,Laughed so much!,9,28 January 2001,This movie had been recommended to us by several people. I went in a group and we all agreed that this was a great movie.The combination of mystery and humour was entertaining.  Sandra Bullock is amazing in this role...we laughed so much!  The final pageant scene is a hit!,Miss Congeniality
257,bigrogges,Some movies aren't very good. Here's an example.,6,28 December 2000,"Some films are simply rentals at best.  Miss Congeniality is one of them. The story comes from the masterminds behind such hits as Forces of Nature and TV's Family Ties Vacation and Search for a Supermodel (Marc Lawrence for the first two, Katie Ford for the latter).  It is directed by the one and only Donald Petrie, responsible for the 1999 stinker, My Favourite Martian (to his credit, he has directed a number of hits, including Grumpy Old Men). It features the look-at-me-I-am-so-cute antics of Sandra Bullock (also the producer) and the I'll-do-anything-for-a-paycheck skills of Benjamin Bratt. So what's not to like?Bullock plays FBI agent Gracie Hart.  She is a rough, crude, unrefined woman who could beat the snot out of any man if he looked at her funny.  She always seems to be screwing things up, finally getting herself in trouble when she nearly gets an agent killed during an operation.  Despite the heat from her supervisor (played by Ernie Hudson), she is elected as part of a special team headed by Eric Matthews (Bratt) to capture an elusive criminal known as ""The Citizen"".  Apparently, this deranged killer is going to strike again.  This time, the Miss United States Pageant is the target.The only catch to Gracie being selected as part of the team is that she has to be in the pageant, as a contestant.  After receiving clearance from the people running the pageant (played by Candice Bergen and William Shatner), the newly appointed Miss New Jersey has two days to be whipped in to pageantry shape.  To pull off this nearly impossible feat, Bergen brings in a former expert to assist Gracie.  Academy Award-winner Michael Caine (The Cider House Rules) plays Victor Melling, a trainer who once won 10 out of 11 years with the woman he trained.  Now washed-up, Vic is reluctant to take on the challenge.  Since he has nothing else to do and unable to resist the chance to again compete, he accepts.From here, Sandra gets beautiful, she bonds with the other girls, and she searches for the killer.  All of the girls just want to have fun hi-jinx became a bit too much as time went on.  The movie does contain some funny scenes, but the laughing to eye-rolling/sighing ratio is significant enough to damper the experience of this film.  As stated before, this one is a rental at best.",Miss Congeniality
258,Fabien_pichard-3,I have not laughed so much in so long...,8,8 January 2001,"I was a bit skeptic when I went there at first, but staring in the first 5 minutes I was laughing... Sure, it's the story of the tom boy nerdy kind of girl, but a smart one that has to go under cover for the FBI in the miss USA contest... now, if you go there relaxed and you actually pay attention to everything they say and every details... it's a very funny movie... it's been a very long time I have not laughed that much...",Miss Congeniality
259,mholtbbc,Wow!,8,17 December 2001,"Wow!  What a surprise of a movie.  I came into this movie with about the lowest expectations possible for a movie.  Sandra Bullock's performance was a pleasant surprise...her acting was actually tolerable (does anybody remember `The Net').  She delivered her lines in impeccable fashion and actually came off as funny.  The premise of the movie was better than could be expected; what excitement could possibly be gleaned from an undercover FBI agent staking out a beauty pageant?  Well, I'll tell you it was a movie with a deeper plot line than one might think.  There was a transformation of character from simple tom girl loaner, to a beautiful classy woman.  The character development was strong with the women being shown as actually warm hearted individuals and not simply bubbly air heads.  The romance angle was cheesy and stilted, but where not actually dealing with an Oscar caliber movie here, but simply a light hearted comedy that was meant to delight the audience over the course of an hour and a half.  Overall.I'd have to rank this movie as 7-1/2 (rounded to 8) out of 10 stars.",Miss Congeniality
260,lyrael,I'm very impressed by this film. Hats off to Hollywood.,10,2 January 2001,"This film delighted me!  I hoped that it would, but when I go to see a commercial film I am always prepared for the worst.  Lately, it seems it is almost impossible to see a movie where the women are just people - unexploited and not purely there to be sexy.Certainly Miss Congeniality recognized women as being sexual creatures, but it was not predominated by the female stereotype so prevalent in America today.  Bullock's character was allowed to be strong and not the weak, slutty Hollywood female star we usually end up suffering through (for reference, see Dracula 2000, The Replacements, or pretty much any action film out there).  I was glad that she didn't seduce men or flaunt herself. She was allowed to be a woman without being made into a prostitute.I knew that there would be a transformation in the movie, and I was worried that when Bullock went from tough cop to contestant she would become a stupid, sniveling woman as well.   I was very relieved when she remained tough but was allowed to accept herself as a woman rather than run from her gender.  Much of her bitterness and social commentary was so dead-on.  It was almost exactly how I feel about society.  Perfect!  I think there should be more movies like this, and less like The Replacements.My only qualm with the film is that Bullock's character was referred to as a feminist.  I am so tired of this.  Just because people realize that women are not treated equally and attempt to change it or choose not to conform to the media's ideal of a woman does not make them feminist.  It simply makes them humanist and intelligent.I'd like to praise this movie, cast, crew, and all involved for a job well done!",Miss Congeniality
261,movielover723,Sandra Bullock shines as Miss Congeniality,9,28 January 2001,"I was a little disturbed after reading some of the user comments on this page. I went with my mother and my boyfriend to see Miss Congeniality last night, and I must say that I really liked the movie. I think it had a great plot. I think the entire cast used good humour, the theatre was laughing and so was I.There were some flaws, I'll admit. That is the reason I didn't give it a ten. I think The plot could've been played out a little more, that it could've been more of a mystery. I think there could've been more of a love story ending... The end of the movie just kind of left you hanging there. I think the movie ended too soon. What happened to Gracie with the FBI? Was she still working there? What about the review board?I can understand about open flood gates with pageant movies. There has seemed to be a lot of them recently. Miss Congeniality didn't do much harm, it showed what the standard viewing of beauty pageants is, but it also showed what they could really be like.I do not think Sandra carried this movie alone on her shoulders. Benjaminn Bratt is an excellent actor. He does a wonderful job on Law and Order, and he has plenty of charm. Like Sandra Bullock, he seems like the kind of actor who would smile, give you an autograph, and maybe chat for a few seconds if you happened to stumble upon them. William Shatner played a typical character of his, and it had the audience laughing anyway.All in all, I think Miss Congeniality had something for everyone, and I know that I will watch it again.",Miss Congeniality

Must read ;) ...",10,11 January 2006,"As one of Sandra Bullock's number 1 fans are you expecting a negative feedback in this film?? As much as I love Sandra, if needed I would criticise good and bad points in her films, but this is not one of them... Miss Congeniality I watched in 2000-2001 when released in the UK cinemas with my ex-girlfriend at the age of 11-12. I went in thinking that it would be a feminine chick flick which I would snore and snooze right the way through, but that was not the case..Sandra, presented as a 'tomboy' type slob at the beginning immediately appealed to me which made me think ""ok then... whats going on here?"" .. FBI agents, gun shots, terrorism??? OK, I don't think this is going to be a chick flick as many people are perceived by it's name.Sandra (Gracie) has to go undercover in the miss united states pageant to watch out for a terrorist attack after the FBI receives the 'bomb' threat. Watching Sandra change from a masculine tomboy, hard girl figure into a feminine, beautiful lady is really a liberating experience.. Although she is playing the part in the pageant, and she certainly looks the part, she is still the same 'Gracie Hart' inside. She stays beautiful on the inside whether she is wrapped in pearls and diamonds, and a flashy dress, or in her military boots, and knotted hair. Her beauty is deep...Sandra Bullock plays both a convincing Gracie Hart, and Gracie Lou Freebush in the film. By just watching the opening of the film you will be hooked with the talented acting skills and techniques within minutes.Michael Caine is certainly also a very funny character. He plays 'Victor' who is a beauty aide for Sandra, which is not usually his movie roles so thats worth seeing. He really pulled it off, without him it wouldn't be half as funny.. The expressions he can make! William Shatner's so called 'song' at the end is a laugh indeed, and his acting is so pure, and comedic...Every actor in the film is comedic, funny, and can be extremely dramatic at times, it's bizarre! This film is definitely a thumbs up from me to watch, it's the first film I saw with Sandra Bullock, and ever since then I have been her number 1 fan, (perhaps you could say stalker! not literally) haha!",Miss Congeniality
275,JeffK8,This film provided me with the laughs I'd been seeking.,8,18 June 2001,"Fish out of water stories are not new to films, but this decidedly different treatment made the film much more enjoyable than I thought it would be.  Sandra Bullock gives a very human(e) feeling to her portrayal of FBI agent Grace Hart.  Ben Bratt edges his role as an equal in the bureau with a dollop of chauvinism.  He heads an excellent supporting cast, but Michael Caine steals the film as Victor, the pageant consultant who remolds Grace.  (Candice Bergen and Bill Shatner, as the co-host/producer and emcee of the pageant, respectively, aren't far behind Caine.)",Miss Congeniality

I had the urge to walk out it was so disgustingly predictable, were these writer's were on strike when they wrote this?!  The ONLY humorous bit was the use of an entire airplane hangar and battalion of ""specialists"" to do the makeover from tomboy to ""contender.""  Other than that, it was an utter waste of two hours and $6.00.  There weren't even any decent trailers.  Why is Hollywood fixated on ""strong"" leading women (relatively speaking), vacuous females in supporting roles and wimpy supporting men?  I'd like to see a film with a female lead that doesn't rely on dumbed down support to be an effective ""lead.""A real disappointment; both Sandra Bullock and Ben Bratt have done better. I also had MUCH higher expectations from the likes of Ernie Hudson, Michael Caine, and Candice Bergen (whereas William Shatner is as William Shatner does).  Even Heather Burns has done better, but this was just a stinker all around.I'm on vacation, so I had the time to waste, and give it a 5/10; but if this were next Friday, or if I'd paid full price, it would be a 3/10.",Miss Congeniality

Sandra Bullock was clearly in her element and I got the impression that she had as much fun making this movie as we did watching it.  Michael Caine and Benjamin Bratt were well cast, and the dialog was rapid fire and at times complex.
Since we have small children my wife normally prefers to wait for a movie to come out on video.  I had to do some work to convince her to go out to this one.  When it was over she said she wanted to see it again.  And she's recommended it to all her friends and family.  This is the pattern with this movie.  The critics (for the most part) panned it, and the people (for the most part) love it and recommend it.

A beautiful creature that was flawed, but flawed with dignity.I'll be honest.. the story is dry, the love interest is almost non-existent and not so believeable....But Sandra Bullock and Michael Caine made this movie well worth my price of admission.

The scene where SB was trying to tell someone the crown was a problem and he said ""Yes, the crown, wear the crown, be the crown..."" he was so that character and amazing! I just had to write that somewhere. Bravo Mr. Caine.",Miss Congeniality
296,totavo00,"Just horrible movie,..",1,19 March 2001,"What i really can say, lousy movie, if you have even one brain cell in your head, don't watch this, just waste of time. I tried to watch this movie, but it was too awful to even look as half of it. Those things what clicked: - You are beautiful even as your hair is totally messed up. This movie give me that impression that ""Movie"" peoples believe ,that when hair is messed up and you speak some what rudely, you are a Bad person and you can't succeed at those things what you try to do,..but you can find couple of jokes which are quite refreshing, but still this is that movie  which has no meaning and acting is something like barbie talk,...With this i mean, this movie has no soul.  and if some one has no soul, it cannot give any good feelings ,...",Miss Congeniality
297,tlboles,Joke at the end,9,6 July 2006,"I want to know who wrote the joke at the very end of the movie! It made me cry in the middle of the theater, I was laughing so hard. The reason is because when my sister and I were kids she was reading a book and she started laughing...I had also read the book and didn't think it had that much humor...what is so funny, I asked. She said...correctional, get it? correctional???? and burst into laughter again...to this day whenever I see her I say , Correctional...get it correctional... and start laughing...because basically I still don't understand why that is funny...but when Sandra bullock said Correctional get it correctional and started snorting... that was it...I rented the movie when I was home on vacation and made my sister watch it...and what fun it was at the end of the movie when our joke was played!!!!",Miss Congeniality
298,nltbouma,I just couldn't stop laughing!,7,11 April 2001,"I think that the storyline of this movie was really weak. There was nothing new in the type of story that was told. Good cop against bad criminal, male cop against female cop. A movie with a really happy ending. Criminal gets caught and there's the ever expected love romance between de male and female cop. But the humor in this movie really made me love it. I just couldn't stop laughing.",Miss Congeniality
299,stamperhopper,Great Movie,10,1 August 2006,"This was a very very good movie!! I loved it. It is full of laughs and surprises. Sandra Bullock is an amazing actress. She preforms her part all throughout the movie. Michael Caine is also a remarkable actor. When i picked it up i wasn't sure if it would be just another undercover cop movie (which isn't a bad thing, they are pretty good) but i wasn't expecting much. I was blown away!! This movie was entertaining throughout the whole thing. There was never a dull moment. There is action, comedy, romance, and suspense. I have purchased this movie and have watched it multiple times. If you like this movie watch all of Sandra Bullocks movies. the divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood is also another good one that she is in.",Miss Congeniality
300,mishu0,Good movie!,9,26 May 2001,"I liked the movie: cool soundtrack (especially bosson with ""one in a million""), talented actors (Sandra Bullock looking as good as ever), and some funny lines. Overall, I enjoyed watching it!",Miss Congeniality
301,thebookwormjl,Funny and really nice,9,2 July 2001,"This movie is so funny. I saw it once, then bought it. <Funny Parts> My favorite part is when Sandra Bullock and Victor Melling are looking at the winners of the past contests on a computer on the way to Texas. Melling is showing how they are walking and when they accept the award one of them fans herself and starts to cry. Sandra Bullock, while ""crying"" narrates, ""O,if I only had a brain."" Then continues to imitate the sobbing woman. Also, when Victor Melling is showing Sandra Bullock how to ""glide"" outside a resturant Sandra Bullock says, ""It takes a very secure man to walk like that."" Except for some swear words this movie is the best.",Miss Congeniality
302,jmmulkey,Miss Bullock is one of the most versitile actresses in years,10,4 July 2001,"Once again Sandra Bullock amazes us with her ability to play any character flawlessly.  Whether she is the divorced woman trying to start her life over, the lonely girl in the subway ticket office, or the tom-boyish FBI agent who goes into an almost impossible situation and comes out smelling like a rose, Sandra plays them all beautifully. One of the constant themes throughout all of Miss Bullock's movies that I've seen is her sense of humor.  Even though she is acting out a scene, she makes us believe that she IS that character. Sandra also makes it easy to believe that she has those same funny, charming, quirky personality traits, in real life, that her characters do. Even with her success, I don't believe Sandra has gotten the credit that is due her for being such a gifted, well rounded actress. I, for one, am constantly waiting to see her ""next"" movie...hopefully she'll keep making them for years to come. Keep making those great movies Sandra...this old Texas Cowboy will always be one of your biggest fans.",Miss Congeniality
303,ghgreenie,"Enjoyable, funny, happy experience to see this film.",10,28 July 2001,"This movie left us laughing and with a good feeling for hours after. We laughed and cheered, and recommend this to friends and family. It was great to see Benjamin Bratt being funny and sexy. And of course Sandra Bullock was funny, sexy, charming, and really excellent in this part.  We also loved her in ""While You Were Sleeping"" and ""Speed.""   It was a '10' for us.",Miss Congeniality
304,l-halewood,"I think the film was excellent, and loved the second one as well.",10,27 December 2006,I loved the film i am a drag queen and i loved some of the costumes and got a few designs of it. I liked the love twist in it as well. It was really weird seeing Sandra bullock play such a hard character seen as though she is seen as a bit of a beauty. You made her look really hard all the way through the film and i do like an actress/actor who is very versatile and can play different parts. i liked all the different twists and turn especially Micheal Cain playing such a camp beauty expert. He played that character with grace an excellency and being a gay man i was glad that the character wearnt to exposed and that Micheal Cain played it with fun and emotion. It just proves why Sandra Bullock and Micheal Cain are two of the best actors/actresses out there.thanks for the time who ever gets there hands on this comment and i appreciate you all reading it. Love from Liam xxx P.s If you have any information on any films Sandra Bullock is bringing out then let me know on L.halewood@merseymail.co.UK thanks again love Liam of Liverpool.,Miss Congeniality
305,Glenys_Williams,"Very good, a great laugh.",8,25 November 2001,"Amusing, fun and at times hilarious. No nauseating bits.  I suspect the actors enjoyed making it as much as I enjoyed watching it.  With a chinese and a glass of white wine it is a great film for an easy night at home, with or without company.",Miss Congeniality

Great actors in it like Benjamin Bratt, Sandra Bullock, Meliss de Sousa, William shatner, Micheal Caine(to be true, his first good movie), Candice Bergen and Ernie Hudson.From pretty to very pretty Sandra stars in this perfect Miss usa pageant. My words are everybody has to see it, and can""t hate this movie. For me it is really my number one movie.",Miss Congeniality
307,Ibiza,This film is funny and sexy,10,25 May 2002,I think that this film is incredibley funny and sexy. I enjoyed Speed and Speed 2 but I think that this film is probably Sandra's best performance yet!!!!!!!! For future reference when a director chooses Sandra Bullock for a love and comedy they should consider including Benjamin Bratt. I think they make a great couple together!!!!!!!!!,Miss Congeniality
308,trenchmouthed,Wow!,1,17 June 2004,"I just ran across this on TV and decided to watch it because I was in a movie mood and I didn't want to go out to rent something. I must say...this is hands down the worst piece of crap I have ever seen! It's got some decent actors in it. It's got Shatner! and Murphy Brown! But apparently, all their budget went to paying the stars enough for them to swallow hard and take their lines from retarded monkies kept barely alive on a strict diet of watered-down gruel. I mean...JESUS H. CHRIST, I didn't think this level of sucklification was possible. I mean...I felt compelled to come on here and put it into type how bad I felt this movie was, I'm usually the type to lash out like that. But this movie is so bad is does something to me...I think it's rage...that or a deep, lingering depression.",Miss Congeniality
309,saz_has_landed,Excellent comedy Sandra Bullock is brilliant!,10,24 January 2005,"This film is one of those hard to find films that will cheer you up even when you think no one else can. it is like a best friend! This film is about an FBI agent going undercover to a beauty pageant or a ""scholarship program""! But she is a complete tomboy, she has never worn make up before and has never worn a dress before. This makes the film even funnier because Sandra Bullock plays the character so well that it really looks awkward for the character she is playing - Gracie hart. It makes you constantly laugh all the way through with its witty comments and overall excellent acting By Sandra Bullock sometimes i wonder where she gets her facial expressions from she is brilliant! There is a serious side to it because of the reason she has gone to the beauty pageant someone is planning to do something bad there - we find out later that they are planning to blow up the beauty pageant winner and her surroundings. There is also a love theme going along which you don't think will work out but we want it to! Overall it is a brilliant, superb, hilarious, wonderful (any other words you can think of that mean brillianto!!!) i love this film and will remain my favourite film forever!",Miss Congeniality
310,happyface811,An FBI agent goes undercover as a beauty pageant girl.,8,3 December 2006,I love this movie. I've seen it a dozen times and it never gets old. My dad always laughs because when it is on I watch it again and again no matter how many times I've seen it. It is one of my favorite movies. I just love how simplistic it is. This movie is so hilarious. I love it so much. Although I wouldn't recommend the second Miss Congeniality because it was not even close to as good as the original. If you like Sandra Bullock at all you will love this movie. Sandra Bullock is by far my favorite actress and Benjamin Bratt is such a cutie. If you love romantic comedies this one's for you. If you haven't seen this movie yet I highly recommend it to everyone.,Miss Congeniality
311,tmh-72022,Miss Congeniality (see review for summary),9,17 October 2017,"Miss Congeniality is one of the best PG-13 comedy movies. It was about a tomboy woman named Gracie Hart who had to go undercover as a pageant girl for Miss America. There was a bomb threat that was supposed to happen at the pageant, so Gracie had to find out who the terrorist was and stop him or her. There was a whole FBI team that could see everything Gracie could see and among those men was a man named Eric who started to find an interest in Gracie. Gracie had to play the part by doing the talent, interview, and swimsuit portions of the competition, and with a little help of her agent, she seems to pull things off. When the FBI team thinks that they solved the case, they all leave while Gracie stays because she thinks that they were wrong. No one stayed back with her, not even Eric. Gracie continued to play the part of the pageant girl, so that she could find the bad guy and prevent the bomb from exploding. At the end Eric, along with her agent, came back to help Gracie. Gracie ended up being the first runner up, and her best friend from Rhode Island won. Unfortunately, Gracie found out that the bomb was apart of the crown, so she tried to stop her friend from putting it on. In the end, Gracie saves her friend and the contest from destruction. Lastly, her and Eric kissed! This movie was so entertaining. Gracie was played by Sandra Bullock, and I mean, who doesn't love Sandra Bullock? The movie was filled with humor and a little bit of love. One of my favorite parts was the big reveal when Gracie became ""pretty."" Before all the makeup and styling, Gracie was not stylish or very attractive. She then was transformed into a new woman and I loved the reveal. I also enjoyed the humor in this movie. It was very humorous at certain parts throughout the movie and I enjoyed a little bit of laughter. One of the funny parts of the movie was when Gracie's earpiece blasted in her ear. The connection in the ear piece was lost between Gracie and the FBI team, and when the connection was regained, it blasted in her ear and she screamed ""Jesus Christ!"" This was funny because she was at a very classy pageant brunch and everyone looked at her. After she screamed at the brunch, she had to cover it up by pretending that she forgot to pray to God before eating her bagel. The other pageant girls also began to pray. Another humorous part of the movie was during the pre-show when Gracie did her talent. She didn't really have a normal talent like the other contestants. Her talent was making music from cups filled with water. It was actually kind of impressive, but her outfit was ridiculous. While on stage Gracie also tried to spot out the bad guy. When she saw a gun and thought she found him, she ran off the stage and tackled him, which I found kind of funny. No one expected it and she looked funny doing it. I also loved the ending. At the end Gracie teased Eric by saying, ""You think I'm gorgeous, you want to date me love me and marry me"" And then they kiss! I loved this part because Gracie said something like this to Eric before and it was just romantic! Miss Congeniality is a hilarious movie. I really enjoyed watching it, and I would watch it again. This movie is also more than just a hilarious movie. It also teaches people to not judge a book by its cover. Gracie thought that all pageant girls were dumb and only wanted world peace, but by spending time with the girls, she learned that they were more than just dumb, pretty girls. I recommend watching this movie if you want to have good time. This movie isn't boring and it will definitely keep you watching.",Miss Congeniality
312,aheredia,Funny Sandra,6,25 June 2013,"Although Miss Congeniality isn't the most original film you will ever see in your lifetime, it is a fine example of Sandra Bullock as a movie star. This film has been done to death, it has a truly unoriginal screenplay that is packed with clichés to the point of insanity. It might sound like I didn't like the film...that isn't true at all. This movie lives and breathes Sandra Bullock, without her the film is a total bust. Only a few actors can hold a movie together and she definitely has the screen magic that is needed for Hollywood. I'm not trying to take away from the rest of the cast, they are all just victims to a terrible screenplay, but the actors also fall victim to Bullock's unique ability as an actor. She stands out and convinced me that this film isn't a total waste. I wasn't the most excited person in the world when this film appeared in theaters because it looked like a complete chick flick. I don't really have anything special to say about the film as a work of art or entertainment, but I am a Sandra Bullock fan for life.Was the above review use",Miss Congeniality
313,markpakula,Miss Congeniality,10,9 February 2006,"Miss Congeniality is a movie for film enthusiasts across the globe. It sees an FBI agent, in Sandra Bullock, disguise herself as a beauty queen. I want to shake the hand of the man that came up with this idea as it is pure gold. It was a recipe for success from the start. The film director should be knighted for making such a masterpiece. The director should also be congratulated on his staging of the beauty pageant. This film sees Sandra Bullock's best appearance in front of the silver screen and could turn a gay man straight. Interest in the male lead of the film is low because we are all there to watch Sandra Bullock. The only thing missing from this film is a Girls Aloud sound track but we will leave that to Miss Congeniality 3.",Miss Congeniality
