0,TheLittleSongbird,Return to the Conjuring universe,5,17 July 2019,"Although horror is not my favourite film genre, and have made that known more than once before in the past, there is still high appreciation for it. Although there are a fair share of average at best films or even clunkers (even when trying to take them for what they are or intend to be), there are also an equal fair share of good horror films as well as classics, which won't be named in order to be fair.Really enjoyed the two 'The Conjuring' films for the same reasons to each other, that they were well-made, well-crafted, suspenseful, entertaining and had genuine shocks. 'Annabelle' is inevitably compared to them, but to me it doesn't compare favourably and could have been much better. Its prequel 'Annabelle: Creation', although far from perfect or great with some of the same mistakes being made, again to me fared better, though again not close to the quality of 'The Conjuring' films. 'The Nun' meanwhile was a mediocre disappointment. Put 'Annabelle Comes Home' in the middle and personally found it a difficult film to rate and review, though it will be easier for others.'Annabelle Comes Home' looks good. There is a great Gothic atmosphere, lush and darkly atmospheric production design and stylish photography. The supernatural effects are surprisingly excellent too. The music is haunting and the direction brings a genuine eeriness and mysteriousness in places. There are parts that are suitably uneasy and eerie once 'Annabelle Comes Home' gets going.The pace, again once the film gets into gear, it has been said that the mute vision in the television is the scariest part and do have to agree with this. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do good jobs, though take a backseat to the younger cast. Was worried that this would not work, but the younger cast carry the film quite well and don't bore and annoy as feared.However, the story is near-non existent with few surprises and can get very silly. Especially towards the end. Although there are moments of scares and suspense, there are not enough of either and could have done with more build up that would have made them less predictable.Did feel that the pacing was still very flawed. 'Annabelle Comes Home' takes too long to get going and then the climactic parts feel very rushed. The ending is one of the film's biggest issues, as well as being rushed it was very anti-climactic and bordered on plain ridiculous, as well as illogical. The dialogue is no improvement too, very awkward-sounding and banal, doing little with developing rather clichéd characters.Summarising, difficult to rate and review. Watchable but never rises above borderline between average and decent. 5/10",Annabelle Comes Home
1,SnoopyStyle,no stakes,6,28 December 2019,"Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) brings home the doll Annabelle. Their daughter Judy (Mckenna Grace) has some supernatural skills. Her classmates are not coming to her birthday party as news of her parents' work spread. While Ed and Lorraine are out, Judy is watched over by her caring babysitter Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman) with her friend Daniela Rios (Katie Sarife). Bob Palmeri (Michael Cimino) comes over to woo Mary Ellen.The biggest issue from the trailer is Daniela opening the room. At least, she has motivations and that's better than nothing. The biggest issue from the movie is that there are no stakes. At least, I made the calculation that non of these girls would die in this story. The Warrens need their room and if a kid dies in their house, they would be driven out of the neighborhood. Without the necessary stakes, non of this is actually scary. It's a good ghost story nevertheless. It's just a kiddie ghost story. There is nothing to fear.",Annabelle Comes Home
2,claudio_carvalho,The Evil Doll,6,24 December 2019,"Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) lock the evil doll Annabelle in a sacred glass cabinet in their demoniac artifacts room. One year later, they need to travel and leave their daughter Judy (Mckenna Grace) with the babysitter Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman). However the local newspaper question if the Warren are heroes or hoax and the snoopy teenager Daniela Rios (Katie Sarife), who recently lost her father, lures Mary Ellen and enters in the locked room expecting to contact her father. She releases the powerful Annabelle and the girls spend the night haunted by evil spirits.""Annabelle Comes Home"", the third film of the franchising, is not bad and startle the viewer in many scenes. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are part of the cast basically to give their names to the credits since their participation is a cameo in the beginning and in the ending. But the three girls have good performances. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Annabelle 3: De Volta Para Casa"" (""Annabelle 3: Back Home"")",Annabelle Comes Home
3,nogodnomasters,Positively do not open,8,7 July 2019,"The Warrens bring Annabelle back to their house because it is better than destroying it because. . . they didn't give a reason. The Warren must once again leave town (circa 1970) and save the world. They leave their daughter at home with a babysitter which increases to two eye candy babysitters. Annabelle gets unleashed and as a demon re-animator in a room full of stuff, it is almost ""Night at the Museum"" but done in a slow scary fashion peppered with mild humor.The film was more than jump scares. I liked how they did the era, even in the grocery store. Looks like Mckenna Grace is going to be in more films than Kevin Bacon. Hope she doesn't grow up too fast.Guide: 1 quick f-word. No sex or nudity. Forget Robert.",Annabelle Comes Home
4,kosmasp,If she just would stay there,6,9 March 2021,"Pun somewhat intended. Another movie in the Conjuring-verse and another one that might divide people. We get our usual suspects at first, but the movie does star kids most of the time - a quite clever decision overall I'd say, but one that might annoy some viewers too.The horror scenes are well done (no pun intended), but are not too scary for anyone who's seen a few horror movies overall. The outcome or where the movie is heading is quite clear I think, but that is for you to decide how much it tickles your scare bone and if that is sufficient enough. A decent effort at least, if you are not too harsh with it",Annabelle Comes Home
5,classicsoncall,"""Can Annabelle come out to play?""",6,8 February 2020,"Not exactly scary, was it? There were any number of creepy build-ups that didn't really amount to all that much, and waiting for a jump scare turned out to be a meaningless exercise. I have to agree with another reviewer for the picture here on IMDb that the character of Daniela (Katie Sarife) was quite annoying. She did everything, I mean everything, that she was warned not to do, and still, the horror aspects of the picture I was expecting never really materialized. And what really got to me was when the three girls alone in the house began reacting to the spooky stuff going on, not one of them got the bright idea that maybe it would have been a good idea to TURN THE LIGHTS ON!!! Man, that was just so silly.I must have missed the movie that bridged 2014's original ""Annabelle"" and this one, titled ""Annabelle:Creation"". Could be I didn't miss that much, although it fares better with IMDb reviewers than either of the other two. The only thing this franchise offered me was the chance to pull off one of my all time great practical jokes on a best friend a few years ago. For that, you can go to my review of ""Annabelle"". I still have to laugh when I think about it.",Annabelle Comes Home
6,jboothmillard,Annabelle Comes Home,4,31 May 2021,"The creepy looking doll has appeared in a good number of films in the Conjuring Universe movies, even just little glimpses, and this was another spin-off prequel exploring what further nastiness it causes to characters that forced it to be locked in the glass box. Basically, set in 1972, paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) confiscate the Annabelle doll from nurses Debbie (Kenzie Caplan) and Camilla (Sade Katarina), who claim that the doll often caused violent things to happen. During the drive back home, the doll summons spirits to attack Ed, but he narrowly survives. Annabelle is locked in a sacred glass case with a label saying ""WARNING! POSITIVELY DO NOT OPEN"" in the couple's artifacts room. The room is blessed often (fortnightly I think) by Father Gordon (Steve Coulter) to ensure the evil is contained. Sometime later, the Warrens welcome Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman), who will be babysitting their daughter, Judy (Mckenna Grace), at the house while they travel overnight to investigate another case. At school, Judy sees the spirit of a priest (Gary-7) that starts following her. Mary Ellen's friend Daniela Rios (Katie Sarife) arrives uninvited at the Warrens' home. Daniela is secretly curious about speaking to the dead, as her father passed away a short time ago. Finding the hidden key to the artifacts room, she unlocks it and looks around at the objects, including unlocking the glass case that contains the Annabelle doll. Whilst in the room, she holds a photograph of her late father, and tries to contact any spirit in the room, hoping to channel her father. After leaving the room, and leaving Annabelle's case unlocked, Daniela has unknowingly released the demonic spirit of Annabelle ""Bee"" Mullins (Samara Lee), and other nasty spirits of the objects in the room. Mary Ellen's crush Bob Palmeri (Michael Cimino) arrives outside and serenades her but is later attacked by the Black Shuck, a werewolf demon, and hides. Mary Ellen is tormented by the Ferryman, while Judy is confronted by Annabelle in her bedroom. Daniela had left earlier but sneaks back to return the artifacts room's keys. She gets locked inside the room and tormented by various objects, such as a piano and an old television that shows near future events. She sees her father twisted into a malevolent spirit, and an image of herself bloodied and screaming on the television screen after answering a cursed telephone. The real Daniela almost answers the telephone but is interrupted by Judy and Mary Ellen. Judy explains that they must lock Annabelle in her case again so the other spirits will go away. Bob protects Judy from the Black Shuck as she retrieves Mary Ellen's asthma inhaler, while Daniela is attacked and possessed by the Bride (Natalia Safran). Eventually, Mary Ellen and Judy find the doll when the spirit of the priest returns, acting as Judy's guardian, guides them. They manage to retrieve the glass case's key after they are attacked by demonic hands from the Feeley Meeley board game, and a possessed Daniela. They struggle to secure the case as the demon of the doll physically attacks them. Daniela recovers when Judy plays Ed's recorded footage of the Bride's exorcism and helps put the doll back in the case. After the case is locked, the spirits return to their slumber and the ghostly disturbance ends, and Bob reunites with the trio. Ed and Lorraine return the next morning, and the girls tell them everything that happened. Daniela apologises to Lorraine, who gives her a comforting message from her father. Later, many friends gather to celebrate Judy's birthday party. Also starring Natalia Safran as the Bride and Douglas Tait as the Black Shuck. Farmiga and Wilson get their moments reprising their roles as the demonologists, but it is focused much more on the younger cast, who do a good job. The pace however is often way too slow, the attempted jump scares are on and off, the special effects do their job, and the eerie atmosphere is alright, but I wanted more to happen and to be more thrilled, a slightly boring but not terrible supernatural horror. Okay!",Annabelle Comes Home
7,paul_haakonsen,Boring and uneventful...,5,17 August 2019,"Granted, I haven't really ever thought that the Annabelle doll was anything extraordinary or even remotely scary. It was good as a prop in the very first movie, but started to dwindle fast when they made it into a spin-off movie series with the doll.Still, I have seen the movies, solely because I have had the chance, and because I do enjoy horror movies.However, this 2019 movie ""Annabelle Comes Home"" was boring. Yeah, let's just be blatantly and brutally honest. This movie was mediocre at best. It didn't take long before I started to lose interest in the movie and had my phone out instead. The storyline was so simplistic and straightforward that even a dead person could keep up here. There were no surprises along the way, and director used every page of 'how-to-make-a-generic-horror-movie' to the fullest.The acting in the movie was good, just a shame that the actresses and actors had so very little to work with. And mind you, the movie is not circling around Ed and Lorraine Warren, but instead focuses on their daughter and her babysitter. Just a heads up, in case you were expecting a movie with Ed and Lorraine.There were absolutely no scares throughout the course of ""Annabelle Comes Home"" for a seasoned horror veteran such as myself. Perhaps if this is your first horror movie, you'll find it scary. Otherwise, you have to look long and hard for anything of the sort.A visually nice movie, but boring and generic in terms of entertainment. I am rating ""Annabelle Comes Home"" a mere, but very generic and mediocre, of five out of ten stars.",Annabelle Comes Home
8,BandSAboutMovies,Annabelle wastes $10,4,28 June 2019,"Maybe I've seen too many of The Conjuring films now - seven in total with several more on the way, such as a sequel to the excoriable The Nun and The Crooked Man. I even sat through the barely connected The Curse of La Llorona. It's co-written and directed by Gary Dauberman, who wrote the remake of It, as well as Annabelle, Annabelle: Creation and The Nun. Original creator James Wan is the other writer as well as the producer.Back in 1971. demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren - back again at least for a brief cameo to drag you into the theater - are bringing the possessed Annabelle back to their home. Before they even get it there, it brings all manner of hell after them in a pre-title sequence that really has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.After Father Gordon - coming back in another call back to the first two The Conjuring movies - blesses a box for the evil doll, we fast-forward a year to the Warrens bringing in Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle) to watch their daughter Judy (McKenna Grace, who has made something of a career of playing the young versions of characters - she was young Captain Marvel, as well as the child versions of Sabrina on the new Netflix series and Theodora Crain in The Haunting of Hill House).Judy is able to see all manner of ghosts and spirits, like a priest that keeps following her and later protecting her. He's Father Michael Morrisey, playing by Gary-7, who will probably get involved in a later The Conjuring movie. Or maybe not. Sadly, I'll probably be there the first night with the vague hope that this will finally be the one that equals the original.Mary Ellen's friend Daniela decides to visit the Warren house, as she wants to speak to the dead, specifically her father, who recently died after a car crash. She was the driver and blames herself, which brings her into the Warren's hidden sanctum of the scariest and most sinister of all occult objects. She ends up touching everything and leaving Annabelle's container wide open, showing that not only is she a moron, but she also has no idea how to read. Finally, she uses an artifact called the Mourner's Bracelet, which certainly will play a part in another film. That's all these movies have become, a kickoff to the next film which introduces the next character which tells us all about the next character for the next one. I get it. I've been paying for it ever since the second one.Anyways, this dumb teenage girl is like, maybe my dad will talk to me through something in this room, which means that Annabella is able to gather all of the other spirits and attack, spirits who I will eventually pay to see their own movies and buy their DVD's, like a ferryman, a bride, a samurai, a hellhound called the Black Shuck - no, not the song by The Darkness - and, of course, a copy of Milton Bradley's Feeley Meeley game.Actually, the Black Shuck is based on a famous Warren case - which is the same as me saying that I have cases when all I'm doing is lying about ghosts - where a werewolf was killing local livestock. Kinda like the chicken that gets it here.Everybody gets attacked by different spirits, like Bob dealing with the hellhound, Mary Ellen getting dragged away by Charon the boatman or whatever we want to call the ferryman with coins on his eyes and Judy has to deal with Annabelle herself, who just up and got in bed with her. Daniela? Well, she's trapped in the artifact room and being terrorized by a monkey that plays drums. Whoever sold those things and who bought them? Maniacs, that's who. Every adult that I ever knew that had one continually used them to torture children. It's like they had an underground network of mean grown-ups who thought it was funny to give kids nightmares.There's one great scene in the middle of all of this, as Daniela watches an old television that shows a mute vision of a few seconds in the future where she'll be screaming and covered in blood. It's the most frightening thing in the movie - hell, in the last couple of these films - and it's a total throwaway. The same with the scene where the kids try to call Lorraine for help and a demon is on the other end. These bring forth primal childhood fears unlike the rest of the storyline.It all ends with Daniela possessed by The Bride, but the priest and Judy play a movie of the original exorcism over the girl, freeing her, while Mary Ellen tries to lock Annabelle back in her cabinet. Of course the next day, the parents come home and every kid ends up coming to a birthday party and Ed plays guitar while Lorraine has a psychic talk with Daniela. You didn't expect a happy ending?I kinda love - or totally hate to be honest - that this movie is being called an intraquel, as it is set during the opening and main plot of the first film. This renders it meaningless, a film that has no true bearing on anything that has come before or since.I guess the only thing we learn here is that the demon inside AnnabelleThe identity of the demon primarily attached to the Annabelle doll is called the Ram, which makes sense, as the cult group in the 1960's that Janice ""Annabelle"" Higgins belonged to was the Disciples of the Ram. The fact that I know this much - and didn't need any reference to call that up - means that for some reason, I know more about the Conjuring universe than my own family.

9,michaelRokeefe,Nothing to the excess...unless it is randomness.,6,20 September 2020,"Not enough jump scares and spaced too far apart. A babysitter and her dimwitted boyfriend are sitting with Judy (McKenna Grace) , the 10-year-old daughter of the ghost-hunting Warrens, played by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. ""The artifact room"" in the basement is not respected and one of the most dangerous and haunted dolls in the world, Annabelle, is tampered with. The doll will just not stay put. No disturbing images; no gore or blood to the excess. The highlights for me was the atmospheric lighting, camera angles and few jump scares.",Annabelle Comes Home

11,view_and_review,Annabelle is so not Nice,5,2 July 2019,"What is it with Annabelle and the world of the living? She won't leave us alone. This time they had to use a tried and true plot device to jumpstart the movie. What was it? Well, most scary movies require:A.) Stark stupidity,
B.) Curiosity, or
C.) BothFor this movie the answer is C. a young, naïve, and curious girl decides to let the genie out of the bottle.""But she had the best intentions.""I don't want to hear it. She was dumb for releasing Annabelle and at the very least she was ill-mannered for snooping around other people's property.After Annabelle gets loose it's the traditional scary movie build up. You know how ghosts and spirits work... they start small with some slight actions that are easily explainable, then they hit you with the full onslaught. Annabelle is no different than any other malevolent spirits in that respect.Sorry Annabelle I was unimpressed. I expected better from you. You stalked, and lurked, and brooded like a run of the mill spirit. You offered nothing new or noteworthy. Annabelle has come home and she needs to be put to bed.",Annabelle Comes Home
12,neil-476,Average but not very scary,6,19 July 2019,"Demonologists, supernturalists, witchfinders, haunting specialists Lorraine and Ed Warren have a locked basement crammed so full of items which are haunted, cursed, possessed, or otherwise supernaturally undesirable that they have to have the place blessed every week. So when they bring the particularly dangerous doll Annabelle back and lock her in a doubly blessed cabinet in the locked blessed basement, and then saunter off for a weekend leaving their daughter with a babysitter, why, what could possibly go wrong? Nothing of course. Until the babysitter's friend arrives, a girl who wants to contact her dead father...This horror film isn't very horrifying. But the irritating friend turns out to be OK when you find out her backstory (sorry for spoiling it for you) and the characters are generally likeable, which made the resolution better. The daughter is played by McKenna Grace for whom I predicted great things several films ago. I stand by that.Apparently the Warrens are real people, and Lorraine died recently. And they really do have such a room. Who knew? Well, anyone who saw this film did.",Annabelle Comes Home

14,mm-39,Should of payed the baby sitter more!?!,6,28 June 2019,"Should of payed the baby sitter more!?! Why there is a toxic waste dump of cursed items in the Warren's basement is beyond me. If the Warren's house burned down there would be troubles for the town. That's besides the point! Anyways, someone disturbs the doll and Annabelle Comes Home becomes a twisted version of Adventures in baby sitting. Scary in a sensory over load situation. There is coins rolling on the floor, bumps, door bells ringing, and lights going on and off. Thus a sensory over load scares in the Warren's house. The family wonders why no one want to go over? (eye roll) Long story short the character build up is well done. The viewers build empathy and likability for Annabelle Comes Home which makes for decent horror movie. The build is always better then the scare. Annabelle Comes Home stars out strong with what to do with the evil doll, and where and why. The middle is strong character development. The bottom third is why the neighbors property values go down living next to the Warrens. Well sensory over load scares, but predictable horror movie cliches.

What did those people expected to see? To me this next movie from Gary Dauberman is like all the others, Annabelle, The Nun, or even It, it's entertaining, certainly for this genre. There are the obliged jump scares, some good creepy characters, the soundtrack is spot on to add the necessary ambiance that lacks in so many other horror movies. Nothing beats good sound effects in a horror movie, to me it's the key point, and in this movie it just works very well. The acting was also good so again no complains here.

18,Pjtaylor-96-138044,She never should have left.,6,15 July 2019,"The first thing you'll probably notice is just how much better 'Annabelle Comes Home (2019)' is, immediately, than 'The Nun (2018)', 'The Curse Of La Llorona (2019)' and its oft-forgotten predecessor, 'Annabelle (2014)'. I mean, it seems like a masterpiece in comparison to those; it's actually engaging, features a variety of successful scares and centres around compelling characters. However, the second thing you'll probably notice is just how much worse it is than 'The Conjuring (2013)', 'The Conjuring 2 (2016)' and, even, 'Annabelle: Creation (2017)'. That's because its plot is incredibly slim - I'm talking almost anecdotal - and it starts to wear thin far faster than it, perhaps, ought to. As such, the piece ends up somewhere in the middle, quality-wise, of the overall 'Conjuring' franchise; it's by no means bad but it's certainly not great, either. Thankfully, though, it's a decently enjoyable, competently constructed experience throughout. The reason for this is, I feel, two-fold. Firstly, its characters - on whom it relies solely because its plot is almost non-existent - are mostly well-rounded and believable. One of them does make some odd decisions that aren't explained until long after they've been made and, even then, don't stand up to all that much scrutiny. Still, this isn't too detrimental and the development done for all the main players is serviceable enough, with some of it actually going a long way to plugging the potential leaks caused by those previously mentioned poor choices. Plus, everyone on screen is, essentially, as likeable as they could be. Unfortunately, they aren't quite interesting enough to keep you wholly engaged during the movie's slower segments. It has a really strange, somewhat disjointed pacing that practically paints most of it as an extended build-up for a seemingly fifteen-minute finale. Luckily, then, it's competent when it comes to the second 'fold' of that two-fold reason I mentioned earlier: the scares. While there's nothing outstanding here, it's also not just jump-scare central. There are are variety of occasionally quite inspired gags that often play on audience expectation, building up genuine suspense that isn't deflated every two minutes by an obnoxious 'false' fright. It does sometimes get a little too overt for its own good - though, the overall series is no stranger to bold, effects-based 'creatures', either - but it's refreshing, and sadly so, for a film like this to not be made of abrasive, repetitive, 'cattle-prod' stuff. Generally, the flick is a fairly fun time. Sure, it wears thin and is only ever so compelling in the first place, but it's a solid haunted house - literally and figuratively - that will certainly satisfy fans of the franchise. 6/10",Annabelle Comes Home

24,cruise01,Fun scares and thrills that delivers as a sequel.,7,29 June 2019,"Annabelle Comes Home (3.5 out of 5 stars).Annabelle Comes Home is the third and seventh entry in the Conjuring universe of supernatural horror films. Some are just decent films that provide the same predictable supernatural scares. Some are boring and dull. This third film as Annabelle is pretty decent. Better than the original movie but not as good compare to the Conjuring. The third film does deliver some cheap jolts and scares, has a decent plot that wraps up the Annabelle storyline, and the cast ensemble was also good.The plot follows Ed and Lorraine (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) after they claimed the Annabelle doll (a scene from the opening in first Conjuring movie). They lock the doll up in their basement in an enclosed glass case. When they go on a business trip. They leave their daughter Judy (Mckenna Grace) with their teenage babysitter Mary (Madison Iseman). When Mary brings her friend Daniela (Katie Sarife). And her curiousity about the Lorraine's haunted basement. She accidently sets Annabelle free. Which she sets every haunting demon in the basement on the loose that will terrorize the three girls in the house.The plot was decent. I did feel like the characters did make some stupid decisions. Which the script did not improve from the last few movies. Which has that cliché were a character would go into the basement after passing several warning signs to keep out. And unlocking the encased case to get Annabelle.The direction did deliver some fun scares and thrills. When Annabelle is released. The three girls are stuck at home. Lights out, fog coming in the area, and creepy shadows and sounds coming around from every corner of the house. It is the house of horrors with that haunted basement. There is a hellhound, some creepy lady in a wedding dress, a demonic looking beast. It does have some fun scares. May not be as scary as previous Conjuring films.It was fun to see Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga having small appearances in this film. Mckenna Grace was good playing Judy. Madison Iseman was also good playing as Mary. Katie Sarife was also okay as well playing a character that has a bit of mystery on why she is desperate to contact the supernatural.Overall, Annabelle Comes Home is a pretty fair film. It does deliver as the third film in the series. Not as a great new horror movie but it is acceptable as an entertaining fun thriller.",Annabelle Comes Home
25,eddie_baggins,Another lame new addition to the Conjuring universe,4,28 June 2019,"There's a lot of good will when it comes to the Conjuring universe, thanks to James Wan's noteworthy efforts with the Conjuring standalone films but we are now getting to the point (much like what happened with Saw films) where saturation and frequency of films set in the combined universe are starting to get more than a little stale.Following on from this year's early disappoint The Curse of the Weeping Woman and last year's crime against the horror genre The Nun, the third entry into the Annabelle corner of The Conjuring universe Annabelle Comes Home may be better than the first Annabelle film (which isn't saying much) but overall, this lacklustre and relatively scare free haunted house like creeper just isn't worth your time and money.While getting early wins thanks to the cameo like appearance of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the Warrens and their collection of the not so cute doll, Annabelle Comes Home loses momentum quickly as it starts to focus on Madison Iseman's Mary Ellen and Katie Sarife's Daniela babysitting the Warren's daughter Judy (played by the capable McKenna Grace) as the film confines us to the Warrens house, a completely unwarranted romance subplot involving Michael Cimino's Bob and an even worse narrative device in the form of Daniela wanting to contact her dead father meaning debut director Gary Dauberman has a tough time making up for the more mediocre elements of its fright fest.To say Annabelle Comes Home has no scares on offer would be wrong, as always there's the nerve wracking sound design, a nice new horror figure in the form of the Ferry Man (let's not talk about the foggy werewolf) and Annabelle the doll still manages to be creepy without doing a whole lot while the films exploration of the Warren's notorious room full of haunted and evil possessions is a lot of fun for fans of the series but there's truly nothing memorable on offer here as the film struggles to keep up the pace in its shoebox like set-up and rather bland main characters.The Conjuring films and some of the more successful spin-offs like Annabelle Creation have always been at their best when combining interesting characters with the jumps and nerve shredding, while Wan set the standard with how a low budget film can still be directed with flair and energy but there's none of that to be found in Annabelle Comes Home as it instead is happy to follow the well-trodden and worn out formula of similar films both past and present.We are not at the point where it feels like quality returns from this series may be a thing of the past, unless the maestro himself Wan decides to come back to the franchise he gave life to as the quality we are getting at the moment is not cinematic quality and would be better suited as a streaming service device where quality content is more of a gift not an expectation.Final Say -A mostly forgettable Conjuring spin-off that feels like the death-knell to Annabelle standalone adventures, Annabelle Comes Home has a few neat moments and some nice Easter Eggs for fans of the universe but there but fleeting instances in an otherwise tiresome and lame attempt to make more money from a worn down entity.2 copies of Feeley Meeley out of 5",Annabelle Comes Home
26,filipemanuelneto,Annabelle surrendered to terror for teenagers.,4,9 August 2020,"If the previous films about the Annabelle doll have focused a lot on its origin, history and how it could harm anyone who owned it, this film forgets all that and turns to the Warrens, who detained its possession for decades, always carefully kept to never harm anyone else. Of course, given that the previous films made good money for the studios, this film was made with more financial gains in mind. Still, it has enough quality to deserve our attention.The action focuses on the period following the acquisition of the doll by the Warrens, and creates an interesting scary story in which two friends, one of them in charge of taking care of the young daughter of the Warrens, will face the terror and the evil inside their house, assisted by the child that they should take care of and that, curiously, shows greater maturity than they on many occasions.Very similar to the ""Conjuring"" films, it works like a spin-off and had two films that preceded it: the first one proved to be very bad, the second, whose quality was better, tells a totally different story. Here, what we have is a film that delivers what it promises and brings a story that manages to scare but tells little. Basically, it introduces us to the characters, the general picture, takes us inside the house and that's it. Even so, this house is far from being used. Let's agree! The house is the Aladdin's cave of cursed objects and, although some have appeared and had their history revealed, we feel that they are not fully exploited.The cast is dominated by the interpretations of Mckenna Grace, Katie Sarife and Madison Iseman. The three actresses did a satisfactory job and, although they didn't shine much due to the poor quality of their characters, totally cliché, they were able to dominate the film entirely, due to the lack of a truly good cast. The film also features the participation of Michael Cimino but his character, quite comical, clashes with the general environment and makes the film lighter than it should. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson bring the Warrens back to life, but here they only serve as a link to the ""Conjuring"" films and limit themselves to being a father and mother, without further ado. Honestly, at times the film looks like an unusual cross between ""Conjuring"" and ""Scream"", or any other horror movie for teenagers.Technically, it is a film with ups and downs. It has a very uneven pace, taking time to build and rushing the scariest parts, which should have been more carefully constructed, always growing in suspense and fear, and taking up more time. The atmosphere could have been more frightening and tense had it not been punctually cut off by expendable moments of humor or philosophical reflection. In addition, the ending is simply too sudden and disappointing. A climax is missing here. We clearly realized that the director and screenwriter didn't quite know how to end this story without killing anyone. It has good cinematography and good sets and costumes, the supernatural effects are also good and the soundtrack is scary, but it is so similar to what we can hear in ""Conjuring"" that it seems to recycle part of that soundtrack.",Annabelle Comes Home
27,Rectangular_businessman,Regurgitated drivel,1,18 May 2020,"The first ""Annabelle"" movie wasn't good, but it wasn't that bad either.The second was an improvement, being creepier, but it left me feeling that there wasn't anything else to say in the story of the doll Annabelle.This sequel proved these impressions right, by adding anything absolutely anything new, and instead it keeps rehashing the same jumpscares from the previous two films in the dullest, most unimaginative way.These ""Conjuring"" spin-offs have become completely redundant by this point. This is a complete soulless cash grab with very little entertainment value.",Annabelle Comes Home
28,TheMovieDiorama,Annabelle Comes Home to a menagerie of spine-tingling haunted shenanigans.,7,18 July 2019,"""A beacon for other spirits"" utters Lorraine Warren outside a misty cemetery, staring blankly at the possessed doll. Yeah, no kidding! Just when I thought this so-called cinematic universe was running out of life, Dauberman in his directorial debut injects some unnerving scares and terror into this horror franchise that proves there is genuine talent behind the onslaught of films. Forget about 'The Nun' and 'The Curse of My Sharona', it's the Annabelle series that continues to improve with each instalment (much to my surprise!). Containing the doll's power in a case within their artefact room, the Warrens leave a babysitter to look after their daughter for the night, leading one of her desperate friends to go snooping around the house.With low expectations, I predicted nothing more than a forgettable, unnecessary jump scare-fest, existing only to conjure up more money than Warner Bros can deal with. And whilst that's partially true, I cannot deny the utter enjoyment and enthralment that I experienced when watching this. Putting aside the third act, which I will discuss later, the first hour and ten minutes were exceptional on a technical level. Zero jump scares. Solid acting. Astute direction. Innovative scares. To be honest with you, I was dumbfounded with what I witnessed. Legitimately the scariest mainstream horror so far this year, and I was not prepared for that.With Annabelle summoning other demons locked away in that same cluttered room, the variety of ghouls, ghosts and strange artefacts enhanced the haunted house vibe that Dauberman desired. I mean after all, the majority of the film is set in the Warrens' abode. Ranging from a ghastly ferryman that scared the living daylights out of me (mostly due to the excellent use of lighting), a violent bride and cursed samurai armour, to a haunted board game and a frolicking werewolf. Aside from the latter, which was completely out of place and diminished the well constructed tension on multiple occasions, these demons were well embedded into the narrative. Furthering the backstory of the Warrens and their extensive list of demonology cases.Dauberman nearly crossed a venomous line that made this chapter almost poisonous. The intent focus on these other objects and cases, instead of the eponymous doll, alluded to many potential spin-offs for this cinematic universe. Fortunately Dauberman actually utilised these demons, for if he didn't this would've been an immediate write-off. So in that sense, he was playing very close to death (I could sense the Ferryman was ready to take his soul...).As I stated, the first two acts were technically impressive. A variety of techniques bursting with formidable flavour, from elongated one take corridor sequences to sleight of hand tricks with the camera. Yet it's the lack of jump scares, an easy method to succumb to, that felt refreshing. Most of the chills exhume from ghostly apparitions gently moving in the background or Dauberman's slow panning of the camera. Oh, and finally some use of the studio's fog machine. Unfortunately, as with many horror films, the loss of momentum in the third act was noticeable and was wrapped up far too expeditiously. The splintering of the characters made for a disjointed final narrative sequence, although not a huge detriment, and the moment of reflection was neatly wrapped up with a hug and some cake.Speaking of characters, aside from the babysitter's friend aimlessly snooping around the Warrens' for the set of keys that unlocks the artefact room (not very well hidden Ed, come on!), most of the choices made were fairly intuitive. There was purpose to infiltrating that cursed room, which assisted in building an emotional connection with these three characters. Some subtle humour breaks away from the heightened suspense, allowing us to breathe a sigh of relief for just one moment. Performances were all very good. Grace is the gift that keeps on giving, Iseman and Sarife were strong throughout and naturally the inclusion of Farmiga and Wilson, although not necessary, were instantly welcomed additions to the cast.Suffice to say, I had a blast with this chapter. Inventive, accessible and downright scary. Minus the sloppy third act, these factors push Annabelle's third outing as one of the best in this so-called ""Conjuring Universe"". Perhaps horror is not totally wasted this year...",Annabelle Comes Home
29,pmtelefon,Scary fun,8,15 December 2019,"The Conjuring/Annabelle movies are a good franchise. I've seen them all and, for the most part, enjoyed them all. ""Annabelle Comes Home"" is a solid entry in the series. There are more than a handful of good scares in this movie. It has a creepy vibe throughout. Writer/director Gary Dauberman did a very good job with this movie. He builds the scenes well and delivers the scares a pretty rapid pace. Dauberman also gets solid performances from all of his cast. I hope they keep making these movies. Honorable mention: the dreamy duo of Madison Iseman and Katie Sarife.",Annabelle Comes Home

This is a great exposition. Nice film",Annabelle Comes Home
31,jtindahouse,They just can not make this series work,5,27 June 2019,"Two doll based horror movies have come out in the last couple of weeks, One was vastly superior to the other. The superior one was not 'Annabelle Comes Home' I'm sorry to say. In fact having 'Child's Play' come out only seven days before this film only emphasised just how badly these 'Annabelle' movies are being made. The reason 'Annabelle' worked in the original 'Conjuring' movie was because she was an addition to the storyline. Not the storyline itself. You'll notice in that film she never actually did anything, however the thought and imagery of her was enough. It is not enough though to sustain an entire movie, and it is certainly not enough to sustain three of them.This movie is rated 'R' but it really can't justify it. Almost nothing happens the entire movie that would justify that rating (in fact while we're at it almost nothing happens the entire movie period - but that's another issue). The best horror movies today aren't afraid to be bold and step out of their comfort zone to shock their audience. 'Annabelle Comes Home' on the other hand plays it about as safe as you'll ever see. Consequently, any intelligent audience member will know that pretty much every character is entirely safe and if something scary jumps out (that's all this movie has going for it) they aren't actually going to do anything to anyone.One of the characters in this movie was one the of the most annoying I can ever remember seeing in a film. She did ridiculous things that only served to advance the plot of the movie. A lot of the humour missed the mark in this one too. If you feel like a couple of hours to ghosts jumping out of nowhere accompanied by loud jolts of music then this is the film for you. Otherwise, if you have taste in horror movies, see 'Child's Play' instead.",Annabelle Comes Home
32,kevin_robbins,It was fairly mediocre overall.,5,23 May 2021,"I thought I already posted my review for Annabelle Comes Home but I guess not. Nevertheless, it was just okay. There were some elongated sequences to keep the film intense. The settings were okay as was the Warrens daughter. Most of the scenes were classic but over used scare tactics and I'm not sure I was a fan of the CGI werewolf. It was fairly mediocre overall. I'd probably grade it a C, or 5.5/10. Not worth seeing in theatre (Child's Play was better).",Annabelle Comes Home

This is the third in the Annabelle series-the first was in 2014 & the second in 2017-and the seventh in the Conjuring Universe. They are connected. It's sort of a sequel and a prequel, since it takes place right after the first Annabelle movie. Vera and Patrick play the real life Demonologists-Ed & Lorraine Warren-that travel around, collecting supernatural artifacts. They have a special room in their house that they keep these objects in. The movie starts with them bringing home the Annabelle doll and locking it in the artifacts room in a sacred glass box and having a priest perform a blessing on it. Vera and Patrick then have to leave on some more business so they leave their daughter, McKenna, in the hands of their babysitter, Madison. Everything is fine and dandy until Katie comes over. She is a friend of Madison and has just recently lost a family member so guess what she wants to do? Yep, go in the secret artifacts room and find something to help her find some closure. Of course, Annabelle gets loose and the fun begins. Annabelle is like a conduit to the spirit world. Ghosts start popping up, looking for a way into our universe-like possessing someone. The movie is not real scary but it is a little spooky. The Annabelle doll does not come alive and move around-like Chucky-but it does look real creepy. As the end credits start, there is a dedication to the real life Lorraine Warren, who died shortly before this movie's release.
It's rated ""R"" for horror violence and terror and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes.

44,aidanratesmovies,"Disappointing, but not the worst the franchise has had to offer...",6,19 October 2019,"The latest adaptation in The Conjuring franchise and latest spinoff and sequel to Annabelle, is by far one of the most unoriginal films in the series. The film is by no means horrible, it isn't even necessarily bad, but it certainly feels lazy. Suspenseful moments are traded off for cheap scares, easter eggs, or rash plot devices that will matter for such little time or such a little point you will wonder why they are there in the first place. That being said, the film is, as all Conjuring films technically are, 'based on a true story,' so it's hard to truly judge the elements that make up the film itself, but the way it executes these elements is truly its biggest fault. With all of that, some cliche character moments, and the somewhat slow pacing of the film in general, the film does luckily have some things to offer. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, as small as their part may be, do shine as their returning respected characters Ed and Lorraine Warren. The overall look of the film, besides some quite obvious and rather sheepish looking CGI, is also rather fantastic. The overall acting of the film is also quite good, even if the characters themselves don't exactly prove to be rather interesting, but despite the films character problems, every actor truly tries to give it their all. The film also wraps together on a surprisingly sweet note, and is, dare I say this about a Conjuring movie, quite touching. In the end, Annabelle: Comes Home does prove at times to be a bit of a crowded mess with issues to spare. But what it lacks in terms of general qualities, it shines on what makes it most enjoyable. It may not be the scariest entry in the franchise, but it is certainly not the worst. Take that as you may.

46,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Follow-up with a Good Young Cast,8,30 June 2019,"This film I was actually intrigued to check out. After the first Annabelle film, I was down on this line of spin-offs, but the prequel Annabelle: Creation was one that I really enjoyed. I think that The Conjuring universe is quite interesting as well and for the most part, they've been putting out solid films and until they start to really go downhill, I'm down to continue checking them out. To get into this one, the synopsis is while babysitting the daughter of Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), a teenager and her friend unknowingly awakens an evil spirit trapped in a doll.We start this off at the end of Annabelle where Ed and Lorraine Warren are taking the doll home with them. On their way, they have to take a detour due to a car accident. From where they are talking to a cop, Lorraine can see a woman just staring at it and she knows this person passed away. They're making their way on the detour when their car turns off and while Ed is fixing it, Lorraine sees spirits around them in a cemetery. They do finally make it home and with the help of a priest, lock the doll away and trapping its evil.It then shifts to a year later. Judy (Mckenna Grace) is getting bullied at school due to the truth of her parents coming out. Her classmates don't really understand and they're not the nicest about it. Her parents are going away for the night and she will be babysat by Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman). She takes her to school and we see that Judy is down. She is also seeing the image of a priest that is staring at her. This kind of scares her.Mary Ellen goes to get some supplies for that night and her friend Daniela Rios (Katie Sarife) asks her about what she is doing that night. Daniela is quite insistent on coming over. We also get to meet a boy that Mary Ellen has a crush on, Bob Palmeri (Michael Cimino) who has similar feelings.After school, Mary Ellen and Judy are preparing a cake when Daniela shows up. She convinces them to go try out her gift to Judy. She then starts to snoop around the house and goes to the room full of artifacts. She is trying to contact her father and in the process releases Annabelle from her case. Things take quite a turn from there, with the amount of artifacts around the room and the spirits associated with them.Now I have to say, I did find this film to be enjoyable, much like the prequel film in this series. Interestingly enough, Farmiga and Wilson are billed as the stars, but they're not really in it all that much. I actually don't mind that, because I thought the three female leads were all really solid. They really can carry the film and I think they're all distinct enough that it works as well as they're dealing with the effects of this haunting.Something that really struck me with this film is that I'm not sure if they can really keep making other films in this line. This one was really almost a 'Hail Mary' in that they use a ton of ghosts and artifacts. I did really enjoy that, as it kept it from being boring. The problem though is that I think they kind of exhausted what could have been used for other films. Just something that really struck me here.Not all of the ghosts here worked for me. There is a wolf one that I could have done without. This film, much like most in this universe, really focuses on the jump-scares. I will say that some of them were effective. I'm pretty sure that I did jump at a couple of them. The scariest part of the film for me though was a television set and what happens with Daniela. Aside from that, they explore The Ferryman entity here and I really could see a film that is just telling the story there.I think this is a good place to shift to the pacing of the film, which I think was good. I was a bit leery seeing that this film ran about 105 minutes long. To be honest though, it didn't feel like it. We get enough creepy things early on that it builds the tension. I could definitely feel my anxiety going up, which is something that I definitely think is effective if a film can do. This also has some heart to it. Judy is growing up with parents that do something that is quite odd. She is getting bullied, because of it. The ending has a bit of an emotional pull to it, which I definitely appreciated.To the acting of the film, I thought it was good across the board. Grace was really good as the daughter here. I like that we get to see more of her being a psychic like her mother. It is a solid move to move away from Lorraine a bit, but still getting that aspect into the film. For someone as young as she is, she did a solid job. Iseman was great as well. She plays such a sweet character and I really liked her. She is also quite attractive. Sarife was another interesting character. I thought her back-story makes a lot of sense for the reason she is doing the things that she is. It was believable and fitting she had some of the scarier scenes to deal with. Farmiga and Wilson were solid in the part they had. I also want to shout out that Samara Lee is back in this film as Bee here as well. The rest of the cast definitely rounded out this film for what was needed.As for the effects of the film, I do believe there were some practical effects, but for the most part they are CGI here. I actually didn't mind it though overall. They did look good and there was never a moment where it took me out of it. There was a demon in here that was quite creepy for sure. I will also go back to The Ferryman ghost, that was pretty scary and I really liked that concept. The film is also shot very well and they use some interesting techniques.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. It didn't overall stand out, but I do think they definitely make it feel like the era by playing songs that would be out then. To go even farther though, there are some scares that are built around the sound in the film. There are times that music is playing and it shouldn't. We also can hear people talking faintly that definitely helped to build the tension.Now with that said, I did really enjoy this film. I don't think that it is the best in this series, but it is definitely enjoyable. I like the idea here of how the doll gets free and moving away from the parents to follow these three young women I thought was a good touch. Their acting was solid and does carry the film. Pacing for the film does help to build tension and there is also kind of an emotional weight that comes with this one as well. We are mostly getting CGI in this film, which I didn't mind. It looked good enough and it never took me out. The soundtrack of the film doesn't necessarily stand out, but it does fit the scenes and help with building tension. As I said, this is a good film I would say and if you like the series, give it a viewing for sure. It is an interesting ghost story.",Annabelle Comes Home

A Little AnticlimacticSUMMARY:The latest movie in the conjuring universe starts to go back to its roots and polish up things. Annabelle's latest story brings the creepy nature of the movies back to the home and that adds the realistic notion of scares that make fans like me love the series. In the sanctity of the home, one hopes to be harbored from ghosts, but Annabelle's minions prove that not even the familiarity of a home can save you. Nevertheless, the movie manages to bring new types of ghosts and scares that potentially will become movies of their own as the forbidden treasures of the Warrens surface and hint at the secrets in store. Surprisingly, the movie still manages to find some storytelling elements in it as well, but this time through the eyes of a new cast, whose younger members accomplish the goals of terror filled teenagers and adolescents trying to cover up their mistakes. The backstory and character development can be touching, but never quite engulfs the main goal of scaring.Sadly, the movie suffers from the usual horror trade of imbalance and predictability. The use of foreshadowing, the same tactics for trying to build scares, and the trailers have spoiled much of the suspenseful parts for me and given the rushed component this sometimes blew through the scary parts too quickly to allow the audience to stew in the intensity of the moment. In addition, the movie held too much in terms of story lines, primarily in the number of artifacts they tried to use. Ambitious as it was to brings many guests to the party, Annabelle's focus on all the spirits led a fractured story component that did not quite have the majesty of the origin story we got a few years back. Ghosts aside, the story of the humans with more of a pulse did not come fully together, falling into some simplistic stories that did not quite have the bite I was hoping, especially in regards to the boyfriend arc, which while funny was not entirely necessary to the film. As you can probably guess the movie as a whole not quite that climactic in its finish.Yet despite all the imbalances, Annabelle's latest trek is about the middle runner for this reviewer. With enough creeps in the realistic setting, one may find themselves afraid of what lies in the dark, becoming quite sensitive to sounds. With new ghosts, some new tricks, and a few new spins on the formula it works for those looking for a good ghost story. Yet, the movie sort of strayed from the story/scare balance of the first one and the characters don't quite have the same drive some of the stronger series installments (Conjuring and Annabelle Creation) has in terms of characters to latch onto or a story to ground it all. Still, it's got enough special effects to garnish a theater run, but only barely. Instead, this one may be better reserved for home, where the setting can help add some horror in itself.My scores are:Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0",Annabelle Comes Home
49,justin-fencsak,A fun movie,7,28 June 2019,If you like scary movies then this one is well done. The third movie in the annabelle franchise takes place before the events of the first conjuring movie and is worth the money.,Annabelle Comes Home
50,vengeance20,The best Annabelle of the Trilogy,8,13 July 2019,"This was actually best Annabelle of the trilogy I think.The story line was enjoyable & simple. The film had lots of scares & creepy visuals to keep you on edge. The doll was creepy as usual & never failed to impress.Being a fan mostly of slashers & gory horrors I actually liked this one. Unlike the first 2 films which didn't exactly impress, this one did & I wasn't expecting much from this 3rd entry due to the type of horror film it is & what the previous 2 films were like.For once this one had a happy ending & although there wasn't much in terms of body count, I actually was impressed & loved the straight forward story-line this film had.I recommend this. 8/10",Annabelle Comes Home
51,lewiskendell,Annabelle Terrorizes Again,6,10 July 2019,"Is it good?
It's pretty good. Better than the first, a step back from Annabelle: Creation.Is it scary?
If you like jump scares. The movie is creepy and time is taken to build some dread before the scary stuff starts happening, but most of the frights are not memorable enough to stay on your mind after the movie is over. Props to the Ferry Man though, anything involving him was the most interesting part of the movie to me.Should you watch it?
If you're looking for a spooky movie that keeps things very basic. At times Annabelle Comes Home felt less like a cohesive narrative and more like a series of scary things happening with little in between. Teenagers doing dumb things is a major theme here, and some people are understandably tired of that trope. I don't mind it, but it doesn't exactly make me excited, either.The ending was a bit anticlimactic, I was surprised by how simple it was. That kinda goes for the movie as a whole. It's decent, but I was hoping for more.",Annabelle Comes Home

53,Abdulxoxo,A solid sequel,7,16 January 2021,"This film manages to set up tension nicely. The cinematography is solid and the score is on point. Stylistically, this film felt more similar to the two 'Conjuring' films than it did to the previous two 'Annabelle' films. This isn't just because of the presence of the Warren's, although they did help elevate the movie. It's because this film used the house, and the artifacts within, to great effect, I particularly liked that scene where the mirror shows you a little into the future, I thought it was a great scene and concept. The jump scares are quite effective. In terms of the acting, Wilson and Farmiga are great in their few scenes. I wish they'd played a bigger role here, but hopefully it shouldn't be too long till we see the Warrens again in their own movie. The main characters are the three girls, all of which I thought were decent and likable enough.",Annabelle Comes Home
54,btreakle,Annabelle franchise,8,9 June 2021,I loved this film the best of all. Predictable but scary and fun. Love Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. Highly recommend this film.,Annabelle Comes Home
55,gianmarcoronconi,Scary,6,29 October 2021,"Film in general quite scary but also quite stupid because it has nothing innovative and indeed uses really stupid pretexts to unleash all the evil, and also all the evil is badly exploited because the cursed objects are too many and it seems that many have no effect. Even the ending doesn't make much sense because it's too fast and pulled away. The only well developed story arc is that of the little girl, the others are not that great.",Annabelle Comes Home
56,muamba_eats_toast,Options of average,6,18 July 2019,The last half hour was actually quite fun some cheap but fun jumps and scares nothing actually happens for over an hour though in all reality and there are so many loose ends left it's unbelievable. There's just enough to get by and enjoy it but could have been paced much better and have more scares throughout.,Annabelle Comes Home
57,saptesh786,Teenage team verses museum of Evil !,3,1 July 2019,"It is not a movie only a patch to Conjuring universe naming Annabelle. Simple one liner story that Annabelle doll brings at the Warren's museum. But producer director created some teenager's mess into that museum to feel viewers some chilling experience along with Warren's daughter and made a single movie. That is why movie will not attract you only some jump scares frighten you but not really. Somewhere a comical touch having present. Acting of teenage team is just okay with their stupid actions. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson will give you relief. If you are real lovers of horror movies, especially Conjuring then you will be really disappointing after watching this one flick, so leave this aside and have a rest at you home and let Annabelle to go at her home.",Annabelle Comes Home
58,Fernando-Rodrigues,Annabelle's back home!,4,7 December 2020,"It has some funny comedy scenes. It's entertaining, better than the first two movies. But it's weak, and it has its potential it's destroyed by its cliché script. (come on, the kids joked with Warren's cursed artifacts, there could've been more blood!)",Annabelle Comes Home
59,educallejero,"Very well done, but the characters kind of suck",5,8 June 2020,"The movie is technically well done, but it fails miserably at some things, making it just fine, but not good enough.It creates horror atmosphere, with long scenes without abusing unnecessary jumpscares and giving space to the stories of the characters; but it also gives us ultra cliche characters (the babysitter, the audacious friend, and the potential boyfriend), with a pretty standard way of developing the story (the stupid neccesary actions of the characters), and actually abusing the lack of jumpscares in the first hour. More, the lead actresses Madison Iseman and Katie Sarife are really weak, and Safire especially annoying in the first 45 minutes (granted, the script doesn't help them).In the end, I missed a bit of humor (like the unfairly criticized ""The Nun"" had) or interesting ambientation (like ""The Nun"" had), to combine it with the good atmosphere and well paced horror (something ""The Nun"" didn't had). I got a bit bored and the ending lost weight. It was fine, but not more than that.",Annabelle Comes Home
60,rockman182,Annabelle Comes Home (2019),6,2 July 2019,"The Conjuring Universe, can you believe it has gotten as far as it has? Neither can I. Some of the films in the film like the first two Conjuring films are quite entertaining, sure, but the rest of the series is littered with fairly bad horror movies. The Annabelle series kind of redeemed itself with a decent second entry but no one really wanted a third film, surely. Somehow, there is one and the movie addict in me was going to see it just to complete all the films in the Universe. This third entry (within the most needless universe of films), sucks.The film starts with the famous paranormal investigators taking the Annabelle doll and bringing it to their home. A year after this occurs, their daughter and her babysitter and friend get caught up in the terrors brought on by Annabelle, when the doll is released from behind sacred glass. The film barely features the Warrens, if that's a selling point for you. However, it does star a young and talented actress in McKenna Grace. The film i the directorial debut of Gary Daberman who wrote the other Annabelle films and The Nun.Its time to wrap these films up. This film has the most predictable and absolutely mind-boggling slow set ups. The film wastes so much time trying to build atmosphere that is becomes irritating and turns you away. I get a jump scare here and there but its ineffective if we can see them coming and also if it relies on being loud and super slow to shock viewers. There is actually very little going on storywise apart from introducing new characters or entities to build future films on, which is infuriating to me.The film needed more time to really build on its characters rather than slow cheap scares. The good horror films these days rely on an intriguing story and making you think about what you just saw (take Hereditary for example). You will forget about Annabelle 3 as soon as you leave the theater. Rest assured, there will be more films. As long as its a cash cow they will keep going and the quality will keep dropping.5.5/10",Annabelle Comes Home

62,Anurag-Shetty,Annabelle is still relevant.,7,2 July 2019,"Annabelle Comes Home continues with the story of the creepy possessed porcelain doll, Annabelle, after The Conjuring(2013), Annabelle(2014) & Annabelle: Creation(2017). Lorraine Warren(Vera Farmiga) & Ed Warren(Patrick Wilson) leave their daughter, Judy Warren(Mckenna Grace), at home for a day. Judy's babysitter Mary Ellen(Madison Iseman) & Mary Ellen's friend, Daniela Rios(Katie Sarife), accidentally let the infamous porcelain doll, on the loose.Annabelle Comes Home is a good movie. Director Gary Dauberman has given us a unique film, within the Conjuring-verse. This works, both to the movie's advantage & hinders it from reaching new heights. Jump scares are very minimal but, the ones that do work, have been executed brilliantly. The growing feeling of dread & the slow-burn horror, is a breath of fresh air in this franchise but, will get a tad bit tedious at times. Annabelle Comes Home is on par with Annabelle: Creation(2017) & slightly better than The Nun(2018). It is way better than Annabelle(2014) & The Curse of La Llrona(2019). However, The Conjuring(2013) & The Conjuring 2(2016) continue to remain the superficial films, within the Conjuring-verse. Mckenna Grace is the star of the show, as Judy Warren. Grace gives us another power-packed performance, after The Gifted(2017), The Bad Seed(2018) & The Haunting of Hill House(2018). Mckenna Grace is a young talent to watch out for. Madison Iseman is spectacular as Mary Ellen. Katie Sarife is outstanding as Daniela Rios. Michael Cimino is hilarious as Bob Palmeri. Vera Farmiga & Patrick Wilson's screen-time has been greatly exaggerated & their glorified cameos, are a disappointment. I wish they had more to do. Annabelle Comes Home is worth a watch for fans of the Conjuring-verse. Looking forward to next year's The Conjuring 3(2020).",Annabelle Comes Home
63,fernandoschiavi,"Annabelle 3"" surprises when it scares. By playing with other terrifying artifacts from the Warrens' collection, the script cleverly plants opportunities for the future",6,18 June 2021,"Until now, the Annabelle doll was the most profitable derivative of The Conjuring for New Line Cinema, the arm of Warner Bros. With yet another movie in the account, ""Annabelle Comes Home"" has the challenge of avoiding the wear of the character as a scary antagonist and continuing to attract viewers. Screenwriter Gary Dauberman (It - 2017) takes the reins of the sequel, makes his directorial debut giving a different tone to the franchise and gets a gratifying respite for the demonic doll story.Paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson, ""Insidious - 2010"") and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga, ""Up In The Air - 2009"") serve as distinguished hosts to introduce the plot. It begins immediately after the prologue to ""Invocation of Evil"", when the couple brings the cursed doll home ""for safety"". They lock her in a special box inside a room, where they already keep a huge collection of sinister artifacts collected over her career in confronting spirits. Message is given: Annabelle is the most dangerous of objects because she has the power to attract evil entities like a great beacon. The film's conflicts come a year later, when the couple leave their ten-year-old daughter, Judy (Mckenna Grace, ""Captain Marvel""), in the care of nanny Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"") and, of course, the doll manages to escape.Unlike what one might assume, Annabelle is not a possessed puppet like Chucky who goes out to kill for perversity. It functions as a conduit for the real dangers beyond. These yes come thirsty for possessing human bodies and stealing souls. When Mary Ellen's friend Daniela (Katie Sarife, from the series ""Youth & Consequences""), manages to enter the ""warehouse"" of the Warrens, she unintentionally releases not only the doll and the malicious entity that comes through her, but several other horrifying beings ready to strike terror into the house. The girls then have to deal with a phantom werewolf, a murderous bride, Annabelle's little friends and a handful of creatures from the worst nightmares.Acting as a horror film that does not exclusively cater to fans of the James Wan universe, Annabelle Comes Home is a visually and narratively interesting production well-conceived as a dramatic path of characters secure in their social (religion) and psychological convictions (faith). The delicious and infamous use of jump scare is still a very present feature in the sound mix signed by Robert Sharman, but unlike some other films in the franchise, it doesn't appear as a crutch to support narrative of a too weak story, as happened with the cinematographic aberration that was the first damn doll movie.Annabelle's evil is released for reasons that, if seemingly preposterous at first, are sufficiently justified shortly thereafter, subverting some of the expectations by bringing some emotional depth to the occasion. As the Warren's daughter Judy (McKenna Grace), her nanny Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman) and friend Daniela (Katie Sarife) face the doll-influenced spirits, other small arches are rescued and incorporated, such as the crush Bob (Michael) Cimino), comic relief of the time. The first half of the film is perhaps the most successful for defying the conventions of what is expected from a film with this brand. The intro promises a scare that doesn't come, and in it the sudden appearances are not accompanied by accented sounds. In the Warren house, tension builds through the silence as the nanny and her friend walk through the rooms, and at the end of these silences there is... more silence. When there is a scare, it comes at an unexpected and conquered moment.In his directorial debut, Dauberman does not display an extravagant performance, but shows talent in his restraint, not always wanting to emulate James Wan's floating camera and focusing on the careful composition of frames in order to enhance the small spaces of the house. There is enough negative space in each frame to keep the viewer analyzing their surroundings, waiting for some apparition at the end of a room or a hallway, without needing more elaborate camera tricks. The director uses this expectation to create an atmosphere of tension in place of cheap awe, raising the quality of the horror. The director is aware of clichés and sought opportunities to pervert them with a script that is smarter than formulas. When the viewer thinks they already know what is going to happen in a scene, something not so expected happens and keeps the suspense longer. The shiver comes from the camera play and from the elements placed in the frame at calculated moments. In addition to easter eggs from the franchise itself, Gary also plants references to classics by Tobe Hooper and tales by Stephen King to enrich the film.Finally, it is human motivations and very identifiable themes such as bullying, mourning and teenage tacky that fill the emotional fabric of the film, especially thanks to the surprising performances of Mckenna Grace and Katie Sarife. Her Judy and Daniela bring an unexpected depth to the genre. On the other hand, supernatural characters do what they want, whenever they want, and the script doesn't bother to explain anything that makes sense of the hauntings other than torment (coordinately) the living.With so many threats that finally escape the Warren's basement, and although the scale of events here is limited to a single house, the succession of frights follows a similar logic to these movies, prioritizing entertainment over internal coherence among the evil entities, which follow their own concepts. If on the one hand this unpretentiousness allows for a wide variety of scares and creative ideas, putting the viewer in a position of uncertainty as to what will come next, the frenzied nature of terror prevents each of the entities from being better developed, not just the limits amusement park monsters as it makes the film's unravel a little too random for its own good - monsters appear and disappear for no apparent reason.As the script also introduces several entities, these could not but be inconsistent with each other as to the idealization and its realization on screen. In terms of aesthetics, the best of them are easily the Boatman, a reaper with coins over his eyes, and Annabelle herself, whose inner demon manifests itself in a fascinating way, in a tense scene with a lamp with colored filters that, when alternated, gradually reveal their true form. The Infernal Dog, who is just a typical werewolf, appears in cartoonish CGI effects that make him much less threatening than even those seen in Goosebumps feature films and series, working better when hidden or in humorous occasions - as in Bob scene in the chicken coop. The cursed wedding dress, meanwhile, is basically a mix of the Nun and La Llorona, and appears in the plot only to create an inconvenience for the protagonists in their final act. The lack of effect of entities on the narrative told here is highlighted by the hasty conclusion, far less climatic than one would expect from this premise.If, on the one hand, everything was resolved quickly and made the plot a little fast-paced, Annabelle 3 is not a dull or tiring film, which ends up making up for this deficiency. Normally, in remarkably successful horror material, we can use the expression ""breathtaking"" or ""shuddering"" and that, unfortunately, cannot be said about this film. With wrong production decisions, Annabelle 3 is not a scary movie and can be ridiculed at times. However, thanks to the cast holding the ends, it entertains.Gary Dauberman, already known for writing Annabelle 2:Creation and The Nun, may have been marked by his not-so-good exploits in the aforementioned features. However, his work on Annabelle 3 is surprising and surreal. The film managed to bring, right from the start, the tension that surrounds Ed and Lorraine Warren in relation to the evil spirits they fight, mixed with the need to try to guess where the scares will happen so that you are prepared. Between jokes and relaxed moments, Annabelle 3 works a lot for its main function: jump scares. Unlike the other doll movies, the third feature of the terrifying play manages to make you totally taken by surprise in parts that you don't imagine it will happen. It is the surprise element of the film that this third chapter of Annabelle stands out.The different and fun setups and payoffs that the script sets up when introducing details that are initially insignificant, but which have importance later in the plot, deserve to be highlighted. This is a generally difficult technique to perform, and what stands out in ""Annabelle 3"" is the number of times it is used. In addition, sound editing as a narrative element is memorable, from the attenuation of doors and walls to the almost imperceptible layer of low frequencies, like an insistent hum that gives away the presence of spirits. Also notice how the noise that comes out of a samurai armor at a certain moment is capable of creating practically a second movie in the viewers' imagination.For daring to build a different climate by bringing new elements to the franchise, ""Annabelle Comes Home"" surprises expectations with creativity and great direction. By playing with other terrifying artifacts from the Warrens' collection, the script cleverly plants opportunities for new spin offs, while giving the doll a little respite to avoid public fatigue. Even with the rhythm and a lot of creativity in the dark attacks, the film doesn't shed the weight of being a late addition to the franchise. It's always nice to see Patrick Wilson (Ed Warren) and Vera Farmiga (Lorraine Warren) duo again, but it's hard not to notice the same formula structure that made The Nun and La Llorona such lazy cookie-cutter, raising doubts about how much breath there is left. In all this.",Annabelle Comes Home

65,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Conjuring franchise turns into teen jumpscare film,6,20 September 2019,"I am disappointed in the direction this film has taken the Conjuring franchise. It has turned into a Goosebumps style tween jumpscare film. I think teens and younger children will love it, but this film lacks a good story for adults. The plot is about a young girl who sneaks into the Warren's room where they keep Annabelle the doll and she lets her lose from the glass display case unleashing lots of spooky characters like werewolves & ghosts. The warren's daughter, babysitter and the girl who let out Annabelle are terrorized by the ghosts until they can find Annabelle and seal her back up in her display case.I gave it a 6 out of 10 because I can see the younger adults and teens will have fun watching this film on Halloween; It's a good film for them. But it will leave adults who might have wanted a deeper movie unsatisfied. Personally, I think they should just call it quits for this franchise before it goes further down.Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson are in this film, but they aren't the main characters. They are secondary characters and the main characters are really Mckenna Grace, Madison Iseman and Katie Sarife. That's not a bad thing, but if you like me were expecting Farmiga and Wilson to be the main characters involved in a new supernatural story, they aren't. Nevertheless, the younger cast members did a good job and the film was directed well with good jumpscares.",Annabelle Comes Home
66,markthomassintek,Another Hereditary,3,17 July 2019,"REVIEW - ANNABELLE COMES HOMEThe latest film in this francize hit the cinema earlier this month and whilst at the cinema and watching the trailer I thought to myself, at last a proper scary film unlike the devastatingly laughable The Nun.The film tries, it tries or it si trying I can't quite decide, it tries to be original in places which si great but then again is the usual predictable in others, even so when I predicted what was about to happed I was asked if I had seen the film before.Basically as we have seen with so many the trailer shows the clips of the best bits but when joined together in an actual film the whole thing is just boring, with nothing really happening for an hour into the film, its feet dragging as the dolls would if it tried to walk.My biggest problem with films like this is that they are churned out for the money, ok I know film making is a business and as such each film hopefully should make a profit but how has this film got 4 and 5 stars?Story is weak (even silly), effects (there aren't any as such, but sometimes the best effects should look real), acting is just lazy and the whole trying to explain what Annabelle is and why is just last in a pathetic attempt to scare which this film doesn't, in fact the audience I sat with even laughed out loud at a number of sequence's which weer obviously intended to be scary but weren't.Don't waste your;money,time,brain cells,laughter,don't even watch this on TV when it comes on late at night because it will disappoint.Another Hereditary.Ratting 3 out of 10",Annabelle Comes Home

68,kjproulx,A Middle of the Road Entry to the Franchise,6,29 June 2019,"The Conjuring films are some of the best mainstream Horror flicks to come out over the last decade. They aren't the standard for the genre by any means, but I'll always remember them very fondly. When Warner Bros. first announced that they were dipping their toes in spin-offs and prequels, I found myself scratching my head, and the first Annabelle film felt like the nail in the coffin for the franchise. Suddenly, Annabelle: Creation hit theatres and actually surprised many viewers, including me. For that alone, I was interested in this third instalment, seeing as they won me over with its predecessor. Annabelle Comes Home isn't worth seeing in theatres, but I wouldn't recommend completely dismissing it if you're a fan of this series.Taking place after Annabelle: Creation, but before The Conjuring, the timeline of these films have begun to feel a little messy. This film picks up with familiar characters to the franchise in Ed and Lorraine Warren, as they discover the Annabelle doll. Once locked up in their cellar, their daughter's babysitter and her friend all find themselves being haunted in mysterious ways. While there are some creepy moments, this movie doesn't feel like an Annabelle film all that often. I would guess that the doll itself received about 10-20 minutes of screentime in a 105-minute film.Where I feel this franchise has had the most success is actually in it's developed characters. It was nice to see Ed and Lorraine on-screen together again, and although there are a few great dramatic elements sprinkled throughout this movie, Annabelle Comes Home almost takes advantage of that too often. Yes, there are scary aspects to this film, but I found myself seeing it as more of a drama than a Horror film, which worked but also felt conflicting at the same time.Being a solid screenwriter for Horror, Gary Dauberman takes the helm as director on his first feature film and I would say that is actually one of the best aspects of Annabelle Comes Home. From some great imagery to overall terrifc cinematography overall, this is a movie that definitely looks the part. With that said, it pails in comparison to the rest of the movie. The look and tone of the movie are weighed down by a dramatic story that only wishes to focus on the drama of this universe.In the end, Annabelle Comes Home isn't as impressive as Annabelle: Creation or either one of the Conjuring movies, but is eons better than the first Annabelle and The Nun, is that says anything. This is a very average movie as a whole and doesn't really state a purpose for existing, other than having some good family drama with the family we have come to love in this franchise since the beginning. For Horror fans, you'll probably be disappointed, but for those just looking to see a decent movie, you may find yourself slightly satisfied.",Annabelle Comes Home
69,kuarinofu,A dorky teen comedy about a family that lives in a horror movie set,4,7 July 2019,"If you strip The Conjuring movies of all story elements, suspense, drama and atmosphere and dumb down all the characters to just sets of stereotypes - you've got Annabelle Comes Home.Let's start with the fact that Warrens are nowhere to be seen in this movie. They were even given a random and disconnected scene only to ensure they are in this movie for at least 10 minutes total. And even in this scene, they act like they cannot care any less about their performances. I've never seen such good actors caring so little.The movie is divided into two significant parts that never interconnect. The first hour is a random mess of teenage dramedy cliches cut and edited by Edward Scissorhands. After the obligatory ""scary"" scene with Warrens, which is not connected to anything whatsoever, the movie follows the cycle - dorky dialogue -> random exposition -> dorky dialogue -> more random exposition. It gets boring fast but by the time you start checking the time on your phone begins the second part.The other hour is just a demon pulling shenanigans on three girls using all the introduced gadgets from Warrens trophy room (a.k.a. ""The Artifacts""). The story progresses whenever it wants. Sometimes the doors are closed, sometimes they are open. Sometimes they can do something, and sometimes they can't. They never go out of character because there are none. It feels more like a slasher movie rather than horror. The victims do the stupidest things imaginable and in no way react as a normal human being would, that is scream and RUN, RUN, RUN.And...this is pretty much it. The girls explore the magnificent house that is no doubt a horror movie set for some time, the demon from the doll pulls more pranks on them, and then the movie ends. All ""storylines"" resolve themselves like there was never any conflict or trouble anyway. Everything is perfect, and this is the happiest ending ever.I rarely say this about movies, but this was just garbage. I'm sorry, but this is not what good horror is. You can only feel scared and even terrified when you find yourself in the skin of a character you are rooting for. Jumpscares themselves does not equal scary.I mean, fine, Warrens live in Sleepy Hollow, the fog is so thick you can swim in it (even in the house), lights never work in this house, but WHAT'S WITH THE DEMON STEALING YOUR TV REMOTE? CHRIST SAKE.",Annabelle Comes Home
70,Hayden-86055,Good acting with some effective monsters,6,10 January 2021,"Annabelle Comes Home is one of the more recent films in the conjuring universe, and it is quite good. Mckenna Grace as Judy Warren is the best actress in the film, especially good considering her age. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are both in it too, but they only have cameo roles effectively. The story is quite simplistic, two babysitters (played by Katie Sarife and Madison Iseman) come over to sit for Judy, but when one of them decides to go and have a look at the Annabelle doll all hell breaks loose and everything comes out to get them. It has some very inventive scares and a few good comedic moments, jump scares are used a lot but mostly effectively and there's some good claustrophobic cinematography that makes you feel trapped in the house. One critique I have though (apart from the predictability) is how many monsters there are - too many! We have: Annabelle, a man with a lantern who takes souls, a huge demonic hound, a killer undead bride, lots of ghosts, the devil (?) and a creepy priest. There's just too many and they undermine the supposedly main monster Annabelle.6/10: Good",Annabelle Comes Home
71,Darkside-Reviewer,Teenager's breaking the rules what a surprise,5,15 August 2019,Definitely not the worst the Annabelle series has to offer but certainly the most boring and predictable of the lot the story follows two teenage characters who are babysitting the Warrans young daughter Judy while they are away for the night but as usual the teenage characters have no common sense in a horror movie and snoop around the Warrans house and end up letting the Annabelle doll out of her protective sacred glass Annabelle then uses all the possesed objects in the Warrans cursed collection room to scare the kids into giving up a soul the typical Annabelle routine just with a few new ghosts added into the mix who have no backstory or interesting reasons behind there violent hauntings and a few callbacks to previous movies that don't tie into the story at all and are just there to connect the movies together in the laziest way possible we do get some interesting character development from the Warrans daughter Judy about how she is treated by other children for being the daughter of Ed and Lorraine Warran who everyone sees in the paper for being involved in the paranormal but other than that nothing worth looking into in this movie.I recommend waiting until it's released on Blu Ray and DVD or a streaming service if you do have an interest in watching this movie as its not worth a trip to the cinema.,Annabelle Comes Home
72,msbreviews,Rating: D,3,27 June 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I went to this movie not expecting much, but it never crossed my mind that I would be watching a film as bad or worse than The Nun. Honestly, going back, I was too easy on the latter since I didn't exactly give it a massively negative review, which it surely deserves. However, Annabelle Comes Home really tries its best to be even worse. I hate it. I truly do. The horror genre has been exponentially growing, and it's one of the two most popular genres right now (comic-book movies are the other), but this cheap, bland, cliche, predictable, and forgettable class of horror films is genuinely starting to annoy and frustrate me. The Conjuring Universe became just a set of silly spin-offs with entities that have no interest whatsoever and filled with extremely under-developed characters.This is the third movie about Annabelle. Three films that address the powers of a freaking doll. Three! Very few people liked the first one, the prequel was admittedly a pleasant surprise, but this one is just atrociously bad. There's not even a story. The whole movie is based on repeating almost laughable jump scares sequences. Literally, it's all some sort of variation of the following:Character walks down the hall -> A strange noise occurs-> Character slowly follows that noise -> Score starts to become louder -> Character checks something and camera closes in on the actor's face -> Score becomes heavier and louder with the introduction of bass -> Another noise occurs behind the character -> Camera pans with the character and nothing happens -> Character continues to check on something -> Another noise, another pan, nothing again -> Score is reaching its climax -> Character continues doing the same thing -> Final noise, pan, and then one out of the two predictable jump scares happen: BOO! or Fake! ... BOO! -> These are accompanied by a ridiculously loud sound that everyone in the theater is already bracing for because, guess what, everyone knows it's coming -> Cut -> Repeat.Except for the first 15-20 minutes, which are used to solely provide backstory to the three main characters, every single scene is an uninspired, unimaginative, anticipated, and tedious build-up to a jump scare that heavily relies on an exaggeratedly loud sound, and someone screaming. There's no real narrative besides some character backstories which also have their own issues, especially one that involves an attempt at the start of a silly romance. Gary Dauberman tried to insert comedy in order to balance an otherwise monotonous film, but he failed miserably. Every supposedly funny moment is astonishingly cringe-worthy. It was his directorial feature-debut, and it shows.It just feels like another cheap horror flick, filled with nothing but jump scares. One after the other. Every director in Hollywood could have done this, there's no distinct style or a trademark shot. Nothing. I do believe that every movie takes a lot of work, and there are tons of people behind a film that genuinely give it their all every time. But Annabelle Comes Home feels so much like a pure cash grab, and I hate writing these words because every movie ever is ultimately an attempt to win money for the studios. However, this sequel never feels like it's actually serving any purpose for the expansion or improvement of the universe it represents. It's a horror flick filmed in just one location, something that I usually love because you can do so much with it, but this time it really seems that it was filmed entirely at a house because it was cheaper, hence more probability of profit.There are two clear areas in the horror genre: the zone with films like Hereditary, Get Out and Us, where the story and its characters are what's more important and scarier; and the other with movies like The Nun, The Curse of La Llorona or Annabelle Comes Home, where the only goal is to cyclically produce jump scare sequences with no narrative significance or impact. If you enjoy this latter type of films (which is absolutely okay, everything is subjective to personal preferences), then you'll probably enjoy this movie. At least, people in my theater screamed and laughed pretty hard with no respect for the moviegoers that were trying to watch the actual film. However, if you're sick of watching the same thing over and over and over and over again, please, for your own sake, skip it.If it wasn't for the truly amazing performances, this could very easily be the worst movie of the year (Serenity still holds that spot). McKenna Grace is phenomenal as Judy! Madison Iseman and Katie Sarife are also pretty good at their roles. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga barely have any screentime, but when they do show up, they definitely elevate the scene. Everything related to the production design is quite good, but technicalities will never save a film from misery if the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are thrown down the sewer. Also, I was shocked when I discovered that this is Rated R. There's barely any blood or anything that justifies that type of rating. It's another aspect that makes this film an even bigger disappointment.In the end, Annabelle Comes Home is as poor or worse than The Nun. I can't really decide which one I would watch instead of the other because I truly don't want to watch any of these ever again. A brilliant cast might save this movie from a completely negative review, but it's still an atrociously cheap addition to the horror genre. Everyone knows why this film doesn't work: continuously repeating predictable, loud, and hollow jump scare sequences is not a story. I can't feel invested in any of these scenes if they lack narrative impact or a minimum level of scariness. The fact that I barely even instinctively flinched (something I can't really avoid) is a sign of how horrible this movie is. My expectations for The Conjuring 3 just dropped tremendously. Good luck, James Wan. You're going to need it.",Annabelle Comes Home
73,jucsetmai,Annabelle Comes Home on 4k ultra hd,8,12 September 2021,"As someone largely disappointed by the two Annabelle films that preceded it - I found both of them to be pretty draggy - I was pleasantly surprised to find ANNABELLE COMES HOME a fun watch this morning on HBO on-demand.It's a wild night at the Warren residence as our favorite hideous devil-doll Annabelle and the malevolent spirits inhabiting a certain locked room are inadvertently released and given free rein. Teenage Mary Ellen, watching over the Warrens' precocious daughter Judy, most certainly earns her babysitting money as all hell breaks loose. Mary Ellen's BFF Daniela (grieving her recently deceased dad, whose death she feels responsible for) and would-be boyfriend Bob (pursued by a werewolf at one point, which serves him right after his especially painful rendition of Bread's ""Everything I Own"" in an attempt to serenade Mary Ellen) are also along for the ride. This entry in the Conjuring Universe takes itself far less seriously than its brethren, and provides a carnival/funhouse atmosphere that suits the creepy fun as the Warren home becomes the ultimate haunted house for the night.Daughter Judy and the teen trio make for appealing protagonists, and I enjoyed the '70s milieu as well as the cheeky touches throughout: I rather liked how an atmospheric fog - enough to make a Hammer or Universal monster movie envious - increases both inside and outside the house as this less-than-enchanted evening progresses.I know this was likely the least well-received of the Annabelle series, but I had a fine time watching this entertaining spookshow...now bring on that third Conjuring movie!

74,SoumikBanerjee25,Horribly Bad!,2,16 April 2020,"I mean, where do I even start? This film has let me down big on every aspect out there. From the storyline to the scares; everything is just a big sigh! The only memorable part would be the performances! As they acted pretty decently. Especially Mckenna grace; the little kid. Other than that I seriously couldn't find a single postive about this film. Maybe the cinematography was decent enough for a horror standard but nothing special in there as well. The background score is lame, the characterizations are piss poor. That Boyfriend/Crush Character was annoying as hell. He didn't provide any sort of important part in there! Seems like they thought, well we have a teenage babysitter so we must now get her some love interest! A foolish decision in my opinion, I don't really see the point!Let's now come to the most important part of a horror movie that is, Scares. Well frankly saying except 1 or 2 scenes I didn't get any scares at all. This film doesn't feel scary, horrific at all. It rather looks like a pre setup of possible upcoming additions of the Conjuring universe.
Though the film is about Annabelle, she isn't the only focus in here and I really liked the premise of it. A Demonic doll, activating other malevolent spirits/ghosts. But the execution falls short and wasted otherwise a fine concept. The spirits/haunted objects failed to impress nonetheless. If any of them get a standalone movie of their own. God I hope and wish let that be good. Cause from what I have seen in the recent additions, I'm really stressed about the current situation of these movies. With such mediocrity no franchise has ever survived for too long. The future projects better be good for the sake of conjuring fans and horror fans as a whole! Otherwise it would be upsetting to see a Famous Horror franchise going down.",Annabelle Comes Home

We will be asking ourselves how did that happen in some scenes as no explanation is given. This movie also sets up for future spinoffs/sequels but we can't guess how good it will be.

81,jwwalrath-227-85487,Annabelle comes to have a good time,8,28 June 2019,"Annabelle Comes Home has the titular possessed doll causing a ruckus in the Warren's collection of cursed objects unleasing the creatures in the house in what the creators call a scary version of Night at the Museum. What ensues, while not the scariest film in the Conjuring-verse, is a fun experience.This movie is more upbeat than the last two Annabelle movies (including a few funny lines.) Kind of surprising considering that this is written and directed by Gary Dauberman, who wrote the last two films. The ending to the last film is one of the darkest in the Conjuring franchise, so Dauberman's pivot is surprising. However, since this revolves around the house and daughter (Mckenna Grace) of the stars of the main film line, I can see why Dauberman didn't want to do anything that would really rock the boat and affect them in the long run. Also, it'd just be hard to compete with the tone of the last film, which in my opinon was the best.Understand that when I say this is more upbeat, I'm not saying this film isn't scary. It just has more of a popcorn/funhouse horror feel. Ever since the Warrens' collection of possessed and cursed objects was introduced, I think everyone has been itching to explore them more, and you definitely get your payoff. There are some pretty creepy ghosts in here, including one inventive being that isn't in the commercials and I won't spoil.I do wish the other ghosts were given more to do. Annabelle still bears the load. I just wanted to see the ghosts have some more physicality and violence. (Yes, the samurai armor from the earlier films is still in the collection. No, it doesn't unsheathe it's sword. I know, right?!) Also, there is one ghost who mostly tangles with Michael Cimino's character that is mostly done using computer animation and doesn't work as well as the other more practical-looking monsters.Considering that this is a first time director, this looks pretty nice. There are some nicely shot scares. They don't compete with the best of the series, but they work. A lot of thought must have went into the set design. This really looks like it takes place during the seventies.The three main leads are pretty likable, especially Katie Sarife's character. At first you worry that she's the stereotypical party friend to the lead who makes bad decisions. Yeah, she kind of does that latter part, but her character goes in a way that is unexpected and fleshes her out.If you were looking forward to seeing Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick WIlson), be prepared that they really aren't in this that much.I'd rank this above Annabelle 1, The Nun, and La Llorona, and below the Conjurings and Annabelle Creation. This isn't the scariest or most technically proficient film in the franchise, but this doesn't miss by that much. If you're just looking for something visually interesting that is just trying to entertain, then I recommend this.",Annabelle Comes Home

These facts in mind I decided to check out this movie (even though I haven't yet seen the first ""Annabelle"" or ""The Creation"").Unfortunately the Warrens aren't in the movie much. Instead we have this new cast of teenagers. That was disappointing because I think the charisma of the original lead stars was the main thing that made The Conjuring stand out from average horror in some way. They are in the beginning and ending but don't have much screentime.Mediocre horror film which feels like I've seen it already a million times. It's not the worst, you can watch it if you want.

86,nikola17,one of better Annabelle films in franchise,8,1 July 2019,"This is something i would watch all over again look i am a conjuring fan universe, i liked first two conjuring movies, first Annabelle i wasn't fan of that movie, Nun i enjoyed the nun great film in my opinion. but i never liked Annabelle creation 2017 film sucked as hell. at least this film had a decent Paced as well it's not very long boring film with too much suspense to it who needs that we had that too much in first 2 films. this was just simple easy made fast pacing film, it was full on horror doesn't slow down at all. it is scary movie of all time it's a interesting story, a lot of creative things in movie like you never seen before, and it takes place just in Lorraine and Ed house witch was scary because their isn't any room to hide in house if it's somewhere else different story. plot is very slaright forward as well. In1970, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren bring the possessed Annabelle doll to their home after claims from two nurses, nothing related from another films. loved how scary scenes were when Lorraine just sitting in car while Ed looking at engine while they had a problem with engine awhile Lorraine sees bunch of dead people beyond Ed, those were people who died in car accident sadly. after of all Judy Warren (Mckenna Grace) who started high school, her parents hired a baby the Warrens welcome Mary Ellen, who will be in charge of babysitting the couple's daughter when Ed and Lorraine are investigating about to go overnight to investigate another case. At school, Judy sees the spirit of a priest that begins following her. you have another funny character bob (Michael Cimino) who works at supermarket that Mary has a big crush on and another girl Daniela Rios (Katie Sarife) arrives uninvited to the Warrens' home. Daniela is friend to Judy , who is curious aboutspeaking to the dead after the death of her father at car accident, Daniela tries to get into the artifacts room but finds the room securely locked, later on she finds keys to room witch it's too easy to put it on desk beyond picture of Jesus a little mini frame, she goes in looks around touch's everything starts exploring and touching artifacts, ultimately trying to contact her late father with an artifact called the Mourner's Bracelet, when she touched Annabelle doll she opened glass case but forgot to lock it Annabelle falls over. then that's when terror and fear begins That night, Annabelle begins releasing other spirits i loved the cursed samurai armor he is a interesting looking haunting spirit to me i wanted to see that as movie itself. also the Ferryman, the Bride not La Llorona but different character, hellhound is werewolf witch i won't mind tosee that as movie itself, rest of urban legends comes to alive then everything goes chaos, everything starts hurting around house. and i liked it when it's just Judy herself managing to survive herself and her friends for first time not just Ed and Lorraine coming to rescue those Judy helped herself and her friends just all once witch that was something different. this is full on horror if your big true horror fan and a conjuring fan of universe this is a lot better then another 2 Annabelle movies a lot better, this is a lot moving happing and it's pretty watchable film it just keeps you watching like film never gets boring, the horror never stops it just keeps going and going. their are a lot terrifying moments as well. film was filmed just at home nowhere else witch issomething different, the film takes you to a reach of a different level. It created a new atmosphere and presented us with the ""haunted house"" like a home alone type feel but expect girl isn't alone in house well if they made it that way that would be better and scarier because she is alone in house with all those urban legends in basement but without her friend going to basement and touched the doll and all another items then theirs no movie. It was intense and quite the ride when things got going. The story was decent. The acting wasdecent. And the scares were decent. It is a decent installment to the Annabelle/The Conjuring franchise. i liked first Annabelle but i wasn't much fan of movie it was just boring, slow, not much to say about film it was bit forgettable as well, but first 2014 Annabelle wasn't that bad, but second film Annabelle creation was just boring as hell and stupid characters, characters were alright and to have a discount version of Liam nesson an actor wannabe Anthony LaPaglia turning on a accent of Liam nesson. but this gets a disappointment ? really for what i liked this movie i think it's great film in franchise i think i can watch this all over again skip the another 2 Annabelle films and yes sue me. From start to finish, it was suspenseful! Very creepy! Andhad an enjoyable plot! The characters were easy to invest in and fall in love with. Great use of music and imagery to set the chilling mood and is definitely my favorite Annabelle movie in franchise. i liked Nun and 2 conjuring movies and this a lot more then 2 films of Annabelle witch it's average. i don't know if people know this but the real Lorraine Warren died just a few months before this film was released. She passed on April 18, 2019, at the age of 92. This was definitely a nice tribute to her she can now rest with Ed side of grave. i thought this had a nice touch for tribute i rate this movie 8.10 it's one of great Annabelle film in franchise it's in proof film in franchise to the another 2 Annabelle films.",Annabelle Comes Home

90,TwistedContent,"Flawed, but Spooky & Even Nostalgic-Feeling",7,3 July 2019,"Annabelle's homecoming turned out to be a little spookier than I thought, that being said, I had set my expectations pretty low.I consider the first Annabelle movie to be the worst in the Conjuring-verse, along with The Nun. However, the 2nd Annabelle movie was an improvement & I think that this one is arguably on par with it's predecessor. First off, I want to get the negative aspects off the board. That damn comic relief character! This time it was a guy (it's always a guy, isn't it) named ""Bob's got balls"" - although the inclusion of him did not as pushed and screen-time-heavy as Frenchie in The Nun, it still tears up the spooky mood that, in my opinion, should not be disturbed if the filmmakers want to achieve the maximum effect. I wonder if it's writers free will decision or a suggestion (more like an order) by the studio. Next up, the story - it's not exactly broad and fullfilling & is mostly layered with things, thingies and sequences that pleases that audience which is already very familiar with the Conjuring-verse, showing off more of Warren's horrific artefacts, ghosts and other demons. Personally, I didn't crave for much more, except for maybe the ending, which felt a little oversimplified and abrupt. The last thing that bugged me a bit was the pacing, at times the suspense building was overplayed and got draggy, but not for the most part. Could've been a slightly shorter expierence.What I really liked is how old-school this 3rd installment felt at moments - many of the little sequences were stylistically reminiscent of horror films from the 70's. I don't use the word ""spooky"" a lot (I guess it's a milder kind of scary), but I thought it describes this film quite accurately, it's slow-burning, patient with scares (yes, mostly jumpscares, but I've seen way worse) & tries its best to feel eerie. Usually in these kind of stories the characters are very archaic, often dumb and unsimpathetic, but the trio of ladies here landed on the slightly-above-average side in this particular area. As for the visuals, there's very little cgi, which is great, a lot is done with, pure and simply, various props and simple practical effects. The cinematography is a blend of modern and the before mentioned 70's kind of style, even using some big, super fast zoom-ins - not a lot I can complain about. Big portion of the movie is literally very dark, which is not a problem while watching it on the big screen, but might be less attractive for the viewers at home. Last but not least, Vera Farmiga & Patrick Wilson as the Warrens - little screen time for them, but it's just heartwarming and awesome to see them when they're there.I'm sort of sure that I'm letting this one off easy, objectively it's probably no more than 6/10, but it was just charming enough - I blame the low expectations (didn't dig the trailer much). I'm also sure that the 4th part is most definitely not needed & if they want to make another spin-off, please not the white bride. The Samurai costume story could make for an interesting story though... My rating: 7/10.",Annabelle Comes Home

In 'Annabelle Comes Home,' we're once again brought into the Connecticut home of the Warrens, but instead of following them along on another mission, we see what happens when their young daughter, Judy (McKenna Grace) is left with an inexperienced babysitter (Madison Iseman) and her troublesome friend (Katie Sarife).After all the frightening journeys we've been on in this horror franchise, 'Home' is sort of a letdown when it comes to the fear factor. Sure, there are some chilling scenes and jump scares as you'd expect, but something about the familiarity of the Warrens' house removes some of the originality and unknown. There are only so many times the girls can go up and down the same stairs, down the same hallways and into the same room filled with ""possessed objects"" before things start to feel stale.Even though you'd think the fact that we're only following young people here would make things scarier, for some reason there's less to be afraid of here. The addition of an awkward love interest (Michael Cimino) also somehow cheapens the effect. Perhaps Annabelle has lost her edge after being cooped up in that display case?It's not horrible, but 'Annabelle Comes Home' is certainly not a highlight in this horror universe.",Annabelle Comes Home

Annabelle comes home is the latest film in the conjuring horror universe. Where cursed doll Annabelle finds itself in the Warrens house contained in a room full of evil spirits. But when they go away for the day there daughter is left with a babysitter and her friend and things start to go wrong can they all survive the evil of Annabelle and other evil spirits as well.
Annabelle comes home was another solid addition to the conjuring universe. They have mastered the correct tone and scares and excellent cinematography. However there are things that make Annabelle comes home one of the more weaker films in the franchise lets talk about what these are.First of all the film had a extremely tense tone throughout. All the films in the whole conjuring universe have really mastered how to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film. whether if it was due to the tense soundtrack or the pindrop were you cant hear anything. I was tense throughout the whole film. And the director did a great job with teasing a jumpscare but not actually fully committing to it which left you even more tense as you did not know when a jumpscare was going to happen. And also the jumpscares were excellently executed and really made me jump out of my skin on a few occasions. The fact that you did not know when these scares were going to happen to the building of tension they had much more of an impact.Next i thought the warrens were a good choice to add into this movie. Despite not having a huge role in the film they still had enough screen time to attract larger audiences due to there popularity in the conjuring films. This was clever to add them in the film as it gave there child judy warren ( Mckenna Grace) more of the spotlight and they went into interesting topics with her character arcs. As she was isolated and alone due to her parents and it was interesting to see that arc develop during the film where more and more people actually liked her they just judged her because of her parents jobs.However due to the large amount of tension and teasing the audience with jummpscares the film did have fairly slow pacing during the first half. There was really not much going on during the first half. Yes it was establishing and developing character arcs and introducing new characters. But the jump-scares and real scariness did not come until the final act which is what happens with most of the conjuring universe films. It would just be nice if they could perhaps experiment with keeping a consistently scary tone and consistent pacing.However the film was pretty scary. In fact one of the scariest films in the conjuring universe. This was helped by the introduction of all the new spirits.Whether it was the introduction of the ferry man. Or the wolfhound or the cursed wedding dress the film was very creative in its introduction of these new spirits. Whether it was thick fog,snapping of bones or dead relatives. One of the scariest scenes would have to be where Mary Ellen ( Madison Iseman) was trapped with the ferry man staring at her dead body. They really did a good job with creating an unsettling tone where they lingered on the scene for as long as they could until they eventually executed a very effective jumpscare.
Next the film was actually one of the funnier conjuring films and had a fun romantic storyline between Mary Ellen and Bobs got balls. The whole Bobs got balls character arc was very entertaining. His awkwardness at trying to win over Mary Ellen was very funny. And he bought a lot of humour to the film with hiding in the chicken coop. So the film had a very good balance of humour and scariness.Next however i would like to add that the character of Daniella ( Katie Sarife) was one of the most annoying characters. This was mostly due to her poor script for a large majority of the film. Her constant questions of whether there was anything scary in the warrens house really annoyed me. And she was the character who made all the stupid decisions and opened everything and touched everything for no apparent reason so this was incredibly frustrating to watch even though there is always this type of character in these types of film. However on the other hand with her character i understood why she did all the silly things. Due to her guilt at feeling she caused the death of her father she was desperate for anything to get into contact with him so this made me understand her character arc despite her annoying qualities.Lets finish with my final two positives. First of all the film had very good acting. All 3 leads in the film. Katie Sarife,Mckenna Grace and Madison Iseman all did a great job here. They all did a excellent and very believable job of showing the terror of the situation they are going through. You sympathised with Katies character as you understood the internal struggle she was going through with her father so the acting definitely was a big part in keeping the film together. And also the film had excellent cinematography. This is now to be expected within the conjuring universe. but they somehow managed to make such a small set piece so entertaining and interesting. The different rooms were very creative in setting up jumpscares. And the creativity with the coloured lamp was top notch directing.However unfortunately i have to end on my biggest negative for the film. The Film just felt like a cheap set up for future prequels. Despite being considered the main cause of the horrible events that were happening in the house. The doll was hardly in the film. Instead the main focus was on all the new spirits so therefore it felt more of like a set up for future films. The focus was supposed to be on Annabelle but she was just an afterthought in the film which was a shame as the second film felt more focused on her and was the best film in the trilogy.Overall Annabelle comes home is still a strong edition to the conjuring universe and further proof that the directors of these films have mastered the craft. However it still falls short of being up there with the strongest films in the franchise.",Annabelle Comes Home

103,movieman6-413-929510,The third Annabelle film looks like a tour of a haunted house.,5,29 June 2019,"Annabelle Comes Hom is the third film in the Annabelle film spin-offs from the Conjuring film series. This film is directed and partly written by Gary Dauberman. This is only the first film he has directed. He has also written several scripts from other horror films from the Conjuring film series.In the film, Paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) have placed the possessed Annabelle doll closed in their artifact space, where the doll, together with other demonic objects, can no longer harm the world.
When the Warrens have to leave their home and leave their daughter Judy (McKenna Grace) and the demonic room safe with the nanny Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman), the Annabelle doll seems to attract many demonic forces. Judy, Mary and Mary her friend are so in the witty presence of demonic beings, who are looking for a soul or a demonic object with which they can connect, in order to harm humanity again. The girls have to stay in control of the demons and keep them in the house until the Warrens return.That this is only Gary Dauberman's first work as a director is fortunately not reflected in how the film was portrayed. He has created a good horror atmosphere and furthermore portrayed the horror moments well. Many moments unfortunately seem familiar. It seems that Gary Dauberman has focused a lot on directing the film, but seems to have forgotten to come up with an original story for the film. Many horror moments from this film often simply resemble some custom copied moments from other horror films. Even from horror films in which Gary Dauberman himself co-wrote the film scripts. Many horror moments in this film are placed in the story as well as not too original, because usually they only build up after a loud jump scare without any further real meaning.The entire film is almost entirely set in a location in the house of the Warrens, where various demons and evil spirits try to do something to the girls. Many of these quay creatures have been put forward in the film with beautiful costumes and make-up effects, but apart from a few simple jump scares you don't get to know much about them. This movie looks like you are walking through a haunted house just like the characters. It almost seems as if with this film they are trying to introduce the various evil creatures to the viewers in order to make their own spin-off film in the future for the Conjuring film series.The acting in the film is well done, but the bad script makes the characters in the film a bit stupid about making cliché mistakes that stupid characters often make in a horror film, so that you as a viewer don't really care about them. The larger cast members Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have more of a cameo in this film.",Annabelle Comes Home
104,deepakdst,Finally the real Annabelle,9,3 July 2019,"After a very long time, this movie shows you the really power of this simple doll. Previous films only gived few scary moments of real power of Annabelle but this movie you should see if you wanna Annabelle possess you.
But the ending is somewhat weak, I mean it was quiet easy to defeat Annabelle.
Movie's runtime needed to be extended.",Annabelle Comes Home
105,Darkjak007,Miss me? No,5,21 May 2021,"Directed by Gary Duberman Annabelle Comes Home see the return to the current timeline as The Annabelle doll is now in the possession of the warrans a year later we cut to warrens getting ready to leave for a another job while they leave their daughter Judy at home with he babysitter Mary. Eventually babysitters friend Daniela shows up and chooses to open Annabelle case and tithe same start all over again. What this film suffers on is the characters, The warrens aren't even really relevant to this story they're absent for the whole movie and you're stuck with these teenagers and Judy. Mary is nothing special it's just your typical babysitter supposed to be some kind of thing going on between her and this guy Bob who randomly shows up at the house it's honestly really pointless doesn't and he doesn't contribute anything to the movie. There's a scene where he's being chased by this hell hound and then he just shows up again out of nowhere like, where was he the entire time just running around in the fog. Daniela give someone a reason why she does what she does it's not really believable or justified. She's just not that interesting of a character and you just spent a lot of time with her messing around with everything. Judy's probably the only redeeming character in the film. She quite and not very expressive which make since giving she made fun of because of her parents. They show more into the lives of the warren house and how having these kind of parents can actually affect a child's life. It is interesting concept and she really does know a far amount about the things I this house and pull her weight in the film. It's just a disappointment however that you're in the house with all these cursed artifacts but for the longest time nothing happens and it just pans out the the duration of the first half of the movie.it's just a girls talking and Daniela snooping around the artifact room. Nothing happens until it's night time and the whole the first hour of your movie take place during the day. This is also the third movie made about this doll it doesn't need to exist at this point after Annabelle creation explained the origin of it. This is the type of movie that could've been used to explain a whole other phenomenon. Annabelle eventually releases several spirits in the house you only see them briefly it makes you wish that you got something more with these spirits as opposed to the same thing again.",Annabelle Comes Home

108,SyoKennex,Should have stuck with the plot premises of the second,7,30 September 2020,"It is almost October which means Halloween is here (in my world, at least) and it is time to open up the vaults of horror, kick back, and terrorise myself.So, part of what I want to do is start finishing up the film series I've begun watching over the years, using it as an opportunity to close up chapters. So, for this (almost) October, I opted for Annabelle Comes Home having seen the first two already and knowing I have to finish off The Conjuring series (of which Annabelle is linked into, with Coming Home being the seventh part of TC series).I am not the biggest fan of the Annabelle series. The first one was pretty boring, the second one was pretty good for generic jump scare horror, and this third one is.. Pretty mediocre. However, I hate dolls, I despite little porcelain archaic dolls, so this genuinely terrified me to the core. Plot wise, however, it was the same as so many other ghost/demon horror films. Someone does something they're not meant to, everyone fights to survive, and then they have a cute ending either way if people die or not.They have good tension throughout the film, Dauberman did very good with creating a very on-edge atmosphere during some scenes; this was not the case for the entire movie, however, and it was a bit of a let down for some scenes to be so adrenaline fuelling and others to fall flat.It's a generic pretty boring demon film, the same as all the others that have come before it with 0 plot but yeah, this film did scare me a lot and definitely a good watch if you really hate dolls.

I would say it's kind of tame and cute for a ""horror"" movie, probably aimed at teens as the cast for the most part is kids and teens.The acting is ok and direction, cinematography etc are good. I remembered McKenna Grace from the amazing Haunting of Hill House, funny how the same actors - kids mostly - appear on every other horror movie these days. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga appear a bit more than briefly, making this movie seem a bit ""bigger"" than it actually is.One thing I did not like was one character who did all the things people are not supposed to do in a horror movie.

I've always loved horror and definitely his movies. For me, this Annabelle movie might be the weakest of the franchise. I didn't not feel that there was enough story to really entertain. I caught that a bit with La Llorona too although I felt this Annabelle movie had even less story. Part of what drew me to James Wan's movies were the stories and attachment to the characters. Producers need to go back and focus on the storyline more rather than just throwing a bunch of things out there, hoping it works.

118,TuesdayThe17th,Should be rated PG-13,5,10 October 2019,"Good filmmaking from Dauberman, this movie is fun and watchable but ultimately it's childish and not scary. The idea is like i said a lot of fun and the movie moves along briskly. However, when the credits roll you are left feeling unfulfilled. Your itch for a good scary horror movie, bloodless or not, is left unscratched. I have no idea how this movie got an R rating but because of it the viewer goes in with a different sort of view which actually probably helps the movie as far as the set up of the events. We are expecting something real scary so we are kept on our toes through out. The film meanders a bit in the third act and starts to become repetative and a bit dull, but then it somewhat pulls it back together for the final 5 minutes to give us a happy ending that soothes us to sleep in bed afterwards. Overall it's a decent piece of cinema and for Dauberman's directorial debut it isn't half bad.

121,pinkarray,"I can sum this movie up in three words ""I don't care""",3,21 August 2019,"I'm a fan of the Conjuring movies. I liked all of the ones I've seen but this one by far is the most disappointing. I refused to see Annabelle and The Nun after hearing how mediocre they were so I don't know if it's worse than them but this is definitely the worst of all the Conjuring films I've seen.First of all, instead of Lorraine and Walter, the focus is shifted to Judy and we almost never see her parents, making me wonder where are the parents? What are they up to?It's too bad because Judy is poor as a main character. She was fine as a side character but I never thought of her as a character that can hold her own. Here, she's now 11 years old adjusting to middle school. Because of changes, she's withdrawn and sulky in the beginning. We also see that she's an intuitive character, able to know what's going on in other peoples' minds. Though, she's really just a bland, contrived protagonist, making me wish Lorraine and Walter were the protagonists instead. Like how does pointing a cross at a ghost make them go away?Like the whole story is just stupid, we got a boring protagonist who barely does anything due to the fact that she's just an innocent child who can't do anything about the ghosts. She had no reason to be the protagonist when Lorraine and Walter could've done much more than her. A stupid, rebellious teen who caused the story to kick off in the first place by her own rebellious actions when she snuck into the creepy room while cooking a freaking birthday cake, opened the glass Annabelle was in, basically releasing her and burning the cake. What's even more surprising is that she found the key while putting down a picture of Jesus for no reason.Now I see why this film didn't do so well. I don't recommend going to see it.

126,totalovrdose,Less 'Meh!' was Needed and More Annabelle for this to be Better,4,13 May 2020,"There are some good films in the Conjuring Universe ~ this however, isn't one of them. That could be the end of the review, though I will go into further details, beginning firstly with the good.The film opens with Ed and Lorraine Warren, reprised by Wilson and Farmiga, who are as entertaining and likable as usual. They occupy less than 10% of this feature, their central purpose being to introduce how the doll came into their possession, after which it was locked in the glass vault we see in The Conjuring. They then leave the house for...reasons (this was either never explained or I dropped off - neither of which is a good sign), and their daughter, Judy (Mckenna Grace) is put under the care of friend and babysitter Mary-Ellen (Madison Iseman), whose bestie Daniela (Katie Sarife) accompanies her.From that moment on, the girls are the central characters, each receiving equal screen time and having good development, growing as characters as the film comes to an end. Judy is the young, religious girl, whose peers at school have recognized that her family, for lack of a better phrase, fight ghosts, and predictably, she is made fun of, with other students blatantly terrified of her. At the same time, she is coming to terms with the gift she inherited from her mom, to interact with spirits. Daniela on the other hand, is the strong, rebellious girl, on the outside at least, who is dealing with a traumatic death in the family, which she feels responsible for. Finally, Mary-Ellen is the diligent young woman who lacks confidence and has asthma. Yeah, scratch what I said earlier - her character receives the least amount of depth.As this is a horror movie, we have to talk about the scares, or, more aptly the jump scares. These are occasionally executed well, with a couple of nice surprises that do cause a jolt, and though the final confrontation is about as scary as an episode of Star Wars Rebels, it is still entertaining, with some of the dead from previous Annabelle films making an appearance during the narrative. (This is the part where I shift into talking about the negatives) For the most part however, the 'scares' are either predictable or just plain 'meh!', some of which have been recycled from previous entries (the doll that randomly moves around; the TV remote that goes missing; the girl who gets dragged out of bed...). Furthermore, the star of the show, Annabelle, has her screen time occasionally stolen by an assortment of other malevolent spirits that she conjures. The reason this spin-off was created is because of Annabelle's popularity; to have her share the stage with other ghouls, most of whom have no background, is an insult to her character. Not only this, the sense of sustained threat that should accompany a horror film like this is entirely absent, as I was never fully convinced of the 'danger' the characters were in.Annabelle Comes Home clocks in at almost two hours, and unlike The Conjuring 2, which was longer, and well-paced, a lot of the time, this installment feels padded out, as sometimes it is, well...boring, with characters sitting around, talking. This does go into cringe-inducing territory like 'you have to woo her, man!'. Michael Cimino's character 'Bob' is another example of this, as the boy next door with a crush on Mary-Ellen, appearing to be comic-relief, and tonally changing the film even more.Additionally, though Judy appears courageous, having a unique understanding of spirits, the other characters, despite seeing the warning signs and the ghosts wandering around, make some of the dumbest decisions known to man. One moment, Mary-Ellen is staring at a ghost as it stares back at her - I mean, what is she waiting for; run Forest, run! Speaking of, her character only has an asthma attack when the plot calls for it. If her asthma was as systemic as the script would want you to believe, initially indicating that any form of anxiety may cause a reaction, she would require her inhaler more frequently.The film includes some good practical and computer-generated effects, though these don't add much to the horror elements, considering the contrived nature of the plot. I had just come off Annabelle Creation the night earlier, which had generated a far deeper sense of dread, with genuinely good scares, making Annabelle more menacing.

It may not be the scariest one, but I found it the most interesting. We get to see a little more of all the artifacts in the do not enter room of the Warren home. It was nice seeing Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga in this, even if they weren't the main stars. It helped solidify the story lines and connect all the films. Also, I read that this movie takes place at the exact same time as the first 'Conjuring' movie which I thought was neat. Madison Iseman has been great in everything I've seen her in, so hopefully she'll become more prominent.The third 'Annabelle' is not ground breaking by any means, but it's a well made suspenseful horror with some killer 70's tunes.",Annabelle Comes Home

131,manuelasaez,Another horrible entry in a horrible series,3,19 September 2019,"This movie was garbage. Plain and simple. Horror by committee, it was made for young kids and teenagers, the easily entertained, and those that have zero taste in movies and need something to fill the void. The acting was serviceable, but it was the only redeemable quality about this otherwise travesty of a movie. Everything about it was just bad, from the special effects to the script, and you can easily tell that this movie was made with very little love or respect for its audience. It was made to fill a hollow slot in a movie release schedule.Lastly, I absolutely despise horror movies with happy endings. Why would anyone go back to a house where such horrible things happened to you? It really irks me to no end that American audiences put up with this garbage. Horror is not to make you feel better about yourself. It's to make you feel despair and sadness. This type of ""everyone survives and had a party at the end"" horror movies are the worst of the absolute worst and deserve no one's time or money.Please do not support this trash film making. It's an embarrassment and a completely disrespect to the genre. I am utterly disgusted that I watched this movie until the end, but I'm hoping I will save some of you from having to suffer the same as I did.

132,MinistryofDoom,Standard Haunted House Flick No More Frightening than an Episode of Goosebumps,7,18 August 2019,"As a fan of the Warrens and of course The Conjuring franchise (I loved The Nun), I was very much looking forward to this film. I enjoyed the previous films featuring the demented Annabelle doll and hoped that this one would be every bit as creepy as Annabelle: Creation, if not moreso.Well, while I enjoyed this film, I fell that it was much more tame than the previous chapters of the Annabelle story, and certainly lighter than the main Conjuring films, and not nearly as frightening as The Nun, which I feel was the most extreme of the lot thus far. For one thing, it's a standard haunted house film. We've seen these many times before. The plot is formulaic and as you'd expect, it involves a baby-sitter, her friend, and of course a young innocent girl who is the pin that holds everything together. This chapter of the series was no more frightening than an episode of Goosebumps. There wasn't any gore nor any deaths. The characters spent 95% of the film running around a house, screaming, and trying to escape from, and contain, various spirits and ghosts under the lead of Annabelle, the creepy looking doll. The room that the Warrens used to imprison all of their haunted items looks like an old curio shop you'd find along the Atlantic City boardwalk and for a room so full of evil and terror, the most that emerged from it were shrieking ghouls, random things dropping from shelves, or various knick-knacks turning on and off by themselves. It just didn't feel frightening enough. Annabelle, who is imprisoned inside a glass box with big giant sign stuck to it reading, ""Warning Positively Do Not Open"" is supposed to contain the most malevolent demon spirit that the Warrens have ever encountered. Yet the most that it does is appears seated in rocking chairs or lying under a bed in a room somewhere. If this thing was so evil (apparently more than Valak the Demon Nun?) surely it would have done more than just frightening kids with harmless apparitions. Overall, I don't feel like this film deserved an R-rating. It just wasn't scary. It felt like a filler in the timeline to move the franchise along to it's next major entry.",Annabelle Comes Home

135,lnvicta,A serviceable conclusion to the Annabelle trilogy.,5,29 September 2019,"I had no expectations for this movie. Annabelle was a lazy cash-grab of a movie, and I use ""movie"" in the loosest sense of the word. Annabelle: Creation at least had a plot, characters, and a decent director, but it was largely predictable and not very scary. Annabelle Comes Home has elements of both of its prequels.The setup is well done. The opening sequence is the most effective in the movie: We follow Ed and Lorraine Warren driving the Annabelle doll back to their house, and their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. It's pretty tense; you expect them to go for the easy jump scare, but they linger on unsettling shots instead to let the tension build. Once Ed and Lorraine exit the movie about 20 minutes in, it turns into a generic ""people running around a haunted house"" for the remainder of the film - the people in this case being the Warrens' daughter, her babysitter, and the babysitter's friend.There's no real structure to it either. Gary Dauberman is a first-time director, and you can tell. He's not awful by any means, but a lot of the movie is flat-looking with no distinct visual style. There are a couple of creative ideas, like the reflecting TV and the color wheel that lights up the room, but they're not executed with any finesse.There's never a sense of danger either. The babysitter's friend decides to go in the Warren's artifacts room and opens the glass box with Annabelle for some stupid reason. It's explained later on, but it's still such a dumb decision that you have a hard time feeling sympathy for her. Also, the demon can do literally anything. It can mess with electronics and move pretty much anything in the house. Basically, it could kill everyone at any point in time. But it doesn't because there needs to be a movie. So instead, the demon plays pranks on them for an hour before actively trying to kill them. There aren't any firm rules established on what the demon can and can't do, so we really don't know what to be afraid of. Unless you consider cheap jump scares scary that is, because there are plenty of those. Not as many as I expected, though, I'll give the movie that.Overall, mediocre movie. Better than Annabelle 1, not as visually interesting as Annabelle: Creation - it's just blah. It's the horror movie version of empty calories.",Annabelle Comes Home
136,snowfre,"The strangest installment in the Conjuring Universe yet, but for sure not the worst",5,17 March 2020,"In ""Annabelle Comes Home"", we are once again witnesses to how Annabelle, arguably the most famous doll in horror fiction since Chucky, brings havoc into the everyday life of the Warrens. Demonologist coupe Lorraine (Farmiga) and Ed (Wilson) brings the not so charming doll to their house for safe keeping but when their daughter Judy (Grace) is to be babysit by Mary (Iseman) and her friend Daniela (Sarife), their curiosity leads to the unleashing of Annabelle's sinister powers. While it's fun, and in a way strange, to see that not even the Warren home is immune to the menacing doll's evil energy, the film fails to build up a major feeling of threat and insecurity. Relying completely on jump scares, the writers of ""Annabelle Comes Home"" seems to be more interested in showcasing various spirits and objects from past (unseen) missions of the Warrens, leaving Annabelle beside the spotlight. During the making of the movie, the real-life Lorraine Warren passed away, and she is deservingly so commemorated in the film which ends with a rarely happy ending for a horror movie; I don't know if her passing affected the film's direction but from start to finish it suffers from a lack of a credible plot threat to the main characters. Annabelle is watered down to nothing more than an annoying sorceress doll that sees an opportunity to haunt Judy, Mary, and Daniele for one night. I must say however, that the cuteness, and cosiness of the film brings an unexpected warmth to the film, and that makes ""Annabelle Comes Home"" stand out a bit from other recent horror movies. While the climatic ending was over with more or less quickly, there is some entertainment to the film, and the somewhat - I don't know - campy (?!) acting brings some - weird - charm to this installment in the ever expanding Conjuring Universe.",Annabelle Comes Home

As with all his stories in the ""Conjuring universe"" the flat pack storyline, predictable plot and inevitable twists are all present and correct.Another key component of all Wan's storylines is his apparent dislike of women. Nuns, brides, Llorona, little girls, he seems to hate them with a passionate misogyny, dressing all his female characters with a cloak of evil.So this is a bog standard piece of crap from the conjuring sausage factory. A production line of crap horror films that regurgitate pretty much the same ideas in slightly different forms.It's hard to say how bad this film is because it's virtually indistinguishable from every other Wan film ever produced.

139,HorrorFan1984,Annabelle Comes Home,8,13 April 2020,"The Warren's return to the series and no one is safe when Annabelle Comes Home.We take off from where the first Annabelle started with the nurses who were in possession of the evil doll. Ed and Lorraine pick it up from them and take it home but not before an evil spirit jumps inside of it along the way. They manage however to lock it up in their basement artifacts room, containing the evil in the glass container. Fast forward one year later and we see their young daughter Judy adjusting to her parents being called frauds in the newspaper after the events of the exorcism in The Conjuring. We also meet Judy's likeable babysitter Mary Ellen and her troublemaker friend with a heart Daniela who is interested in checking out the artifacts room.Daniela gets into the artifact room and lets Annabelle out of the glass container, thereby releasing the demon to run amok in that room full of evil items. The demon takes form as Daniela's father, the Ferryman figure, creepy bride from hell, and a werewolf. Each form ends up attacking Judy, Daniela, Mary Ellen, and Mary Ellen's love interest Bob who comes over to woo her. Can the kids put Annabelle back in her timeout case?Annabelle 3 scared me. Watching this alone in the dark freaked me out more than the other two films in this series, and that was really great to see. There is such eerie imagery down in that basement full of evil/possessed artifacts. Not only do we get the Annabelle doll, but also the evil monkey figurine and the wedding dress, etc. The evil bride demon was creepy, the Ferryman gave me chills, and Daniela's dad coming back to haunt her was super effective. There were so many other attackers in this movie, the Annabelle doll really did take a backseat to the horror trapping the kids in the house.In the acting department, we get Conjuring heroes Vera Farming and Patrick Wilson in to reprise their roles as the Warren's. It was great seeing them again. Young talent McKenna Grace plays their daughter Judy and she was really good. Madison Iseman was a standout as the sweet yet fierce babysitter Mary Ellen, with Katie Sarife and Michael Cimino doing a good job as well.Annabelle Comes Home is a fantastic sequel in this trilogy, likely to be the last of this series sadly. I found it really unnerving at times in the best way possible if you're a horror fan. Perhaps the best of the Annabelle films.8/10",Annabelle Comes Home
140,bastille-852-731547,"Solid, Well-Directed Conjuring Spin-Off",7,26 June 2019,"While I like the original two ""Conjuring"" movies, I have not cared much for the spin-offs in the franchise that I have seen. I decided to see this one in theaters because unlike the other Conjuring spin-offs, it has a genuinely unique premise (the Warrens' artifacts all become possessed by Annabelle.) I was also intrigued of the prospect of the Warrens coming back. While it's not perfect, this is a pretty solid horror film that should please fans of the franchise.First-time director Gary Dauberman makes a strong debut behind the camera, managing to craft inventive scares that play around with audience expectations. Even though they are a key part of this franchise, I have never been all that crazy about the loud jump-scares in these films, mainly because I view them as a generally lazy and uninspired way to startle viewers in lieu of creating genuine dread and psychological terror. While the film still has some jump-scares that don't really work, the horror in the film does reach more efficacious and creative heights than that. There are also some moments in the film when the viewer thinks a jump-scare might happen, but it actually does not, which helps balance surprise with suspense during the film's duration. Dauberman uses audience perceptions of space, color and light to create some interesting scares with the Warrens' artifacts. The film's lighting is superb, managing to make the film's aesthetic be both clear and ominous at the same time. While the film's sets are somewhat minimalist, that works to the narrative's advantage. This also makes the horror seem more authentic.The writing is a cut above many of the ""Conjuring"" films, although some minor plot holes and inconceivable decisions by major characters are still present. The film's score is chilling yet powerful. It's great to see the Warrens back as well, even though they are not exactly the primary characters of this movie. Despite some flaws, this is a good and fairly creative addition to the Conjuring universe. 7/10",Annabelle Comes Home
141,hoernkeem,"Annabelle Comes Home (2019, Gary Dauberman) The Warren daughter takes center stage as this demonic doll can't find a good plot",3,11 February 2021,"Annabelle Comes Home (2019, Gary Dauberman)
Dauberman is the writer of 'Annabelle', 'Annabelle: Creation' and 'The Nun'. That devotion to The Conjuring Universe was rewarded with this project as his directorial debut. This is, of course, is the third film surrounding the possessed doll known as Annabelle. This starts with the Warrens, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, from 'The Conjuring' films as they take position of the doll Annabelle and bring her back to their quaint Connecticut home where they reside with their teenage daughter. We first met Annabelle in 'The Conjuring' and since then we have seen her in a story from recent history before the Warrens had her as well as a story about her creation from a period of earlier American history. This is the first time we are being shown a story with her after the Warrens took possession of her. Nominally this isn't a story about the older Warrens. Instead it is a story of the daughter, Judy, played by McKenna Grace. The Warrens go out of town leaving their daughter in the care of babysitter Mary Ellen, played by Madison Iseman, who is most notable as Bethany in the new 'Jumanji' films. They are warned not to go into the locked room that houses numerous malevolent artifacts. Mary Ellen's friend Daniela, played by relative unknown Katie Sarife, arrives to hang out and she invariably winds up entering the room. We think it might be just cocksure thrill seeking, but we find out there is actually a deeper motivation to her actions. All might have been fine until she opens Annabelle's locked glass case. The night goes downhill for the three girls from there.
This was an extremely basic ""horror"" movie. Every move in it is very cliched and telegraphed. Also despite being an Annabelle story this seemed like more of a potential setup for other stories as the objects in the room are seen, talked about and in some cases used. They all wound up there via some some chilling story and that easily could translate into movie after movie after movie if they so chose. Easiest setup ever. This pretty much just goes along and doesn't do much interesting but even worse it doesn't do much that's scary. If you go back and look at the movie once the credits role I want you to add up what was actually scary in the movie. What horrific events occurred? Let's just say it is a lot less than something calling itself a horror movie should aspire to. I would say this franchise is running out of steam, but then I never thought it had any. I have not been a fan of the 'Annabelle' series at all, and it is easy to see why when they all came from the same writer. I would skip this movie and just stick to the core Conjuring films which are much more original and enjoyable.

The best part about seeing it in 4DX was that the movements mimicked the horrific things happening on screen, for example when somebody was stabbed, something in the back of the chair thrusts into your back as if you too had been stabbed. If I had seen this in 2D, I probably would have rated it 8 stars rather than 9.The plot was a bit weak, simply because it seemed like the movie was an unnecessary expansion to the franchise and therefore the plot was forced, but the horror movie techniques were brilliant; the suspense was built very well indeed and left me feeling ridiculously on edge, and the jump scares were very effective.I highly recommend that you seen this film, and, if you get the chance to see it in 4DX, then do it because you will not regret it!",Annabelle Comes Home

145,theredsky,Annabelle Comes Home Review,4,22 July 2019,"Annabelle Comes Home is fine. It's not great but it's not bad. Here are the negatives. The film starts to become over reliant on jump scares in the second half. Every other scene you are waiting for that jump scare and then boom jump scare. This leads to the film being generally not scary and I don't mean just jump scares. They aren't a lot of concepts or ideas presented that are genuinely terrifying. That's why films like The Shining, Get Out, and The Exorcist are legitimately terrifying because of the ideas that are presented in those films. That's not to say there aren't interesting concepts presented in the film but that's about it for them, concepts which leads to my next point. There are ideas presented in this film that really aren't explored a lot. The Chinese soldier armor, the TV that shows a couple seconds into the future, and the Cymbal Monkey are really interesting and cool but they aren't explored a lot. The scenes with these objects are great but they are only on screen for about a minute or two and yes I know there might be films about those objects in the future but I wish we got to learn a little more about those objects. Katie Sarife and Madison Iseman didn't do that great of a job in this film. In some scenes they were decent but in others they weren't even trying. The boyfriend subplot is just kinda dumb and he is only there to save a character in one scene and that is it. The film is tonally inconsistent. About a minute after they defeat Annabelle, the main characters make jokes about going to homecoming. Some scenes are undercut by jokes and it's obnoxious. Here are the positives. I think the first 30 minutes of the film is fantastic. It's paced really well, it's creepy, and the performances are really good. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do a great job in every scene they are in. Mckenna Grace was also pretty good in this film. There are a couple of moments where she isn't trying but for the most part she does a good job. As I said earlier, some of the ideas and concepts presented in this film are really interesting and I hope we get to learn more about them in the future. There are a handful of good scares in the film but they come from the first half instead of the second half. The film does build up tension really well and makes the somewhat smart choice to cut out the music in these moments. Unfortunately, these moments of tension are undercut by random jump scares. You do get to see the demon towards the end of the film and the makeup on it looks pretty good. The cinematography is fine but there are a handful of really good shots in the film. Overall, Annabelle Comes Home has a fantastic beginning but starts to rely on jump scares instead of diving into new and interesting concepts. I give Annabelle Comes Home a 5/10.",Annabelle Comes Home

153,domtaylor,This franchise isn't as dead as I thought.,6,23 July 2019,"'Annabelle Comes Home' is a definite step in the right direction for 'The Conjuring Universe'. It's not great, but it's a huge step up from the likes of the first 'Annabelle' (2014), 'The Nun' (2018), and 'The Curse Of La Llorona' (2019), proving that there may still be some life in this 'universe' after all. The biggest reason for this is that, unlike the aforementioned films, it doesn't solely rely on predictable jump scares, signposted by lengthy periods of silence, for its frights. Instead, it actually tries to build a scary and tense atmosphere and, while this isn't as successful as it could have been, it's still far more effective than obvious jump scares every two seconds. In several instances it actually plays on your expectation of this too, building you up for a jump but then subverting it, which shows that perhaps Dauberman knows where the series has been going wrong. The three leads all give good performances as well and their characters actually have some development, which has been lacking in the franchise for a while, so you care about them a bit more and are therefore further invested in the narrative. Saying that, there is a lot of build up to the actual 'haunted house horror stuff' which brings a lot of fake outs in the first half and this can get a bit tedious. Also, as the story and stakes are extremely small-scale, the scares aren't as tight as they should be, and in the end it sort of feels more like an over-extended 'Conjuring' short than a full feature length 'Annabelle' sequel. Thankfully though, it's well-made and decently entertaining throughout thanks to Dauberman trying something different with the scares, and the good characters and performances. It does, however, get a little repetitive, isn't particularly 'scary', and in the end doesn't really amount to much, but thankfully it's far better than I was expecting and shows that this franchise isn't as dead as I thought. That end credits song is a really bizarre choice, though. 6/10",Annabelle Comes Home

I have to adjust the volume 100 times because the ""scary"" parts are volume 100, but dialogue/talking is at volume 20. Had to practically mute this dumb movie because I didn't want my neighbors to wake up! Yes! It's THAT LOUD! Doorbell rings, evil ghost comes, the volume jumps from 10 to 100 and I have to jump to click mute because I can't just turn volume from 20 to 8 in 1 second. Mute button is fastest way to silence the LOUD parts. This movie is ruined because of that! Otherwise, it's be a decent movie, despite the dumb girls! Garbage babysitter, dumb friend of babysitter, and VERY DUMB PRETEEN GIRL who knows about evil spirits but still CHASES THEM?! Really?! What world does a preteen girl chase a scary lady in white?! And I just muted the tv again because a music box just CLICKED and it was extremely loud! GLAD I DIDNT PAY MONEY TO SEE THIS STUPID MOVIE! Pirate! I hate dumb movies that rely on loud music or loud sounds to scare or whatever! Ruined the movie. It's either Leave volume very low so the extremely loud sounds aren't waking neighbors at 3 am, or adjust the dang volume 200 times every time it has a jump scare. So dumb! I can't hear these idiots talking and STILL, the sounds are loud! Piano is loud, glass is loud, screaming is loud, DOORBELL IS LOUD! I wanted the Danielle girl to die, or whatever her dumb name is! But the idiots making this film are dumb for relying on loud volume to scare people! Also, Hell Hound IS a case they worked on, so the fools saying werewolf is dumb, it still follows the concept of the other ghosts from the room.JUMP SCARES RUIN FILMS!

163,tresm87,"A solidly creepy entry into the Annabelle spinoff series thats full of effectively executed scares, though utilizes the same formula as other films in the Conjuring universe.",8,26 June 2019,"7.8/10 The third film in the Annabelle series marks Gary Dauberman's directorial debut and it's a good start for the seasoned and acclaimed horror writer. This story does echo familiar with certain thematics/aspects that we've seen in this film universe, with youth being the focal point surrounded by the paranormal phenomenon. The plot does take a little bit of time to develop and maybe spends too much time trying to develop some of the characters before anything really exciting does happen. Once things do start going bump, it does get very fast paced and thoroughly foreboding at times all while staying grounded with the plot.The overall setting of the Warren house fits the particular story very well and adds nice substance with the artifacts room. The late 60s/early 70s ambience is perfectly done and sets a terrific tone, and the lighting/ camera work is phenomenal as usual for the series. There are many different callbacks to other films in the universe with familiar entities as well as a few new very creepy ones making frightful sporadic appearances. It almost acts as a conjuring universe greatest hits if you will which isn't a bad thing and was actually quite fun. The finale finishes off the film in excellent fashion with with a fantastic culmination of events, and once again I was left wanting more for the series, be it another Annabelle or the upcoming conjuring 3.Some of the scares also get a little bit cliché at times but they do enough to keep them fresh a majority of the time. Overall this gets the conjuring universe back on track after the last 2 middling to decent films released (The Nun/La LLorona). If you enjoy the series/universe, this is a must see.",Annabelle Comes Home
164,boris_unanimate,Extremely Dumb Movie For Extremely Dumb People,3,3 October 2020,"I have seen all of the extended Conjuring universe movies (Devil knows why though), and I have yet to come across an interesting story or at least a scary scene. 'Annabelle Comes Home' is just another cheap cash grab that relies heavily on the idiocy of the target audience and loud jumpscares. If we don't expect or demand better from horror movies, we ain't getting anything worthwhile.The acting is decent, the actors do their best with the dumb story and inane dialogue they got. I laughed some and yelled a lot at the movie, so it wasn't as bad and boring as 'Annabelle'. The cinematography and set design is the only thing I actually liked, but it's not enough. I hope one day this trend will end, and horror directors will care about creating good movies instead of single-serving shlock.",Annabelle Comes Home
165,WisdomsHammer,"So I guess the new Conjuring monster is Daniela, the angsty teen.",6,1 January 2021,"This is more a haunted house or scary museum tour than an actual story, and honestly, I'd be fine with that. I like scary movies as long as they're scary, even if the story is weak.The problem I have is how they took a girl who is desperate to come to terms with the death of her father and wants so badly to see him again that she'll do just about anything - and turned her into someone I just wanted to die because she was so evil. She almost burns the house down after not watching the oven, she deliberately does anything she is warned not to do, and when Judy screams she does nothing to go help. This is the entire first half of the movie, by the way - scene after scene of showing what a monster Daniela is, before finally showing us the real monsters we came to see. But by this point, I'm more scared of Daniela than any of the cursed objects because she's going to get us all killed. If that was the writers intention, I think it was a bad idea. If that wasn't their intention then they're not very good writers.The thing is, Daniela's not evil, and they eventually try to make that clear, but by then it's too late. The writers make her the bad guy, and they really drive the point home by having her go above and beyond to break every rule, as well as break and enter, and it really hurts the movie because she's not the monster I came to see, even when they turn her into one.Just about everything else about the movie I thought was good, scary fun, although it didn't have a lot of meat behind it because, like I said, it's like going into a haunted house where you encounter one scary thing after another where the purpose is to scare you rather than to tell a story.I think this might have worked better as an anthology where individual stories were told about some of the scary items in the Warren's museum and then they all got loose somehow, Annabelle the conduit that makes them more active or something - but not because a grieving, angsty, bratty teen inadvertently yet purposely lets her out.I still like this movie and the whole Conjuring universe, but I'd rather they concentrate on the monsters and not wait til the movie's half over to show them. You want Daniela to be a monster? Leave her locked in that room, then commit her to an asylum or something after they finally find her driven out of her mind by what she's done.",Annabelle Comes Home

It's a nice connection to the Conjuring Universe and knowing that they are there somewhere. I also really liked all the young cast, especially McKenna Grace, who is good in pretty much everything she's in. The spirits were also really creepy, especially the people with the coin eyes and the woman in the wedding dress. It's overall a really creepy movie and for the most part the characters are fleshed out just a bit but enough for you to understand where they were coming from. Also I really liked Bob. He was in some pretty funny moments and was great. The Cinematography was also really good, and this is overall a well directed movie. I also really liked how at the end it payed tribute to the real Lorraine Warren.

Their roles were mostly limited to extended guest appearances and the real stars of the movie are the 2 young women and their little girl Judy.The entire plot is set during a single day unlike the previous films and this time the trouble is also self inviting.

The film starts out well but then it just throws everything we've established for years out the window in the name ofwhat? Girlpower flick? Comedy? Bathos and ridiculing of the guy character throughout the film who's largely only comedic relief. IN A HORROR MOVIE?! ... What?! Why??! This is dumb.Film tries to be funny when it shouldn't, we got a 9-10 year old girl fighting the super evil bad guys who've given her parents a run through HELL for years. Portrayals of such evil and monstrous tales that we still remember vividly. But who cares. Lets just portray the stuff we're used to seeing and fearing and remove all sense of dread ... COMPLETELY.
Anyone can fight a demon now! Who needs faith, or vatican permission or experience of bibles. 1 little cross and you're all good.Are you kidding me?How is this getting 8-9-10 ratings? Are you actually serious? People rating this higher than the actual James Wan Conjuring films, masterpieces and genuinely scary I might add, clearly dont understand horror at all.This film is the worst of the Annabelle films, because it tries to be funny instead of being creepy and ultimatley makes a mockery of established Conjuring lore.This is supposed to be a ""supposedly"" real inspired tales made cinema. This has made these films notorious when imagining, when analysing and even watching because of the background factor telling you "" The Warrens claim this was real""And here we are, spitting on the whole franchise with this stupid bathos spin-off.Please be the last movie.

172,Matin_Shwany,Absolutely Worth It,8,25 January 2020,"Annabelle Comes Home, Annabelle wants to play hide and seek, Patrcik Wilson and Vera Farmiga back again, the opening scenes when i saw them i was so relieved to see them together again, even we won't see them much in the movie just the introduction and the ending, its better than the other two Annabelle movies i think, you will have some peaceful moments that's what i liked about this one, even it felt kinda fun to me some, the kids are playing with the doll while Daddy and Mommy gone, the script is so good that's what it makes different from the others, obviously you will get the horror but it looked more stressful to me than having more jump scares i think there wasn't many jump scares according to others, i was just stressed really when the camera closes up in the face in the dark atmosphere i felt worried and nervous what am i gonna see next? So be careful with this part take care of yourself, the colors are so bright great cinematography, i love Patrick Wilson and i believe in him when he's in for a movie, james wan did it again every time his trace is left on the movie, combination of (Patrick wilson) and (Vera Farmiga) with (James wan) this is all what it means to me i believe in every movie their names are attached with, The movie is dedicated to Lorraine Warren (portrayed in the movie by Vera Farmiga) who passed away two months before the film's release.

176,Benslie,A surprisingly decent film,7,28 June 2019,"First of all, the pacing in this film was pretty bad. They spent a really long time focusing on the three characters that this haunting was going to happen to and in the end just made it really boring. People could argue that it's so we will care about them when everything goes down but it doesn't work or at least in my case. This also leads to a super quick ending that just wraps up awkwardly. Also, I can't hate on the film too much because it is Gary Dauberman's first time directing but I think he overkilled it with the whole tension build up during some scenes. Because there was a long build up to something it just lost its scare factor in some cases. The ending felt like three completely different films just mixed into one as if this one wouldn't make enough to make the other two. This isn't that big of a deal but to the person in charge of making the house match up with the others failed. The clothes match up it's just the house set that didn't match up. But like I said this isn't that big of a deal but it still just bugs me because I already know what the house looks like. Will give the movie props for having a great atmosphere set up though because in every scene you knew what kind of scene it was going to be. But it also loses marks for not having bright enough lighting to see what was going on in certain scenes. Everybody did decent jobs in the acting department. I thought I wasn't going to like Mckenna Grace as Judy but in the end, she did an amazing job. I also loved seeing Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga back as Ed and Lorraine. In the end, Annabelle Comes Home is actually a pretty good movie that's worth checking out. I give Annabelle Comes Home a 7.5/10.",Annabelle Comes Home

178,jackson_ro,Annabelle Comes Home,3,28 February 2020,"Love the Conjuring series and the first Annabelle film (can't remember about the 2nd one), but Annabelle Comes Home is not on the same level. The script is poor, apart from Annabelle, none of the other scares have any backstories, they feel very much piecemealed together giving the movie a bunch of sudden frights but not much depth. I think a lot of it can be blamed on the director, perhaps it is because it's his first film, but more so I just don't think horror is his forte. There are also some weird plot holes and unnecessary stuff added to the film. It's good to see the Warrens, as they add some continuity for the series, but they are hardly of any importance for the film. The fact that they use a bunch of teenagers also knocks a grade down from the film, as it is like so many other horror flicks that does not have much substance. Annabelle Comes Home fits right up that alley.",Annabelle Comes Home

180,Colbridge,It does offer up a few scares but writer turned director Gary Dauberman plays it safe and gives the audience what they expect,5,20 September 2021,"The third Annabelle film to appear in the Conjuring universe offers nothing new as this picks up where The Conjuring (2013) left off with The Warrens taking the evil doll to their home and keeping it safely under lock and key. Of course it doesn't stay there for very long as the curiosity of the Warren's babysitter gets the better of her and she stupidly releases it from it's glass case for the doll to awaken more evil spirits.While Annabelle Comes Home is not as good as Annabelle: Creation (2017) it does offer up a few scares but writer turned director Gary Dauberman plays it safe and gives the audience what they expect. With a story by series creator James Wan this probably would have been a lot more scarier had he helmed this instalment, being in my opinion one of the best directors working in the horror genre today who actually makes his films scary, but this third outing becomes too predicable and smaller in scope and ambition.For those who enjoy finding hidden references to the other movies in the Conjuring universe there are plenty to uncover here and this is all part of the fun.",Annabelle Comes Home
181,ubasarsahin,My review after my 4th watch!!,6,8 June 2021,"I remember the day I watched this movie in cinemas. It was the opening day and I'd had really high hopes since we've seen Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson in the cast.. After watching the movie, I'd had headaches. I was so disappointed and upset. That wasn't what I was expecting from the movie and then I'd become one of those haters of Annabelle Comes Home, until today.Just after watching The Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It, I decided to watch all of these Annabelle movies and am really glad I did. This time I actually, for the first time, enjoyed this movie and uppered my rating from 3 to 6! I think that's a big change and here's why I did make that change;First of all, I realized that this movie wasn't supposed to be the one that we all should fall in love with. I mean if I didn't have those big hopes, maybe I could've enjoyed this movie more on opening day and wouldn't have become a hater after all. And I also realised that the director, writers and producers have done what they really wanted to do. I think that's what matters after one point. If a filmmaker successfully does what they really want to do, that's an achievement. So, I decided to believe in that and now I want to congratulate them all.The music, the actings, costumes have all worked out for me this time. I think they did a good job on these. Still may not be the best Annabelle movie but actually I find Annabelle Comes Home enjoyable from now on. I think I am not one of those haters anymore. Cheers.",Annabelle Comes Home

185,helenbassett,Annabelle Comes Home Film Review - I Like Your Doll - Gary Dauberman Directs A Phantom Fog Of Clammy Hands,9,21 July 2019,"Annabelle we know was created with love as a doll just like any other, but the things she has seen has now warped her into a conduit for evil, as Vera Farmiga's demon hunter Lorraine Warren explains. And horror alumni Gary Dauberman directs the supernatural horror story Annabelle Comes Home around our doll, who if she isn't evil herself, certainly gets around, with misty cemeteries and the whole Conjuring case book to explore.When Lorraine and Patrick Wilson's Ed originally brought Annabelle back to their home she made the car breakdown outside a cemetery. And the phantom spirits were drawn to her. But only Lorraine can see them. At home Annabelle's potential for evil is contained within a locked blessed box, because it's never a good idea to seat a demon doll alone on a rocking chair. The one thing I would never have in my house thank you very much. But the Warrens have seen it all before, and they keep the room locked.And Annabelle fits in nicely in the (always dark) creaky old house, not exactly haunted, unless you call out the 70's design, but still capable of a scare or two. With great Cinematography by Michael Burgess and Production Design by Jennifer Spence.When the Warrens need to go away on business, young daughter Judy, played by Gifted's little poppet McKenna Grace, and developing the same spiritual gifts her mother has, (why are religious ghosts always so scary looking?), is left in the capable hands of babysitter Mary Ellen, played by Madison Iseman. She never lets the Warren's job spook her, but the creepy Annabelle is the conductor in the locked artefact room, and she always wants to play. And when Mary Ellen's friend Daniela, played by Katie Sarife, invites herself over for the evening, the demon is out of the bag, and looking for a soul. Is anybody there? All it needs is the case to be unlocked, the evil released, and a night of supernatural mayhem to commence.It's always good when watching a horror to feel unsettled and Gary Dauberman knew when to direct the scares, and although I didn't jump too much at them, the music by Joseph Bishara, coupled with the swirling fog of The Hound of The Baskervilles, and spooky special effects, amped up the tension, and my hands felt clammy throughout. Young 'Bob's got balls' Michael Cimino added comedy in a chicken coop, and his lovestruck Romeo rounded out the teenage Nancy Drew and Brady Bunch style story.Another entertaining entry in The Conjuring series with the young actors looking like they're having a lot of creepy fun. Normally I would have hidden under the duvet but in this story that focuses on Judy, I didn't fancy sharing the bed. And that being pulled along it by an unseen demon gets me every time.",Annabelle Comes Home

Those reasons are the scares and frightening scenes in the previous two were predictable but in this it is less predictable. There are also many new elements of horror that were put into this film that i have never seen before so this feels like a new feel on the whole horror theme and this is a first for me that made me feel this way. The acting and characters were great as well as the cinematics. The plot was too bland and boring and had no real meat, it was basically a simple mistake that caused a wave of other problems along the way of resolving the problem. There weren't really that many characters and most of the movie takes place in the house and is very slow paced. The first half is pretty quiet but has some slight scares here and there but when the ending and the climax comes on its gets crazy with the scares and i actually myself got scared and that very rare for me.

I've enjoyed all of the Conjuring movies and the Nun one, and I saw the Creation. They were all good. This one was not good. In fact, it was horrible. Sad really. It was sophomoric and very badly done. The story was lazy. Decent effects might have helped but there weren't any. And why did Mary Ellen tuck Judy into bed, seeing that the Annabelle doll was beside her and say nothing? That made no sense whatsoever! If you haven't don't bother.",Annabelle Comes Home

197,rustonreviews,"Just like Annabelle: Creation, ACH is a fun flick that's perfectly enjoyable for what it is.",7,5 August 2019,"In this third stand-alone adventure featuring the supernaturally possessed doll Annabelle (who by this point has become a modern horror icon for both her notorious reputation both on-screen and off), the malevolent terror that surrounds her moves to the household of renowned paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). With the Warren's absent for the night, their daughter Judy (Grace) is left under the supervision of babysitter Mary Ellen (Iseman) and her best friend Daniela (Sarife), who tags along despite no invitation. Their intended quiet night in is ruined when Daniela begins snooping around the Warren's basement, where various haunted artefacts utilized in ritualistic practices are contained, including Annabelle herself. Daniela unknowingly unleashes a malevolent presence upon the house by releasing Annabelle from her locked glass cabinet, leading to a frightful night in which the girls must contain the unleashed evil once more.Screenwriter Gary Dauberman makes his directorial debut with Annabelle Comes Home, having penned the previous two instalments in the Annabelle series as well as The Nun (2018) and The Curse of Llorona (2019). Dauberman makes a solid effort behind the camera here and crafts some genuinely creepy sequences, yet there are times where moments of suspense are squandered in exchange for clichéd, basic jump scares (there's no shortage of screaming faces popping up from out of the darkness to give you a good old easy startle), but amidst these annoyances Dauberman orchestrates some well executed chills that make up for the pitfalls. Wilson and Farmiga reprising their roles as the Warrens (albeit only for a little while) was a positive, and once again their shared chemistry remains one of the strongest elements of this whole franchise. Although the storyline runs fairly thin, it's never boring. Dauberman's screenplay feels more like an adult orientated Goosebumps adventure at times, but that's no bad thing. There's nothing new or groundbreakingly innovative to be found here, but it is a simple yet effective film that's perfectly enjoyable for what it is.",Annabelle Comes Home

It almost feels like the franchise is not the same anymore since The Nun came out. New installments are not that scary anymore like the past ones. This movie is also almost like a fantasy film with few teens messing around the warrens museum. The demons are becoming funny as well like the warewolf and the one who loves playing with coins. The warrens almost got no screen time, no family or life was in danger, whole movie is shot with just a few kids trapped inside a house like some old serial killer movies used to be. The jumpscares are not bad but definitely not special. Overall I have to say this movie was a disappointment.

Annabelle 3 tries slightly change the formula of the movies from The Conjuring Universe. During the first half builds its characters, making us to like them and understand their actions and in the second half gives us some scares as we are used but in a different way.
I don't like jump scares, however I loved how they tried to make something different and prank us with some cliches. I mean, a lot of times we think something scary will happen and then nothing happens but another times we are not expecting anything and the movie gives us a jump scare.For me is not so good as The first two main Conjuring films, but it's better than the 2 previous Annabelle movies and The Nun.

depicted in it. Good taste and reverence, while fine in real life, are not exactly what we're looking for in a horror movie however. Admittedly, there are some scares and a lot of mileage is produced from shadows and things going bump in the night - still, this fails to deliver anything really upsetting.

Also, the character's motivations for their actions are really dumb and overall the film is not well paced, as there were many times where the movie went on really slow.

If not for some ocations, where the scene is cut in the most shocking moment and then jump's to the start of suspense in another, this movie would have Conjuring 2's level of quality.
I recommend this movie, is by far the best of all the spin-offs in the saga. Greetings.",Annabelle Comes Home
224,Kristamw,Good,9,1 October 2019,"The Warren's ten-year-old daughter, Judy, has no friends because they know all about her paranormal investigating parents and the evil artifacts they keep locked safely in the basement (to protect society). While babysitting Judy, teen Mary Ellen invites her friend Daniela over to celebrate Judy's birthday. Daniela turns out to be one of those nosy teens whose curiosity about the afterlife leads her to literally unlock the evil in the basement.
Writing Quality: Good, though a lot of the common tropes are used. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but because the producers are so used to these films, it seems that they gloss over the special effects when they should zoom in and linger a bit longer to give it that more frightening feel. At first, Daniela's actions are annoying; of course, if you open the door to trouble, it will find you, as it does here. But it's her need to find peace with her dad (he died in a car accident and she was driving so she feels responsible for his death) that allows you a little bit of empathy. Just a little. The focus expands from just the Annabelle doll to a plethora of other demon-possessed artifacts, so it feels a little out there as we dive into other universes with new ""villains"", making this film feel a bit different than its predecessors.
Scare Factor: It is a scary movie with a couple of places that might startle you, but because so many of the same tropes are used, most of them don't scare. What I found really odd is that we only see ""Bee"" for a few seconds. Because she possesses the doll, one would think she would be shown more, like in ""Creation"".
Content (sex, language, & violence): No sex. Mild language, if any. Violence occurs when someone pushes a knife into someone and when a girl is tossed to the wall.
Values & Themes: Containing evil, protecting loved ones, befriending loners.
I do wish that Ed and Lorraine were shown more; we get to see them only in the opening scene and then at the very end.",Annabelle Comes Home

People will probably like this one the best because of Ed and Lorraine as well as all the different ghosts and monsters. This one only proves one thing, that Ed and Loraine are the best part of the Conjuring universe. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson really light up the screen when they are around. McKenna Grace does a really good job as Judy Warren and the two other girls ( a babysitter and her bestie) are really good too. If they weren't good, the movie would've been awful. There is a ton of jump scares. It's what this movie relies on to be scary. Most of them are very effective. I did realize while watching the movie how far horror has come. If this movie was released in the 80s the girls would have had their tops off in the first 20 mins and would've been killed off soon after. They take a slower burn with this film and give the girls a bit of pathos so you root for them. To finish out this review, I say if you are a fan of the Conjuring universe you won't be disappointed.

It's often stated that horror is the most difficult genre to convey, and after watching this rendition of Annabelle, I must agree. There is truly a disconnect between the main ""Conjuring"" movies, and the spin offs. They all seem to rely on these cliche horror tricks in order to pull off scares. It does not work. Character development is weak, and when you cannot connect with the characters, you will not feel nor care for the fear they are projecting. I honestly dosed off a few times; In a ""horror"" none the less. I would say this type of horror is made for children, and children who are unseasoned with horror movies.

234,DJKwa,The Conjuring by way of Goosebumps (Adjust your expectations accordingly),7,26 June 2019,"What is it with horror movies and lax on-set security recently? In Annabelle Comes Home there are frequently figures moving around in the background during scary scenes and it's super distracting.Jokes aside, the best way to describe the new Annabelle film would be The Conjuring by way of Goosebumps. If that sounds appealing to you, then you'll certainly get a kick out of the numerous monsters and demons that appear onscreen throughout the film. But if your looking for something bone-chillingly terrifying, well then.... you'll have to adjust your expectations a bit.The set-up to the story is largely a gimmick, as two young girls agree to stay at the Warren's house overnight and babysit their ten-year-old daughter. With only their curiosity and numerous trapped malevolent spirits and demons to keep them company, what could possibly go wrong? However, series writer Gary Dauberman, who also makes his directorial debut here, understands what makes these films fun and appealing. So, when one of the girls wanders into the basement and unleashes Annabelle, so too does she unleash the many other demons trapped below.What ensues feels like a live action broadcast of a puppet master pulling the strings on his favourite creations. Throughout the night, the girls are chased and tormented by the monsters and entities from the Warren's previous cases, and it's the sort of outlandish premise that benefits from the kitchen sink approach Dauberman provides.Moreover, in a time where horror films seem content on recycling the same scare tactics in hopes that they will still work the hundredth time around, the third Annabelle film feels like a welcome respite. It seeks to entertain, more than it does to scare, and it lends the film a breezy, eminently watchable quality. There are still plenty of jump scares and hit or miss moments, but the air of fun that hangs over the film luckily patches over most of the rough bits. If the recent Child's Play didn't satisfy your hunger for killer dolls, then Annabelle Comes Home may just do the trick.",Annabelle Comes Home

I wanted something to happen at some point and when it happened, I smiled thanking everyone involved that they hadn't left that out. It is creepy as it should be, with darkness being a key element, because we all know that most of our fears come from dark, being left on your own literally and metaphorically with no light around you. It is a fear deeply rooted in our childhoods, of which this horror film reminds its audience, making them face their own fears. Something is always lurking in the shadows. This one is the best sequel of them all. I didn't give it a ten, only because I wanted to see more of Ed and Lorraine, taking into account that real Lorraine died this year and more screen presence of her character would've been a decent send-off.

A girl touches everything she's not supposed to touch because she thinks that way she will be able to contact her father, girl gets possesed for like 5 minutes then suddenly is not possesed anymore, then doesn't show any signs or traumas of ever being possesed. I thought the first one was bad, but this one beats it big time. This movie is simply unnecessary. What does it teach us about Annabelle? nothing. We learn nothing about nothing.",Annabelle Comes Home
249,sagniknath,What's truly horrifying are the high ratings for this film,5,28 June 2019,"The biggest disappointment straight off the bat is that despite being rated R, this film at best can be described as PG , not even PG 13. There were maybe perhaps two scenes with split second of onscreen blood. The rest of the film plays out like a generic Goosebumps episode from the 90s. Actually, some of those episodes I watched as a kid had a more structured narrative to them, along with effective scares.This movie could have easily been so much more than the bland tepid two hour jump scare montage. You have just one big house as the setting with many props dangling around. A good script writer , whose only aim would have been to scare the audience, could have easily designed an elaborate system of conflicts for the main characters to resolve one after the other in order to get to a goal. He could have easily even sacrificed a character to make the final resolution seem more significant. Yes, these methods are cliched but they would have been more effective in making a barebones horror film plot than the mess I saw splattered all over the screen. The characters don't have any arc. Only one of them somewhat has it but it comes off as the laziest way to conclude that arc.In the scares department, you had random ghouls providing the jump scares. No introduction or character development was made for them. Guess they are all just sequel/spinoff bait in this muddled horror cinematic universe.The only time I sort of felt engaged with the story was whenever the Lorraine couple featured in their brief cameos. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have excellent chemistry as husband and wife and really makes you yearn to partake in that lovely experience. But basically everything else caused me disappointment. So don't but into these bafflingly high reviews made by the possessed and save yourself that ticket money. I hear Midsomner is coming out soon and that's apparently already a hit with the critics as a fine horror movie.",Annabelle Comes Home

Excellent acting, great costumes & good direction from film makers who truly respect the genre. These movies continue to improve upon themselves at the point in a franchise where quality usually lacks. I think people want an Oscar winner every time they see horror...

Where the movie fails is in the script that is very lazy, about the horror scenes, only the last one was scary, the others were very clichés and predictable.

The one thing many movies lack is good writing and in some cases good acting, this film has the acting part down for the most part, but is very disappointing in what could have been in using the talented cast with a much more in depth story, so many films these days are shallow in what they present, writers are part of the blame, politics is another as the main stars, if they could have more control would have made this a much better film.",Annabelle Comes Home

The whole movie is set inside a house over a night and so you can imagine there is not a lot they do with it. Three fourth of the film is teenagers talking to each other or approaching mysterious objects in a room in slow motion. I so wished there was a fast forward button somewhere. It's not hard to see the film was made with a bare minimum budget, as most of the effects were practical effects , like smoke machines and thread work to move things like cups and chairs. It's obvious this was intended to be a quick money grabbing movie before they release the next edition of Conjuring.

1. bring in some new ghostly/demonlike antagonists to make even more spinnoffs about in the future...but guess what, they failed to be even remotely scary this time! When the demon/devil-like creature came in I even started laughing! And at least the Nun had somewhat of a scary appearance, the Bride totally fell flat compared to that! And 2. how to create a movie that was fit to make a new maze/haunted house out of for upcoming Halloween. Cause that's pretty much what it felt like, watching 3 girls walk through a Halloween maze/house...oh and in the meanwhile trying to put back the Annabelle doll into the 'box of Pandora'.

It's scooby doo like goings on are so over the top that you're wondering if you're watching an installment of Goosebumps. The whole part with the werewolf was too much and should have been left out completely. Just when you think The Nun was the worst thing they could produce, they turn this out, using every mediocre horror cliche in the book. Just how many times do we have to see someone hit the floor and get dragged backwards through the room. It's been done to death.As if that wasn't enough, suddenly the sun is shining, the birds are chirping and all of the kids collectively decide to be her friends and the bully decides not to be a bully anymore.

Sequences with the bridal dress were perhaps the best scares amongst the film, whereas the Hellhound felt a bit silly and would probably need its own film to feel effective.Gary Dauberman's first directed film is nonetheless solid and contains some suspense moments were you expect a jump scare but don't get one. Also the rotating colour light in Judy's room where Annabelle's shadow size increases is a very cool visual.The whole plot line of Mary Ellen's love interest, Bob is extremely unnecessary, you would think he would add something to the plot, considering he lives across from the Warren's, in truth all he adds is more screen time for the Hellhound.",Annabelle Comes Home

It's like Annabelle from Disney.. 2 teens and 1 kid girl..

Can't she just go directly to his grave and say sorry there to her father? ).. Why the hell did she have to open Annabelle's glass box to look for her father? The father died in a car accident, what it has to do with Annabelle?? That is idiotic. Girl 2 Judy, lousy acting with poor facial expression throughout.

But if you watched the trailer, the world's most predictable plot emerges again. Yes, you can stress out somewhat watching this film, but that's what suspense is suppose to do.

You will just spend 80% of your time waiting to be scared but only to be dissappointed. The film is very anti climatic and not just at one point but at various junctures.

Oh gosh heres a kill heres a kill, how about just jump scares or, tense moments of what you think or will happen when people do stuff thats the stuff III like in horror.

This movie sucked so bad that it made fall asleep for about 10 minutes. It is nothing but dumb characters slowly moving in a dark hallway, leading to an eventual jumpscare. All of the jumpscares are also very predictable, which just kills your fear.Let me tell you the plot of this movie - Annabelle gets released by a stupid teenager, couple demons scare dumb kids, the kids catch Annabelle and put her back. Movie over. Whaaat?! Does not advance the plot at all, there's no impact or consequences because NO ONE DIES IN A RATED R HORROR MOVIE. Yes, no one died in the Conjurings. However, James Wan knows how to build scares and tension, thus fear for the death of characters is present. This movie just fell flat on almost every single aspect of it. The Warrens are good but they're on screen for 10 minutes. The artifact room is creepy. No more positives. Don't see this one",Annabelle Comes Home

302,taranpannu01,Annabelle Comes Home (2019),3,30 June 2019,"It's been a few days since I saw the film and I've genuinely been wondering if this film is even worth my time reviewing. I'm not much of a horror fan in general but I did enjoy the first two Conjuring films. Annabelle Comes Home is not enjoyable, it is so devoid of logic that it is painful to sit through.The lack of logic is mindblowing but before the scathing review first some positives.McKenna Grace is a talent and she is really trying her best with this one note role, she does her absolute best as does Madison Iseman.Katie Sarife gets the short end of the stick, her performance isn't bad by any means but her character is so brainless that one can't help but think badly of her performance when in fact it is simply the writing.For the first 45 mins - 1hour, absolutely nothing happens, nothing scary, it's just attempts at ""development"" but it's all the same cliches found in every post 2010 horror film.Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are hardly in the film and for a good reason, this is just a poor look on their resumes.The special effects are quite well done for what I could see because sometimes the film is so dark you can't see a damn thing.The sound design is the most impressive out of the film, sound is used as effectively as possible.The direction for the most part is basic, it's solid I guess. Although there are two zooms in the film which I genuinely sat back in disgust for the sheer pointlessness and ridiculousness.Look the film just isn't good, the performers are trying their best, the material is horrible, the direction is sub par, the music is basic and notes, the scares aren't there at all, the logic within the film is painful and it's taking the audiences for fools. The reviews are surprisingly positive but this film for me is on par with The Nun (2018) which was just ridiculously silly.Annabelle Comes Home is not a great film, it's not even a good film, it's a bad film with no scares and trying actors and actresses doing their best. Go watch Rocketman or Yesterday or even better, stay at home. You'll have more fun.",Annabelle Comes Home

308,Krush_Burner,Annabelle is home... but she's not alone,7,26 June 2019,"The most surprising news about this installment is that it's definitely the best of all three films involving Annabelle. Gary Dauberman, long-time screenwriter for ""The Conjuring"" franchise, got solid direction and knows how to make story interesting. Third part is revolving around ""The Artifact Room"" in Warren's house, and Dauberman truly releases most of its potential. There'll be a lot of creative creepy scenes, not only with Annabelle, but with different items (and creatures) almost every of them can be used for the whole separate film. Instead, Dauberman generously placing cursed boxes, hellhounds, ghosts and some more supernatural stuff around the house, slowly builds tension and knows when to ease it with a one-liner jokes. This is pure story-driven film, with minimal using of jumpscares and CGI, but maximum reliance on lights and shadows, dark corners on the background and simple, but likable characters. Go see it, if you're a fan of ""The Conjuring"" universe. Go see it if you're just a fan of good ghost stories. And... go see it if you're fan of Annabelle.

The boyfriend hides and tries to save a chicken by telling it ""No, don't go!"" Why?!

Action may be a very generous term here....the formula of lights out, silenced music and a cheap jump scare used over and over. The characters are incredibly bland (well, the daughter is not that terrible, but the other two girls are simply moronic, specially the one that just goes in and pretty much does what nobody with a working brain cell would do). They really should stop trying to milk out this franchise anymore. And if they do, please bring back the Warrens in the movies.

Well myself, being a huge fan of the conjuring universe since the first film, have seen every film in the franchise and honestly feel as though the Annabelle films are just terrible. This one included. The Warrens barely feature in this film at all. Combined with a cheesy love story, a ware wolf and the most drawn out ""story"" (or lack there of), I just feel like this was a film created for some extra cash. Speaking of the story line, the entire movie is essentially Annabelle wreaking havoc after she is released from the enclosure. That's it. Oh, and if you feel the need for some jump scares or just scary scenes in general, then this probably isn't the movie to watch. The only part that made me jump was when the lid closed on a box in the Warrens artefact room and that was purely because it was dead silent and it slammed shut. The rest of the film was boring, slow and really quite predictable. And I swear to God (the irony in that statement...) if I see one more so-called scary movie with a damned rocking chair rocking by itself, I'm gonna lose my s**t! Enough with the cliches!!

How it affects them. The horror for Valek was good mostly, because he was actually really powerful, evil, manipulative, and we see it. He was the profane, the Marque of Snakes, Valek. In the Nun, Valek had a theme, you could hear the evil. But with Annabelle, you never know what's her doing and what's not, no themes, no indication, all she does is sit on chairs and closes doors.
In previous Annabelle movies, the demon needs a sacrifice to get the souls, but in this he just shows up and suck your soul away? Wtf? Admittedly, this Annabelle is better than the first but wasn't as present and horrifying compared to Annabelle origins.",Annabelle Comes Home

In fact, the writing was quite strong and answered some of the questions like why you would ever go into the that room. Several good shocks and in typical James Wan fashion - he uses the music and suspense timing to extremely well.The acting was strong for a young cast - would have liked a little more of Patrick and Vera - that could have pushed this movie up to a 9.If you liked the other movies you will certainly like this one.",Annabelle Comes Home

The story of the movie is same as they shown us in trailer but i like the fact that this chapter adds something to conjuring universe. If u r a fan of conjuring universe then u probably don't want to miss this movie .In the movie there are also some easter eggs and hints that might be related to conjuring 3.As always the the cinematography , Set design and music of the movie is really great. The acting by the all characters is good. There is also a comic character bob which i personally think is added just for entertainment.I like the fact that we got some insight in the Warrens Demonology Witchcraft museum that has huge curse objects and stories related to them but sadly we just got very little of it.In the movie there r also some well crafted and creative jumpscares that i like personally.If i compare this movie with other conjuring universe movies then it would be better than Annabelle and Nun and somewhat equal to Curse of lalaorona but not better than Annabelle creation.Veridict

I was alone but the theater was house-full. It is a one night story which builds up slowly. And I personally like the horror movies which are largely based on one night and where minute details are considered. It has a creative story with some refreshingly unique terrors caused by a cursed wedding dress, a Ferryman, a werewolf demon, and a haunted TV screen which can tell the immediate future. Of course, the central point of horror is the doll, but it is the others which strike horrific experience due to their unknown character.

349,StrifeLeeSimpson,Lived up to the predecessor,9,1 February 2020,"The 'Conjuring Universe' is the only attempted cinematic universe that has been able to work besides the MCU. It's working because whosoever idea it was didn't rush it. It started with a different formula. With the films starting with the flagship then following up with the spin-offs. Although not all films were an A+, this one was at least an A. The universe is working because most films, except two, have been given real care. It may have still been a cash grab, but it was worth every penny. And having 'Conjuring' characters actually in the film did not hurt either. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, we have all been wondering since film 1 ""What would it be like to be trapped in that room?"" The adaptation of that fantasy did not disappoint. They kept the suspense going and a female lead cast captivated the screen with intensity. All the scares worked and there were imprints on both my armrests after it was over. Perhaps it is my own horror movie expectation but, just like in Annabelle: Creation, I wanted more people to die. If my memory serves me correctly I don't think anyone did. The film was still effective but I believe if they continue on that path then everyone is going to know that there are no real stakes involved. All in all a great horror movie.",Annabelle Comes Home
350,nickijjohnson-16955,Better than Annabelle and Creation combined,8,7 July 2019,"I was pleasantly surprised watching this one. After seeing Annabelle which admittedly was kind of boring and Creation which I thought was mediocre I didn't expect much from this one. For starters I always like when Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga come back for their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren. I've always thought they were perfect for the roles. I really liked the characters. They were developed enough to make me care what happened to them. The scares as always were interesting and well thought-out. I think for me what separated this film from other Annabelle films was the characters. In Annabelle you have this woman basically going through this hauting alone which actually made it a dull experience. In Creation you have a child as the lead which let's face it is nothing new for these particular type of horror films. With multiple leading characters I'm more entertained because I'm witnessing multiple experiences within the same film. Having lost my father I related to Daniella. I liked her backstory. Without it, for me, she would've just been some dumb teen unleashing evil for no good reason. I could understand what she was trying to do. Though obviously trying to contact her father in a room full of evil probably wasn't the best way to go about it. I liked watching Judy develop the sight that her mother has. The motherly babysitter was just so sweet you couldn't help but like her. Lastly I loved ""Bob's got balls"". He added a nice comic relief that was absent from both Annabelle and Creation. It was an entertaining film with your typical Conjuring like scares. And Annabelle's okay and all but to be honest the best one of all the ""Conjuring universe"" films for me will always be The Conjuring.

357,Sabaher,"Nice, somewhat lighter addition to the franchise that was hurt a good bit by one character",3,30 June 2019,"There's a pretty big quality jump from The Nun and The Curse of La Llorona to this film and I enjoyed this one a good bit. A big part of that is that it's very Warren centric. What this film did really well is kind of showing us their home life and in particular how what they do would affect their daughter which kind of grounds things a little bit. This film also has a nice set of side characters that seem above avrage for this genere. For example there's a pizza guy who got like a minute of screentime but was actually a scene stealer. Also Bob's got balls is another side character that add some levity into the mix, but feels like an awkward teenager that you would actually know. When it comes to the scares, since it kind of went from a more contained vibe it felt like they were a little bit more earned. It did some creepy things where it built tention, it maked you think a jumpscare was coming and then it came from somewhere else. They're still jumpscares but they felt a little bit more warrented inside of the film. What kind of knocked it back a little bit was the babysitter's friend character that almost was a good character, but they overplayed her character as the dumb teenager. They tried to balance it by giving her a a backstory that explained her actions and I didn't buy into the the mix of the backstory with the dumb teenager behavior, it was pretty frustrating. If they tightened up that character a little bit this movie would for sure get a 10/10",Annabelle Comes Home

Annabelle strikes again!,9,4 July 2019,"Annabelle Comes Home is a thrilling 3rd chapter to the Annabelle films and the 7th installment to The Conjuring Universe. From beginning to end I was glued to the screen. I really love how Gary Dauberman kept the feeling of real conjuring content and mood as well with throwing new themes and spirits. The film itself has a lot of comedic relief that is necessary instead of random lines thrown. Every single character played by the actresses and Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are flawless, you also care about every character deeply even when one of them seemed like not so nice person comes one of the nicest of all. The warrens reprising their roles was a beautiful thing, even though they don't have a significant amount of scenes we still have them and to also see before we get the Conjuring 3.

Plus they seem to love to walk right by light switches in the pitch dark while searching for a flashlight. Like the switch is right next to them and they don't try it. The flashlight goes out and its dark and no switches are even flipped . The story itself is Annabelle gets let out of her case by the typical curious teen wondering around. And what didn't make sense there was she grabs the keys and somehow all those keys on the keychain she picks the right key on the first try every time. But that's just nit picking.The movie if it was shorter or had a faster pace could have been better or at least smarter characters. None of the characters have any sort of redeeming qualities that make you want to root for them. You're just really watching for the scares and that's it. There isn't anything to keep you invested.

The film is, at times, truly frightening, and extremely entertaining. Most of the scares never happen the way one would expect, which is a strength of the film; most horror films rely on cheap jump scares and predictability. This film decided to go against the grain on some of the scares, and think outside the box, bringing a creative spin into the mix, such as the television screen inside the Warren's locked room. The atmosphere is great, there is some investment in the characters, so the audience is invested in what happens to them, and there is an overall sense of fun.

Please rest assured that any positive reviews on this movie are purely biased and misleading as there is no way in hell any even half intellectual viewer could bypass the fact the movie has the lamest of stories ever produced on a big budget movies as this movie makes The Nun look like The Exorcist that's how incredibly bad it is and anyone seeing otherwise is either without taste or on a payed agenda to promote the movie through reviewing here and instead of giving a purely honest opinion decided to the exact opposite!!!!!! Going back to the importance of story telling or storyline, Yes the directing and editing are very important but the story is what makes the movie watchable to the average intelligent viewer and that applies to all genres... Back to this movie my honest optimistic assessment is that there is no story whatsoever and it is only based on the lamest of scares possible even a 7 years old child would laugh at and think it's stupid... Don't understand how people get paid millions of dollars for acting directing so on so forth and end up coming up with something this poor is beyond me... I don't know maybe I'm a genius but I already have two excellent and totally different storyline that jumps to mind just talking about it I wonder what I could come up with if I actually sit down and actually think it... I don't know what or why it is but it's almost been 6 months since I last saw a decent movie in any genre and I'm pretty sure alot of you never thought about it but a movie critic like myself who gets paid to air his opinion on movies and other acting ventures and one who absolutely track any decent movie that comes out in all genres find those last 6 months equivalent to the global financial crunch that happened back in 2008 but this time it's movies that has fallen terribly low and only God knows when it is next that a decent well made engaging movie comes out in any genre because I'm seriously getting bored and about to explode from the lack of creativity in Hollywood right now...",Annabelle Comes Home

393,christianolivarez-78828,COME BACK HERE,7,9 July 2019,"Hello ladies and gentlemen. We're going to be talking about Annabelle Comes Home. With how popular The Conjuring Universe is, I won't be explaining the whole story to save you some time. Your welcome. Anyway, this is a straightforward movie. Ed and Lorraine Warren play a very small part in this movie which I thought was interesting. Instead, the movie focuses on their daughter Judy Warren (played by Mckenna Grace), her baby sitter Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman), and Daniela Rios (played by Katie Sarife). So Mary Ellen is a sweet girl and Daniela is the skeptic that kind of thinks everything is a joke and wants to explore these haunted items. I think you guys get the idea. So here we go.So I did appreciate that they kept the foundation simple. Going into this movie I thought it was going to be cluttered given the trailers with all the spirits being let loose but it was just a battle between Judy Warren and fitting into society with such a different upbringing. It's her birthday, but she's been bullied so it's not looking to hot for her when it comes to friends/spirits following her. There are some subtle moments in the beginning that are a bit creepy and kind of set the tone for the movie. There's some comedic moments that were a bit much i thought but i wouldn't say it takes away from the movie really.What I didn't like too much about this film was that there was no main storyline. The Conjuring movies usually have some great story mlines that add mystery to the movie and kind of makes it worth watching. In this movie all this happened in one evening so the storyline in this movie is that this girl Daniela touched everything and let Annabelle out. That's literally it. On the other hand, since this happened in one night it does make you feel like you're with them in the movie and really draws you into the horror that's happening. Another bright piece for me was the sub plot with Daniela and her deceased father. The first part of the movie she comes off as kind of a spoiled bossy brat, but as the movie continues, you get the idea that she's just hurting from losing her father and isn't all that bad. There is also a love interest that's kind of thrown in there. They give it enough but it is kind of just there. I don't know how i feel about it.Now back to the movie as a whole. You're probably thinking, ""no storyline, no Ed and Lorraine Warren, what's happening?"" So what I always like about The Conjuring is that the scares are all really well done. They do throw a lot at you but they do give explanations about all the spirits that are soon to come. There is one spirit in particular that I would love to see more of. You'll figure it out when you watch it. There is one other part as well that left me speechless. It's about half way through and happens to Daniela. It was something that made my jaw drop and I can't wait to talk about it with more people.I also felt that Judy Warren really shined in this movie. Yeah, she's been in pretty much all the movies but with very small roles. This movie is all her and she really took the opportunity and ran with it. I'm really excited for her and to see what else she comes with in the future. Not surprising, but this movie also opens quite a few doors for future movies and I hope they come through. This movie is worth a watch for sure, but idk if it's a must-see in theaters. If you love The Conjuring like I do then yeah, see it in the movies and support it. If not, then wait for a Redbox. All in all, looking at this movie objectively, I'm giving it a 6.8/10",Annabelle Comes Home
394,nickrichardson-16919,Popcorn Empire - Annabelle Comes Home review,4,6 July 2019,"""Despite solid performances and sporadically interesting camerawork and special effects, this film falls flat."" 4/10Annabelle Comes Home is the third film in the Annabelle franchise, which is part of the larger Conjuring Universe. While the Conjuring films themselves have been a sort of renaissance for supernatural horror, the spinoffs (Annabelle, The Nun, The Curse of La Llorona) have consistently paled in comparison. Annabelle Comes Home is no different.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!The film starts out promisingly enough, picking up from the scene in The Conjuring where the Warrens receive the Annabelle doll. On their way home, their car mysteriously breaks down next to an old cemetery. The Annabelle spirit calls out the souls of the dead (acting as a ""beacon"" as Lorraine puts it) and the tension builds UNTIL - Ed gets shoved to the ground, and the scene ends. Strangely enough, this is just about the most harm any character in this film endures. I'm not kidding.The Warrens quickly exit the film, and it takes a nosedive from there. We meet the Warren's daughter once again, as well as her babysitter and a couple of her friends. These characters are fine enough, but the only one with any real investment in the plot is Daniella, who is grieving her dead father. She attempts to communicate with him through the evil spirits in the Warren's forbidden room. If that sounds dumb to you, that's because it is (why not just ask the Warrens for help instead?).Following the first act, Annabelle is let out of her cage to cause some mayhem, unleashing every evil entity the Warrens have ever collected. The result is - underwhelming. Things quickly devolve into a series of jump scares, and the thinness of the plot really becomes apparent. Despite a couple inventive set pieces, these sequences quickly become tedious. The film follows this rinse-and-repeat structure until the doll is finally locked away again, and everything immediately returns back to normal.At some point, it becomes clear that these children are in no REAL danger, protected behind a shield of timid writing. Whether this is an attempt to appeal to a wider audience, or just out of reluctance by the writers, this movie barely earns its R rating.With each Annabelle film, it's only become more and more confounding as to why the Annabelle doll is held in such high regard. The stakes are always relatively low in these films, and the consequences of this doll's existence have been fairly minimal. With this third film, the stakes are puzzlingly lower than they've ever been. No one gets killed, let alone hurt, and Daniella is the only character in the entire ensemble that has anything resembling an arc.Despite solid performances and sporadically interesting camerawork and special effects, this film falls flat. Unless you go to horror films looking for an amusement park ""haunted house"" type of experience and nothing deeper, than this film will likely appeal to you. But if you're a horror fan looking for some true terror and a satisfying story, don't waste your time with this one.4/10",Annabelle Comes Home
395,wilhelm-22,Big disappointment,2,19 April 2020,"None of the Annabelle movies were masterpieces. But they were scary and entertaining enough to satisfy those of us who just can't get enough of evil doll movies. Annabelle also happens to be an impressively creepy doll, and the ""based on a true story"" aspect of the films give them some extra appeal.
I was very happy to find this new installment of the series on Netflix, but it turned out to be a big disappointment. The main problem is an incredibly weak plot. Three girls accidentally let Annabelle out of her glass cage, thereby releasing some evil spirits. The rest of the film they walk around in the house and have random encounters with a diverse selection of ghosts, werewolves and other supposedly scary creatures. That's it. No twists and turns, no secrets/revelations, no character development, no nothing. To make it even worse, the ghosts are not all that scary. Also, we see very little action with Annabelle herself, she mainly sits in a chair and stares.
Don't know what happened here, they had some great characters and backstories to work with and it would seems almost impossible to not come up with something at least half decent. But despite everything they had going for them, they failed miserably.",Annabelle Comes Home

It did not disappoint, but at the same time did not impress either.As to be expected within the horror genre (in particular the extended conjuring universe) there are a few cheesy lines and some rough acting. However, as a baseline horror film, this checks all the boxes. A few good jump scares, mingled with an overall creepy tone made for a fun horror film.Now for my feeling as far as how it relates to the rest of the Conjuring franchise. I honestly feel as though it was kinda irrelevant. Nothing was gained, nothing was lost. Just kinda an empty addition to the series. My hope is that this film will be used as an ""introduction"" for many potential films to come. This in my view would make this addition seem more relevant.My fear is that the Conjuring extended universe is sinking into a trap of trying to pump out as many cheep thrills as fast as they can for a quick cash grab. The last 3 installments into this horror universe have been a little lack luster. So I can only hope that James Wan and the other Conjuring universe creators have something a little better planned for the next films.",Annabelle Comes Home

398,talizen,Just as I predicted,3,14 July 2019,"I may have been scared a little watching Annabelle Comes Home but that was not the point why I watched. The only reason why this movie happened and totally unoriginal story, is because of one dumb character who doesn't know how to read whatsoever. If you have seen the trailer, then you know why. The character Daniella stupidly unlocked the Warren's room with all the cursed objects and touched everything which she wasn't supposed to, including opening Annabelle's case and left it open. That was the laziest writing I have ever seen, especially using one of the oldest cliches in the book and I can't believe James Wan let that happen. Boring plot the movie and predictable jump scares. The first Annabelle movie wasn't even that great but its a much better movie than this one. I am however fascinated on a couple certain haunted objects that I don't mind can be turned into a movie such as the bride wedding dress.

399,sallyannandrew,"Entertaining enough, but disappointing",7,28 July 2019,"I love an evil doll film and Annabelle is a seriously evil doll. But these films are lacking something. The first one was okay, the second one was seriously scary (in my opinion) and then this one...wasn't. I enjoyed this, it was fun, but it still leaves a lot of questions unanswered, it's a tad lazy. The blue demon doesn't work for me, he's frankly a bit silly - and many of the scares in this were disappointing. Lots of set up, and then, nothing. I felt like they could have done more with this. I did really like exploring the Warrens other 'artefacts' and 'The Ferryman' was a nice touch, but ultimately this was messy.

403,ScreenRanker,6.7 - Probably Best the Trilogy Ended Here...,6,28 June 2019,"After the not-so fancy stuff that came from the original 'Annabelle' (2014) and promising success of the terrifying prequel known as 'Annabelle: Creation' (2017), I had hoped that this story would pick itself up.
I watched the trailer for 'Annabelle Comes Home' and decided that it looked a bit trashy. Well, I wasn't entirely wrong. As it turns out, the movie was a bit cheap. It had good comedy at times, girls, as usual, and this around even romance. Or a comedic romance. Whatever the case, it should NOT have been in this movie because it simply confuses the genre. This story actually had something good going ever since the last movie. It may have just become a chick flick; it almost feels weird watching this movie as a guy.
The actors and actresses were good enough and the horror was okay, but they made Daniella an idiot. Judy was probably the most respectable of the three main characters.
This movie neglects the Warrens and even Annabelle, considerably. It takes this movie a while to get to the good stuff and seems a bit too centred around friends at times. Perhaps that is what Lorraine was talking about when she mentioned ""all the good that is out there"" in the world, but...
By the time the girls put Annabelle back in her glass case, I was a little disappointed that the movie was over already. It was a bit of a mess and the original story was not expanded on or concluded very well.
As part of the The Conjuring universe, I expected more of this movie. Watch it if you are an early teen (or just easily frightened).",Annabelle Comes Home
404,judinazena,There's only so much you can do with a movie about a doll,7,9 August 2020,"So, the thing is - movie is not bad. It actually held my attention from the start till the end. First Annabelle movie was a little dull, and second was simply OK. This one is GOOD. It's more like a teenage horror movie, but it has a decent story. It freaked me out more than 2nd one. Personally, I'm terrified of things like ghosts, etc (things I can't see with my own eyes), so random objects falling and making a noise when there were like 2 minutes of dead silence, actually works for me. Makes me jump. This movie also made me think ahead, unlike first 2 parts. It's a good movie to watch before sleep (unless you're a kid that's frightened of movies). Even tho jump scares did scare me, I fell asleep like a baby after a movie. It makes your mind a little tired from scares and thinking ahead, but as soon as it's over - you forget about it. Actually, the only thing that gave me actual chills, was in post-movie credits, when they said that real Lorraine Warren died. But hey, she died in 92. She's lived a full and interesting life, so that kind of gives me some comfort.
Anyway, I believe there will be no more Annabelle movies. Cause the real doll is in the same place now where it's been since than - in the glass box. And as far as I know, there hasn't been any more stories about her after that. She's just locked, and that's all there is to it.",Annabelle Comes Home

Then I saw this, expecting a lot, and yeeeeew, I am thankful I didn't spend money at the theater to see this pile of '80s cliché and dejà-vu.
It's hard to find good horror stories when you are 40 and you have been a fun of the genre for 40 years. Well, this is simply not a good story, it's barely a horror story. They just wanted to find a background story for that potentially inspiring collection of evil items in the cellar and made a simple and stupid one for each of them. Waxwork 30 years ago was a better movie compared to this. Why ruin such a well designed universe by linking useless and surely uninvolving stories to unveil the mysthery behind those ""souvenirs""? They had the potential and the material for something great, but instead they managed to produce a huge flop. They only had to carefully select items and find an interesting story related to them, not so difficult right? Wrong. Item one plus bad story one. Item 2 with bad story 2. Item 3 and bad story 3. And then there's a doll...doing more or less the same obvious things for 3 movies...it gets boring and unwatchable. Acting is ok. Atmoshpere is ok-ish. Plot is meh...was it really a trouble to expand each story a little bit more and go a tad deeper instead of showing a series of monster with the usual peekaboo! style?

This is not normal, something is clearly wrong, why would she lie about this?In the finale the 3 girls manage to lock up Annabelle by force, when Mary is literally thrown 5 meters through the air seconds before that.

426,JohnnyRatesALot,"""All the Evil in Here Reminds Me of all the Good That's Out There.""",10,28 June 2019,"I just had to share that beautiful, touching quote said by Lorraine at the end of this film.
I don't see how this film only has a 6.2/10 rating on IMDB! That doesn't give it justice at all. If it was up to me, I'd give it at least a 7/10. Because that's what it deserves.
I've been a big fan of The Conjuring Universe ever since it birthed in 2013 with James Wan's very first masterpiece. Three years later he gave us The Conjuring 2, which in my opinion was just as great - if not better - than the first! The series also expanded into a ""universe"" with various spin-offs. First there was Annabelle (2014), which was decent but not great, then Annabelle Creation (2017) which was EXCELLENT, then there was The Nun (2018) which was okay, but could've been better.
Now for Annabelle Comes Home. Everything about this latest installment is brilliant (the plot, setting, atmosphere, actors, characters, direction, and the creative, non-repetitive scares). The idea of Annabelle the doll unleashing evil in The Warrens' artifact room is a brilliant concept, and the film did a wonderful job delivering it. I personally visited The Warrens Occult Museum a few years ago and I thought to myself, ""What if all these creepy artifacts came to life one night?"" It was a notion in the back of my head. I never dreamt it would turn into a real movie!
Anyway, I must say - this film had me on the edge of my seat. Not only was it suspenseful, creepy, eerie, dark, and diabolical; it introduced me and the franchise to new, horrifying demons! Some include The Ferryman, The Samurai Armor, The Bride (which scared me the most), a werewolf, and a television that shows the future. But that's just a few (isn't one enough?).
Gary Dauberman really did a superb job for his directorial debut and he did a great job with the ""jump scare"" restraints. He added a lot of tension and build up when it came to the scary parts. He didn't resort to cheap, uninspired jump scares nor did he have to rely on them to make this movie effectively creepy!
I also loved the appearance of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren, which was the ""cherry on the top"" of this great spin-off. Even though their appearances were limited, their characters are still as strong as ever and their chemistry continues to shine.
Overall, I truly enjoyed Annabelle Comes Home and I think it's THE BEST installment in the 'Annabelle' trilogy. The acting was excellent, the setting and atmosphere was perfect (what could be scarier than The Warren's house in the middle of the night?), and the characters were very likable. The scares were very creative and the film had its sad, comedic, and emotional aspects as well. The various demons were absolutely terrifying, mischievous, and had their own traits, and it was full of suspense and dread. It was like every animal escaping from their cages at the zoo all at the same time, but in a supernatural sense.I also love how they dedicated the film to Lorraine Warren at the end credits, who sadly passed away back in April. It's a shame she didn't get to see this wonderful installment in a franchise that wouldn't exist if it hadn't been for her and Ed - and their extraordinary career.
Annabelle Comes Home is a strong, promising, and well-needed installment which is truly ""the home"" of The Conjuring Universe. I highly recommend it. It's very different from the others, which is a good and refreshing thing all the way! I give it a 10/10 and five stars!Rest In Peace, Lorraine Warren.",Annabelle Comes Home

I mean this curious ""bad"" type girl walks in Warren's house just like that with promises she will not touch anything and then of course she does and she unleashes hell... it's all stupid from reason why she is there to how easy she opens the secret and terrible room where all evil is kept...I mean just dont bother watching this movie.",Annabelle Comes Home

454,savindri,snooze fest is what this movie is,4,29 June 2019,"This is coming from a person who doesn't watch horror movies because I'm scared but also cuz I just don't care for the genre much. But this movie was just a honest waste of time and money in my opinion. The pace of the movie was quite slow during the times it led to the jump scares; which were also very mediocre. The character ""Daniella"" was unbearable to watch. As well as the ending was so stupidly abrupt. It was comparable to the ""when she woke up she realized it was all just a dream"" scenario. You would expect the characters involved in this movie to be genuinely traumatized after such an event, but no they all were happy as if nothing happened. Also how are people rating this 10/10, do u have any taste in film? Anyways, Smh I just want my money back lmao.",Annabelle Comes Home
455,jonatan_juntunen,So great - until the ending?,9,26 June 2019,"Let me start with this - the movie overall was conjuring quality, something none of the films has really achieved then this movies prequel, annabelle creation. The humour works great, and together with the tension built it makes the perfect movie. Perhaps the biggest letdown of this movie was the ending, which felt very thrown together. Im starting to see a pattern in these horror movies, they seem to start off good, and settle on a rushed and empty ending. The last scene with the demon somehow sucking the soul out of Judy felt so out of place, i felt so lost watching it. The same goes for the werewolf, it was a cool idea, but rather then create a horrible cgi monster, rather use a real wolf which makes for an even creepier villain. The movie is still great, but the clearence of the demon in these movies need to be more looked through. Showing the entirity of a demon takes away that it's there for - horror. I think Gary Dauberman did a great job though, but the ending + the werewolf, and i cant say this more clear, was the only thing stopping me from submitting a 10/10, and also calling this the best spinoff of the conjuring universe. Does this mean you should not see it? Absolutly not, the movie is great, and a enjoyable flick with a nice tribute to the real life lorraine in the end. Way to go, Gary.",Annabelle Comes Home

457,Frostycat_lives,A huge disappointment,5,19 July 2019,"I always think that the doll Annabelle looks anything but scary - however I had high hopes for this as Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as the Warrens, and they are a class act. The Conjuring 2 was to my mind one of the best horror films ever made. Imagine my disappointment when they disappeared from the film almost immediately and we are left with the wooden acting of three teenagers, no suggestion of a real story and just a succession of bog-standard jump moments. Yawn. There was a decent demon in the closing moments and a very brief reappearance of Ed and Lorraine but I'd lost interest by then. Let's hope The Conjuring 3 will recapture the horror of Conjuring 2, and we can forget about Annabelle and her manic expression. Bring back Ed and Lorraine for more than cameo appearances. I suppose it would be too much to hope that Valak might appear too - one of the scariest demons ever. I hope this is the last we see of Annabelle as they've obviously run out of ideas for her.",Annabelle Comes Home

The story of the film was nice and short. It could've been better if we had more time on the history of the haunted artefacts. The acting was done very nicely by the girls and it made it fun to watch. The movie took time to reach its core but when it arrived it was a complete Rampage of horror by the haunted artefacts.

Disgusting as hell! Most disgusting nasty scene of the movie.The girl (Mckenna Grace) reminds me a bit of the kid in the 6th sense (Haley Joel Osment), in that that they both always look sad / crying.. even when they smile.
Really awesome actress for the role!Worth the watch, especially if you enjoy the horror suspense genre
8/10",Annabelle Comes Home
462,seiteom,Boring early teenage version,2,30 December 2019,"This film is Annabelle for youngsters in their early teens. The most scary scene is as though copied from one of the lesser Fright Night episodes. I can't help feeling the film is very deliberately targeting young girls, as it features only female protagonists, besides a shy, good-looking boy who is there only to court one of the women.
Sometimes, movies for teenagers can have rather imaginative narratives. Not so here. It is basically the story of a baby-sitting night in a haunted house. The rest is jump-scares and the occasional hinting at other stories that are never explored beyond a few screams and shadows.
If you are a young teenage girl with little horror movie experience, this may tickle you a little. The film will likely bore most others.",Annabelle Comes Home

465,Snacks87,DECENT ENTRY!,7,15 July 2019,"Good morning, Good People!! Another review for ya! This past weekend I went to check out the latest entry into ""The Conjuring"" series, ""Annabelle Comes Home""! Mind you, I have not seen every film in the series OR watched them in order! That being said, I can not speak on easter eggs that make connections to the other films! Sorry! Moving on, for me the film was decent! I really enjoyed the young cast. Mckenna Grace's Judy Warren was my favorite! Madison Iseman's Mary Ellen (Judy's Babysitter) and her best friend Daniela Ross portrayed by Katie Sarife. The three young characters make sense in their choices that push events forward, specifically Daniela! Annabelle is as menacing as EVER, summoning hordes of spirits to attack! The pop scares are cool (don't MAKE me jump), but they serve their purpose and the characters have realistic fear related reactions.The movie takes place in the legendary home of Lorriane and Ed Warren's in house museum (WHICH I WILL BE VISITING NEXT YEAR!!) Without spoiling much, Daniela (Mary's best friend goes into the museum and touches EVERYTHING). Trailer tells you this, so I ain't spoiling NOTHING!. There are appearances from some dark spirits of Legend from different cultures which are really cool! One reference to a real life crime, involving a supernatural entity!Series regulars Patrick Wilson (""Watcmen"", ""The A Team"") and Vera Farmiga (""When They See Us"", ""Bates Motel"") reprise their roles as Ed & Lorraine Warren. The movie shows how they came into possession of the doll and an understanding of the Annabelle's nature! Go check it out, peeps! Hope you enjoyed the review, peeps! I give this film a thumb up!",Annabelle Comes Home

467,samuel_lincoln,"Not too bad, not too great",6,26 June 2019,"Lots of jump scare scenes, but none that were truly terrifying. This movie was very reminiscent of 'The Cabin in the Woods' , although this isn't a satire. The acting in the movie wasn't bad, some amount of intended comedy was mixed in.

People these days rate a horror movie based on how many times they got jump scared and that is just sad to see all these people rate this movie low because the director has some actual brain and create tension before a jumpscare instead of just doing the dumb and by now standard jump scare every few minutes.If you are a fan of real horror you should check this out,you will like it.",Annabelle Comes Home
470,DanielNeil1237,Average yet somewhat fun horror film,6,6 September 2019,"Annabelle comes home is a average one hour and 30 minute horror movie. With your usual jump scares and pretty much being there just to set up future Conjuring movies. The acting is of course great with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga returning with the very little screen time they have. Even the teen babysitters are also likeable and do a good job with a funny boy friend character. Also some of the monsters can be cool like one is a werewolf but they don't tell you much about them, or their origins. So they can most likely make a whole movie on them in the future. There is a lot of humor also but this is a bit of an issue because it takes away a lot of the scariness from the movie mainly like I mentioned earlier with the boy friend character. Though the teenagers are are great one of them of course makes very idiotic decisions like usual with these types of movies. Overall the movie fails to live up to the amazing first two Conjuring movies and great Annabelle creation. By feeling very run of the mill and basic as if it was just there to set up more films though it does have a few good moments and creatures to make it turn off your brain summer fun.",Annabelle Comes Home

Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson started off the movie which is quite interesting and I wanted to watch what's next. But after other characters came to the scene and I am not sure what is happening. To be honest I wanted to stop watching the movie because it became so boring to watch. But as a fan of Annabelle series, I hoped that the movie will come to its right track meantime.

This movie was great. One of the best in the conjuring universe. I liked the story, I liked the execution of the movie. But most of all, I liked the fact that there were scenes when one would expect something scary to happen (I often had to say ""really, so predictable?!""), and nothing happened! And then there were scenes where I would have said ""yeah right"" and just in a second, something scared the .... out if me. For me, this is a plus. This means you know how to create tension, you know how to create atmosphere and suspense. Yes, it did have some funny moments, but those moments are there for a reason. I would have given it a 10, but for me, the nun and the conjuring 2 are a 10 so everything is judged in connection to those moviea. Nevertheless, this one was a great movie overall and would definitely watch it again and recommend it. James Wan, you did not dissapoint!",Annabelle Comes Home

483,raymondzralte28,Annabelle Ruins Movie Night,5,23 September 2019,"Pros:1. Patrick Wilson and Vera Fermiga.
2. They nailed the theme of the era.
3. First half of the movie was up to mark.Cons (this should take a while):1. The plot is looser than my little niece's tooth that's about to fall off.
2. The characters Judy, Mary Ellen, Daniela and Bob were, how you say......boring. Judy was okay, she was relatable. But in the end she was fighting off demons like a pastor on steroids. Relatibility went flying out the window.
3. Let's talk demons. The lady in the wedding dress was good enough, the ferryman was good enough. But the horned demon? Come on! It was worse than a nagging mother-in-law, both in terms of visuals and its connection to the plot. And the werewolf?? Don't even get me started on the ""demon"" werewolf. Whoever came up with this idea SHOULD BE FIRED! It get's whacked by Bob and it dissolves into a fine mist only to magically reappear from said mist. God!! Give me patience! Like I said, SHOULD BE FIRED!
4. The jump scares were so bad its laughable.
5. Some scenes didn't even make sense. Here is an example from a list of many: The werewolf could destroy the roof of the car with ease. Now, when Bob whacked the werewolf and Daniela ran inside, where did Bob go? Did he run back into the chicken coop? The werewolf could have easily destroyed that. But no, Bob had to survive so the werewolf was cool enough to not kill him.
6. If Daniela had touched all the other objects in the room besides Annabelle, then how come they all stop when Annabelle gets put back into the glass showcase. Are the other demons and ghosts under the command of Annabelle's demon? Did they elect Annabelle's demon to lead the whole haunting fiasco?
7. There are many more of these points but I have wasted enough time already. I WILL NOT WASTE OVER TWO HOURS ON THIS MOVIE AND ITS REVIEW!With a movie with such a potential, they went and messed it up bigtime.Me: The Curse of La Llarona is the worst movie in the franchise.

509,willismagilous,A coagulation of cheap clichés and half-assed jumpscares,1,5 April 2020,"One thing that sticks out most in the Conjouring movies is the ambiguous goals, rules, and natures of the entities they portray. In the first movie of this disappointing series, the doll was possessed by the cultist girl. Then she was actually being controlled by the demon said cultist intended to summon. Now, in this film, it's a beacon to other spirits? Make up your mind.Nothing about the demon's actions make sense in progressing towards it's dictated goal: acquiring a soul. Not one thing the antagonist does helps to achieve said desire. The demon does flashy things with no real substance behind it.In the entire Conjuring universe, set rules are entirely absent. The Nun and La Llorona are very good examples of this fatal absence. In neither movies can the writers decide whether the spirits are physical entities or spiritual. In one moment, the spirit can wonder room to room, or even town to town without any regard for physical barriers like wall, but one scene later will be stabbed in the heart by a crucifix.The Conjouring series is a joke and an insult to good paranormal films like The Autopsy of Jane Doe or the first edition to the Paranormal Activity series. I personally hope this universe comes to an end soon although I know the creators will milk the name as long as possible.",Annabelle Comes Home
510,tommomarshall,Skip to 50 minutes. You can thank me later.,5,31 July 2021,"There really is no need for the first 50 minutes of this movie. It starts so well, and then is just a dragged out, unnecessary 40-45 minutes of talk, which does nothing to build tension nor does it improve the plot.Long 40-45 minutes cut short, Annabelle is let loose by the babysitters friend (who inexplicably finds the keys to the most dangerous room in the world, just casually lying around on the desk whilst Lorraine and Ed are away).And lo and behold, all the spirits are causing havoc. There. 45-50 mins of your life saved.Then you can (somewhat) enjoy. There's nothing particularly new to this film nor the genre (Annabelle possesses the other artifacts which is a little different), but it's still mildly entertaining. The usual really. Protagonists dragged out of bed, ghosts lurking in the dark, creatures appearing from nowhere. What we've unfortunately come to expect from the genre.Almost zero of Lorraine and Ed too which is a real shame (and needs mentioning given they're a big draw to this franchise), but the other actors are also good, particularly Madison Iseman.If you have a spare hour, skip to 50 minutes and give it a go, but don't expect any real scares, or any creepy scenes. Expect what you've already seen!",Annabelle Comes Home

How was it green lit? I wouldn't be proud to have this as my ""first time directorial debut."" Plus, the way this movie goes down, makes the Warrens look like they are ill equiped to be keepers of the artifacts they hold. Totally disappointed with this movie. Erase this from existence. This is exactly the movie everyone was afraid Annabelle was going to be in the first place. Beyond all this, it is a cheap Friday The Thirteenth The Series rip off!",Annabelle Comes Home

A pretty teenage girl getting dragged across the floor by an unseen entity. Bed covers pulled off a sleeping child by a spirit that takes shape under the sheets. A blooded spirit in an old-fashioned wedding dress. Annabelle Comes Home offers nothing fresh to the diehard horror fans that crave a unique angle to the genre - like Hereditary, Mother!, Us, and Get Out. Annabelle Comes Home was more about cramming as many of the cliched monsters into 2 hours than it is about maintaining an interesting storyline. No attempt at originality.",Annabelle Comes Home

But after all was said and done, it left me with the feeling that Warner Bros. was just using it to set themselves up for the next 15 years. This move could potentially introduce 5 or 6 franchise spin-offs, with completely new ""villains"". Now that is not a bad thing, because most of them looked pretty interesting, but in terms of the primary story line, it got a little overwhelming. It was an enjoyable movie that does a good job at being a horror movie without having to have a hundred different attempts at jump scares to make it creepy.

I love the dimension that the characters have. It's so easy to put throwaway teens in roles like this, but these kids were great... mainly because of the way they were written.

But apart from the three minutes they were on screen, this movie was a let down in every single way.An idiotic teenage cliche will make you scream at the tv most of the way through until you finally ask yourself, how on earth was this from the same minds as the conjuring and why has Annabelle only been on my screen twice?Annabelle might end up on the screen more but after 88 minutes of watching this sad excuse for a movie I had to move on and say, ""I've already lost enough time in my life that I won't get back, I can't do another 22 minutes"".As the title of this review says, DO NOT WATCH",Annabelle Comes Home

The great thing about the past movies of this saga - though they too strayed far from the truth - had a basic true story behind it. This one is just fake. Every second is a joke. There are loads of moments when you see a classic jump scare or horror movie cliché coming but then it doesn't happen which normally would be great because all horror movies are just recycled spooks but this one could have benefited from taking those chances.Waste of time.

The concept is just insanely good, but after all it didn't because it didn't really have a story. The movie itself began really good and eventually got worse after the part when a lot of jumpscares came in couples of seconds. Because I like it when they build up to something insane. This movie had some really nice camera shots , which was super nice to see. So I really loved that. After all I'm not too dissapointed about this one although I think Creation was a little better. This movie is still plenty of fun and I'm giving it a 9 because of the concept which is just so good and the cinematography. Also the soundtracks haha. 9 well deserved",Annabelle Comes Home

HUGE male skulls, HUGE male brow ridges, sloped foreheads, linebacker shoulders and zero female hips, which are supposed to be 0.9 or 1:1 ratio shoulders to hips on adult females. You're not fooling everyone anymore!Besides that, the movie was completely predictable as the main characters ALWAYS have to go take a look at every noise instead of doing something logical. The little girl or boy and the two main girls are horrible actors. The boy, Bob is a sniveling little wimp, as Hellyweird keeps pushing that ""girl power"" and boys are helpless little feminized wimp agenda.This movie doesn't even deserve a 6.

This is a movie about Annabelle but it is also about Judy, the Warrens daughter. The concept being,""what would it be like to be Judy, the child of the Warrens who lives in the house with the artifacts room."" As we learned in the trailer, it is important to never touch anything in this room.I enjoyed the movie. Good acting. Lots of creepy scenes. But my favorite part was very trivial - the grocery store! They did very well at stocking the shelves of products with old labels. It felt very authentic to the late 70s. Same with the house and decor, they paid great attention to the details. If you enjoy fog, you will enjoy this movie. I would give it an award for great use of fog in a very Salem's Lot kind of way.",Annabelle Comes Home
530,cenycesyn,More meaningless and pointless than lifeguards at Olympic swimming,2,26 July 2019,"This film has some good acting and i think Mckenna Grace really is a great and up and coming actress but wow is it the most predictable and meaningless horror film ever. I truly cannot believe the amount of times I was genuinely convinced that the plot and scares of this film were plucked out of a hat at random and the fate of the film was left to chance. I hate how in horror films we no longer understand what we are to fear, we don't really get an insight in to the powers of the so called 'malicious spirits' but instead we get random scenes of an old dude in a hall way with pennies in his eyes who just stands there pointlessly only to not even be scary but just drop the pennies on the floor and vanish.More on my point of not understanding their powers, it seems like in modern horror we aren't scared of what's going to happen because of our lack of understanding the situation that the characters are in. We are left in the dark, especially in this film. Without too many spoilers the general plot is that all the spirits in the house are released from their 'prisons' by Annabelle and some upset yet fearless girl desperate to contact her dead father. Because of this there is no where near enough time for us to learn the abilities or limits of these monsters and therefore we aren't scared of what could happen and we have no way to relate with the characters (so the film lacks suspense) but instead we just have to be scared of jump scares. However the film manages to screw this up as well. Admittedly I did jump at 1 or 2 but other than that the film feels lacking in actual ideas in their scares; as I said earlier, pulled out of a hat at random. The scariest thing was the liquid to air ratio in my tango iceblast.Finally... Why is Bob a character? He just has a guitar. That is essentially the extent of Bob's involvement in the film.All in all, the next time i watch a horror film i'm hoping to see creative scares with a monster/creature which we learn about, characters that make decisions with their brain and not their 'special horror film mindset of being an idiot' which everyone in horror films seems to have now and a story line that doesn't end the exact same as it started with no change in story or characters (chraracter development) or is without consequences (unless cleverly executed.)",Annabelle Comes Home

In the world of horror where most films are low budget I am always happy to find a film that will actually make me jump a few times as most of the stuff out their just supplies blood, gore and predictable murders while we must endure horrible acting, one liners and corny scenes. This film isn't going to win anyone an Oscar, there are a few odd corny scenes because it's geared to a more teen audience and I could do without The nature of the dénouement and the length of the Dénouement (trying not to spoil) but horror films don't need happy endings.

However, there is no sense of mystery in the movie, so getting scared by demons/ghosts or waiting for that to happen is pretty much the only thing you're seeing. There's no interesting backstory, no interesting though a lot new monsters and no real character development. No downtime where the characters can catch a breath and discuss about what's really going on. Just tensefull scene after tensefull scene and this became a bit of a drag for me.
The scenery is also pretty boring compared to that castle in the Nun or the houses of the Conjuring and Annabelle: Creation that seemed to be in the middle of nowhere. Looked as if they wanted to keep the budget as low as possible here.

I brought my family and we were seldom scared, and we didn't care for Mary Ellen or Daniela. It breaks my heart to say this but the Child's Play remake (which also came out in June 2019) was better...and I'm not even a big Chucky fan.Lots of unanswered questions: Why get Ed and Lorraine get a teenage babysitter when the Grandma was the babysitter in The Conjuring, especially right after they brought an evil doll into their house? Why would Ed leave the keys to the evil antique room just laying on his office desk? Why would his office door be unlocked? Why would Ed and Lorraine go away over night near or on Judy's birthday? Why didn't Lorraine sense Judy was in danger, like Lorraine sensed it in The Conjuring?Patrick and Vera saved this film from being a total waste. Judy's character gets more character development, which was nice.

Set in the franchise based on the real-life supernatural investigations of the Warrens, this film focuses mainly on their daughter Judy Warren while her parents are away, and on her babysitter Mary Ellen. A friend with a tragic past gets involved, and sure enough the evil sealed in their home is unleashed. The film itself was shot very well, surprisingly for his debut Gary Dauberman knew where to put the camera at and when to keep it rolling; making the characters feel pursued and cornered aswell as building up dread and suspense towards each scare. The leads were smartly written and well-acted, the entities were spooky and unique, the humor was fun and on-point and most surprisingly of all with films of this nature (the paranormal and/or demonic presence) they do not waterdown or reduce the dependence and importance of Christian Faith as protection against such evils; making the film more enjoyable towards Christian-Catholic viewers like myself. Overall, a really satisfying introduction to this franchise that I definitely recommend.",Annabelle Comes Home

I got hit by two jump scares maybe 3 ... but don't worry because I have watched a lot of movies. there must be lots of jump scares so don't worry it's still a horror movie.
My criticism for this film is : there is no strong purpose and climax for the story, but overall is good. and I consider this to be more than the whole story.

568,Headspin2011,Can we have a movie with just the adults for the duration?,4,25 September 2019,"At the beginning, I had high hopes for the conjuring universe. However with each movie that gets run through the cookie cutter, those expectations have been crushed. I'm now without any sense of excitement that these movies should have been able to give me and those of us who love the chance to see great horror.It's not just this movie that has missed the mark, but the last several. Especially the Annabelle movies in particular.Why do they insist on throwing together a mindless exercise in lazy scares acted out by kids we have no reason to care for in any way? Instead we get Ed and Lorraine at the beginning for the minimum amount of time just to make sure we know it is a conjuring universe set up, just to see them conveniently depart until the very end.Nothing against the young actors, they are decent enough, but you always know they are never in any real danger whatsoever, because they don't kill the kids off in these movies, they always make it through unscathed. The outcome is always the same.So I say, just the adults for once, and leave us guessing right until the end who is going to live or die or worse. At least we have a chance to be surprised.",Annabelle Comes Home

But that's about as generous as I can get with this movie, and it shouldn't be a valid starting point for a review. If you've seen the previous The Conjuring & Co. movies, you've seen this one too. You get to revisit the Warrens' house with the doll and different haunted artifacts inside, you get a variety of boogeymen, some pretty ridiculous, some more or less decent, you get some jump scares and familiar devices from the previous movies. It's not completely worthless, but I was basically dozing off by the last 3rd. It's almost as if they were counting on the new target audience who hasn't seen the previous movies yet and wouldn't be disappointed to see these old tricks again, in a word, kids and young teens. I think this is really the last one for me. ""The Conjuring"" was really good, ""The Conjuring 2"" had its flaws, but in essence was also a good horror movie. It has been all downhill from there on (to be precise, starting from the ""Annabelle"" between the first two). This release isn't perhaps the lowest point of ""The Conjuring universe"", but consider it still a guilty pleasure with a bottle of wine after a hard work day when your brain doesn't work anyway.",Annabelle Comes Home

574,paglacholakha,"A series of terrible decisions, and not just by the living",4,29 June 2019,"I am not entirely sure what was happenning throughout the film.
So the protagonist girl knows ghosts exist, she knows she is in a house filled with supernatural stuff, yet when music suddenly starts to play in a different room, she isnt concerned at all. She casually goes there to turn the music off.
But in horror movies, we know these things happen, this movie was different because the stupidity the ghosts showed.1. Ghosts could turn the lights of an entire house off but escapes the moments our protagonist flashes a flashlight on their faces.
2. A particular spirit or something in a wedding dress is so powerful that a cross would turn upside down and fall off a wall when she passes by, but when she is about to attack our protagonist, all she does is hold the cross up and she escapes.There are many such things these ghosts do which makes you wonder, really, I am supposed to be scared of them??We have an exorcism that happens via a recorded video. Really, that is all it takes, a video recording?There is a scene where some says ""We are trapped"".
I thought, so what, big deal. These ghosts are doing nothing to you. All they are doing is switching lights on and off, turning music on and off, turning TV on and off, sometimes throwing coins at you.
Most of the time, they are just standing there.The ghosts would do something then wait 5 mins to do the next thing. As if after every action, their stamina runs out and they have to wait for the stamina to revive.Its just absurd and frustrating.",Annabelle Comes Home

Too many unnecessary monsters and ghosts with little to no story or purpose. Characters (especially one) doing the whole I'm-going-to-touch-this-or-go-in-here-because-I-can.

Hereditary is way way way better than this movie and doesn't use jump scares. The ghosts practically do nothing other than turn lights on and off, put the TV on and off, same with music etc and closing doors. Other than that, there was a knife stab which didn't actually happen. The ghosts don't even look scary.

602,poonamloveskanwar,Miss me?,8,11 July 2019,"I am a huge Conjuring universe fan and have watched all of their movies. I recently watched The Nun, which I found to be a tad disappointing as The Nun character is my favourite in the franchise and I felt that they didn't do it justice.
I have never really been a fan of the Annabelle doll, I just don't find her to be all that scary. I wasn't expecting too much walking into this movie, but my loyalty to the franchise meant that I had to watch it. Boy, was I wrong - it was a fast-paced, entertaining romp from beginning to the end. They went all out in this one, not only having Annabelle as the protagonist but a whole host of other demons and ghouls from the infamous 'artefact room'. We had the ferryman, the black shuck (a werewolf) and some sort of demon bride, to name a few. This may sound a bit extra, but it works. Why does it work? Well, I think that another movie based on the doll alone might have been a bit stale and repetitive, whereas the extra characters added a new dimension to the movie. The artefact room itself is a fascinating addition to the movie, as in previous Conjuring movies we merely get a glimpse of the room. Most of this movie is based inside the room.
The only downside to the movie is the lack of intelligence amongst the characters, but then again you can't have a horror movie with smart characters as it wouldn't work. Nobody would unlock the cabinet, thus keeping Annabelle locked away. The ending was unrealistic too as the characters are singing and celebrating a birthday right after their terrifying ordeal...surely they should have been traumatised by it all?
Now, wouldn't it be incredible if Warner were to publish the Warren's case studies for fans? They just seem so fascinating!
All in all, a great addition to the Conjuring franchise.",Annabelle Comes Home

The only thing that makes her different is her parents are the famed demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren. Judy can see things too. One night her babysitter and her friend accidentally unleash Annabelle.This movie is the direct sequel to the last Annabelle movie, the third in the Annabelle series, and a prequel to The Conjuring series. Directed by Gary Dauberman and written by James Wan and Dauberman, Annabelle Comes Home is one of the few movies to be a sequel and a prequel.Judy, played by Mckenna Grace, is just like her mom. She too can see spirits but doesn't tell anyone. Grace is best known for her role in Gifted and playing young Tonya in I, Tonya. She is great as Judy and stands on her own against the ""adults"" in the film. Ed and Lorraine, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, are hardly in the movie so it's up to Grace and the teenagers to carry the film.The movie itself is slow to start but once the scares get going they work pretty well and continue the rest of the film. Sadly, all the demons get muddied and had they stuck to just two or three terrorizing them it would have been more effective. The plot is pretty good as well. It keeps you interested and entertained. It has funny moments, sad moments and plenty of jumpscares.The Annabelle movies won't win an Oscar for anything anytime soon, this is probably one of the best in the series.

I then watched the same trailer a second time a little while afterwards, and absolutely hated it; I thought it was going to turn out like the first Annabelle film that came out, or even worse - The Nun. Safe to say my reservations were wholeheartedly wrong. I'm not saying this is a great advertisement of the horror genre, but rather a somewhat adequate film in the 'Conjuring' franchise when held in comparison to it's best films, i.e: The Conjuring 1 & 2 and Annabelle: Creation. This film had plenty of good moments: 1) It was well acted by the leads McKenna Grace; Madison Iseman & Katie Sarife and just goes to show that the franchise can indeed survive without it's two stars, Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga; 2) It had very good editing and cinematography, which has become a staple of this particular horror franchise.The scare-factor I found to be rather lacking; the film would often build up extremely well and then pull itself back from going over the edge, which I found to be a tad jarring. Nevertheless, this film had me hooked from beginning to end, and I would definitely recommend this as a watch when you and your friends gather for a ""horror movie night"".Highly enjoyable; I give it a 6/6.5 out of 10 - maybe even a 7 out of 10.",Annabelle Comes Home
634,diegoag-43300,"Omgggggg!!!! Great, great, great!",10,27 June 2019,I think it was awesome. The cast and effects were truly amazing. Definitely the best Annabelle movie so far. I recommend it very much.,Annabelle Comes Home
635,armeakin,Not scary,6,24 August 2019,Feels like Sabrina the teenage witch compared to others in the Conjuring universe. There is clearly a big effort to explain the stories behind lots of objects in the storage room rather than Annabelle.,Annabelle Comes Home
636,culturdkid,Not bad once you look at it like a comedy,1,20 October 2019,I love the Annabelle series however this lacks what the others had. Luckily we only rented had we seen it in the theaters I for sure would have walked out. Its predictable and laughable. Halfway through the movie we decided to treat it as a B movie and made jokes about it.,Annabelle Comes Home

639,sderousse,I feel like I'm watching the same horror movie over and over again,6,26 June 2019,"Let me just sum the whole movie up for you all:
Parents leave, just the kid and the babysitters in the house, house is haunted, ghosts everywhere, jump scares, then some jump scares, some more jump scares, then some more jump scares, oh and some more jump scares.
I mean honestly do they really think that this is actually scary, do they think they're viewers are 5 years old. Might as well have gone into a haunted house, at least I would actually enjoy it. I really hope this isn't how the next horror films are going to play out. What they need to do is actually hire some real writers, spend more than 5 minutes on the plot, the scary stuff, etc. spend some actual money on the movie as well so we can have some actual good special effects. Why waste our time with this excuse of a ""horror film"". When I watch a horror movie I want to actually be terrified. There needs to be more than just jump scares, like a really creepy plot and characters, kind of like the first two insidious movies, I actually had nightmares from those movies.
Watch this movie if you just need to fill an hour and a half while waiting for your parents or your wife and kids at the mall, don't expect anything new or original or certainly scary.",Annabelle Comes Home

641,geet_phadnis,Annabelle's Slumber Party,5,25 May 2020,"The Geets (Greats):Although unnecessary, this movie helps to expand the Conjuring Universe with many nice additions to future stand-alone Horror movies. It was interesting to see how some of these cursed objects materialised throughout the film.As always, some of the formulaic scares lived up to the expectations. This movies is enjoyable as a Theatre experience for cheap scares with little plot development.The Phads (Bads):This movie was an excuse to gain more profits for the film makers. There is no substantial plot development and the character developments seemed drowned by the many cliched 'jump scares' and different cursed objects and their materialisations.The main storylines consists of Daniella overcoming her guilt over blaming herself for her Father's death, thereby concocting a plan to enter the 'cursed room' in order to make amends with his spirit. However, there is little emotional investment into this storyline, and even the slightest investment is 'drowned out' by Annabelle and her supernatural 'friends'.This movie seems like a 'hot mess' with a weak plot and forgettable characters who seem to be dealing with many 'unleashed' spirits and demons. The different cursed objects, their manifested and mythologies are too much to digest for a standard movie. It would be better to make each of these into their own stand-alone movies for better effect.Even worse is the pure stupidity of events unfolding which lead to the poltergeist and demonic activities within the Warren's house. Due to this, the 2 teenage protagonists seem forgettable. Even the Daughter of the Warrens (Grace) cannot help advance the plot regardless of her good performance.To add to this, the pure unrealism of the situations unfolding is laughable. It seems like Annabelle and her otherworldly friends are just playing with their human hosts, enough for no casualties as a result of plot advancement.Furthermore the blossoming comical love between Mary and Bob makes this movie hard to take seriously. These comical moments only add to the sense that this is more of a 'family-friendly' Horror movie unlike its predecessors. It definitely ranks the lowest within the Conjuring Universe to say the least.Most of the scares are way too formulaic of the 'Conjuring-esque' style established by Mr. Wan and his team. In this day and age, something this formulaic will start to be shunned and mostly only enjoyed by an audience which relies on the thrill of the movie experience.This movie does nothing to impart philosophical and psychological intelligence which is sustained by Conjuring and other successful Horror movies. At the end of this movie viewing experience I highly believe most individuals would be left thinking 'what is the point of all of this?'Film-makers should try to avoid conglomerating many Horror mythologies into 1 movie, as this is only rarely successful in The Cabin In The Woods (2012).",Annabelle Comes Home

651,daltonbabadar,A real stinker...,2,27 June 2019,"What can I say about Annabelle Comes Home? Very little imagination was put into the film. Annabelle Comes Home does not bring something new to the universe. The film has a very weak plot that will leave you edging closer and closer to the exit door. The film becomes boring fast. The films startup is beautifully executed and starts to die after 20 minutes. Let's just say it's down hill after the graveyard scene. Scare points in the film are just rehashes not even allowing for a hair standing moment. It seems that the creators of Annabelle Comes home were trying to add another character to the universe with an over-the-top and completely fake looking hellhound that left a ""are you kidding me"" kind of taste in your mouth. This film may be good for someone who is starting to venture into the horror realm but not a well seasoned horror addict. If you do want to see the film I would wait for it to stream on a service that you are currently subscribing to. I don't think I would even recommend as a redbox rental as it's a turd in the bucket. Boring...",Annabelle Comes Home
652,igordimitrienko,Great tribute to the real Lorraine Warren. RIP.,8,26 June 2019,"I had absolutely no idea that the real Lorraine Warren died just a few months before this film was released. She passed on April 18, 2019, at the age of 92. This was definitely a nice tribute to her. Introducing Ed and Lorraine's daughter (Judy Warren) in ""Annabelle Comes Home"" made this film reach a different level. This film is very refreshing by taking the possession, the terror and the horror to Warren's home where the doll resides with just about everything else that's evil. It created a new atmosphere and presented us with the ""haunted house"" type feel. It was intense and quite the ride when things got going. The story was decent. The acting was decent. And the scares were decent. It is a decent installment to the Annabelle/The Conjuring franchise. Again, great tribute to the real Lorraine Warren. May you join and rest easy with Ed now. This film also marks the directorial debut of Gary Dauberman, who was involved with ""The Nun"" and the ""It"" remakes. adaptation and its upcoming second installment, now introducing the teen hungry installment of ""The Conjuring"" universe and actually delivering. Overall, ""Annabelle Comes Home"" is a good film that I would see again with the other Annabelle and Conjuring movies.",Annabelle Comes Home

We have enjoyed and rewatched most of the movies but this one was very disappointing. The movie starts with Patrick and Vera who are both crowd pullers but they end up just being a cameo. As from then, movie is very slow with very few jump scares here and there and the plot is easily predictable. A few comedy scenes which are not really necessary. Daniella's character soon becomes unbearable. The last scenes compensate for the whole movie but the ending is quite rushed.

To be honest Supernatural t.v. show should be rated R, and this film should be pg-13 at best. I'm glad I rented this instead of waiting my money at the movies.

The history of the items in the occult museum and even just the intro with Annabelle causing trouble in the car were good enough and I would've liked to have seen the backstories to the items more but instead they chose to go down the silly route and go too far with everything coming to life. It was a shame to only have Ed and Lorraine Warren in it briefly but waste time on the romance with the supermarket checkout kid and the babysitter which I felt was unnecessary.

I'm going to keep this short sweet and simple. Whatever you expect this to be it won't be, lower expectations and you won't be upset. Rushed film with very little direction, lacks passion and attention to detail. When I say their fans expected this particular film to be handled with care trust me we did. The moment the conjuring introduced this ""room of demonic relics/antiques"" we were drooling for films to encapsulate out fears and curiosities while expanding our imagination on unique scare tactics but nope.. rushed garbage not worthy of a R rating and definitely for the measly hour and 45 minutes wasted.",Annabelle Comes Home

Even seeing Ed and Lorraine as cameos at the very beginning and end of film were upsetting- why would they want to associate with this movie?Look, there's a painful love story and guitar serenade that have to happen before the first jump scare.

Also the werewolf was ridiculous, but the mini love story was cute and added some laughs.",Annabelle Comes Home

717,S-H-A-W,Not worth watching,5,18 September 2019,"I am a big fan of Conjuring franchise. And I love James Wan who is the writer and producer of this movie. This movie is an interquel, as it is set during the opening and ending plot of the first film.
The plot of the movie is not that interesting. A dumb teenage girl tries to make contact with her dead Dad. I mean, Why ??? She went into that room where Warrens kept all the ghostly possessions. And she touches each one of them as if they were just toys to play with. Why?? There were many monsters or ghosts with little to no story or purpose. There wasn't even a single jump-scare in the movie.
But there was a scene which I loved the most in the movie. Daniela watches an old television that shows a mute vision of a few seconds in the future where she'll be screaming and covered in blood.
This movie may be good for just a casual and fun watch. But it's a big disappointment for horror freaks like me.",Annabelle Comes Home

The only contribution is the new spirits were finally showed out which is likely to be in new conjuring series such as wolfspirit, wedding dress, jewel box, ferryman and samurai armor. I felt this director is trying hard to play as the shadow of James Wan and imitated his style in both weeping woman and this movie. Hope he can find out his own style in future spirit universe. A new beginning of journey for this serie.",Annabelle Comes Home
731,amarmy-19898,Surprised More Than Scared,8,27 June 2019,And I mean this in the best way possible. I was tired of watching the same pattern being followed in the Annabelle franchise and this one brings us something fresh to view. I had terrible experience with the first Annabelle movie and I'm not a big fan of Annabelle Creation because of its overuse of CGI. And so I was expecting nothing much for Annabelle Comes Home. But oh boy I was surprised with how the movie went on.The first half was okayish with all the introduction of the characters. Which was done in a very well manner I suppose. And they were believable too. The second half takes you on a crazy rollercoaster. It reminds me what made the first conjuring movie special. The pacing of the movie was very well done too. Every stupid action taken by the character had a logical and reasonable reason to do so. That's what I liked about this movie. It's not just plain stupid. When you feel like the chaotic scenes are over they hit you with some great emotional scenes which many horror directors of this generation seems to forget the necessity or the impact it has on the audience.I left the theatre with a smile on my face. And not many horror movies can do that. The director Gary Dauberman knows how to do it. Go watch it in the theatres and you won't regret it.P. S Bob's Got Balls😂,Annabelle Comes Home

738,oplunks,Great Scares but Basic Plot,8,29 June 2019,"I have always loved the Conjuring franchise with the Conjuring being my favorite movie. I saw it on opening night with one of my friends and we both really enjoyed it. The third installment is my favorite of the Annabelle franchise with the acting being great, the scares being more than just your classic jump scares with well built up scares that put you on edge without any resolution which made the movie even better.However, the plot was basic. It was essentially the three girls, Judy, Mary-Ellen and Daniela running around the house being attacked by the various cursed objects till they were able to get Annabelle back in the glass box. And then that was it. Having other characters such as Bob involved in the scares was fun and broke up the plot a bit, which was good. I am sure this is going to lead to more movies focusing on Judy (maybe a Nancy Drew type paranormal horror thing) which would be great to see, but I was a little disappointed because the plot resembled a haunted house attraction on steroids.",Annabelle Comes Home

742,dajanaeg,Wow,1,3 July 2019,"I've NEVER written a review , I didn't even have an account til now. I just HAD to write one after watching it because WOW.
As everyone said slow , legit takes the movie an hour just to get to the ""good"" parts. Daniella *sighs* was the absolute worst , I think she should've died or at least gotten badly hurt 😩 The whole movie was her fault. It made sense or even an attempt to do so. The 3 girls seen creepy things before reaching the climax and ignored them as if they're not in a house that has a room of possessed possessions. As if the sh** is normal👀
After that one VERY long day everyone just brushed it all off as if nothing even happened, as if Ed and Lorraine shouldn't know the severity of Annabelle's actual strength.
They had many opportunities to escape but ignored all the signs of danger beforehand. A waste , I'm so happy I didn't pay to see this because I spent the whole movie yelling at it😄
All in all , my main point is they never made an attempt to get in the CAR & LEAVE🤦‍♀️I'm not even going to proof read this before I post it to make sure it makes sense, just like the producers didn't before releasing this movie.",Annabelle Comes Home
743,angusstraford,"Lots of Potential, not much realisation of that potential.",6,4 July 2019,"Annabelle comes home was extremely disappointing, despite sadly setting itself up early with a lot of potential to be a very terrifying movie. It set itself up really well from the outset and with a few of the early jumpscares, the tension and suspense was set decently well. Unfortunately the humour that gave light breaks from the horror felt forced, unnecessary, and honestly detracted from the scariness of the movie as a whole. Further, (NO SPOILERS DON'T WORRY) the plot in the last act didn't really make much sense, even more so when compared with the other movies in the franchise.
Aside from some obvious plot holes, it's clear that this movie doesn't have the same fresh terrifying horror that we loved so much in the original conjuring. We need James Wan back to direct the next however many movies that are to come in this franchise.
To conclude, don't go into this one with high expectations and you'll enjoy it, it's got a few good jumpscares and its still an alright horror movie that'll definitely give you a jump at some point or another, definitely fitting in as not very much better than the nun however.",Annabelle Comes Home
744,missyreno,Creepy enough for me,8,6 July 2019,"I get scared easily, so this may not be the most trustworthy horror movie review. I also have watched a great deal of horror movies.

747,siddusubbarao,Not worth your time!!!!,2,9 July 2019,"Imma huge fan of the conjuring series but this is the absolute worst movie in the series of entry of movies so far. The first annabelle was trash, with minimal scares and a weal plot. The second 1 was super good which real good chracters and scares but this 1 is so bad. The story is weak with jumpscares only coming at the end. 40 minutes into the movie, nothing is happening and in the last 30 minutes the story writer just cramped the highest amount of jumpscares they could add. these werent even scary at all. Idk how this got an R rating becuase there as nothing. as per violence there was 1 seen where there was blood for like a second. Nothing else. they need to stop making these annabelle movies ecause now its just a stretch. The story is simple, 3 kids are in the lorraine house (2 babaystisters and lorraines daughter), the annabelle doll wreaks havoc. Not scary and rather boring. The first hour is a complete waste of time, with bare character development. and the last 30 minutes with all the scares are just unoriginal. All the jumpscraes are a charcter moving across the halls, the camera panning away from them and the monster coming from behind. gets boring after a while. just horrible.",Annabelle Comes Home
748,briannamitchell-41046,A Huge Disappointment,1,10 July 2019,"I have stated committed to the entire Conjuring franchise and watched all the Annabelle movies along with the conjuring movies and The Nun The last movie created, The Nun, was the worst movie so far in the franchise The movie tried to line its plot with humor and portrayed the demons as weak and stupid in past movies much of the fear stemmed from the fact that the demons will always be more powerful I have just watched the newest addition to the franchise ""Annabelle Comes Home"", and it was a huge disappointment The movie felt like it's lasted 30 minutes. The horror seems to only last for maybe 15 minutes in the middle of the movie I thought I would enjoy the idea of all of the spirits coming out in this movie, but this plot just seemed tacky. The demons produced no fear. I feel this was due to the fact that the actresses were not given room to actually seem afraid. They remained calm for a majority of the movie, as if the spirits being released were not actually that harmful to them When the few seconds of actual horror was over, the characters acted as if they were not scared at all. It's mentioned that she 'just' released a spirit, as if this isn't an issue and happens all the time in past movies the spirits killed families and created a real threat to the people involved it was almost like the producers wanted to create a movie that was suitable for younger kids overall it was not was I was hoping for from the franchiseSide Note: I did watch this movie at a drive in and therefore the screen was VERY dark I will be watching the movie again to make sure I did not miss anything. Maybe my review will be changed",Annabelle Comes Home
749,hafizulhaq-21308,Spoilerssss.,5,11 July 2019,"This movie seriously brought nothing new to the table. It seriously uses the exactly effortless scare tactics that has been used by every single horror film since the the year 2000. It uses the obvious tactics such as rocking chair, lights going off, torch going not working, the unexpected (expected) scenes involving a mirror and not so horrifying image of annabelle in it, and the most used uneffective scenes where the character see's the ghost directly and suddenly being blocked by a closing door just to open it and not seeing the ghost ever again. The characters have predictable way of acting/thinking, where there is always a menace character unleashing the evil out of ignorance or being playful. However, the little girl and her babbysitter are great characters. The babysitting scenario with her friend, and new found boyfriend being caught up in this horrific situation was entertaining. There is a high level of predictability through out the story because of its lack of originality and the fact that it seems the horror genre films have been doing nothing but recreating the same story again and again. I expected the girls parents to be somehow involved in the story as anyone expected, but them not being involved gave it a good different take suprisingly. They can do better tho. 5/10. NOT WORH IT AT ALL TO GO WATCH IT IN THEATRE SPENDING YOUR TIME WITH THE SIGNIFICANT OTHER OR WHEN IT COMES TO SPENDING MONEY.

758,jonathanwhite-80407,The Average Ratings DO NOT Give it Justice!,10,27 July 2019,"I'm a big fan of The Conjuring Universe and I recently saw this latest installment, Annabelle Comes Home, in theaters and really loved it. I loved it so much that I saw it twice, which never do! It has everything a good, spooky haunted house film should have, and it was delivered exceptionally well. But the ratings weren't.
The film delivers its creepy, suspenseful, eerie, and dark plot in an old school ""Conjuring"" style, which is great. The scares are creative, the performances are strong, the setting is very atmospheric (The Warren's house at night!), and the unleashed demons are menacing. The Bride demon was exceptionally scary. In addition there's The Feeryman, Samurai armor, a toy monkey, a Feeley Meeley board game, a haunted television that shows the future, a haunted telephone, a werewolf hellhound, and many more unique cursed objects!
All the demons Annabelle unleashed show their diabolic traits to the fullest, and it's an action-packed night of horror for Judy, Mary Ellen, Daniela, and Bob's Got Balls!
Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are perfect as Ed and Lorraine Warren, like always, even if their screen time is short. But this spin off helped prepare them for their bigger, upcoming roles for The Conjuring 3!
Annabelle Comes Home is a strong, well-needed addition to The Conjuring Universe that proves that there's still plenty of life in it for future installments. This is definitely the BEST ""Annabelle"" film yet and I can't figure out for the life of me why it only has a 6.2/10 rating on IMDB and a 65% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It's absolutely ridiculous and doesn't give this unique installment any justice.
It's as if critics are holding a grudge against the franchise because of its previous two weaker installments, The Nun and The Curse of Llorona. Unlike those films, Annabelle Comes Home does NOT have to rely on cheap jump scares to make it a quality film and terrify the audience. If it was up to me, the film would have a solid 6.9/10 and a 75%. That's more like it.
If you IMDB users enjoyed this film, I advise you to please give it a high rating right now! Thank you.",Annabelle Comes Home
759,stevejbriggs,Scardy cats only,8,28 July 2019,"This movie is a welcome relief to the other conjuring off shoots. Which have been a bit below par in my opinion. Nun was by far biggest disappointment shame it had so much potential.
I would put this movie up in the terrifying category with Conjuring and Conjuring 2. Best watched in cinema in the dark,up loud, phones off.
If you didn't like Conjuring don't watch this and would advise you not to watch occult horrors as you'll always be dissatisfied. This will be a classic.
Story is well .... thin at best. But hey who watches a horror for the story. It's the characters the suspense, lighting, shock scenes it's a really well made film.

Mr. wan, really knows how to write and produce horror movies to grab the audience on the edge. This film, ""Annabelle comes Home "", had an amazing plot, actors, and dialogue, but the horror was missing.. the makeup was incredibly scary just wish they used it more often in the film. Also, since both the Warrens' passed away, it would've been nice to know the cases in the film, like the ""Hellhound story"" the Warrens did.

Such likable characters, and so scary. I loved them bringing in all the terrors we only saw in the background in previous movies.

We were having too much fun and laughing during the movie every time there was a jump scare. An older lady didn't like how loud we were being so when we left she chased us out of the exit and we were not watching where we were going and fell down a 20ft hill that was very steep. In this process it felt like Annabelle was chasing us and it was a fun, crazy experience. The old lady couldn't keep up with how fast we were running so she gave up and went back to her car. In the end this scary movie brought us together with an overall crazy, hectic night. Definitely a thriller!",Annabelle Comes Home

No one dies in this movie.
No one gets HURT, in this movie. Let that sink in.
A Conjuring installment where no one even gets SCRATCHED.Great for a PG first-installment indie thriller film. Terrible, horrendous, insulting for a THIRD installment in a very bloody franchise.

773,benc-05025,Unexpected,4,1 August 2020,"I've just been reading the other reviews and I thought I have to watch it for myself to consider my own opinion and my opinion of the film wasn't the best.Plot, a 6 year old could've came up with that, parents go away I mean I guess the writers needed a way for a connection for the parents to go to London to deal with Bill Wilkinson.Jump Scares. This was probably the worst thing In the film, they were in 3 categories.Unneeded,Useless or Unintended
First you had the old guy lurking about at the school ( why not at the house, like the demons in the first insidious movie) you had the little girl at the door asking for Annabelle to come out which was unneeded, the wolf that was practically useless and the Minotaur sucking Judy's soul which was unneeded.Annabelle.Yes she came home, was locked in the safety case until Daniela failed to put her back safely and lock the case and she forgot to keep an eye on the cake 😂 and apart from that she was upstairs siting on chair and that was it. I thought the film was part of the Annabelle series And I think the fans will know what is expected to happen in Annabelle films but that in my opinion was boring so it wasted a bit of my time to be honest.Now I'm a conjuring fan I've seen all of the movies but I just want to let other fans know if they want to watch this film go ahead it's your own choice but it's not as exciting as you'd hoped it would've beenThank you for your time",Annabelle Comes Home

It is abit slow, but the suspense is there. It fails to deliver a knock-out punch - something to make the suspense worthwhile. Not enough of the demonic side of things in my opinion. Ed and Lorraine play no meaningful part either. It really needed them to come back into it for the end struggle scenes.

IMO this is just below average horror movie, so take it or leave it.The beginning is just too slow. It takes about an hour for something ""scary"" to happen, which is annoying for horror movie. Beginning is fullfilled with some romantic scenes and other meaningless things which gives nothing for the movie. Also characters are very poorly written. For example why Mary Ellen as a babysitter let Daniela to stay alone in the house, even though she knew that Daniela would start to search places for demonic objects? It sounds very reasonable to let someone alone to house which you don't own.
For myself I didn't like Daniela's character at all. Also this movie is digging a hole for other Warren movies because if just couple teenagers and schoolgirl can handle and beat all those demons at the same time, is there any need for Ed and Lorraine?It gives you couple of those moments you were waiting for but don't offer much. At least for me. I think that even the first Annabelle movie was better.",Annabelle Comes Home

Even my partner who loves horror films and followed all the conjuring franchise also barely able to watch some of scenes. It's just get horrific on certain scenes. Don't mention me, some parts really got me shocked.Be prepare for jump scare moment. It's a lot of them by the way. All thanks to the camera work. Its really really good. The director did a great job on it. He deserved a credit for that!I think most of you who watched the trailer already knew that this movie is not just about the scary doll. It's the new untold stories/haunted items that make the film more solid. Would love to watch more detail about them. Maybe a solo film like The Nun does. Just hopefully they don't screw it up.I personally think so far its the best Annabelle film. Even more exciting than Creation. All the actresses also really did well in the film. No doubt about them.

805,aaronva,Other Reviews,6,29 July 2021,"I don't usually write reviews but I felt it necessary because of the juvenility of other reviewers. This movie is an average horror/thriller. It's 5.9 rating seems to be pretty close to accurate. It is not a great Annabelle movie but it is actually better than the original Annabelle movie.The main problem too many reviewers have is that they go in with specific expectations which never leads to an appropriate review. The movie was not marketed as an Ed & Lorraine movie and those giving 1/10 reviews are just people being unnecessarily immature. This was not a TERRIBLE movie that had absolutely no entertainment value at all which is what a 1 or 2 star rating suggests.If someone does not like a movie, they should just say so and give an explanation as to why in broad terms if they can do so without spoilers and if they have to use them, they can flag it.Personally I do not understand why some people need to give movies absurdly low ratings just because they may be upset they spent a whole $10 to watch it. I hope these people can still retire after having to spend that much money.Finally, it's a movie. Too many people take movies too seriously or fail to suspend disbelief. If people just tried to enjoy a movie without pre-established expectations as to what a show is going to be or should be and just relax & not take themselves so seriously and let little things bother them they might come to realize what the purpose of movies are: entertainment. It's hard to be entertained when one thinks about a movie as if they were watching them as professional critics.",Annabelle Comes Home

While some of the initial jump scares were used effectively, the later ones were overused and predictable. Also, it sort of should have gone from horror to neutral back and forth to ease tension and buildup. Main problem is that it is a very predictable movie with a simple plot.Overall build up could be improved but movie gradually got worse progressively.
