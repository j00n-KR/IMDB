0,Leofwine_draca,Cheesy but fun Die Hard on a mountain,7,5 May 2015,"Yes, CLIFFHANGER is nothing more than DIE HARD on a mountain, and Renny Harlin's second best film following on from DIE HARD 2: DIE HARDER. It's an ultra-cheesy and ultimately funny action romp filled with special effects sequences which range from the breathtaking to the downright silly, and it's a film which is over the top and bombastic in every respect.The best part of the film is the electrifying - and much-parodied - opening sequence, and after that point we're in B-movie territory with an A-list cast and budget as backup. Sylvester Stallone appears in one of his more wooden performances as a haunted mountain guide who becomes involved with a criminal gang who are searching for three briefcases full of stolen cash which have been dropped high up in the snowy peaks.There are some fun one-liners here, along with plenty of action and stunts, so there's very little to dislike as the whole thing has a good sense of fun. The bad guys don't have much menace and concentrate more on chewing the scenery. John Lithgow gives the best performance as the chief nasty, a guy who couldn't be any less imposing if he tried (he's a far cry from his role in BLOW OUT) and he's supported by various unsavoury types. Craig Fairbrass, playing an ex-footballer turned international criminal, is a real hoot.Harlin's direction is acceptable and although Stallone is doubled for a lot of the difficult stuff there are some truly impressive stunts on offer here. Being a 1990s film, as much stuff blows up as humanly possible. Watch out for Michael Rooker in a rare good guy role.",Cliffhanger
1,SnoopyStyle,Some mountain climbing thrills,6,13 April 2014,"Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) is an expert mountain climber. While rescuing injured friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), equipment failure causes the death of Hal's girlfriend. Gabe is haunted by the death and blames himself. Eight months later, a government plane transporting bulk money is hijacked. However the 3 suitcases of $100M are lost in the aerial transfer. The criminal gang led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow) crash lands. Gabe and Hal are tricked into rescuing the gang, and are kidnapped to track down the suitcases.The money transfer looks silly when the whole hijacking is suppose to be thrilling. However the climbing chase in the mountains has its thrills and its spills. In the end, it's a fun little ride and probably better than one might expect from this standard B-movie.",Cliffhanger
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Starts off great, stays solid",6,12 December 2014,"""Cliffhanger"" is one of the most seen films from 1993. It reached no°10 in the box office ranking from that year. The director is Renny Harlin from Finland who has worked on several sequels to classic movies including ""Die Hard"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""The Exorcist"". The script comes from John Long, Michael France and lead actor Stallone himself. For some reason, the Razzie Awards decided to nominate this movie in several categories, which is pretty ridiculous as it is by no means a bad movie. John Lithgow is a great villain (as we know from ""Dexter"") and Janine Turner gives a decent performance as well. The Razzies really messed up by nominating these two as well as the screenplay and film itself. Turner was probably cast as she played the central character in an Alaska-based television series which was very successful at that point. Snow content seems to be her thing.The movie centers on Sylvester Stallone, who is sometimes displayed as almost too perfect here. Even when he fails to rescue a woman in the first thirteen minutes, we see that he did everything right. Everybody sees that except him and Rooker's (""The Walking Dead"", I did not recognize him though) character. That's why the friendship of the two men is also a crucial emotional plot point as the film goes on. The two go on an extraordinary journey when they get kidnapped by a group of criminals deep in the snowy mountains and have to help the thugs to get back some suitcases full of money.All in all, I enjoyed watching these 105 minutes. It's pretty good entertainment. There are minor flaws: For example, I did not understand really the inclusion of the two young guys in the mountains who added absolutely nothing to the story. Other than that, I can certainly recommend watching this film and I am not even a great Stallone fan. The fact that I knew Lynn and Lithgow (and these two had major roles) helped me a lot in appreciating this film I guess. Visually, it is pretty nice too. The snowy mountain landscapes are great to watch and I can see how this movie scored three Academy Award nominations. By the way, it lost the entire trio to ""Jurassic Parc"". I recommend watching it. The first 15 minutes are certainly one of the best intros to any 1990s movie.",Cliffhanger
3,Prismark10,Cliffhanger,6,31 January 2020,"It's Die Hard up a snowy mountain. Sylvester Stallone thought if Bruce Willis can get away with being a lone action hero. Then he will have some of that.Renny Harlin who directed Die Hard 2 brings some of the verve from that movie to Cliffhanger.Stallone plays Gabe Walker an expert mountain climber haunted by the accidental death of his pal Hal Tucker's (Michael Rooker) girlfriend during a botched rescue attempt.Now some months later Gabe and Hal are fighting to survive from master criminal Eric Qualen (John Lithgow) who wants both of them to hunt for three lost suitcases containing stolen cash.There is some gravity defying action some of it is overblown but it is wildly entertaining with some strong violence scenes. Lithgow chews the scenery as the villain with a hammy English accent. Again if Die Hard can have a mesmerising villain with a British accent then this movie will do the same.There is nothing much original here, even the score by Trevor Jones borrows heavily from his earlier film, The Last of the Mohicans.",Cliffhanger
4,classicsoncall,"""Gravity's a bi..., isn't it?""",7,3 May 2017,"Every once in a while I like to take in a Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagall flick just for the escapist value. Something like this serves the same purpose but without the martial arts mayhem. The thought that kept going through my mind as I watched the mountain climbing segments was how in the heck the film makers ever staged those scenes without putting the actors in mortal jeopardy. Stallone hanging by one arm directly over a thousand foot drop? - I really don't think so, but it sure looked that way from the vantage point of one's living room couch. This movie is a part adventure/part caper story, and the bad guys might have gotten away with their heist if they had thought through some of the possible unintended consequences. But we know that's never the case with pictures like this. The main thing I couldn't understand was how Gabe (Stallone) and Jessie (Janine Turner) managed to find cases number two and three after the first one wound up disintegrated. What did they have to go on? I guess by that point in the movie one shouldn't have to ask such a ridiculous question.",Cliffhanger
5,gavin6942,Cliffhanger? More Like Big Snoozer,5,1 January 2006,"Another Stallone movie. This should be all we need to say, but it's not. Why? Because it also has Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. And two ""extreme"" guys who should be in a Mountain Dew commercial or in ""Harold and Kumar"" listening to Wilson Phillips. But anyway. Coolest stalactite scene ever (although the competition is slim). Is Lithgow Walken? The part Lithgow was cast for was originally meant for Christopher Walken, but unfortunately Lithgow got it. (No offense to Lithgow, but Walken is the best character actor on Earth - he actually made ""Gigli"" worth watching - despite my unbridled love for Ben Affleck.) Long storyshort, this movie is awful. Everyone compares it to Die Hard, but that's a disgrace to the Die Hard series. This film doesn't have the decent plot or excitement those films have. And I'll choose Bruce Willis over Stallone any day when it comes to fighting terrorists (Willis is a one-man Homeland Security). If you have a fetish for Stallone, watch this movie. Or maybe if you really like IMAX films. Otherwise, watch Die Hard for the 42nd time.",Cliffhanger
6,jboothmillard,Cliffhanger,7,14 May 2009,"From director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2: Die Harder, The Long Kiss Goodnight) I knew it was about climbing, so I decided to try it. The film opens with Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone, also writing) trying to save the girlfriend of Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), but he couldn't hold on and Sarah (Michelle Joyner) fell to her death. Eight months later, Gabe has given up rock climbing, and it is only when there may have been a plane crash in the mountains that he and Hal are called to rescue. It turns out to be a bunch of criminals who have dropped three suitcases containing $100,000,000 in the mountains, and led by Qualen (Razzie nominated John Lithgow), these villains want the expert climbers to help them get it back. Gabe manages to make them believe he is dead for a little while, and with the help of fellow climber Jessie Deighan (Razzie nominated Janine Turner), they are determined to stop them getting to the all the suitcases, as they will obviously kill Hal when they have them. Also starring Rex Linn as Travers, Caroline Goodall as Kristel, Leon as Kynette, Craig Fairbrass as Delmar, Gregory Scott Cummins as Ryan, Denis Forest as Heldon, Max Perlich as Evan, Paul Winfield as Walter Wright, Ralph Waite as Frank and Trey Brownell as Brett. I recognised the opening sequence from it being spoofed in Ace Venture: When Nature Calls. Filled with some good chases, explosions and small gripping moments, it is a good energetic adventure film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Very good!",Cliffhanger
7,rmax304823,Let it go.,2,7 September 2006,"Approached this in the mood for a good action movie but it was overall pretty disappointing. Good Lord. How much suspension of disbelief can you demand of one human being? The story involves a handful of thieves and murderers taking four innocent Mountain Rescue Team hostages and forcing them to lead the way to three suitcases containing collectively some forty million dollars. Maybe it wasn't exactly forty million but, as you'll see, it makes no difference.You can mostly figure out what's going to happen from moment to moment and you don't have to work especially hard to do it. Sylvester Stallone escapes from captivity and acts alone against the hoodlums. Will he natter them in all sorts of unimaginable ways? Will there be one or two times when he is forced to doff his shirt and show off his muscles? If you really need to ponder issues like these you may find the flick more absorbing than I did.Think for a moment of a stereotypical action movie. The first red digital readout on a bomb that I remember seeing on film was in a James Bond movie, the one with Odd Job, from perhaps 1963. The movie was made 43 years ago, as of this writing. I'm not at all sure that there has been a single action movie involving a time bomb since then that has not features a red digital readout clock, ticking down the second. This movie gives us THREE red digital readout clocks attached to bombs. Okay? Getting the picture? Let me note, though, to be fair, that the final stunt was very well choreographed, a failed helicopter on the side of a huge mountain, slipping away, held only be a wrought-iron ladder from which Stallone is swinging. Don't ask. It's not as finely tuned as Harold Loyd in ""Safety Last."" But it's the equal of the stunt in ""Die Hard"" in which Bruce Willis leaps from the top of a skyscraper with a fire hose tied around his waist.Beyond that scene -- well. This takes place atop some giant snow-veined colossals, so we have multiple bodies falling through space, sometimes with parachutes, sometimes not. We have two avalanches, one of snow and one of rock, so you can thrill at the avalanche of your choice.The thieves are led by John Lithgow with a fake British accent. Often these otherwise mindless movies are redeemed by a good, smart heavy who has been given good wisecracks. Example: John Travolta in ""Broken Arrow."" Earlier (and classic example): Orson Welles as Harry Lime in ""The Third Man."" Not here, though. The wisecracks mostly fall flat, as if they'd been toppled from some stony peak. ""You'd like to kill me, wouldn't you. Well take a coupon and get in line."" There is one pretty good bit of dialog given to Lithgow though. See, this jet is damaged and wobbling around in the sky, and one of the gang has been wounded. ""What are we going to do with him?"" asks another thief. Lithgow: ""Get him to a hospital -- fast."" (Throws him out the door.) Otherwise the dialog is not only not innovative but redundant. A helicopter is chasing Stallone across a snowy field. Stallone is running like hell in slow motion, while Janine Turner watches. ""RUN!"", she screams.The hull of the helicopter with Lithgow trapped inside falls to the valley and explodes in a slow motion fireball. Stallone, his bare torso flexed, is trapped under a sheet of ice while a heavy stands over him and aims a machine gun at him. ""So long, Pal,"" says the heavy, or something like that. That's what he thinks. Stallone simply pulls out a pistol and shoots him several times -- THROUGH THE WATER.I wonder if I ought to revise my opinion when I reconsider incidents like that. Was the whole film supposed to be a comedy?",Cliffhanger
8,Tweekums,Great high altitude action,8,16 May 2017,"Gabe Walker was a rescue worker in the Rocky Mountains but after an accident where he was unable to save the life of a friend he has left the mountains. Almost a year later he returns hoping to persuade his girlfriend, Jessie, to come back to Denver with him. He has no intention to go climbing but events conspire against him. A treasury plane transporting a hundred million dollars is intercepted and hijacked in an audacious attempt to steal the money. The robbery doesn't go according to plan and the three cases full of cash fall into the mountains and the hijacker's plane makes a forced landing. They then put out a false emergency call, claiming to be lost hikers. Gabe's former friend, Hal Tucker, responds to the Call and Jessie persuades Gabe to go too although it soon becomes clear that Hal hasn't blames him for what happened in the opening scene. That is all put behind them though when they are forced to help the hijackers. Gabe is forced to climb for one of the cases but when he finds it he scatters the money and then escapes as the villains accidentally trigger an avalanche. While Hal is forced to continue helping, Gabe meets up with Jessie and the two of them play cat and mouse with the hijackers in an attempt to get to the cash first and save Hal.When one thinks of action movies that usually means either lots of shooting or martial arts; this manages to be different. There is some shooting and fighting but much of the best action is provided by our protagonists struggling against the rugged mountain environment. There is also the spectacular hijack sequence where a character uses a rope to move between two planes in flight. The scenes on the mountains look great; it looks as though the characters are really precarious positions rather than obvious green screen shots. The film gets off to a great start with the shocking death of Gabe's friend then gets even more exciting when the main story get underway. Sylvester Stallone does an impressive job as Gabe and is ably supported by Michael Rooker and Janine Turner as fellow good guys Hal and Jessie. The bad guys are pretty impressive too; most notably John Lithgow who is delightfully over the top as Qualen, the psychotic leader of the villains. Some of the action is quite brutal; surprisingly so as I'd previously only seen the heavily cut UK VHS release which is less violent and much less sweary than the uncut version. Overall I heartily recommend this to anybody wanting a fine action movie which features great stunts rather than obvious CGI.",Cliffhanger
9,BA_Harrison,Cold blooded killers!,8,26 February 2016,"Finnish director Renny Harlin, whose career gradually nosedived after the massive financial disaster that was pirate adventure Cutthroat Island, really should have stuck to the freezing cold environment he clearly knew so well: having already scored a massive hit with his sub-zero Die Hard sequel in 1990, he had an even bigger box-office success with snow-bound action adventure Cliffhanger, which starred Sylvester Stallone as mountain ranger Gabe Walker, who unwittingly finds himself pitted against a ruthless gang of plane hijackers searching for their lost cargo of cash.Essentially Die Hard on a mountain, with Stallone's Walker the fly in the hijackers' ointment, the plot really isn't all that original, but there is so much else to enjoy about this slam-bang slice of '90s action: the spectacular, rugged, outdoor setting, marvellously captured by cinematographer Alex Thomson; the gratuitous, bloody, brutal violence; the entertaining performances—John Lithgow is a blast, relishing his role as loathsome leader of the baddies, Michael Rooker is as great as always as Gabe's pal Tucker, and Eastenders star Craig Fairbrass hams it up a treat as Cockney thug Delmar; and, last but not least, Harlin's faultless handling of the action, starting with a masterful exercise in tension that will cause vertigo sufferers to have sleepless nights, and finishing with a wonderfully overblown set-piece involving a helicopter hanging off a cliff-face.",Cliffhanger
10,BandSAboutMovies,Rambo on a mountain,6,18 August 2019,"This movie didn't start out being about rock climbing.Carolco Pictures had originally signed Sylvester Stallone to appear opposite John Candy - of all people - in Bartholomew Vs. Neffa, a John Hughes written and directed comedy about feuding neighbors. That movie was dropped, but Stallone stayed on for two more projects.Isobara: Written by Jim Uhis (who adapted Fight Club and also wrote Jumper), this movie was about a genetically created monster set loose on a high-speed runaway train. Stallone and Kim Basinger were set to star with either Ridley Scott or Roland Emmerich directing. However, artistic disagreements between Carolco and producer Joel Silver caused this movie to get canceled.Gale Force: Described as ""Die Hard in a hurricane,"" Renny Harlin was set to direct Stallone in a film where he'd play an ex-Navy SEAL battling modern pirates in the midst of a large scale hurricane. It went through numerous re-writes over several years of development. In fact, they even brought Joe Eszterhas in for a rewrite and spent $500,000 on him turning the movie into an erotic thriller, which isn't what anyone wanted. The budget spiraled out of control and the film was canceled two weeks before production was to begin, but Harlin kept his pay or play deal worth $3 million.Somehow, Carolco then decided to spend double of Gale Force's budget on Cliffhanger and brought Harlin back to direct it.Due to Carolco's debt issues. half of the film's budget was paid for by TriStar Pictures in exchange for complete distribution rights in North America, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and France. Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera, Le Studio Canal+, and Pioneer Electric Corporation also helped finance the film, which meant that even when it was successful, Carolco saw nearly none of the money. Trivia note: This is the last movie to show the Tri-Star Pictures logo.Honestly, between Gale Force, Cliffhanger and Cutthroat Island, Renny Harlin pretty much decimated Carolco. I'm shocked people didn't try to have him killed.Mountain rangers Gabriel ""Gabe"" Walker (Stallone) and Jessie Deighan (Janine Turner, Northern Exposure) race to save their fellow ranger Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) when his knee gives out and he's trapped in the Colorado Rockies with his girlfriend Sarah (Michelle Joyner, Outbreak). Despite their best efforts, her harness breaks and her hand slips from her glove as Gabe tries to rescue her. Hal blames him for her death and he leaves for nearly a year.Gabe returns to gather his remaining possessions and try to talk Jessie into leaving with him. A distress call from a group of stranded climbers comes in, so Hal and Jessie go to help, persuading Gabe to come with them. Hal remains angry and even threatens Gabe's life at one point, but they soon learn that the distress call was a fake.It turns out that U.S. Treasury agent Richard Travers (Rex Linn, CSI Miami) stole three suitcases full of uncirculated bills valuing over $100 million. However, their plane has crashed and now he and a gang of criminals - led by John Lithgow as an ex-military intelligence operative - plan on using the rangers to locate the missing money. Lithgow took over for Christopher Walken, who left the production a few days before shooting started. Harlin's first choice for the role? David Bowie.Stallone would later say of the film, ""The director's cut was met with a lot of disapproval at the screening and received some alarmingly low scores. Mainly because the stunts were absurdly overblown. For example, the average man can jump maybe twelve feet across a gorge, and the stunts had me leaping maybe three hundred feet or more, so situations like that had to be pared down and still then were fairly extreme... so you're probably better off with this cut. By the way, the 2nd unit crew that filmed the majority of the action was extraordinary.""One of the recuts involved the scene where the rabbit gets shot at. Audiences hated seeing the rabbit die so much that Stallone spent $100,000 of his own money for a reshoot.There's also the issue of the Piton gun, which fires pitons directly into rock. Usually, in reality, climbing requires rock-drilling and piton-hammering. If the Piton gun were real, there would be shattered rock and shrapnel with each shot. But hey - when you're hanging off a mountain and making a movie, why worry about those kinds of things?That said - this is a surprisingly violent movie, as one scene where a henchman attacks Hal is incredibly bloody. Not a lot of people discuss this movie, but it holds up pretty well more than a quarter century after its initial release.The film is still in the Guinness Book of World Records for the costliest aerial stunt ever performed, a stunt in which Simon Crane jumps between two planes at 15,000 feet with no trick photography. Obviously, in the pre-CGI days, you did stunts like that. The insurance company refused to insure this stunt, so Stallone - man, he was just giving away what I make in five years to get this made - reduced his fee for the movie by the final cost of this stunt.TriStar Pictures planned to make a sequel called Cliffhanger 2: The Dam, which would have had Gabe defend the Hoover Dam against terrorists. This project almost made it to the screen in 1994 and 2008 before StudioCanal would make a remake of the film. That project was in development for nearly a decade before a female-centric reboot was announced in 2019 that will be written by Sascha Penn (Creed 2) and directed by Ana Lily Amirpour (A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night).",Cliffhanger
11,sunwarrior13,Stallone As A Rescue Climber,8,7 October 2012,"Cliffhanger is an action-adventure thriller that features Sylvester Stallone and John Lithgow together with Michael Rooker,Janine Turner,Leon Robinson,Paul Winfield and Ralph Waite.Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a member of a mountain-climbing rescue team who is haunted by an incident from his past when he couldn't save the girlfriend of his best friend, Hal Tucker,from falling to her death.It was directed by Renny Harlin.Gabe has left mountain-climbing rescue work and has set up business in Denver. He returns to the mountain rescue office to persuade his lover, Jessie to quit and come back to Denver with him. While he is begging Jessie to head out to Denver, things are happening in the skies overhead. A gang of professional crooks headed by psychotic Eric Qualen has hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane carrying millions of dollars. But the plane crashes, and the bad guys find themselves stranded on top of a mountain with the money that was placed into three cases scattered around the wreckage and with no way to get down off the pinnacle to retrieve the cases. They put in a phony distress call that is received by the mountain rescue team. Gabe agrees to take part in one last rescue attempt, and they head up to help rescue the thieves. But Qualen has plans for the rescuers to force them to climb through the dangerous snow-covered peaks to find the three suitcases of cash.Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us, and it works, especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three- mile fall, and the bad guys are stomping on him.Also,it is a big-scale action adventure with plenty of blood and blasts. It resembles some Shakespeare plays only in that by the end of the story almost all the characters are laying in pools of blood.Finally,it may go down in screen history as the nail in the coffin of the Die Hard sub-genre, in which all the key elements of that blockbuster have been recycled to the point of self-parody.",Cliffhanger

13,hitchcockthelegend,Superb actioner from Sly and the gang.,8,15 March 2008,"Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) is an expert climber, but after a tragic incident leaves a girl dead, he leaves the mountains to get his head together. After his self imposed break he returns in the hope of rekindling a relationship with Jessie (Janine Turner). Whilst at the rescue centre he is called to help a group who are stranded in the mountains, he agrees to help out this one last time, unaware that the group in the mountains are heavily armed murderous thieves and they need help of another kind...Directed by Renny Harlin, this is one of those films that shows that Stallone once had box office clout as big as his bodily frame. It's a delightful no brain action film that delivers royally to those with a bent for the action genre. What really lifts Clifhanger above average is the wonderful use of suspenseful situations. The film opens with a quite breath taking sequence and then kicks on to literally have us hanging on by our fingernails. The bad guys are deliciously over the top, none more so than the bullishly nasty John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, whilst Sly gets beefcake support from the ever reliable Michael Rooker. Cinematography by Alex Thomson is gorgeous as he brings to life the Cortina d'Ampezzo area of the Dolomites in Italy. Score is by Trevor Jones, who keeps it orchestral as he lifts from his own work for Last of the Mohicans, which in turn is mixed with what sounds like the lead theme of Alan Silvestri's work on Predator.Slam bang action, tense fraught moments, and a script written with knowing tongue in cheek persuasion, Cliffhanger literally does ROCK. 7.5/10",Cliffhanger
14,Theo Robertson,Fair Thriller,6,29 June 2002,"This gets off to a great start with a tragic and strangely affecting incident , but then CLIFFHANGER decides to delete the human aspects  and carry on being a straight forward blockbuster thriller which is a pity.Once again the bad guys have mainly British accents , but in a fit of artistic radicalism we have an American actor playing the main Brit villain. Wow maybe this might catch on , but seeing as John Lithgow`s  ( And just about every other American who has tried ) attempt at an English accent is rather unconvincing maybe not . You can also tell it was an American who wrote the script because of the dialogue "" Did I tell you I played soccer mate ? I was a really good soccer player me "" Eh sorry but it`s called  "" Football "" in Britain and the rest of the World  . It`s only baseball nations that call it "" Soccer "" . That aside CLIFFHANGER is a fairly good film , crammed full of exciting setpieces and the director does a pretty good job , especially the scene where the bad guys open fire but no gunshots are heard over the soundtrack only music",Cliffhanger
15,Hey_Sweden,Top notch action thriller.,8,21 May 2012,"Sylvester Stallone is in Haunted Hero mode in this slam bang bit of escapism, playing Gabe Walker, a mountain rescue expert who in the movie's opening set piece is unable to stop a climber from meeting their doom. Racked with guilt, he spends some time away before returning to his old haunt to ask girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner) to come away with him. This coincides with the actions of some ruthless airborne criminals who have purloined international currency from the Treasury Department. These people are led by John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, and Lithgow here shows he definitely has what it takes as an action movie villain. He truly is a cold blooded and nasty s.o.b.Director Renny Harlin proves once again to be a master of the large scale action film, keeping the pace going through one riveting sequence after another. ""Cliffhanger"" is the kind of movie where even at a hefty enough running time (1 Hour 53 minutes in this case) the time just flies by. Of course, this is due in no small part to the incredible setting. The Dolomite mountains of Italy stand in for the American Rockies, where the story is set. All of this natural grandeur really takes ones' breath away, and the sense of being at dizzying heights is extremely palpable. This is white knuckle stuff all the way. Taking away a little from some of the enjoyment are some stupid and annoying characters doing stupid and annoying things, but then, this movie is hardly unique in the world of film when it comes to that element.The bad guys, also including Rex Linn ('C. S. I.: Miami'), Caroline Goodall, Leon, Gregory Scott Cummins, Craig Fairbrass, and Denis Forest, are largely the kind of scum where you have a high old time just aching for their demise. And on the other side, the good guys are all likable enough, with Stallone showing again how he can be under appreciated as an actor; old pro Ralph Waite is delightful as Frank, and Michael Rooker is aces as Gabes' friend and fellow climber who's spent some time resenting him for that failed rescue attempt at the beginning of the movie. Other familiar faces lend a welcome presence: Max Perlich, Zach Grenier, Vyto Ruginis, Don S. Davis, John Finn, Bruce McGill, and the always solid Paul Winfield.Soaring music by Trevor Jones and excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson add to the enjoyment. This is genuinely exciting and suspenseful stuff that reels you in right from the start and keeps you watching the whole time. It's one of Sly's best ever vehicles.Eight out of 10.",Cliffhanger
16,LeonLouisRicci,Dangles and Dangles,5,3 June 2013,"True to its Title, a lot of folks do hang from a lot of cliffs, and they also hang from other things as well. Ropes, bridges, helicopters, trees, ladders, and credibility also hangs in the balance. This type of thing can be charm- fully exciting, Wow-Cool stuff.This one delivers quite a bit of that. But somehow nothing seems to work very well. The broad expanse of the landscape is beautifully shot but adds little to the menace. It is more breathtaking than, well, breathtaking in a suspenseful kinda way. The Villain, is usually a diabolical genius in the Genre, but here he is so stilted and unannotated (maybe he was freezing) that John Lithgow's usually creepy self is reduced to playing Second-Psycho to His Gang of the more Psychopathic.The Star and the Director have done much better Work elsewhere and go through the mountains motionless and everyone on the ""set"" seems surprisingly uninspired. In the end it is mildly entertaining and worth a view, but there are so many Action Movies that are better, that this one can only be considered lost in the Wilderness of its contemporaries.",Cliffhanger
17,poolandrews,"""In a minute I'll be dead but you'll always be an a*shole."" Great Stallone action flick.",8,3 July 2007,"Cliffhanger starts as the United States Treasury in Denver prepare to ship $100 million in a plane, however en-route over the Rocky Mountains in Colorado soon to retire agent Richard Travers (Rex Linn) turns traitor & kills his fellow agents aboard, a jet with know terrorist Eric Qualen (John Lithgow) & his henchmen aboard flies behind it as Travers performs a daring mid air transfer between the two planes. The plane's pilot (Kim Robillard) who is also in on the plan is supposed to send the money which is packed in suitcases across but things go wrong & the cases fall to earth somewhere in the mountains, the pilot is shot as is Qualen's jet which crash lands in the desolate, icy terrain of the Rockies. The men are desperate to get the money & agent Travers has a tracking device which will lead them to it but they need guides so they make a call to the local mountain rescue team who send Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) & Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) who Qualen intends to use to lead them to the money but Gabe knows once they have it he & Hal are as good as dead so sets about spoiling Qualen's plans...This Italian, French & American co-production was produced & directed by Renny Harlin & I think it's one of those terrific action packed unashamedly violent & excessive big budget adventure flicks from the 90's which they just don't seem to make anymore. The script by Michael France & star Sylvester Stallone is a story of an ordinary man who turns the odds on a gang of known international thieves in a far fetched but sensational way, basically there's enough needless killing, fighting, bad language, gun fights, crashes, improbable action set-pieces, plot holes, rock climbing & downright overblown silliness to keep any action junkie such as myself happy for it's two hour duration. The character's are pretty good although the scene at the start where Gabe tries & fails to rescue Sarah (Michelle Joyner) is quickly forgotten & doesn't really amount to much, the heroes are suitably heroic while the bad guys are suitably bad, what more do you want? The dialogue is alright & the story is quite exciting, it moves along like a rocket so it never bores & I just think it makes for fantastic action packed entertainment. A lot of these types of films are criticised because they are brainless, well that's true but that's why people do like them. They are pure popcorn flicks you can watch & enjoy all the wanton destruction & needless violence taking place, I'm a big fan of the 90's action flick & Cliffhanger is right up there with the best of them. There are a few silly moments like how Gabe manages to survive the avalanche that falls right on top of him, how he can swim in what would be literally freezing water without a shirt & survive with no ill effects & how the strapping on Sarah can magically un-do itself but what the hell no-one said these sorts of films had to be realistic, it's only a film right?Director Harlin does a good job & the mountain location provides a striking backdrop to the action, set in Colorado it was actually shot in Italy when apparently the American Environmental Protection Agency refused the production permission to film because of potential damage by the filmmakers! Cliffhanger also contains the most expensive aerial stunt ever filmed, at over $1 million the plane-to-plane transfer cost a lot considering how long it appears on screen. While the film does have plenty of action scenes they are mostly of the gun fight & beating people up variety, there's a plane & helicopter crash but not much else. One word of warning though, Cliffhanger in it's uncut state (sorry anyone who has a UK copy it's cut to bits) is an extremely violent film & a very bloody one as well with every bullet hit accompanied by a wound gushing blood.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Cliffhnager is quite well made & has impressive widescreen cinematography but there are a few continuity problems, for instance when Qualen's jet crash lands the final shot of it is of the nose overshooting a cliff edge by a fair margin but in the very next shot the jet is completely on the ground. The acting is OK but nothing special, apparently Christopher Walken had been cast as the lead villain before dropping out which is a shame because he's an intense actor & he'd have made for a great baddie.Cliffhanger is one of those 90's action flicks which are just so entertaining & overblown, this is one of the better ones with great action & loads of unnecessary violence. I liked it a lot & think there are far worse ways to spend a couple of hours, definitely recommended but just stay away from the rubbishy cut UK versions.",Cliffhanger
18,Calicodreamin,Mindless action,5,4 September 2021,"A mindless action thriller that has a shaky premise and even shakier science. Remove brain, then watch, and you might find a few enjoyable moments. Acting is actually decent and fairly good effects.",Cliffhanger
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Yup, there actually is someone dangling over a cliff every so often in this",7,7 February 2012,"Sly stars as Gabe, a rescuer in the Rockies, who fails to save the girlfriend of Hal, after which they both blame him for it(and really, that's the entire character of Stallone in this right there... and he's surrounded by an equally underdeveloped cast... if Lithgow is an enjoyable, if bland, villain). So he doesn't climb for a few months, and then goes back to the town, where his ex(who doesn't think it's his fault) sends him to meet his former friend(so they can discuss the subject of who should feel guilty for it) up on the mountain, where they're both headed to check out what turns out to be a faked distress call, sent by a gang of thieves(who, with the help of a moustache who betrayed his fellow agents(of the government), are looking for three suitcases full of millions of dollars, somewhere in the area(they have tracking devices)) who are prepared for almost any situation, somehow(I guess they expected their heist to go wrong...). The two try to sabotage their efforts, and it plays out like you'd expect. This is essentially an average 90's Hollywood action-thriller, if it's slighty better than that. That comes from a few aspects. For one, it's genuinely rather exciting. The pacing is tight, with next to no time wasted, and though some of the surprises lead to nothing, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. They got pretty creative with setting up scenarios, most of them credible, where nature is a real threat to these people. Heights, cold, drowning, being eaten, even claustrophobia is utilized to increase the tension(this must have been amazing to see in theaters!). The FX are highly impressive... they must have used a lot of stunts and practical effects. Everything comes off as realistic. There is overkill in this, and it does hit most of the major clichés. The bad guys are obnoxious, have no personality other than that and are constantly arguing(with their hostage, the turncoat and *each other*!). Dialog is deliciously dumb. The performances are decent, I'd say it's the writing that lets the actors down. This is also incredibly filmed at times. If the camera merely showed us the death-defying feats, it would be terrifying. But it goes further than that. The best example is when we arc around Sylvester scaling in the intro sequence. There is graphic, bloody and disturbing violence as well as plenty of strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys turning off their brain to take in their entertainment. 7/10",Cliffhanger
20,view_and_review,It was so much cooler back in '93,6,19 April 2020,"The only distinguishing characteristic of this action movie is that it was in the mountains with a lot of ice. This was experimented with before in ""Shoot to Kill"" with Sidney Poitier, Tom Beringer, Kirstie Alley, and Clancy Brown. In that movie there was a killer who needed a guide through the snowy mountains of Washington to get to Canada. There were no explosions, far less fighting and killing, and just overall better.""Cliffhanger"" stars Sylvester Stallone, John Lithgow, and Michael Rooker as your household names. Lithgow plays Eric Qualen, a supercriminal who has masterminded a heist of $100M from the U.S. Treasury. When his plane went down in the snow covered mountains of Denver he and his crew needed a guide to help them track their lost money. Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) and Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) would be those guides.From there it was a series of moves and counter moves as Gabe tried to stay alive as well as save his friend Hal. There were bloody fights with your typical comeback kills, shootings, and even explosions. There was even the kidnapped girl being used for a trade.""Cliffhanger"" was nothing special, it just gave us more death defying stunts than you'd ordinarily see.

21,neil-476,Terrific action adventure,9,12 April 2011,"Cliffhanger came at a very interesting point in Sylvester Stallone's career. After Rocky kicked him into the big league, he seemed to settle into a career pattern of gradual decline - Rocky and Rambo sequels with diminishing returns, and a succession of identikit action thrillers which passed the time and did little else. Then there was the ill-advised venture into action comedy with Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot!, and suddenly the decline was an outright slump.Then, to maintain the boxing metaphor, he came off the ropes with the mighty one-two of Cliffhanger and Demolition Man, as fine (and diverse) a pair of action movies as ever graced anyone's filmography.Cliffhanger starts with a nerve-shredding sequence - one of the best opening sequences of any movie ever - which takes mountain rescuer Gabe (Stallone) out of the business and destroys his confidence. Then there is a plane crash in the mountains. This involves a group of crooks led by John Lithgow attempting to steal a large amount of money. Gabe has to buckle on his crampons again in order to rescue his mountain rescue colleagues and defeat the bad guys.This movie is simple, spectacular, suspenseful, action-filled enjoyment from start to finish, and brought Stallone roaring back to the top of the box office.",Cliffhanger

Gabe knows the group will kill Hal as soon as they have the cash, so with fellow ranger Jessie, Gabe tries to reach the money before they do.....It was wonderful return to form for Stallone, after nearly three years of duds. And does this movie really make up for it. It's basically Die Hard in the mountains, and at the time of the films release, these were the most successful action films going. Seagal and Snipes had one going, so why shouldn't the second best action star of all time have one?Harlin grips the viewer from the word go, and the opening scene is one of the most memorable openings of any action movie, and sets the tone for the rest of the movie.Lithgow tries to out-Gruber Rickman, but despite his best efforts, can only pull out pantomime villain, albeit to great effect.The action is brilliant, and although its narrative is a little foolhardy (fight, climbing, fight climbing), you cannot help but get lost in all the action.Its Stallones best film from the nineties, and Harlins finest piece of work.A Brilliant start to a brilliant year of summer blockbusters.",Cliffhanger

26,Mr-Fusion,A peak for Stallone in a hit-or-miss decade,8,18 February 2013,"On paper, ""Cliffhanger"" probably shouldn't be nearly as entertaining as it is. It plays like the run-of-the-mill ""Die Hard"" knockoffs that littered '90s cinema, with a curious assortment of unintentionally hilarious bad guys and some pretty cheesy one-liners. But I've had a soft spot for this movie for 20 years now, and age isn't curbing that anytime soon. For an action movie, it's tightly wound and moves pretty damn well. The stuntwork is right up there and the gorgeous mountain scenery doesn't hurt either. And they spared no expense on bloody carnage; I was surprised by the level of violence for the time. Oh, and Lithgow? That guy does scenery-chewing wonders with (what could've been) a stock villain. He is undoubtedly a highlight of this movie.Sometimes you're just in the mood for some cheap thrills, and to that end, this is comfort food.8/10",Cliffhanger

After they radio for help, Gabe and his partner Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) respond, not knowing they would be forced to guide the thieves to locate the money.This is an exciting little action flick full of thrills and roller-coaster rides as our heroes attempt to scale the mountain in search for the missing money before the bad guys do. Thrown in the mix is a daring rescue mission and awesome stunt work. Stallone makes a formidable action hero while Lithgow makes a ruthless, love-to-hate lead villain. The plot is fast-paced and the acting is serviceable, albeit a little corny at times. One major issue I had is that I didn't like the part where the villains first appear before Gabe and Hal.

29,sddavis63,Fun High Altitude Action Movie,7,12 January 2009,"Overall, I thought this was a pretty passable action/adventure movie that featured a bit of an outlandish story about a group of international criminals who steal millions of dollars from a US Treasury plane and then have to depend on a couple of mountain rescuers to help them find it after a crash. The movie featured pretty good performances from the very versatile John Lithgow as the mastermind criminal Eric Qualen, as well as from the generally one-dimensional (read Rocky Balboa) Sylvester Stallone as climber Gabe Walker, who overcomes a tragedy at the start of the movie to become the great hero by the end. There was some pretty exciting action that was scattered throughout the movie, thus keeping the viewer interested, a lot of bad guys to root against, and a good supporting performance from Michael Rooker as Walker's rescuer sidekick Hal Tucker. In addition to the outlandish plot, there were a few things that just didn't work for me. Why it was decided that this movie needed to include a couple of pretty typical ""stoner-type"" characters is a bit beyond me. The two kids added nothing to the movie and really served only to irritate me. Then there was the absolutely unnecessary (and at least mercifully brief) bat-scene in the crack through which Walker and Jessie (Janine Turner) were crawling. That also accomplished nothing except allowing any bat-squeamish viewers to go ""eeewww"" when Walker sticks his hand in guano and the bats start to fly at them. Finally, does anyone actually believe that John Lithgow could hold his own in a fistfight with Sylvester Stallone the way the respective characters did at the end of this movie? Not likely, in my opinion. For all that, for a movie with a story that was at best very limited, this movie was fun most of the way through, which gains it a 7/10.",Cliffhanger
30,thesar-2,Hanging Around for More Action,6,27 June 2010,"If you were to add up all the bad things with 1993's Cliffhanger, you'd only have half of the number of positives.Sure, when the movie's bad – dialogue, clichés, laughable acting and too many slow-mo shots– it's bad. Really bad. But I remember the only other time I've seen this movie was when it first came out 17 years ago and I would've called it a guilty pleasure, if I knew what one was at that time.I loved the cinematography – it was beautiful, I loved the suspense and despite the (most times) predictable script, the opening blew me away. Yep, it's a major plot point, but unfortunately I can't spoil it. It's a wonderful and grand scale beginning that most directors would actually use as their climax verses their prologue.And even though the film concerns mountain-men who climb up to get idiots down, there actually was a lot of action, explosions, hand-to-hand combat in addition to gun battles.Stallone plays Gabe, Rocky Mountain Rescuer Extraordinaire, who participated in an accident and leaves the high altitudes and wife behind for more than a half a year. As in most action films, the retired is always drawn back in for one final mission and low & behold he needs to assist when criminals plead for help recovering thousand dollar bills located in three remote areas.Actually, it's pretty exciting how that was really set up, or that the suitcases of cash were distributed. They really spent a lot of time making a whole lot of nothing into multiple action segments.Suspending your disbelief involves ""every-day-man"" Stallone who gets his ass kicked from Colorado to Castle Rock. But, if you can get past that, and the occasional obvious blue/green screen and scenes lifted out of Die Hard, you might enjoy the thrill ride. Despite the layman's obvious plot holes, I'm sure there are more for people who actually know a few things about rock climbing. I don't know the first thing, so it's just exciting and suspenseful for this amateur.Okay, it didn't prove a huge box-office sensation or that Stallone could act or write, but it's an enjoyable adventure that absolutely requires your brain to be checked in at the door before viewing.",Cliffhanger

He's hijacking the shipment!,6,25 November 2011,"***SPOILERS*** Sylvester Stallone as mountain rescue climber Gabe Walker has a chance to show off his muscles in this high climbing adventure while wearing in most of his scenes a sweat drenched t-shirt in sub-zero temperature. That as he tries to get his nerve back that he lost some eight months ago.It was back then that Gabe in an attempt to save her life lost his best friend Hal Tucker's, Michael Rooker, girlfriend Sarah's, Michelle Joyner, grip as she was dangling some 4,000 feet above ground level when her security belt gave out! With Sarah's tragic death and his friend Hal holding him responsible for it Gabe just dropped out of sight not willing to face or see anyone for over eight months.Now in town to get back with his girlfriend mountain ranger Jessie Deilghan, Jennie Turner, Gabe suddenly finds himself face to face with arch-enemy Hal Tucker as he's reluctantly recruited to save a number of people lost in the high Rockies after their plan crashed. What no one realizes is that the persons trapped in the snow are a gang of skyjackers who sky-jacked a government plane with over 100 million dollars in denominations of $1,000 dollar bills! It's the skyjackers headed by former US Government Intelligence Agent Eric Qualen, John Lithgow, who want Gabe and Hal to find the cash,in three large suitcases, that they lost during the failed skyjacking attempt!****SPOILERS**** It takes a while for both Gabe & Hal as well as Jessie to figure out what Qualen & Co. are really up too but that's after all three ended up getting captured by Qualen and his gang. It's Gabe who escaped, wearing only a t-shirt and pair of torn up pants, and made it to safety who had to save his fellow mountain rescuers Hal and Jessie's lives depended on the Qualen Mob getting the lost money which Gabe was threatened or better yet blackmailed to find. But in what we soon see how Qualen & Co. interacted with each other, by murdering themselves over the slightest mess-up, it's a given that as long as the cash is not recovered that will assure that both Hal & Jessie will remain alive!***MORE SPOILERS*** Great action scenes with both Gabe & Hal really getting worked over by Qualen and his thugs but still having enough left to finally put them out of commission. Incredible final sequence with Gabe & Qualen having out on a disable helicopter hanging by a string, or cable, on the side of a one mile high mountain. Gabe who in all reality should have died from the beatings he's taken as well as the bitter cold, wearing only a wet and unfrozen t-shirt, was able to turn the tables on Qualen at the very last moment. In the end Qualen ended up with his fellow hijacked for all intents and purposes dead and buried in the snow. And as for the 100 million dollars in $1,000.00 dollars bills that Qualen & Co. was after: It ended up burned shredded and blown away to the four winds where,in the high snow covered and impassible Rockie Mountains, no one would ever find it!",Cliffhanger
32,Robert_duder,Another Stallone action classic...but was it always this cheesy?,7,8 August 2007,"I love Stallone films, Sylvester Stallone is one of my faves...mock if you will. Cliffhanger I had seen many, many years ago and considered it a Stallone must see and it was only recently I sat down to watch it again in order to review it. It was still the guns blazing, vertigo inducing action film I remember with absolutely stunning shots of mountain tops and amazing stunt climbing (all done without the benefit of computer generation or trick shots.) What I was a little surprised about was that I don't remember the stunts and some performances being so cheesy and I don't mean Stallone. I mean I give the film makers kudos for keeping it real by not doing a lot of over the top, ridiculous stunts and having the actors actually battle it out against each other but there were shots and scenes that were almost laughable by today's action standards that show this film wouldn't have a prayer if it were released today. If you read a little about Cliffhanger the costs were astronomical and they did so much of it without the aid of special effects or trick camera shooting but some of it just seems so cheesy watching it now. Still the story is good and most of the performances are very strong and you definitely get attached to the main characters. It's not quite the non-stop, adrenaline pumping action film I used to think it was...in fact so many of the stunts and scenery are so much alike that it almost drags just a little. Still it's unique in that way as well.Sylvester Stallone headlines the cast during his peak (no pun intended.) Say what you will about Stallone but the man can command the screen and is a powerful presence. I happen to think he can be a very versatile actor and has this way of, even in action films such as this one, being a very emotional and important character. Stallone also co-wrote the script and put a lot of time, effort and money into the film. He does a terrific job as disgraced mountain climber Gabe Walker who left it all behind after being unable to save his best friend's girlfriend from plummeting to her death. He returns to the Mountains just in time to get caught up in a high stakes robbery for millions that has been inadvertently spread all over the mountain range. Michael Rooker is also really good in his role as Hal Tucker, the best friend and fellow mountain rescue ranger. Tucker has some incredible stunts to perform and is under duress through the whole film but is really a hero as well. Janine Turner is Stallone's love interest who was left behind by him when he took off from the mountain. Turner is decent and they establish a strong relationship between them early on but she kind of comes across as a little bland, and looks like a deer in the head lights and kind of just weighs everything down. Her character is important to Stallone's character arc but she doesn't really succeed in being all that significant. John Lithgow, plays blood thirsty super villain Eric Qualen and I KNOW Lithgow can play evil and I know he is a very versatile and brilliant actor and he has his moments of really being creepy but he also has a bit of a cheesy performance going on. His accent and the way he performs certain lines and situations comes across as being cheesy and takes away from how evil he really is or could be. Stallone and Lithgow don't have that good vs evil, hero vs nemesis chemistry that I would have hoped for because I think they could both pull it off. Rex Linn plays almost a better super villain as the sleazy treasury agent working with Qualen. But his character is very whiny and a weak villain the way they wrote him.The big draw to Cliffhanger is exactly what you'd expect...the cliffhanging. Renny Harlin did an absolutely incredible job filming the breath taking views from these mountains. The stunts were first rate and all done with actual people. Because this is such an isolated set to work with it almost feels a little monotonous by the end which is unfortunate because that doesn't make it any less beautiful but you can only enjoy a shoot out in a cave or on the side of a ledge so many times. There is no shortage of gruesome deaths and a few really intense moments but it never really reaches the status of a truly remarkable action classic. Still if you're a Stallone fan, there is no avoiding it and you'll enjoy it. 7/10",Cliffhanger
33,bowmanblue,Doesn't actually end of a 'cliffhanger' but not to worry,7,31 May 2015,"Sylvester Stallone sort of fell out of favour at the Box Office (just slightly before Arnold Schwarzenegger did), so many see 'Cliffhanger' as a kind of 'come back' film. To be fair... it did produce Stallone's best returns in terms of revenue at the Box Office. It may not have the 'cult appeal' of Rambo, but it's still pretty good if you're into a solid little action film.As with the best films (and certainly the action-orientated ones) the plot is simple – a gang of bank robbers lose their loot while flying over an American mountain range. To get it back they kidnap the only man capable of scaling the treacherous terrain and try to force him to recover it for them. Unfortunately, the only man is Sly, and he's not going to make it easy for them.So, as many people have commented, it's basically 'Die Hard in the snow.' And that's a fair appraisal of the film, but, seeing as Die Hard was a classic, there are worse films to be based on. Plus Sly adds a natural A-list quality to the proceedings, making sure that no one ever thinks that this is nothing more than a glorified B-Movie. Plus you have John Lithgow (sporting a pretty decent British accent for some reason) as the head bank robber, who displays the menace that would also be present in later series of Dexter.It's a simple enough action film. It has all the thrills, kills and set-pieces that you'd expect from any action film that has been given a decent budget (and this one definitely has!). You don't really need to pay an awful lot of attention to the plot to enjoy it, just be in the mood for some harmless (well, not for the bank robbers anyway) fun and watch Sly do what he does best – kicking bad-guys' asses.Bonus points of having Michael Rooker (now better known as 'Merl' in The Walking Dead) as a good guy for a change!",Cliffhanger

He also got a chance to perfect his patented ""Sly running for his life slow-mo"" move which would turn up in most of his subsequent films.In fact this was a one and done. He never took this sort of role again preferring either Rocky variations, Mission Impossible variations, or roles involving a suit and tie and a sharp outfit.So the film has historical value mainly As a film ... it is OK.

36,The-Sarkologist,This movie is certainly no cliffhanger,3,18 November 2011,"Well, this movie did not really live up to its title. To me a movie can't really be a cliffhanger because we are watching everything in one straight shot. Doctor Who on the other hand was brilliant at just simply leaving the story hanging drawing the audience back the next night, or week, to see how the situation was resolved. Cliffhanger was not like that. It did not keep me gripping my seat and the only thing I was waiting for was for the bad guy Qualin (John Lithgow) to die and the movie to end.I could end here because to me there wasn't much in this movie that I have not seen before. The scenery didn't thrill me and the cinematography wasn't all that crash hot (unlike Bad Boys where it is brilliant). The reviewers seemed to have loved this movie but personally it may have been breathtaking in the cinema, but it was not at all breath taking for me. Stallone's character does not need a name because the character is simply Stallone. He is a very good actor but when directors cast him to be the typical brutal action hero then I am not really impressed. Tango and Cash was not Stallone and that is what I liked. Here he was a typical clichéd hero in a different role, where as he might be a cop in one movie, he is a mountain man here. No real point to it.John Lithgow and his gang of thugs are pretty poor. They are just too brutal and evil to really catch my interest. They may have been cool and calculating in the air, but on the ground in the mountains they are just desperate, sadistic, and just running around with signs on their back saying ""kill me please!"" John Lithgow puts it aptly in his line, ""I guess you want to kill me, well take a number and get in line."" That is in line behind all of the audience who simply want to see him dead for being such a pathetic bad guy. Bad guys are supposed to have style and sophistication. They supposed to know what they are doing and have a goal in mind. They are also supposed to be intelligent, especially if they are able to pull off a mid-air heist such as the one the pulled in this movie. Lithgow is none of these, he even lacks the intelligence to know that you don't kill, or even intimidate your guides. You play it nice and easy. But if they were to do that then there would be little room for your stunts. Personally, I could probably rewrite this movie to make it much better.",Cliffhanger
37,slightlymad22,Of Of The Greatest Openings To A Movie Ever,7,25 January 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to 1993's Cliffhanger.Whilst his muscle bound rival, Arnold Schwarzenegger was scoring huge with Terminator 2 in his last movie, Sly's movies were tanking and tanking hard. So after coming to terms with the fact he wasn't going to score a hit movie with comedies, and unable to return to the safety net of Rocky and Rambo (after the last movies under performed) Sly returned to the action genre, more in need of a hit than ever.Plot In A Paragraph: A botched mid-air heist results in suitcases full of cash being scattered throughout the Rocky Mountains. Mountain worker Gabe Walker (Stallone) is forced to guide the high jackers (Led by John Lithgow) to the suitcases. Cliffhanger has one of the greatest openings to a movie ever!! I rate it up there with Jaws, Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Saving Private Ryan! It's that good!! Renny Harlin is a director who is either great or awful. Thankfully it's the former here, and the action scenes are all brilliantly (if slightly unbelievable) staged. Trevor Jones score is a real winner too. Despite some awful stunt doubles, some dodgy use of miniatures, and obvious studio sets mixed with real footage, Cliffhanger is very enjoyable. With the exception of an over the top John Lithgow, Rex Linn and Caroline Goodall, who all put in fine turns. The villains are as cardboard, two dimensional and cliché as the come. But this is the Stallone show, and backed up by the always reliable Michael Rooker he is back on top form. OK it's still a bit of a one man army story, but it's certainly more believable than the last Rambo. He may not be the number one Box Office Star in the world anymore, Kevin Costner, who'd been scoring big in The Untouchables, No Way Out, Bull Durham, Field Of Dreams, JFK, Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, The Bodyguard and the Oscar winning Dances With Wolves (which he directed) whilst Sly movies under performed, had over taken over him as the biggest movie star on the planet. And rival Schwarzenegger was doing better than him too, thanks to Predator, Total Recall and T2, but Cliffhanger proves that back in the action hero role, Sly still had it in him to deliver the goods.",Cliffhanger
38,UniqueParticle,Cult classic gem,10,24 August 2020,"I can't believe I didn't see sooner this movie is totally awesome! One of Sylvester's best roles easily and underrated.

The cinematography is incredible, catch phrases galore, guns, kicking, stunts up the wazoo, stylish shots, tense music, and silly action humor.",Cliffhanger
39,paulclaassen,Good old-fashioned action adventure.,6,21 June 2021,"'Cliffhanger' is a good old-fashioned action adventure thriller with a simple premise and without a twist ending. After a nerve wrecking opening scene I knew what was in store for me, and I was looking forward to it!The film revolves around rescue worker Gabe (Stallone), who blames himself for a friend's freak accident, and coming to terms with what happened. He then finds himself on another 'rescue mission', but soon discovers there's much more than meets the eye, and the mission becomes a fight for survival. John Lithgow stars as the film's antagonist, Eric Qualen - mastermind of a cash heist. This man was born to do bad guy roles! He is excellent! Stallone also makes for a credible hero.The opening scene determined the character actions for the rest of the movie. This was well set-up and made me understand the main characters better, and root for protagonists Gabe, and Hal (Michael Rooker). I loved the adventure element and setting on the mountain.There's lots of action, intrigue and suspense to keep the viewer glued to the screen. This is a really exciting film, with a good climax. Pure entertainment!Would I watch it again? Yes.",Cliffhanger

41,johnnyboyz,Workable action film in the Die Hard mould which is quite watchable.,6,23 September 2018,"I can just imagine a snowy, mountain-set drama of around 90 minutes involving the majority of the characters in ""Cliffhanger"" working quite well - they would spend it reconciling with one another about past times, and fleshing out what they felt about things. The chill of the surroundings might act as an extension for how everybody's feeling: the cold, bleak whiteness of it all working well as a metaphor for emotions and outlooks and whatnot. It would be a film about love; loss; guilt and rediscovery. Instead, what we end up with, after an admittedly impressive opening act, is what one might have described at the time of ""Cliffhanger's"" release as Die Hard 2.5 - second unit material kicks in; character takes a seat at the back and we are able to quite easily discern hero from villain. This is not to say that ""Cliffhanger"" is a bad film - it is not, in fact it is a fairly nifty actioner combining a familiar story of a heist gone wrong with the odd disaster genre convention thrown in unfolding in a bleak, snowy wilderness. Its characters are divided into two camps: innocent mountaineers who are, in the classic John McClane sense, in the 'wrong place at the wrong time' and crooked thieves looking to make off with millions of dollars in stolen hard currency. The camps themselves are, interestingly, divided further still: the inside man on one side doesn't much like the goons he's working with, and two mountaineers played by Sylvester Stallone and Michael Rooker have an old score between them...Said score confronts us in the opening, where Stallone's character Gabe Walker is ably making his way to the top of a piste without the use of any wiring such is his natural ability to do such things - unlike certain other characters, he has no need for a chopper. At the summit is Rooker's character Hal Tucker and his long-term love interest, whose first love of Rooker's (climbing) she is having a bad initial contact. It gets worse: turns out they were stuck there, and Walker's rescue attempt goes wrong when the girl gets stranded half way on a rescue line and plunges to her death when it cannot hold her. The action-hero 'type' is thus subverted - Stallone does NOT rescue the girl before going off into the sunset. One year later, Walker comes back to the mountain rescue centre where Tucker; Janine Turner's Jessie and an elderly paramedic still work to woo Turner's character away and with him to a new place. Tucker, as you can understand, is not best pleased to see him. Meanwhile, three security briefcases are lost in transit by a gang of crooks led by John Lithgow's Eric Qualen, whose haul evades him by way of zip wire in exactly the same way Gabe lost Hal's better half, thousands of feet above ground. Lithgow's increasingly unhinged partner in crime and one-time mole Richard Travers (Rex Linn) is along for the ride and still valued given it's his security device which tells them where the cases are located. Much of this is a prompt for a series of toing and froing when Tucker and Walker are caught by the cons and made to hike around searching for the final case of money, which has blown further away from the other two. A number of things work well here - the villains don't know how to navigate the mountains, and so require the mountaineers who do, but they in turn know that their lives are in danger once they find said case, so need to delay proceedings for as long as possible while they figure out what in God's name to do. Additionally, nobody in the vicinity of any of this actually seems to like one another...Renny Harlin, who actually directed Die Hard 2 prior to this, essentially re-renders the Colorado mountains the Nakatomi Plaza skyscraper from the initial 1988 entry: avalanches replace explosions, cliff-edges replace roof-top ledges, snow and ice stand in for broken glass. The film works better as a B-movie actioner than a piece depicting taut, elongated changes in heart - as said actioner, the villains are suitably sadistic; the heroine is suitably in need of rescuing every so often and Stallone's hero is suitably flawed. Meanwhile, the backup takes the entire film to arrive at proceedings via a helicopter. The film possesses various themes and content to do with forgiveness; redemption and love, but they are too buried at the core of ""Cliffhanger"" for us to really notice, or care - kept there under close observation so as to not interfere too much with the primary content. This fact doesn't make ""Cliffhanger"" a bad film, only keeps it from being a really good one.",Cliffhanger
42,pmtelefon,Top-shelf Sly,9,14 January 2020,"I'm saying this as a fan: ""Cliffhanger"" is one of Sylvester Stallone's best movies. Sly has made his fair share of great movies (and at least one bona fide film classic) and ""Cliffhanger"" is one of them. This is a very exciting, often emotional, movie. Sly gives a nice performance. The rest of the cast is also very good. ""Cliffhanger"" is also a stunningly beautiful movie to look at. There is more than one ""how'd they do that?"" kind of moment. I saw ""Cliffhanger"" in the theater (Fresh Meadows, NY) when it first came out. I really enjoyed it then and I still really enjoy it now. I need to watch this one more often.",Cliffhanger

One man takes on a group of mercenaries, the lead flies, and he kicks butt. It could have been called ""Rambo Goes to the Rockies"", it was that pat. It did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror. Not a bad picture, but just same ol', same ol'.",Cliffhanger
46,hellraiser7,The Peak of Thrills,10,24 December 2019,"This is my fourth favorite Sylvester Stallone film and it's another one of my favorite action films of all time. This action film is just thrilling from the kickoff of things to the end, heck even the trailer to the film is exciting to watch and still is, just listening to that operatic music and the movie clips spliced in, it just sang thrills and excitement.The plotline is solid, it's a simplistic plotline which I'm like nothing complicated. But what makes this unique is really in its setting. I like the fact that this is set in a rocky mountain terrain which makes the situation even more dangerous as it's a deadly combination of not just beating the odds and surviving against the bad guys but also surviving the elements.Antagonists are solid as it consists of a unique group, the one that stands out the most of course is, John Lithgow one of my favorite actors this is one of my favorite roles from him as he plays Eric Quailan whom is an honorable mention in favorite fictional villains. Once again, another archetypical villain but it's really the performance that makes him stand out. Really like the South African accent which just sounds sharp, focus, cold, calculating, sophisticated scum.We also see the guy is kind of a borderline sociopath as he really doesn't care about anyone inside his group or even outside, he only cares about his goal which is his greed. He's even at times displays this bland smile like a guy that is always so sure of himself. This makes him even more menacing because he's seems like the kind of guy, you really can't reason or get the upper hand on, he will always find a way to stay on top because in his deranged mind he is.
I really like how well the protagonists have some depth making them sympathic and people you want to bet on to win.Hal is solid and is played well by Michel Rocker whom is an underrated actor, this is one of my favorite roles from him. I really like how despite being a hostage he's anything but helpless as he throws a monkey wrench into his caters plans from slowing them down by misleading them and getting messages out to his friends which helps put them a step ahead and also warn them of danger.I like there is a little drama with his character as we see despite the anger and sadness he has felt for a long while from the failed rescue, he doesn't hate Gabe enough to want to kill him. Deep down he really does want to be friends with him again and for everything to be like it use to be. This situation was one hell of a way to do it.Jesse played by Jannie Turner she solid, really like that there is this sort of spunk to her and she can hold her own against danger. There is also a decent interaction between her and Gabe which makes you buy both are friends and even more than that. Alright not a great romance but hey I take it over any crappy rom com anytime.But of course, the protagonist we here for his Gabe played well by Sylvester Stallone as usual. Not much I can say as it's pretty much Sly being Sly but nothing wrong with that as the same can be said about other action stars whose character roles blend.But he's a likeable protagonist as he got a lot of memorable lines and he's got that soft-spoken passive aggressive nature and of course doesn't take crap from no one. When one of the scum suckers orders him to fetch the money, he just gives the guy a cold stare not bending to his order but also you just know that jerk just made his kill list.There is depth to his character as he's a guy that has let himself out of the game for a year as he's been dealing with the trauma. He wants to continue to hide from the world and himself but deep down he really doesn't, he want to climb out of that hole he feel into and get himself and life back to where it belongs on top, and this situation is one hell of a boost.The action and the suspense are great, the cinematography is great really love some of the shots of the mountain terrain which really displayed beautifully how high above the world they are. The choreography on the action is good, I like that it doesn't look perfectly choregraphed. But that's because the action is a bit realistic if you can believe that, and it makes sense as Gabe isn't a trained fighter, he's a mountain rescue ranger.So, Gabe must use his mountain climbing skills, along with his knowledge of the territory, as well as his wits to beat the robbers. It's just great as Gabe alone with the help of Hal and Jesse, they are taking these robbers down one by one, showing these scumbags the mountains are their turf.The suspense is great as your constantly hoping that Gabe and Jesse will be able to get ahead of the robbers and somehow take them down; but also, Hal somehow sabatoshing the robber's efforts and finding a way to escape. There is also that double layer of suspense as we see the scenes with the robbers hunting down both the lost cases and even their pursuers Gabe and Jesse, and with Hal as the robbers hostage it's really suspense as we not just hear the robbers plans making us a step ahead of the protagonists, but also reminding us how little time the protagonist have as the robbers close in on each case. As well as some sticky situations in place that really put me on the edge of my seat like seeing Gabe and Jesse having to go back and forth to gain momentum to grab a ledge before both their weak rope gives and the bomb blows, yeah double the danger.And, there are some good kills and even a blood effect or two. Like one where Gabe and a bad guy are sliding down an icy hill and Gabe just pushes the guys face onto the icy floor cutting his face like a cheese grater. But also, Gabe using the bolt gun on one which is my favorite kill, I won't say how but you just must see for yourself but let's just say Gabe nails him.""Cliffhanger"" is thrilling fun worth hanging around to.Rating: 4 stars",Cliffhanger
47,jamesrupert2014,Implausible but entertaining adventure yarn,7,2 August 2018,"Indestructible and relentless Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) and his mountain rescue buddies take on a ruthless gang of criminals searching for a hundred million dollars that fell out of the sky onto the alpine snows following a botched aerial robbery. The plot is somewhat contrived (the villains have a convenient suitcase detector) and reliant on improbabilities (the suitcases seem easy to find in the wilderness just knowing their general location), but serves to set up the action sequences, which are generally excellent. Stallone is fine playing his typical pumped-up minimalist hero and the rest of his team serviceable (although Ralph White seems to be smiling at some inner joke most of the time). Despite affecting an inconsistent English accent, John Lithgow is great as the cold-blooded criminal leader and his crew are sufficiently brutal and deplorable to justify their extirpation. The real star of the film is the magnificent mountain scenery (a melange of the Dolomites and the Rockies) and the climbing scenes (especially the opening sequence and the scenes on the massive rock faces) are outstanding, with seamless transitions between the actors and their stunt doubles. The film is diminished somewhat by the strained secondary material such as Stallone's and Janine Turner's relationship and White's 'comic relief' shtick, and (despite the more farfetched moments of heroism having been edited after poor test audience responses), a couple of action sequences that are unbelievable to a point of ridiculousness. All in all, an entertaining, fast paced, and scenic action film that has aged pretty well. Note: the scenes with the BASE jumpers, a couple of entertaining, albeit superfluous, characters, had been edited out in the sanitised version I recently watched on TV.",Cliffhanger
48,freemantle_uk,An Entertaining 90s Actioneer,8,6 April 2020,"The 80s and 90s were a hell of a time for high concept action films and Cliffhanger was no exception. It had a simple premise where a team of mountain rescue workers is forced to help a gang of robbers find $100 million lost in the Rocky Mountains.Cliffhanger saw the start of an upswing in Stallone's career and made at the height of Renny Harlin's powers. It's what you would expect from a 90s actioneers: lots of blood, stunts, cheesy-one liners, and practical effects and it is a case of 'they don't make them it like that anymore.'The filmmakers did have enough sense to give Cliffhanger some heart because of the prologue where a rescue mission went wrong and Hal (Michael Rooker) blamed Gabe (Sylvester Stallone) for it. Even though Hal is hostile to Gabe when all things go bad he knows what's important.Cliffhanger has a Die Hard premise: i.e. original people having to face off against highly trained thieves or terrorists. At least Cliffhanger was more subtle about it because it was trying to do what other Die Hard clones did i.e. Die Hard in... scenarios.The big issue with the film is the villains are incredibly stupid. They pretty much kill everyone one they see just to prove how evil they are.",Cliffhanger
49,ebiros2,The first 10 minutes is the best,7,23 September 2012,"Rock climbing was the fad of the time, and this and another movie ""K2"" appeared around the same time.They really did a seamless job of going from studio shots to on the location shots. The cliffhanger scenes were really realistic. This movie has one of the best opening scenes of any movie made. The mistake perhaps was that they didn't keep going with this flow. As soon as the scene changed to the plane crash scene, it lost some of the momentum, then it was down hill from there.The movie basically makes super human hero out of Sylvester Stallone, but he really fits the bill. He had the right flamboyant attitude as the hero too. Then he carries the guilt which really wasn't his fault. They should have just went on with the flamboyant attitude, and it would have been even better.I liked the scene where Stallone climbs up the snow covered rock face in a T shirt (this of course is totally preposterous in real life). Very cool. Seriously, this movie had some of the best Silvester Stallone moments, and I wished they'd make more movies like this of his.",Cliffhanger
50,ianlouisiana,Hang on sloppy...............................................,6,27 December 2008,"Guilt - ridden former Mountain Rescue worker (Mr S.Stallone) actually hangs on quite a lot during ""Cliffhanger"".To ropes,broken ladders,falling bridges,helicopter skids,cliff edges,and,during a tense opening sequence,a young lady whom he is unable to save from falling thousands of feet down a ravine - hence the subsequent guilt that fires him to take risks that a more rational man might consider unacceptable. A hi - jacked plane crashes in the mountains and,under the guise of str anded mountaineers,the occupants call for help.Mr Stallone and his companions go to their rescue and it is not long before the villains' fiendish plan is revealed. The bad guys are led by Mr J.Lithgow who has trouble taking himself seriously which,in a nutshell,is the movie's weakness. There is a basic dichotomy in a film where you have some first - rate stunts,breath - taking photography,a fair amount of cold - blooded murder but a set of villains that might have graced a ""Batman"" movie.Just when you are beginning to feel involved,Mr Lithgow or one of his henchpersons exhibits the kind of behaviour makes Jack Nicholson's ""Joker"" seem like a masterly study of the criminal mind. If it is meant to be taken seriously it is sloppy film - making:if it is supposed to be a little light relief it is still sloppy film - making. Because it detracts from the tension,lowers the threat - level to that of clowns in a circus. I admire Mr Stallone and consider him to be a far better actor than he is often given credit for.He has not been well - served in ""Cliffhanger"" where Mr R.Harlin has rather hedged his bets and attempted that notoriously difficult genre the comedy thriller and,as is so often the case,the comedy side has blunted the thrills. Fortunately he got it right a few years later with ""The Long kiss Goodnight"",but ""Cliffhanger"" can only be considered as a missed opportunity.",Cliffhanger

Other than that it's good enough fun with some exciting set pieces.",Cliffhanger
52,jimbo-53-186511,If you can overlook the implausibilities it's actually not a bad film,6,24 July 2020,"When a team of crooks attempt to transfer cases of cash from one plane to another the heist goes wrong and the cases end up scattered across the Rocky Mountains. Fortunately, one of the crew had the foresight to fit a tracker to each of the cases meaning, in theory, that all is not lost. However, our would-be criminals realise that they will not be able to recover the cases themselves and dupe the local Mountain Rescue team in assisting them to retrieve their ill-gotten gains...After such a nail-biting opener it almost seemed inevitable that everything that followed in Cliffhanger would be slightly anti-climactic to a certain extent and in some ways the film does play out in this very manner...Renny Harlin is a good action director and it's very telling that the action scenes are the ones that you remember in this film such as the numerous occasions when somebody is hanging off the edge of a mountain holding on for dear life. It's also fair to say that the nature of the plotting gives the film a sense of urgency meaning that despite some of its misgivings there is rarely a dull moment to find here.Yet despite some of these positives I'm somewhat loathed to give the film a higher score and I think part of the reason for that is the film's overly serious tone and its rather colourless villains. I thought with this being a Sly actioner and given the premise that a slightly more humourous tone would have been adopted; don't get me wrong it has the odd moment of humour, but it has to be said that the dialogue on the whole is fairly unmemorable - I can't even recall one quotable line!!! Aside from Lithgow (who does turn in a solid menacing performance without over doing it) the rest of his crew are a little colourless and failed to make much of an impression.Still I must admit that the action is what makes it worth watching as well as Stallone's ingenuity in continually staying one step ahead of the villains as he plays hide and seek in the Rocky Mountains. There are naturally implausibilities such as Stallone naturally struggling with the extreme cold when he's forced to remove his winter coat yet later in the film he's running round in sub zero temperatures just wearing a T-Shirt and body warmer and seemingly suffers from no ill-effects - he isn't even shivering after spending close to a minute submerged in icy water!!Like a lot of action films Cliffhanger is good and enjoyable providing you don't think about it too much.",Cliffhanger

Action scenes and stunts are great and deserves an applause.The screenplay of the movie is predictable and average but still the movie will keep you engaged, the cinematography of the movie might disappoint you because the movie is been shot in mountains but the scenic beauty is not been captured to it's fullest, however few of the mountain scenes were incredibly beautiful.Climax of the movie is predictable but good, the climax of the movie could've been little more refined, the duration of the movie could also have been trimmed by few minutes. Overall despite of being a predictable movie the movie is not a disappointing movie and is a no brainier entertaining action movie.",Cliffhanger
55,barnabyrudge,Ignore the absurdities and treat it as a fun ride.,6,22 October 2003,"Cliffhanger is violent, foul-mouthed and absolutely absurd, but on a certain level it is also rather entertaining. You have to be in a particular frame of mind to enjoy his movie. You can't be in one of those moods where you spend all your time grumbling about obvious plot holes. You can't be in one of those moods where you are constantly groaning at the physical impossibility of some of the stunts. You also can't be in one of those moods where you get annoyed by cliched dialogue. However, if you are in the mood for non-stop action, mindless yet spectacular set pieces, and good giving evil the whooping it deserves, chances are you'll find Cliffhanger good fun. Sylvester Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a mountain rescue hotshot. At the beginning of the film, he sees a rescue attempt go wrong and a young lady climber plummets to her death. Walker can't bear his failure to rescue her, so he quits and becomes a recluse. A few months later, a plane crashes in the same region and Walker - against his better judgment - agrees to help in the hunt for survivors. Unfortuantely, the plane was no ordinary aircraft but a US Treasury plane full of cash. A group of hijackers who were trying to steal the cash have survived the crash and are swarming all over the mountain-side trying to recover the money which was scattered far and wide during the accident. It's clear from the plot synopsis that Cliffhanger requires a big leap of faith if the audience is to overcome the lack of plausibility. However, director Renny Harlin isn't too concerned with logical plotting and he opts for breathtaking action instead. Fussy viewers may struggle to get by the outrageously improbable events which litter the movie, but if you can watch the movie when you're in a ""couldn't-care-less-about-believability"" mood, it'll probably pass a couple of hours for you quite pleasantly. To summarise, treat it as fun and you'll have fun; treat it as serious and you'll be groaning with despair.",Cliffhanger
56,juneebuggy,This movie is still impressive 20 years later,9,29 September 2014,"I just did a long overdue re-watch of Cliffhanger and it stood up really well. Definitely one of Stallone's better (less cheesy) action flicks and seeing his body in its prime is pretty nice too :) That opening scene gets me every time but I enjoyed everything about this (even if you do have to suspend disbelief occasionally) The action, the stunts, the scenery, the cast. John Lithgow is great as the bad guy, although his British accent could use some work as it fades in and out, he seems to be relishing playing this character though. Also fun to see Michael Rooker from The Walking Dead in an earlier role, I had forgotten he was in this.The ending helicopter scene is still awesome as is the opening accident with the silly panicking girl on the zipline. Stallone caught under ice and climbing the rock face in a t-shirt during a blizzard... awesome. Many great and well done action scenes. 03.13(4)",Cliffhanger
57,NateWatchesCoolMovies,One of the best action films ever made,10,21 May 2016,"Renny Harlin's Cliffhanger is to this day one the best and most exhilarating action films of the 1990's. It's big, bold and full of protein for lovers oft the genre. From the lively villain to the unbelievable stunts to the set pieces, it's a tough package to beat. A stunning, vertigo inducing opener set high atop a snowy peak that ends in tragedy. A breathtaking airial heist carried out between two planes via cable wire. A whopper of a helicopter crash. Countless bone snapping, visceral hand to hand combat scenes. The list goes on. Sylvester Stallone puts his physique to great use as Gabe Walker, a rock climbing mountaineer guide who is accidentally responsible for the falling death of his best friend's girlfriend. His buddy Hal (Michael Rooker) blames him no end, and he leaves in personal disgrace. Elsewhere, ruthless backstabbing psychopath Eric Qualen, (John Lithgow) leads a team of dangerous mercenaries through aforementioned heist, plundering millions from a US treasury department plane and disappearing into the snowy desolation. Soon they come across Hal and a group of people touring the region, who are soon hostages. Word somehow gets out to Stallone and he's back in business, out for redemption and then chance to brutally dispatch this gang of snow pirates. The action, refreshingly absent of digital gimmicks, packs one hell of a punch. Every fight scene feels breathless, dangerous and desperate. Every blow is thunderously felt, courtesy of director Harlin's commitment to his work and the efforts of a stellar stunt team. Stallone isna beast and I forget that every time I haven't seen him in a while. He's almost as big as the mountains he scales here and each and every bad guy damn well finds this out. Rooker is as intense as he always is, love the guy. Lithgow is a freaking villain for the ages, in a role intended first for David Bowie, then Christopher Walken. I'm glad the ball ended up in his court, because he subsequently knocks it back out of the park with his cold blooded, deliciously evil performance.

I am a Stallone fan, but I have a hard time getting through this. Cliffhanger is one of many attempts to cash in on the success of Die Hard and is directed by Renny Harlin who made Die Hard 2. This was basically Die Hard on a mountain and an excuse for Stallone to kill some bad guys and do some crazy stunts. Stallone's physicality is in top form. His acting, not so much. It does have a good supporting cast. Michael Rooker is one of the actors that is actually good in this. John Lithgow has been a great villain in the past, but overacts like crazy with a really phony British accent. Cliffhanger did well for the time and is quite popular. I never liked it and found it to be really cliche and boring. As a matter of fact, the only mid to late 90's Sly action movie I really like is Demolition Man.

64,Samiam3,Mountainous mediocrity.,5,3 June 2010,"To address Cliffhanger as stupid would be true, but it would not be very effective criticism. It is a Hollywood blockbuster, only one in ten of these films is NOT stupid. What is more important is whether the film does its job in providing a hundred plus minutes of adrenaline and thrills. It is easy enough I suppose for one to make the argument that Cliffhanger suffices...but I am NOT one to make that argument. Assuming you haven't seen anything by Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich and/or the far more talented James Cameron, Cliffhanger may do the job for you. Otherwise, I find it a less-than-average action spectacle with a cardboard thin plot. In the end, Cliffhanger proves to be nothing more than a string of action sequences with too much landscape photography taking up screen time that should've gone to story.A group of British thieves high jack an American aircraft transporting a hundred million dollars, in three traceable cases over the Rocky Mountains. The plan goes south, the money gets lost, and the plane goes down. The survivors fake a distress call, and the two mountaineers who are sent to rescue are then high jacked and forced at gunpoint to climb the mountains to retrieve the cases. One gets away, and races to get the money before the 'bad guys' do in the hopes of sabotaging the plan.It's kind of ironic. There is so much action in Cliffhanger, that there is virtually nothing else, and the end result is not only uninteresting but it feels pretty dull. There is only one (I dunno maybe two) scenes that really come close to edge-of-seat suspense. Action is the only thing that director Renny Harlin wants to invest time and effort into. If it was more compelling, perhaps it would be easier to let Cliffhanger slide for its bad acting and equally feeble writing. Unfortunately, the movie is not the spectacle it could have been. The plane crash in act one, has nothing on (among many other examples) the train wreck in The Greatest Show on Earth. For god's sake, that was forty years earlier with a tiny plastic toy, and a map painting. The avalanche in act two is about as intimidating as a pile of stones, and the climactic fight feels like such a recycled scene and the explosion it ends in is about as epic as a firecracker. I didn't much care for anyone in the picture, especially Stallone. Janine Turner as the girl by his side, gives an ugly stiff performance. what these two could really use is a few one liners, the kind Steven Seagal gives himself. Such lines end up going to John Lithgow, who is a pretty icky villain.For a while (a very short while) Cliffhanger feels captivating and has you eager to see what happens next, but as the film increases in adventure, so do does it (unfortunately) degrade in brains, appeal and originality. Even though I didn't set my expectations too high, by the end I was rather disappointed. It kind of makes me wanna go back to see Harlin's financial disaster Cutthroat Island, which is starting to feel much more epic after all.",Cliffhanger

Sylvester Stallone plays a mountain climber on a mission to save his family from evil terror and there's explosions and action and everything in between.

67,philip_vanderveken,"Not the most intelligent movie, but enjoyable and one of the better in the genre",7,7 April 2005,"I'm far from a Sylvester Stallone fan and I guess the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is an almost inexistent small role. And yet I must admit that this movie was actually not that bad, even though I feared the worst.When Gabe (Stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top, he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger. For almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve, but than he returns. Soon after he's back, they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm. At least, that's what the rangers believe. In reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed. The cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them...This is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it's an enjoyable one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers. I know him best from the TV-series ""3rd Rock from the Sun"", but I enjoyed his performance in this movie as well. Overall the acting is OK, it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. I loved the snowy mountains and valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests... Perhaps that's why I give this movie a score higher than what I normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind. I give it a 6.5/10. If you don't expect too much, this is an enjoyable movie.",Cliffhanger
68,screenman,Clichehanger,5,12 April 2009,"I don't think I've ever seen so many clichés nailed together in a single movie. We've got the 'failed' action-man/expert in the form of Stallone as a mountain rescue oik who's lost his nerve and is stricken with guilt after an accident in which some female gets dropped. But he's soon whipped into line by a spirited, rasp-tongued young harridan accusing him of cowardice etc. We have the good-buddy who despises him - I think he was related to the dropped wench. There's an amiable old patriarch who's got 'marked for death' written all over him. The airborne heist that marks the beginning of the adventure is a worthy bit of action. It's tense, visceral and edge-of-the-seat stuff. The aerial transfer is also an unusual twist. After that, the whole plot comes down like the jet. The miraculous crash landing is a foretaste of many miracles to come. Firstly, 3 big cases of money come adrift and fall somewhere in the rocky mountains. No worries; each is fortuitously fitted with a homing beacon. Why; did they expect it to happen? All they've got to do now is find them - in the rocky mountains. It's a doddle. The jet, in the meantime, has struggled on for many miles.The baddies are a gang of such nasty pieces of work that they're almost comical. Their leader is so cold-blooded that you wonder how he survived adolescence. Stallone and his good-buddy respond to their distress signal only to find themselves dragooned into finding the money. Together, everyone hops around the mountains as if they were the local park. They scale terrain and cover distances in hours that would take skilled technicians days. Trust me; I've been wilderness trekking. Even, the raspy young harridan reappears, flown in by the old patriarch to some place about 10 miles away. That's about a week's hard struggle, but she meets-up with Stallone in less than half an hour. Despite having no electronic tracking device, Stallone miraculously finds one of the cases all by himself. How? Don't ask; it was in the script. Never did a needle make so light of a haystack.There's a couple of hedonistic adolescent paragliders who refer to each other as 'dude' in classic 1980's style - yeah, man. One gets shot the other escapes. Suddenly the mountains are beginning to look very crowded. There's a scene in which Stallone shoots a baddie from under water. Anyone with more than half a braincell knows that the gun would simply have exploded. But miracles just keep on coming. And there's a final confrontation in a hanging-by-a-thread helicopter that is bloody, needlessly protracted and as predictable as expected. That's about it. Well worth watching for the heist sequence, and some of the photography is excellent. But then it's hard to foul-up the splendour of the Rocky mountains. Otherwise it's just a clichéd turkey.

72,TheUnknown837-1,elaborate and effective action movie,8,14 January 2008,"""Cliffhanger"", while it is in no regards, a great movie overall, is by all accounts, a great action movie. If you want a relatively simple story built around nonstop fun, action, shooting, and fistfights, ""Cliffhanger"" is definitely the kind of movie that will suit you. It is the perfect, late-night, enjoy-the-ride film since it keeps you riveted and entertained. It is Sylvester Stallone's best action picture since ""First Blood"" and still remains one of his better.The plot of the film is very simple. Mountain climbers are forced by terrorists to find lost bags of loot that they need in order to flee the country. Along the way, friends are endangered, they encounter the hostilities of nature, and are struggling to beat the other side while the FBI wants to end everything right away. Sure, that's not particularly complex or original. But when it's done right, a simple plot like that can turn into an effective movie.The film is elaborately designed and performed. It was shot on a real mountain range, and therefore, the scenery looks breathtakingly beautiful, especially when combined with the memorable music score. Sure, the rock climbing techniques done by Sylvester Stallone and Michael Rooker aren't entirely accurate. The bolt gun that Stallone uses is something that no real rock climber would dare use. And some incredible things happen. Such as a character falling into freezing cold water without a shirt on, climbing back out, and ending up just fine. But it's just a fun movie and should be treated as such.""Cliffhanger"" might be too violent for some people to enjoy. The body count is fairly high, there is a fair share of blood (although it's not used too recklessly), and it could be just too intense for some. But overall, it's a great movie to just sit back and watch for fun. Do not take the movie too seriously, and you will be riveted, thrilled, and have the ride of a lifetime for your first viewing. Afterward, it's still a good solid action picture.",Cliffhanger

74,CitizenCaine,Stallone Is Good In Mountain Actioner,7,19 July 2005,"Renny Harlin directs this white knuckle thriller starring Sylvester Stallone as a mountain climber/rescuer who is having second thoughts about his work. This is due to the fact that he loses his friend's girlfriend while trying to rescue her, and she falls to her death. Stallone is then in conflict with his friend, Michael Rooker, for the remainder of the film. Meanwhile a group of international wackos, of course, have hijacked a plane containing $100,000,000 dollars; they end up crashing into a mountain while the money, which is enclosed in suitcases, ends up scattered over the mountains. Stallone is good and believable, most of the time, as the rescuer taking a second chance in life. Michael Rooker provides tension as Stallone's friend who feels Stallone is responsible for his girlfriend's death. John Lithgow is the leader of the crooks after the money. Lithgow is absolutely menacing as a man with no conscience who only looks out for himself and the money. The movie was filmed in the Italian Alps substituting for the Rocky Mountains, and the eye-popping stunts, fantastic cinematography, group of characters, and fast pace action keep us interested. However, the film is rather formulaic in its execution, and the story is not always believable, but it is enjoyable nevertheless. *** of 4 stars.",Cliffhanger

76,TOMASBBloodhound,"If nothing else, watch it for Lithgow",6,5 October 2010,"Cliffhanger was an expensive and dangerous to film vehicle for Sylvester Stallone. But odds are you will remember John Lithgow's performance as the lead villain more than anything. Maybe even the fine stunts. Considering he was a last minute replacement for Christopher Walken, Lithgow more than creates a dynamic and diabolical baddie. His performance, along with the rest of the cast and fine stunt work make this a watchable film.This is certainly Stallone's movie though, and it came out at a time when his career was beginning to sink to depths from which it never really recovered. Though certainly not on par with his better Rocky and Rambo flicks, this absolutely beats the stuffing out of Demolition Man, Daybreak, or whatever that race car movie he made was called. Stallone plays the leader of a mountain rescue team. After an accident early in the film claims the life of a colleague's girlfriend, he abruptly retires from the business of saving lives. Little does he know that his skills will be needed once more when a team of reckless mercenaries crash lands onto his range and tears the countryside apart looking for their lost loot. Can they be defeated before they recover the money? Will anyone they encounter survive? Or will these crooks end up killing each other until only the worst of them are still standing??? Go ahead and watch this film. Not a shred of it is believable, but Renny Harlin has done worse.The cast is full of recognizable faces, many of whom peaked in the early 1990s. We don't see that much of Michael Rooker these days, or Janine Turner for that matter either. Leon Robinson or ""Leon"" as he is typically billed is here as one of the bad guys. You may recall him from Madonna's Like a Prayer video or his role as a player in Waiting to Exhale. The late Paul Winfield has an all too brief role, and Bruce McGill is barely on hand long enough to have a cup of coffee! What the heck? He's too good of an actor to waste like he is here. Several of the stunts are such that they could only have been done in the controlled confines of a movie set. Some scenes are just impossible to begin with. Stallone is going to hide under the ice of a frozen river and wait for the opportune moment to shoot a bad guy with a climber's bolt gun? Sure. Stallone is apparently going to catch a wild rabbit with his bare hands and tie a tracking device to it so it can lead the bad guys in the wrong direction. Uh huh. Why not? The explosions look real enough, at least. Stallone still can't deliver a funny line properly, though. ""Where's the money?"" asks a bad guy. ""Burned it,"" Stallone replies. ""Never could save anything."" Or as he's burning the money in a cave to provide warmth for he and Ms. Turner, ""Costs a fortune to heat this place."" Ughhhhhhh!! 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Cliffhanger
77,ivo-cobra8,One of the best underrated action thriller movies from Sylvester Stallone my personal favorite,10,4 November 2015,"Cliffhanger (1993) is one of the best Action thriller heist movies of the 90's. I love this film to death! It is one of my personal favorite movies. Besides the Rocky and Rambo which are Stallone's most popular stuff I would put Cliffhanger right above those! I absolutely LOVE this film!!!! Gabe Walker is awesome I love it. I would put this movie over Rambo III and Cobra because I have enjoy it more than those two films. I don't like Rambo III it is a bad action movie. I love Cobra but Cliffhanger beats Cobra and I love Cliffhanger to death It is my childhood movie. This is the finest action movie of all time and it is a perfect 10 it deals with no CGI but real climbing, real action sequences. Dangerous stunts that people could have died. Even for a $70,000,000 budget movie the action and the stunts are well done for the 90's. Renny Harlin made an awesome job on this movie. The movie is awesome. It has slow motion running jump! The action sequences in this movie are fantastic! It is actually the first best favorite Action that Stallone did, I love this film and it is my childhood film I love it. One of the most Stallone hit and the most successful Stallone film! This movie is filmed in the real Rocky Mountains and not a CGI or computer crap the stunts are real and insanely crazy. I watch this movie with my dad on Blu-ray 3 years ago and I really want to say thank you to Stallone for making this movie. I have enjoy it and even my dad did enjoy it and it is really my favorite memories on my dad so thank you Stallone. Is one of my first best favorite movies ever. Why I love this movie and I put it above Cobra? Simply because the whole movie is about thrills in the rocky mountains during snow time. Renny Harlin's 'Die Hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most awesome action movies ever. That's right, 'Cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it. Stallone uses his mind and not his muscles, a machine gun or a hand guns to defeat terrorists. He uses his mind, he is rescuing people and he try's to save his friend's life, who is held hostage by terrorists. They are thrills, suspense, avalanche and action all over the place in the Rocky Mountains. And I seriously love this Action thriller. The opening scene where the girl is hanging on the line for her dear life, still makes my hands sweaty. And When Gabe Walker couldn't saved her, I really felt pain and I mourn with Stallone's character. Cliffhanger was actually the film I grew up with it. It is a stone cold classic action film a film that I will always cherish! Mine favorite is Cliffhanger and almost no one puts Cliffhanger into their favorite best action movie so I put it as my Top 4 best Stallone action movies out there. Sly's best out and out action film. It is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and Renny Harlins direction is stylishly assured. Stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes. This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's, a definite genre classic. As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories. Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good action film. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. On the airplane, the plane heist up in the air from plane-to-plane airborne transfer, a money transfer stunt was filmed in the USA as such a stunt is illegal in Europe. The stunt itself cost over $1 million to film. Cliffhanger is a 1993 American action adventure film directed by Renny Harlin and starring Sylvester Stallone and John Lithgow. I love this film to death beside Rambo movies, it is one of my favorite trills action movies. It is Die Hard in the mountains. I love the music theme from Trevor Jones, he write and made a perfect music score that fits to the film. The basic plot story is about A botched mid-air heist results in suitcases full of cash being searched for by various groups throughout the Rocky Mountains. It is die hard movie in the mountains.This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth. It is way to underrated and it is my personal favorite Stallone action movie.",Cliffhanger
78,The_Movie_Cat,"""It costs a fortune to heat this place""",6,25 June 2000,"Along with 1993's other vehicle, Demolition Man, Cliffhanger is probably the peak(!) of Stallone's ""going through the motions"" (c. 1985-1996) period.Sylvester treads water almost as much as he treads rock in this one, though post-Copland it doesn't seem to matter anymore. Stallone acts again, and so candyfloss capers like this can be looked back upon as a lightweight bit of fun. The film opens with a scene which, while predictable, cannot help but get the palms sweating. ""Don't look down!"" indeed. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie becomes a preposterous artillery hunt for some missing cash and the high level of tension in the first five minutes is therefore absent throughout the rest of the film. You can laugh at the illogic, and snigger at the Perspex (supposed to be glass) on the villains' plane, flapping in the wind, but you can never recapture what that first scene promised.One upsetting thing is John Lithgow as a Brit villain. I long for a Hollywood exec (preferably a pretty blonde one) to give me a reassuring hug, tell me everything's alright and that America doesn't hate the English. (There's even a review on the IMDb from a guy in Texas that adds ""and even the English dude was good""  like it was a miracle for an English actor to give a decent performance.) Until that happens I guess I'll have to settle for seeing movies where English wars are won by the US, and the villains always have clear-cut Cambridge accents. Or, in Craig Fairbrass' case, an East-End one. Seeing Fairbrass as a minor henchman in this film is a nice touch, as he's now very famous in Britain as the barman lothario Dan Sullivan from soap opera ""Eastenders"". (Incidentally, while an Englishman might, possibly, say ""soccer"" instead of football, they would never use the word ""punk"" as an insult. Okay?)It's also a nice change to see Sylvester play a part where he's not actually that tough, and only gets to live through sheer luck and determination. It would have been nicer to have seen him tackle the taller and similarly-muscled Fairbrass, but as it is even John Lithgow sends him to bed with no supper. There are the occasional funny lines (such as the title quote after Stallone has burnt money in order to keep warm), and Lithgow is likeably over the top as Eric Qualen. You're never rewarded with anything you don't expect to see, and the ending is a little abrupt, but this is a passable way to spend an hour or two. I used to really hate Cliffhanger, but it isn't so bad. Just simple, average action entertainment.",Cliffhanger

It's quite interesting seeing films that you haven't seen for a while; you tend to notice things that you missed before. This is no exception, for instance, I hadn't realised that British actor Craig Fairbrass was even in it until watching it this time! But I digress, here's a short summary first (summary haters: this next paragraph is just a figment of your imagination).Rescue worker Gabe Walker is about to give up his job after losing a climber in a rescue attempt a year ago. He has returned to clear out his stuff from the house he shared with his girlfriend Jessie Deighan when a call comes in. Some hikers are trapped on a mountain, the weather is too bad to get the helicopter out and Gabe is persuaded to go and help. His former friend Hal Tucker is also on the rescue attempt. Little do they know, the people they are heading to rescue are robbers who, after a failed hijacking, are now on the hunt for their loot. Their leader is Eric Qualen, a psychotic killer who is very determined to find the money as quickly as possible. He is aided, amongst others, by US Treasury employee turned bad, Richard Travers who has a tracking device for the three cases of cash. Walker and Tucker get separated and, while the gang keep Tucker as a guide, it's up to Walker, who is later joined by Jesse, to try and get to the money before they do. They know that when the bad guys found all of the cases they will kill Tucker.There is some stunning scenery in this film; the helicopter flying shots are particularly good. The special effects are maybe not quite up to the standard we are used to today, but still passable. There is also some great stunt work, hats off to those guys! Decent performances all round, particularly from Sylvester Stallone as Gabe Walker, John Lithgow real bad-ass as Eric Qualen and Michael Rooker as Hal Tucker. Honourable mentions go to; Janine Turner as Jessie Deighan, Rex Linn as Richard Travers and nice to see Ralph Waite as Frank.I thought John Lithgow was particularly good as the bad guy; he really made the audience hate his character. Plenty of thrills and spills and I like the way the tension is slowly built up throughout. Although it looks a little dated by today's standards, still a pretty enjoyable watch and overall recommended.My score: 6.7/10",Cliffhanger
81,Maziun,Stallone's best movie in the 90's,8,6 September 2013,"""Cliffhanger"" is quite underrated action movie . It's a mix between ""The Eiger Sanction"" and ""Die hard"" . I think that from all ""Die hard"" clones this is the best one. It's refreshing to see an action movie set in mountains . It allowed the filmmakers for some nice ideas and a breathtaking views.This is Stallone's finest performance along with the ""Rocky"" and ""Rambo"" series. He fits his character – Gabe , a mountain rescuer with troubled past – perfectly . He's character isn't a ex-marine , ex-soldier or cop , but a normal human . That's what makes it interesting to watch how will he be able to defeat the bad guys. He's got solid support from Michael Rooker (Hal) and Janine Turner (Jesse). John Lithgow is great as the cold blooded leader of bandits – Quialan. He's such a cold blooded guy. Great performance.The best scene of the movie happens at the beginning . It always makes hair on my back stand up. It's a really thrilling scene that takes audience by surprise , because we were expecting a different end to it. I also have to mention the final showdown between Stallone , Lithgow and the helicopter.""Cliffhanger"" is directed with professionalism by Renny Harlin (""Die hard 2"") . The screenplay offers some nice laughs and twists. The whole movie is photographed well and looks good , even if sometimes it's obvious that some scenes were filmed in studio. The rock climbing here is not really realistic, butafter all this is an action movie.""Cliffhanger"" should be rated higher. I give it 8/10.",Cliffhanger

Their cartoonish villainy is matched by Stallone's equally flamboyant heroism, which finds him dressed in the flimsiest of attire in sub-zero temperatures whilst dodging bullets and missiles of every conceivable description! It sounds ridiculous - and it is! - but Harlin throws logic and subtlety to the wind and stages the crowd-pleasing action scenes with expert precision. Eye-popping cinematography by Alex Thomson. Co-stars include Ralph Waite, Paul Winfield, Craig Fairbrass and Leon.",Cliffhanger
83,kenandraf,Good effort....,9,20 March 2001,"This movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded.This movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights,a very fit Stallone putting in a good performance as well,an exciting plot,and a great performance from it's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways.The movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play.The plot and story cries for this movie to make Stallone an extra special human,much like the Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters.They chose to humanise Stallone's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot's style,weakens the excitement factor.Also,the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times.The script should have been more realistic and less ""talky"".Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes.The movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses.They should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie.Instead,they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences (ala ""A-Team"" TV series) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops.This movie had a lot of all time great potential.Crisper action sequences,better dialogue and more Rambo/Rocky style emotion/determination from Stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level.I know this was not Stallone's fault.I sense the movie's director wanted to tone down Stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer.Sill a good movie though........",Cliffhanger
84,tonypeacock-1,"Blown away on cinema release, ordinary heist on small screen",6,8 April 2021,When I first saw this film back in 1993 on cinema release I was blown away by the cinematography of the mountain locations that added impetus to the stuntwork and action scenes.Some of that impact is lost on the small screen but the film still is an action packed thriller with plenty of great set pieces including a stunt that cost over $1 million back in 1993!Sylvester Stallone is the main star as mountain rescuer Gabe Walker. Stallone still packs a punch (as in the Rocky franchise) and his mangled physique of later films hasn't kicked in!The cast also includes the old guy (now no longer with us) of the television series The Waltons as a fellow rescuer or helicopter pilot Frank and John Lithgow in a delightful performance as the main villain Qualen.I found a henchman quite laughable. The cockney character played by Craig Fairbrass who some people may remember as Dan Sullivan off the UK TV soap Eastenders.The stunt work is a delight (provided by veterans of the James Bond films) and Stallone gave up some of his salary to ensure stunt work could be funded.1993 was a good year for Stallone and was probably his last great year as an action heavyweight before he frankly became embarrassingly old.The film perhaps finds some motivation from films like The Eiger Sanction and itself went on to provide impetus to Vertical Limit.An entertaining film.,Cliffhanger
85,nicholls905-280-546911,Great Action Film,9,8 March 2020,"Stallone has had a mixed career, but some of these are gems, and Cliffhanger is one of them. The film is large in scope, and that opening is incredible. The film struggles to maintain the pacing all the time, but it leads to a strong finale. Great cast and a filmmaker working at the height of his career. This is one of my favourite action films, and it's amazing to watch on 4k, sadly a cinematic experience has alluded me.",Cliffhanger
86,emm,Stallone's high-altitude action film is ordinary.,5,30 January 1999,"Are Sylvester Stallone's days numbered as an all-out action hero? It appears as though CLIFFHANGER built a tremendous amount of hype upon its first release as visions of snow-covered mountains and bloody violence went through our minds. I expected better. From the opening where Stallone loses his grip on the damsel in distress hanging on his arm, things got suddenly ordinary. Other than the amazing scenery set at the Rocky Mountains, the key action and plot substances are too simple, too safe. Much of the time, our villains get a lot of credit for acting. If you have the perfect 20/20 vision, you may spot a couple of aerial views looking utterly cheesy. Consider this film to give you a small taste of SPEED. Not up to my expectations, I'm afraid.",Cliffhanger
87,qormi,It's Rocky in the Rockies,3,26 November 2011,"This film is an insult to anyone's intelligence. A romp through the Rockies, where people are oblivious to freezing cold, where men can jump like mountain goats and not slip, etc. In one scene, Stallone falls through a frozen stream. We see him under the water, beneath the ice.He inexplicably takes his jacket and shirt off ( I know it's obligatory for Stallone to take his shirt off in every film he's in, but this just wasn't the time for this) and shoots through the ice, killing his foe. Then he bursts through the ice and is helped out. In the very next scene, he has his clothes back and is completely dry. He didn't even sneeze, let alone lapse into a hypothermic coma. In another scene, he is 3/4 the way across a hanging plank bridge between two cliffs, when an explosion ahead of him collapses the bridge. He runs a quarter mile faster than a 550 hp Camaro and manages to grab the cliff at the other end as the bridge dangles beneath him. A bad guy fires off a magazine of ammo from an AK47 at Stallone. Stallone runs away in a straight line and jumps off a cliff onto some trees. You guessed it - the bad guy missed with all 100 bullets. Stallone is bleeding from the fall, with blood from his chest soaking though his layered clothing. The next scene, it's as if nothing had happened...all gone. In another scene, a little brown bunny rabbit gets shot at by a bad guy who heard it rustling and thought it was Stallone. The little critter got away, but it is wearing a harness. I guess he was making a fashion statement. All in all, dumb...very dumb....and the background music sounded like the soundtrack from a Bugs Bunny cartoon.",Cliffhanger

89,Min111,Rocky,6,7 May 2021,"No! I don't mean his ""Rocky"" movies which we all like. Our boxer is now an action hero in the movie Cliffhanger. In the movie, I just like how the action happens on mountains (Rocky). I like the setting. Cliffhanger doesn't copy the other action movies I'm sure we've all seen. Do you know what those action movies are? I thought so. There were too many, and Cliffhanger is one of those movies. I rate Cliffhanger right up there. Cliffhanger is a unique action movie. Anyway, a former mountain climber goes to the mountains to help survivors from a plane crash. He soon learns they're crooks using him to find suitcases full of cash. I like the woman named Jessie (Jessica). She's cute! I'm glad she didn't die just like Sarah. Yes, I was worried there was a chance Jessie might have also died during the movie. The woman, though, named Sarah didn't had to die. She (Sarah) appears as soon as the movie begins. Cliffhanger is an ""action"", ""adventure"" and ""thriller"" movie.",Cliffhanger

Add in classic action star Stallone in his prime and entertaining bad guy John Lithgow, and you have a very enjoyable movie. The plot is basically Die Hard in the mountains, but honestly it works. The setting is very unique and the stunts are genuinely impressive. The dialogue and acting are about what you'd expect, however the positives far outweigh the negatives here.",Cliffhanger

It has great action sequence's, edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies.",Cliffhanger
92,jhaggardjr,Awesome action/adventure/thriller,10,10 December 2000,"Sylvester Stallone didn't make alot of good movies in the '90s. At the beginning of the decade he got caught in two comedies that were big bombs (""Oscar"" and ""Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot""). Stallone realized comedy is not what he does best (wouldn't you think he learned that after 1984's ""Rhinestone""?). So he returned to action movies in 1993 with ""Cliffhanger"". It's his best movie of the '90s. This film has a whole lot of action, stunts, effects, and thrills to last a lifetime. Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a veteran mountain climber who returns to the mountains for the first time since a tragic accident happened eight months earlier. A new problem starts to brew. A plane carrying thousands of dollars in currency is somewhat hijacked by a crazy villain flying beside the plane in a small jet. Their plan, with the help of a foul-mouthed baddie on the plane, is to steal the money by transferring it from the plane to the jet. This plan takes a very wrong turn. The plane explodes, the money just as its being transferred over falls into the mountains, and the jet crash lands on top of the peak. Stallone, along with fellow mountain climbing experts Michael Rooker and Janine Turner, receive a distress call from the villains claiming that they're trapped and need to be rescued. What Stallone and his team don't know is that its a trap, and when Stallone gets away, he preceeds to play cat-and-mouse with the bad guys. ""Cliffhanger"" is one extremely exciting movie. Director Renny Harlin has made an action movie the way it should be made: pile on as many action sequences one after another and it's done very effectively. This is Harlin's best directorial effort to date. It's a shame he had to take the low route with his follow-up movie, the monumental bomb ""Cutthroat Island"" (which starred his then wife Geena Davis). He followed that with another box-office loser, ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (also starring Davis). He returned to form last year with the excellent horror-thriller ""Deep Blue Sea"", and he reteamed with Stallone for his next movie called ""Driven"" (to be released next spring), about race car driving (which also stars Burt Reynolds and Kip Pardue from ""Remember the Titans""). I just saw a preview of this movie recently, and it looks good. But I don't think it will top ""Cliffhanger"". Stallone is excellent in this movie. He's much better here that he was in most of the movies he made in the '90s. Turner (from TV's ""Northern Exposure"") and Rooker (currently in ""The 6th Day"") are terrific too. And what about that performance by John Lithgow as the lead heavy? He makes an outstanding villain here (even though his British accent had me laughing at times). And veteran ""Waltons"" actor Ralph Waite has some good moments as the other part of the good team, the helicopter pilot. ""Cliffhanger"" is for anyone who loves action movies. This one delivers!**** (out of four)",Cliffhanger
93,buiger,First word that comes to mind... Fake!,4,2 October 2007,"This was a below-average, mindless action flick like thousands that Hollywood has produced over the years. The film is full of clichés, the plot is ridiculous, the script and dialogs totally unbelievable, the characters cartoonesque. The motion picture is worthy of a dozen Razzie awards (it actually won 'only' 4). But then, what surprised me most, and what usually is a strength in such movies was camera, set decoration and special effects. Not even these where up to standard, making the movie seem even more unrealistic, or to but it bluntly, fake. How these visual effects could have been even Nominated for an Oscar is a mystery to me... (just watch the scenes in the cave and you will know what I mean, you can actually smell the paint off the cardboard used to make the ""cave"" walls).Stallone plays out as a cross between Rambo and Rocky and many scenes show he didn't put much effort into researching and learning how a real climber actually moves. Both he and Michael Rooker are miscast for their roles. They are far too heavy and have far too many muscles to be even remotely convincing as professional climbers. A much better, more realistic film with this theme was certainly 'Vertical Limit'. This one leaves us with the feeling that the only people satisfied with this picture will be 5-year old kids and the bean counters at the box office...",Cliffhanger
94,DavidSim240183,A halfway reasonable Die Hard imitation,7,19 May 2006,"Die Hard certainly had an impact on the action film genre. I can't think of another action film replicated or alluded to more. Films like Under Siege, Speed, Passenger 57 all have the same basic premise. Cop or special forces guy find themselves cornered by terrorists or criminals, and gradually outmanoeuvre them. And Cliffhanger definitely falls into that category.When I first saw Cliffhanger, I loved it. I thought it made use of great stunts, dizzy-inducing mountain climbs and exciting action sequences. But as the years passed, and I've grown a bit wiser, Cliffhanger doesn't quite do for me what it used to.It's a film that requires you to suspend disbelief a little too much. Not surprising considering it's directed by Renny Harlin. He tends to specialise in action films barely held together by explosive action scenes with little regard for characterisation or plot development.Harlin previously directed Die Hard 2, a film with many of the same problems as Cliffhanger. Die Hard has layers of sophistication and style that Harlin is unable to bring forth in his films. I'm sorry but he's no John McTiernan. Still, despite its flaws Cliffhanger does hold your attention fairly well, the location shooting is often breathtaking, and some of the action scenes are really spectacular.Cliffhanger was billed as Sylvester Stallone's comeback film after his disastrous attempts at comedy. In fact, the only time I ever liked him in a comical role was Demolition Man. That film worked because it was a very funny satirical vision of the future, and Stallone was helped no end by the ebullient comic timing of Sandra Bullock. Cliffhanger certainly has its shortcomings, but its better than the dreadful Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot!Gabe Walker (Stallone) is the leader of the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team. When his best friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) is stuck on a mountain ledge with his girlfriend Sarah, Gabe leads a rescue party. Gabe rigs a support line to a rescue helicopter, but Sarah's safety harness comes loose. In one of the best scenes, Gabe has to struggle to hold on to Sarah. Filled with quick pans and close-ups, that is a very nail-biting scene. Tragically, Sarah slips from his grasp and plunges to her death.Eight months later, Gabe has returned to the mountains after a self-imposed exile. Gabe has lost his nerve, and doesn't want to be responsible for any more lives. But a chance for redemption presents itself when a Treasury Jet with a hundred million dollars on board is hijacked by a group of terrorists led by the psychotic (and sarcastic) Eric Qualen (John Lithgow in British Alan Rickman mode).The plot goes awry when the money falls into the mountains and Qualen's plane crashes. With no way to get down, Qualen sends out a fake distress call picked up by Hal. When he goes alone Jessie, Gabe's ex convinces Gabe to help. Although Hal is in no mood since he blames Gabe for Sarah's death.The two are captured by Qualen's men, and forced to lead a search through the mountains for the missing money. But Gabe manages to escape, and teamed up with Jessie, plays a game of cat and mouse with Qualen's gang to get to the money first.If reading any of this has left you scratching your heads in disbelief, its not hard to see why. Cliffhanger has so many inconsistencies and glaring plot holes you may find yourself cracking up at the absurdity of it all. Still, Stallone is in his element and he's up to the strenuous stuff. But you wonder why they bothered with the beginning, plunging Gabe into a crisis of confidence. Once the action has started, that idea is dropped and it never resurfaces.Cliffhanger is also an action film that's a little rough around the edges. Some of the editing is clumsy and not as tight as it should have been. For example, Gabe has driven off making it clear he wants nothing to do with any rescue attempts. The next time we see him he's on the mountain ahead of Hal. We get the impression there may have been a scene in between showing him changing his mind, but that's been left on the cutting room floor. Harlin may have been going for slick, but honestly it comes off as a hatchet job.John Lithgow is completely over the top, but at least he gets a lot of memorable one liners. Lithgow is an odd choice for an action film villain, and its clear he's trying to channel a bit of Hans Gruber into his performance, but he can't quite pull it off. A pity really considering John Lithgow is a fine actor most of the time.Janine Turner gets a thankless role as the love interest. Her performance as Jessie is really bad, and her character is so poorly written because of the way she alternates from feisty to useless screamer. When you think of Sandra Bullock in some of her action films, you will see how this character could have been played.There are some memorable action scenes to be had though. As well as the opening one, there's a great moment where an actual stuntman makes his way across a cable from one plane to the next in midair. That's a fine bit of stunt-work, and gives new meaning to death-defying. I also like the scene when Gabe falls through the ice being pursued by one of Qualen's men, his fight with Qualen on a helicopter, and the lovely closing shot of the mountains.Cliffhanger is by no means motion picture poetry. But it's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half, and you do cheer along when some of the villains get their comeuppance. You just wish it were a bit more coherent.But then, they can't all be Die Hard, can they?",Cliffhanger

99,gary-444,Terrific Action Movie,9,16 June 2010,"This is no cerebral or arty thriller. It is an old fashioned mix of a great story, good acting, great action and an imposing setting. Director Renny Harlin cut his teeth on big budget movies with the adequate ""Die Hard 2"". But here he excels, getting the maximum out of every part of this picture to create a hugely satisfying entity.The opening scene is like a James Bond pre-credit opener. Sly Stallone revels in the part of Gabe Walker as he reluctantly comes out of retirement to assist with a climbing rescue. The scenery is staggering and provides an awesome backdrop to a climbing accident which results in Gabe dropping a fellow climbers girlfriend to her death from a rope between two towering stacks much to the displeasure of her boyfriend. These two are then thrown together when a bank heist goes wrong and they are forced to help the criminals recover the loot which has been scattered across a mountainous landscape which Gabe is uniquely placed to assist them with.John Lithgow does the evil as the lead criminal, with Craig Fairbrass from English Fire Station Soap ""London's Burning"" pleasingly villainous as his side-kick, Delmar. Avalanches, shoot outs, white-outs, helicopter rescues and cliff-face peril thrill throughout as the baddies try to get away with their ill-gotten gains. Yes the scenes are set-pieces, and the scene in which Gabe lets his would be female rescue slip through his fingers clichéd in the way it is shot. But it doesn't matter. Without exception the action scenes are riveting and entertaining which is surely what a good slice of cinema going should be about.",Cliffhanger

Slyvester Stallone And Renny Harlin At Their Best.",10,5 December 2014,"Cliffhanger is an excellent,thrilling and exciting Action-Adventure-Thriller that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,fantastic Action,incredible stunts,amazing photography and a memorable score. All of those elements make Cliffhanger not only one of my favorite Action films but also one of the best Action movies of the 1990s that is Slyvester Stallone and Renny Harlin at their best.Cliffhanger tells the story of Gabe Walker(Slyvester Stallone),a mountain climber and rescue ranger who goes up against sadistic criminal Eric Qualen(John Lithgow)who along with his hired guns are looking for three briefcases that's filled with 100 Million Dollars. With his back against the wall Gabe has to find the money before Qualen does stop Qualen and survive at all costs.Cliffhanger is a brilliant and unforgettable Action-Thriller that is easily one of the best Action movies of the 1990s and another Slyvester Stallone classic that is an absolute roller coaster ride from beginning to end that is an Adventure in highest order and when you watch the movie you will have a blast. It's also one of two films released in 1993(the film other being Demolition Man)that were Box Office hits for Sly Stallone and were seen as a comeback for Stallone after some Box Office flops. Right from it's now classic and memorable 13 minute opening scene(which perfectly sets the tone for the entire film)Cliffhanger is an Action movie that just grabs viewers by the throat and never lets go with everything done in an large,epic scale whether it's the Action or Suspense you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. It has everything a great Action movie should have:a good story,incredible Action Good Guys Vs Bad Guys everything that makes a good and entertaining popcorn film while putting viewers on the edge of the seats throughout the film. While Cliffhanger is basically Die Hard on a Mountain Cliffhanger is one of the best films to take the Die Hard concept and place it in the Rocky Mountains giving viewers an intense and amazing experience. The Action sequences in Cliffhanger are fantastic,explosive and done with terrific skill and suspense and when the suspense stops the Action comes at you like a punch in the face. With every Action scene everything from the gunfights,explosions and stunts is big,loud and very powerful. The stunt work in Cliffhanger is truly sensational whether it's with the Action scenes or the Mountain climbing scenes giving the movie a realism and accuracy even though some things are exaggerated. While Cliffhanger is still an Action movie it's also a movie that is very beautiful and stunning to look at thanks to the photography by Alex Thomson. Thomson's photography is amazing and make the Rocky Mountains more beautiful than they already were giving the movie a stylish and memorable look that makes Cliffhanger standout from most of the Action movies during the 1990s. The main character Gabe Walker is very much an Action movie character that gets into fights and is heroic but doesn't use a gun instead using the mountain and his smarts to beat the bad guys. While an Action hero Gabe is also a character with depth because we see Gabe trying to climb the mountains again after a unfortunate incident that killed his will to climb a mountain. We see Gabe trying to not only save the day and trying to climb the mountain again but also try to repair his friendships. The ending of Cliffhanger is a fantastic and memorable conclusion because there is enough Action,thrills and excitement that will leave viewers happy and satisfied. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Slyvester Stallone is excellent and at his best as Gabe Walker,with Stallone bringing depth,intensity and charisma to the role. John Lithgow is brilliant and at his bad guy best as Eric Qualen,with Lithgow being delightful and evil. Michael Rooker is wonderful as Hal Tucker,Gabe's best friend. Janine Turner is terrific as Jessie,Gabe's girlfriend. Rex Linn gives an outstanding,hilarious scene stealing performance as Agent Travers,a corrupt Treasury Agent working with Qualen. Paul Winfeld is good as Walter Wright,a Treasury Agent. Ralph Waite does a fine job as Frank,a rescue ranger. Caroline Goodall(Kristal),Leon(Kynette),Craig Fairbass(Delmar),Gregory Scott Cummins(Ryan)and Denis Forest(Heldon)are memorable as Qualen's henchmen. Max Perlich and Trey Brownell are fun as Evan and Brett best friends who are thrill seekers. Michelle Joyner(Sarah)and Vyto Ruginis(FBI Agent Matheson)give good performances as well.The direction by Renny Harlen is outstanding,with Harlen always moving the camera and giving the movie a stunning and memorable look while doing a fantastic job with the Action scenes. Great direction,Harlen.The score by Trevor Jones is amazing,epic and suspenseful and fits perfectly with the tone and atmosphere of the film. Wonderful score,Jones.In final word,if you're a fan of Slyvester Stallone,Renny Harlin or Action films,I highly suggest you see Cliffhanger,an excellent,thrilling and exciting Action-Adventure Thriller that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Cliffhanger

He made so many good movies in his career that are my favorite movies. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Deep Blue Sea, Mindhunters and Skiptrace. Real good movies that are my favorite. Sylvester Stallone is Gabe Walker a rescue climber who becomes involved in the failed heist of a U.S. Treasury plane flying through the Rocky Mountains. Another movie that put Stallone in the underdog character. I would put this movie between Rocky, Rambo: First Blood and Over the Top because Stallone plays that kind a characters. Gabe becomes Rocky when he fight the nature, he climbs up the wall without his climbing gear in a t-shirt whithout his jacket. He becomes one man army after the hijcakers kidnapps his friend Hale Tucker (Michael Rooker) and force him to search three suitcases full of money. Gabe knows after they will located and get the money they will kill his friend and he has to get to the suitcases first.In the opening scene we have attempted rescue failure when the hero Gabe fails to save the girlfriend Sarah (Michelle Joyner) and he drops her of the cable into her death. This is the first time in the opening scene we see a hero failing to save a life. ""Gabe"" Walker, a former mountain climber and rescue ranger. This is my fvaorite character Stallone played. The movie earned over $255,000,211 it was another year of Stallone. In 1985 Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rocky IV both earned over $300.000,000 Cliffhanger is another successful movie that put Stallone on the top of his career.Sylvester Stallone is excellent as the lead role, his acting ability is professional and a bad-ass. In here Gabe Walker dosen't use guns or knives he uses his mind and he has to fight for survival againts the nature and criminals in the Rocky Mountains. John Lithgow was excellent as Eric Qualen fantastic job as the bad guy. Michael Rooker is fantastic as the good guy Hal Tucker love his acting performance. Janine Turner as Jessie Deighan, Walker's love interest is gorgeous and likable I like her, I really like that she try to help those people I love her. Exccellent performance ever. Caroline Goodall as Kristel was another likable actress that I like her. She was talented as the villian. Rex Linn as Richard Travers was excelelnt villian he was in CSI: Miami and Rush Hour he was great. Ralph Waite R.I.P. as Frank was another likable actor that I love. Max Perlich and Trey Brownell were great as Gabe's friends I love them when they talkwith gabe in the opening sequence. Leon Robinson as Kynette was a bad-ass henchman I love him.The mountains I love the snow the night scenes. There was a stuntman that was hierd to jump off the plane without parachute he slide the cable in to other plane. That was for real, he was payed $1.000.000 and he did that stunt only once. You have an explosion on the bridge that explodes practical explosion. You have bats in the cave in which Gabe and Jessie accidently discover them. Actually the dialogue reminds us on ""First Blood"" Two of Qualen's men start fighting and Qualen breaks the off and says the fight is not here, it's over thetre."". The same dialouge was used in First Blood when Ward and Mitch fight each other and Teasle says ""The fight's out here!"" Great action, wonderful practical effects, excellent stunts, great direction and great acting from everyone. They are three explosions in this movie. Agent Travers shot with a machine gun a rabbit but rabbit survives in here. In the workrprint cut the bunny is shot to pieces. Stallone re model the bunny and change the effect that the bunny survives because Sly loves animlas like Jean.-Claude Van Damme. My favorite scene in the movie is fight between Stallone and Kynette (Leon) the henchmamn kicks Walker's but I love when Gabe granbs the guy hold him nad stab him like in a slasher horror movie. Even Kynette's knive looked like Rambo's knive. The bridge scene is fantastic filmed when Gabe Walker set's a trap wire off handcuffed with C4 he runs you see Sly running with an explosion on the bridge. Great choreography.I love this movie to death. One of my personal favorite action film of all time. This is my movie my action movie it means everything to me. Stallone fan for life. I love the music score from Trevor Jones. It is Rated R for violence and language. For 1993 it is not a dated movie it come out the same year as Demolition Man, Hard Target and Jurassic Park my favorite movies of al time, they are my movies. I have this movie on Blu-ray disc I have 2 copy's of Cliffhanger on Blu-ray. In 2015 I watch this movie with my dad he loved the film too. Cliffhanger it is a thrill seeking action in the mountains. This movie get's perfect 10!",Cliffhanger
104,jb_campo,Falls short - coulda been a contender,6,4 May 2021,"Cliffhanger could have been a much better film but it fell short.The story revolves around a group of Rocky Mountain rescue staff who love climbing for a living versus an evil gang of killers looking to rip off a boatload of cash from the govt when fate brings them all together.Stallone delivers a decent job as the likeable super climber. Gabe. Due to a terrible accident, he leaves the mountain and his friends, then suddenly returns. No real explanation why. He's apparently in a relationship with. Jessie but had no problem leaving her for a year. Doesn't make sense, like several things in this movie.The bad guy is of course John Lithgow who sometimes talks with a pseudo British accent because he's an international bad guy. He's got his mob of bad guys and they all end up on the mountain trying to retrieve this stolen money with the help of a turncoat.This sets you up for a pretty good thriller. But then, the dialog starts. I cringed at almost every sentence that any of the bad guys uttered. It was just excruciating how stock and just crappy the dialog was. They would say stupid stuff and do stupid stuff to measure their manhood against each other. That worthless banter dragged this movie into a crevasse of mediocrity.The other good guy Hal (John Rooker) was pretty good - I recognize him from other movies, not famous, but decent. He and Stallone are on the outs but yet they end up rebonding to fight the bad guys. They had me rooting for them, which was a positive.The cinematography was wonderful. The climbing scenes and air scenes were very real and exciting. But so much of the plot just didn't make sense, mostly around the bad guys doing stupid stuff, repeatedly.The final scene was very predictable, and possibly Mission Impossible stole this for one of their movies, but we've seen it before.Cliffhanger could have been an 8/10 if they had a decent screenwriter for dialog, and a better director to weed out the terrible stupid scenes. Still, it was mildly entertaining despite that, and with the beautiful scenery, I'd give it a 6/10.",Cliffhanger

106,tburke85,Cliffhanger A Decent Action Crime Adventure With Some Flaws,7,28 June 2009,"Cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker the expert climber especially in the action/fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic. For the sake of the film though I willing to suspend my disbelief. The rest of the cast including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall, and Leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie. The action/fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are. The climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the Ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie. The deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable. The villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them. The pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. Overall Cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, some suspense, excitement, thrills, and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.",Cliffhanger

108,son_of_cheese_messiah,Cliffhanger AKA Potboiler,4,2 July 2014,"The sweeping orchestral music (probably the highlight of the film) prepares us for an epic and exciting film and the opening scene does not disappoint. One may quibble as to how a girl who is afraid of heights manages to climb to the top of a high mountain. That said, her acting is almost perfect, with a look of genuine fear through-out. The whole scene with her swinging helpless on the line is grippingly (pun not intended) done and the outcome was a surprise to me, at least.Alas the film then falls more steeply than she does. A cast of cookie cutter homicidal villains make a failed (and very bloody) robbery of a plane and the booty is scattered over a mountain range. making it a bugger to retrieve. This crew of cut-out villains are led by John Lithgow (affecting a curious English accent which makes him sound like Stewie Griffin)and comprise two other genuine Brits, a black guy who looks strangely out of place, and an angry bald white man. They all hate each other and are quite prepared to murder each other in cold blood, so one wonders how they ever got together. This is clearly bad script writing 101, and one can imagine the script-writers (which include the great Stallone himself) saying ""we must have conflict between the characters"", but it is so overdone that it almost becomes comical.However there is so much swearing and gore that laughing is quite out of the question. Obviously Stallone swings in to save the day, although not without a number of innocents being mowed down.This is one of those movies where all the creativity goes into devising the most gruesome deaths possible and none goes into the script. The script is actually completely ludicrous, a mere peg to hang these gruesome scenes on. Possibly the most gory and ridiculous is the death of the black guy. In a display of superhuman strength, Stallone Clean and Jerks him to be impaled on a stalagmite.The final fight between Stallone and Lithgow is impressively shot.",Cliffhanger
109,AwesomeWolf,Almost Stallone's best,9,13 May 2005,"I don't think I'll ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most awesome action movies ever. That's right, you little punks, 'Cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it.Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), assist in a rescue on a mountain peak. Walker obviously came back at a convenient time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.S. government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back...Essentially, 'Cliffhanger' is another 'Die Hard' clone. Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. Naturally, that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough, as Stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease, and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. After all, isn't that what action movies are all about?'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning, it maintains its action awesomeness. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad dude. Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely Renny Harlin's best effort, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10",Cliffhanger

111,netwallah,Bad people and bad acting in high places,1,8 February 2006,"Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Cowritten by and starring Sylvester Stallonethat should have been enoughand featuring too many rock-climbing scenes, vertigo, falling, and scene-chewing villains and a botched airborne heist. There are two plots, both lame. One involves a traumatic failed rescue, and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty, and killing various harmless people whenever possible. The usually reliable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product, is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn't care ""Bostid!"" in a vague approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played Maggie on Northern Exposure, is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot. Stallone is stolid and muscle-headed. No deathless lines in this one. No living lines, either.",Cliffhanger
112,refinedsugar,Sometimes you hit. Sometimes you miss.,5,4 July 2001,"Cliffhanger is a movie with potential. It fails at delivering much of this, but effort is half the battle. Stallone does his job, the story isn't half bad either. Unfortunately it fails to live up to the decent set up in the first half when it goes the route of the typical inane and borderline stupid action flick in the second act.Which is too bad. It's not too often you see an action movie that takes place in snow covered mountains of rock. If nothing else it makes for unique scenery. The cast are the real losers here though as they just aren't given very much to do. Michael Rooker gets to hobble around being embittered. Stallone gets to do his prerequisite number of screams as he dives out of danger's way while John Lithgow gets stuck playing the one dimensional mastermind bad guy. Paul Winfield probably gets the best and the worst. He doesn't have too much screen time which is good when you are stuck in this movie, but his only appearances are inside a helicopter barking mad dog orders to an underling.Cliffhanger is watchable on a rainy day, but not memorable in my book. Everything feels tired and predictable. It may have made grand bank in it's day, but even die-hard Stallone fans or non-discriminating action junkies will have a hard time highly praising it.",Cliffhanger
113,blazesnakes9,"Good, but not great Stallone adventure",7,17 August 2014,"For several years, Sylvester Stallone had been in one turkey after another. Before he starred in Cliffhanger, he starred in a number of flops such as Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot and Oscar. For some reason, Stallone somehow lost his way in the movie world and got stuck making forgettable flops like those two movies. My best guess is that either his next film will be a hit or a miss. And to tell you the truth, Cliffhanger is definitely an hit, an huge hit for the box office.Stallone plays an rescue mountain climber who, in the beginning of the movie, is trying to rescue his friend, Hal Tucker, (Michael Rooker), and his girlfriend from an mountain. Unfortunately, the rescue attempt doesn't go smoothly as the clip on Rooker's girlfriend snaps and slips through the harness. She falls to her death down an gorge, leaving both Rooker and Stallone, devastated.Months later, Stallone is living by himself, away from his other friend, played by Janine Turner. Stallone is scarred for life because of what happened months ago with the death of Rooker's girlfriend death. However, he continues to climbs mountains anyway.The centerpiece of the story involves an group of villains, lead by John Lithgow. Their plan is to rob an U.S. Treasury plane with three cases holding millions of dollars. Their high-altitude plan goes completely wrong when their plane crash lands in the Rocky Mountains, leaving the bad guys, stranded in the snowy wilderness. Seeking help, they radioed help from the local mountain rescue center. Soon enough, Stallone and Rooker finds themselves caught up with the bad guys as they are being used by the villains to help find their stolen loot in the Mountains.The great thing about Cliffhanger is it's mountain climbing scenes. I actually started to believe that these actors were really climbing an mountain, instead of climbing an fake mountain that was build on a studio set. These are real mountains, all right. With that being said, the action sequences are well directed although I had a hard time believing in the way the bad guys were able to get the three cases into their plane while trying to fly their plane through the high altitude. Most of the action sequences in Cliffhanger are so energetic and sometimes scary due to the fact that some of the bad guys fall off the mountain. And when these characters are leaning over the edge of the mountains in some of the scenes in the movie, I was actually afraid that they would fall.The movie was directed by Renny Harlin, who directed the second Die Hard movie and he does a very good job creating an stunning visual sensation with the beautiful shots of the canyons and gorges. The movie was shot in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and the use of the locations in the movie are very useful as a setting for a movie like this. I couldn't really picture myself climbing those mountains by hanging off the side of it. For those who know what I am talking about, it pretty scary.Stallone is okay as the lead character. He tries his best to not only play an action hero, but an flawed one, too. The best performance comes from John Lithgow, who plays the leader of the group. His British accent and his ways of taking people out of his plan is very sadistic, making him the perfect villain. He is maybe different from the villain in Harlin's last film, Die Hard 2, but Lithgow does a very good job playing the bad guy who doesn't take chances.With the exception of Cliffhanger, I could only say that Stallone is mild in this movie. He isn't really that great, but at least give him credit for trying to become an flawed character. That's important because we've seen Stallone play heroes before like Rocky Balboa or John Rambo. Those characters are like superhuman characters that are meant to win in the end of the movie. Here, it turns an different direction. It's interesting to see him tackle this kind of role because it's surprising and interesting. As for the action sequences and the mountain scenes, those scenes will have you admiring the breath- taking views of the Rockies. I will say though that this movie might even give you vertigo because of the scenes involving climbing especially the beginning of the movie which is clearly authentic. ★★★ 3 stars.",Cliffhanger

120,CinefanR,Action entertainment at its best,10,29 June 2012,"I absolutely LOVE this movie; along with Die Hard 1,2 and 3, it's the best, most entertaining action film of all time. These movies are fun and spectacular, entertaining and brilliantly done. They simply don't make them like this anymore.
Anything that Stallone did in the 80's and 90's was ""so bad it's good"", but this one is simply spectacular on epic scale! Stallone doesn't have a clue about acting (and he couldn't have), but he's trying so hard, God bless him... The icing on the cake here is John Lithgow, none other than the master of the ""over-the-top acting"", whose bad British accent only adds up to the camp. He is focusing so much on the damn accent it's distracting. The take accent comes and goes.
Magnificent alpine landscapes make a perfect setting, and the pace is alert indeed, with some of the most spectacular stunts and action sequences ever filmed. The sweeping music score is truly memorable and feel-good, the stunts are amazing, the direction is brilliant. Whoever chose the filming locations is a genius.Bad characters are really evil (and extremely funny, I might add), the good guys are really good and brave and have super-human strength (Stallone is climbing mountain walls bare-handed in the blizzard, wearing just a T-shirt), the one-liners are on the same epic scale as the breath-taking scenery, and of course ""Cliffhanger"" has dialogue so dumb it's unintentionally hilarious.

122,antoniokowatsch,My guilty pleasure,5,31 January 2019,"I always liked this movie but after re-watching it I kind of changed my mind a little bit. I still like the movie but I'm a little bit more objective about it now.
What this movie has going for it is quite obviously the beautiful landscape. It's truly breathtaking. Even after all these years it's still a magical sight to behold. And the film score was also pretty good.However, certain aspects of the story don't make any sense after careful consideration. Take e.g. the scene where the feds discuss the ""robbery"" in the hallway. This scene added nothing to the story. It was completely superfluous. What's even worse is that the FBI didn't play any role in the movie. I mean, other than the aforementioned hallway scene they didn't seem to care about the lost money. Because if they did care, they would've investigated the matter immediately and by doing so would've interfered in some way. I kind of feel like this was a missed opportunity. I mean, why did they include a scene where FBI agents discuss the robbery if they aren't going to do anything about it?Furthermore, I would also like to mention that the dialogue in many scenes is laughable and cheesy. Seriously. I mean, now that I'm older some of these scenes seemed completely ridiculous. The bad guys had monologues that sounded like they were written by a 12-year old. That black guy e.g. had me cracking up with his stereotypical ""bad guy"" monologues. It was funny, but unintentionally so.Between the ""rabbit scene"" and the 40-foot cliff-to-cliff jump of Stallone in one scene, let's just say that this movie is a little bit unrealistic. Oh yeah, and don't get me started on the animatronic bats. I know that animatronics were pretty advanced in 1993. After all Jurassic Park's dinosaurs were animatronic and that movie came out in the same year as Cliffhanger. Just thought I should point that out.Now, don't get me wrong. I still like the movie but I feel like I have to rate this movie more objectively.",Cliffhanger
123,SPaS,"Your basic grade ""A"" actioner ***mild spoiler***",8,31 October 2001,"All right, now here's an action film that delivers! Picture a school that the action directors of the future go to. Before they graduate, they have to study and analyze a basic action flick from a list of ten actioners. If such a school and list existed, ""Cliffhanger"" should be on that list! We got a setting, a situation, heroes and villains and all of them are way above average. The plot keeps it all (in a good way) simple all the way, and director Harlin is in his own territory- result is an outcome as energetic and exciting as ever! Suffers just a bit from editing made after test screening: The shooting of the bunny - after editing the bunny still looks like it got hurt. If Harlin wasn't so sadistic, he'd have let the bunny get away unharmed in the first place. The outcome would have been welcomely hilarious- now it's just semi- hilarious. Enough violence already!The King's leap- scene - [read the ""alternative versions""] A dumb idea in the first place! Why didn't they have the bridge blown up in the middle - Stallone would have jumped to the hanging half of the bridge on the other side and using it as a ladder, climbed up. Now of course that would have resembled ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" a bit, but either that or dump the whole jump (I'd have used it, because one like it looked great in ""Vertical limit"")! Now, the 'jump' Stallone uses when he escapes from Travers, looks weird and out of place - as it is!But, two minor complaints in an overall good action movie is nothing.

Were all these characters really outer space aliens?Enjoy the climbing, particularly by Stallone, ignore the goofiness in the battles, and never let yourself wonder why anyone is doing what they are.

But to compare Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion.The excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill, suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws. The heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before.The biting cold of the snow capped Alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation. The forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end.Good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then.

And we do need these kind of movies time and now because always watching a movie that depicts the real life and nothing more can be quite boring. We do need our escape routes from the daily grind.Stallone's movie Cliffhanger is an action classic. One of the best movies that Stallone has been a part of. Breathtaking stunts, beautiful action sequences and a screen play that simply fails to bore us, Cliffhanger is among the best action movies I have ever seen. There is no doubt about the fact that time and now one gets to see a lot of sequences that you know are virtually impossible in the real world but as I have already said, it is good to have some movies like these that within certain limits provide an escape route from our routine world into a world of fantasy.Stallone plays the role of a professional mountaineer and a rescue officer. At the very start of the movie, you see a beautiful shot of a rescue mission gone wrong. Gabe (Stallone) does not manage to ever forgive himself for letting that operation go wrong. After a break he comes back and finds himself a part of the sinister gang operation. Every shot in the movie is so awesome and amazing. The stunt team assembled to achieve these shots is among the best ones I've ever seen. They leave us with images that have a lasting impact.The plot does not become boring and obvious anytime. It keeps you to the edge of your seat and gives you your money's worth. No matter how much you choose to criticize Stallone and his movies, there is no doubt that this is one of the best Stallone action movies ever. Surely it deserves the praise for its well shot scenes more than the criticism for being unrealistic. And even when this movie becomes unrealistic time and now, it still comes with its thrills and excitements. One will find it easy to ignore the realism aspect of it anytime in exchange of the enjoyment and the thrill the overall movie gives you.This movie is highly recommended for all movie fans. The action sequences and photography are something to watch out for. No matter how low this movie is rated, it will continue to excite fans for ages to come. Cheers.",Cliffhanger
129,skullislandsurferdotcom,A Nice Climb,7,2 February 2012,"The opening scene, as intrepid rescue worker Sylvester Stallone attempts saving a woman hanging onto a cable connected from a really high mountaintop to a helicopter, sets a nice stage to one of the better (or perhaps the only decent) Sly action flicks during the 1990s.Cut to a group of T-MEN embarking on a plane trip to move three suitcases of money, and wouldn't you know: they just happen to crash on the same mountain where Stallone had worked before quitting and, eight months later, returning for his woman. But she's content with the same job as a rescuer who, along with Michael Rooker, Ralph Waite and a reluctant Stallone, is thrust into ""saving"" the plane-wrecked villains led by a really nasty John Lithgow, who really wants the money residing in various locations throughout the storm-ridden mountaintops. And it's up to Stallone and Rooker to recover it, or else.Stallone makes for a worthy action hero, which is no surprise, but since you can tell he's doing most of his own stunts in genuinely dangerous settings, his physicality, along with Renny Harlin's weaving camera, makes for a star-director collaboration that, although loaded with corny dialog, is a fun ride. With every scene there's another goon to thwart (including Rex Linn in a great performance) and a new peak to climb.Janine Turner is more than eye-candy as Stallone's independently daring girlfriend, while John Lithgow not only chews the scenery but blows bubbles with it. And that's okay – because even the silly stuff works.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",Cliffhanger
130,LagerLagerLagerShouting,One Of Stallone's Better Efforts.,7,30 April 2008,"This run-of-mill actioner has all the basic cliché ingredients of the genre but is set apart by its unique isolated setting and some amazing stunt-work. The typical 90's action aesthetic is it play here, that of a fallen anti-hero protagonist who, traumatised by a passed event, comes back to save the day. This coupled with your typical trigger-happy bad guys, unpredictable head psycho, characteristic female moral conscious and the right hand man who was once your friend offers a predictable premise. But the set-pieces and spectacular scenery shine through and throw in some great one-liners then you have a pretty entertaining night in with some beers.7/10",Cliffhanger

133,xiaoli7377,Sly Goes Mountain Climbing,7,22 August 2020,"Sylvester Stallone, John Lithgow, and Michael Rooker star in this 90s action blockbuster. It's got all of the expected action movie clichés: a brave hero who has gone through trauma; a psychotic, cold, and calculating villain who will stop at nothing to get his way; a leading female as the love interest for the hero; an estranged friend who has a complicated history; a host of colorful, bumbling henchmen who bicker and fight amongst themselves every chance they get.The plot involves muscular mountain climbers facing off against criminals who are attempting to steal $100 million in uncirculated bills from the U.S. Treasury. A botched mid-flight plane robbery leaves a group of miscreants stranded in the middle of the Rocky Mountains, and the heroes receive their call for help over the radio. It's nothing really ground breaking that hadn't been done up to that point in other films like ""Die Hard"" and ""Point Break"" and a dozen different Bond films.The one thing that I really like about this one is the setting. We get some very thrilling and breath-taking stunts amid the Rocky Mountains. Lithgow's performance as egomaniacal villain Eric Quaren is also pretty decent, if a bit stale. Cheesy one-liners and the lack of a compelling motive and backstory for his character kind of kill it for me, as well as the fact that his on-again, off-again faux British accent feels like it needs a bit more practice and consistency when he speaks. Stallone's character on the other hand is actually pretty fleshed out in comparison. It's not anything amazing or ground breaking, mind you, but the opening fifteen minutes help paint Gabe Walker in a sympathetic light and are meant to attach the viewer to the character. His relationship with Michael Rooker's character, Hal Tucker, is believable as a close yet troubled friendship, and it works as a device to drive the plot. There are times when he comes off as a bit of a helpless sidekick to Walker, but Tucker is able to get his own sweet and gruesome revenge against a particularly cold and cheesy baddie later in the film.What really dates the film in my opinion are the ""Beavis and Butthead"" extreme sports junkies Evan and Brett, played by Max Perlich and Trey Brownell, respectively. The stereotypical 20-something college age buffoons who watch MTV and who go base jumping. I'm not sure if they were intended as comic relief for the film or what, but they make the movie seem very early 90s and very goofy. Thankfully they only get about five minutes of screen time altogether, which also kind of leaves me questioning why they remain in the film to begin with.Overall, ""Cliffhanger"" is a fun action film to spend an afternoon watching. Some very thrilling action sequences and good performances from Stallone and Lithgow make this a good watch to go with some popcorn. It is by no means essential viewing or fine cinema, but it does rank up there among the many ""Rocky"" and ""Rambo"" sequels as one of Stallone's best, and it also serves as a good way to mix things up if you're tired of watching ""Die Hard"" on repeat as your go-to action movie of the time period.",Cliffhanger

It stars Sylvester Stallone, John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, and Janine Turner. Excellent acting and outstanding special effects really bring out the excellence in this film. Intensity and sheer terror really bring out the thrills in this film.Sylvester Stallone is the perfect action-rescuer guy, John Lithgow is the perfect bad guy that uses guns, fiery explosives, and extreme violence to win the thing he desperately craves. I'M NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY! I strongly recommend that NOBODY under the age of 14 see this film. It's violence level is on the heavy scale and the language is on the extreme scale and it's terror is on the terrifying scale. There is a lot of blood and gunshots in this movie. There was a lot of 'F' words and 'motherf***er' works too. And the terror...terrifying.This movie has non-stop action from it's frightening beginning to it's explosive conclusion. It's conclusion is explosive, but very short and very mediocre. Well, I mean the ending is literally explosive, if you know what I mean. The director could have done more with the ending. But otherwise, this movie is filled with violence and terror and fiery explosives that makes this one of the best action-adventure-thrillers ever made.Spectacular, intense, strong, pulse-pounding, heart-stomping, throat-tightening, great, awesome, sweet, incredulous, super, brilliant, and very violent!

135,sonofhades,And some people find this movie good?,1,15 July 2001,"I am still shuddering at the thought of EVER seeing this movie again.I have seen action films, I have even liked quite a few of them, but this one goes over the top.Not only does it have the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) playing the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground, would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with IQ less than his shoenumber to believe it. Furthermore, the plot has no real twists at all, a three year old kid could guess what comes next. It is a set of cliches (of action genre), with Sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in Rambo III if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). Now there is an actor who can't act A) surprised B) sad C) anything else than his basic face. I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, but then... you can see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are magnificient, but then... there are documentaries about the Alps and Himalayas, so you can see better sights that way, rather than waste time on this flick.Go watch some other movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands better action movies.",Cliffhanger
136,VictorianCushionCat,Hold On!,8,3 August 2009,"After the success of Die Hard and it's sequels it's no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glut of 'Die Hard on a .....' movies cashed in on the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. That is what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone's career.Cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! However, if you an forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs.You've got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent, Rex Linn as Travers.He may of been Henry in 'Portrait of a Serial Killer' but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as Hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' And whilst he surely can't be, it really does look like Ralph Waite's Frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death.Mention too must go to former 'London's Burning' actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football, yes, you can't help enjoy that bit, Hal needed a good kicking.So forget your better judgement, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy!

137,kimnil80,Memorable action movie,8,25 September 2006,"""Cliffhanger"" has always been one of my favorite action movies since it came back in 1993. It holds up pretty well today. Reasons: the movie is as predictable as many other movies in the genre. But two things sets it apart: humor and villains. There are MANY cool one- liners in this movie and many fine villains, where John Lithgow hits bullseye with an downright evil performance so to speak. He simply is that: pure EVIL. He don't care for anyone. He don't have sympathy for anyone. Feelings are something he don't know. That's why he's so cool: he is completely over the top. Otherwise: OK acting(even by Stallone), spectacular scenery and action scenes. Photography is amazing. Story is weak, but the scenery makes up for it. But my praise for this movie goes to the villains. Simply great villains. Shame Hollywood don't make them like this anymore. Shame Renny Harlin has fallen like he has. Now he makes just crap. No ""Cliffhanger""s anymore. If you should recover Renny: welcome back.",Cliffhanger

140,LawnBoy-4,Insultingly stupid,2,29 September 2017,"(Spoilers ahead)I get that action yarns such as this typically require a partial or complete suspension of disbelief, but, when a movie comes along that is so staggeringly stupid that the requirement of said suspension constitutes an intellectual assault on the viewer, well, it's impossible to give the film makers a pass. This is such a movie.Others have already covered the plot in more detail than is necessary, so you've already been sufficiently apprised of the fact that Lithgow & Co. are searching the mountains of Colorado (Canadian rockies, in actuality) for the money they've stolen and subsequently lost. Stallone, in typical Stallone fashion, plays the over-the-top action hero who is, in this specific case, a tortured soul thanks to his inability to save a friend from a tragic fall.Moving on to the idiocy, I'll list but a few of the offenses that make this movie so unforgettably awful:1. The 60-year old, non-weight rated, hardware store-quality rope that manages to somehow hold both Stallone and ""Jesse"" as they repel their way to eventual safety whilst fraying, piece by piece. In tact, the rope would not hold either one, let alone both, for 5 seconds before breaking. The idea that it would be able to hold both of them, even after having sustained broken braids caused me to roll my eyes so far into the back of my head that I actually sustained a headache.2. The scene in which Stallone manages to kill Travis from below river surface may have been the single most offensively unrealistic scene in the movie and here's why: First, when the body spends any degree of time in freezing water, muscles become nearly ""paralyzed"", making quick movements almost impossible. Yet somehow, Stallone was able to quickly remove his shirt, see through the murky water/ice and, in quick-draw fashion, shoot Travis as he stood above him on the ice. Next, As we saw earlier in the movie, the cold temps caused Stallone to struggle after having encountered Jesse in the shelter. How, in God's name, was he not completely hypothermic after having been submerged for an extended period in icy water? Further, how did he manage to dry so quickly and remain calm (and non-shivering) within 10 mins after he had been rescued from the depths? Props to him for managing to restyle his hair, too! Finally, how was his decision to grab Travis and pull both of them into icy water an even remotely logical decision? 3. As great of an actor as John Lithgow has demonstrated himself to be, his scenery chewing and overacting were beyond absurd. Coupled with the vaguely European accent and repeated utterances of ""BOSTID!"" (bastard), his performance was just way over the top.4. Following on from #1 above, the scene in which Stallone somehow managed to grab and hold onto a rock face with one hand while gripping and ultimately pulling Jesse to safety with the other (all without chalk or ropes!) did, admittedly, cause me to laugh audibly, so props to the film makers for that.5. The use of night vision goggles during a supposed ""night"" scene (when Stallone and one of the villains slid for what appeared to be a couple of miles in the snow) was especially absurd given the fact that it was obviously filmed during the light of day.These are but a few of this film's transgressions. Overall, this is an Ed Wood/Uwe Boll-level action flick that begs for a Rifftrax treatment. The only reason I afforded it as many as two stars was due to the cinematography.",Cliffhanger

Cliffhanger will keep you on the edge of your seat why? Well because the characters will be on the edge too! Sly is just a skilled man who bleeds and has to cope with a lot of problems throughout the film and not a testosterone-filled beast that eats bullets for breakfast. The action scenes are great, full of nicely directed battles, chases and mountain climbing stunts. The performances are quite solid with characters you'll actually care for and with villains that you'll actually hate. Finally the film simply looks beautiful. Usually Action Movies don't look too good, even when we talk about good movies. This one looks though and not only because of the wonderful and breathtaking mountain setting but also because of excellent cinematography.You'll hate Cliffhanger if: If you wanted a more typical RAMBO-like action movie, with insane fights and cheesy characters and one-liners oooooor if you hate Action Movies!!! There aren't exactly many bad things to say about this film, so unless you hate Action films you'll love it.

144,Dave-330,"Oh, the horror",2,21 July 2000,"Let me start by stating that I usually do like Renny Harlin's directing style, for the most part, and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots.  Unlike Harlin's ""Elm Street 4"", and ""Die Hard 2"" which I really liked, there is something that is missing from this movie.  That, my friends, is a script.  The dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful, but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity.  There are so many awful lines in this movie, I don't even want to have to remember any of them.  Not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure.  It's almost like Harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said, they could improve the script.  Wrong again.The sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue.  Stallone has never been a favorite of mine, but when he is acting circles around Lithgow, Turner, and the worst of the bunch Rooker, there is something wrong with this picture.  Lithgow played one of the best villains in ""Ricochet"", yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here.  How is that possible?  I've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by Stallone, who himself still phoned-in his performance.  Turner's part is so small and pointless, but she still manages to appear lost on screen.  Michael Rooker CAN act.  I know this because I have witnessed it in ""Days of Thunder"", but he seems like he is READING his lines from cue cards.  Has it come to this?  When Rooker and Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking, I just wanted the movie to end right there, or have them both amazingly find their acting ability.  Unfortunately, neither of those things occurred.Which brings me back to Harlin, who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters.  It's his fault that I was never drawn into this movie at all, because he should have made the people actually act.  The script is not very good, but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director.  I don't care how much was paid for the special effects, which for the most part are good, you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting.  Plus, the pacing of this movie seems to be off.  The opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done, but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all.  I mean I understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene, but I really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene.  If the bad guy's would have won early, maybe I wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever!",Cliffhanger

Under SIege had a sequel which was better than the first, the only difference in those clones is that they used martial arts and different settings, the die hard sequels didn't even stay in one place!!! This film is pretty much Die Hard, but on a mountain and with Stallone replacing Bruce Willis and adding Michael Rooker as a sidekick. The villain is deadly and evil, and there are some pretty creative action scenes in this, most were fist fights but that doesn't matter. This remains a classic Stallone film with great acting (even from Stallone) and a great villain whom is really cold hearted. I expected less from this film but i got way more.

147,JimS_8686,Die Hard Meets Rocky.,4,16 March 2008,"Two of the most influential Hollywood films of the 1980's were Die Hard and Fatal Attraction. These blockbusters left a blueprint for dozens of films in their aftermaths, which also wound up being moderate hits at the box office. Cliffhanger hit theaters about a year after the success of Under Siege, one of the many bastard sons of John McClaine. The original 1988 Bruce Willis action vehicle involved European terrorists planning a multi million dollar heist in the top floors of a skyscraper. It's sequel, 1990's Die Hard 2, had this scenario take place in an airport. 1992's Under Siege used the premise on board a submarine. 1993's Cliffhanger finds the terrorists attempting a big heist in midair. When the plan goes haywire, the money lands in the rocky mountains where Sylvester Stallone happens to be rock climbing with several peers. This film might as well have been another Rocky sequel, with Rocky stumbling across these international terrorists while training for his next fight by climbing the Alps.Cliffhanger is the Die Hard formula at it's most absurd. Here, Stallone does to rock climbers what he did to Vietnam vets with Rambo 2. A he-man like Sly has no need for protective equipment or warm clothing while scaling ice-capped mountains at such high altitudes. A tank top, bicycle shorts & his bare hands suffice. But does he get even with the bad guys who kidnap his fellow mountain climbers when they attempt to recover the suitcases full of money? If you don't know, you've never seen one of the countless Die Hard clones Hollywood cranked out in the early '90's.Cliffhanger was surprisingly one of the few Stallone vanity projects to make a profit over the past few decades. Unfortunately, it managed to bring the film careers of the lovely Janine Turner and the great John Lithgow to a screeching halt. The moral here is that sometimes success comes with failure in Tinseltown. Stallone is certainly no stranger to that.",Cliffhanger

Apart from a few early scenes where he is moping around, you mostly get the tough guy and that, of course, is our preferred Stallone format.John Lithgow is also in fine form as the villain of the piece.The plot line is clear, understandable and plausible. The scenery is incredible, the suspense and tension consistently keeping you on edge.Apparently Sly did a lot of his own stunts and he's in fine form.My only complaint about the entire film is the opening sequence where Stallone and his crew of forest rangers are rescuing another ranger and a novice climber off a mountain peak. Now, on the whole, the scene is intense and works well, but the underlying premise is ridiculous. We are expected to believe that a novice climber would find herself, with no visible equipment, on top of an extremely difficult rock climb and that an experienced ranger would take her there. Then we are asked to accept that they would choose to rescue her by tethering a helicopter to the mountain with a metal cable and letting her traverse to the helicopter in a kind of bosun's chair with safety cable, all of which would then inexplicably and utterly fail. It's preposterous.This initial scene sets up an apparent identity crisis/tension with the other forest rangers and Stallone, but the thing is, that after the first reel, there is really no reference to it at all and you wonder why they bothered.

151,csjintn,one of Stallone's best and a great movie.,9,25 April 2006,"There are those who hate Sylvester Stallone no matter what he does and/or says. While I have many movies that he has done that are awful, CLIFFHANGER is and an aptly film that is terrific from start to finish. Stallone gives a cautiously measured performance as a rescue climber who seems to have lost his edge after a horrifying accident. When a Federal Treasury plane crash lands in the mountians with a band of ruthless murderers and thieves on board, it is up to the rescuers to do what they do best. They find out about the plane's cargo and it's passengers only too late. Renny Harlin directs CLIFFHANGER with style and energy to burn. Stallone, Michael Rooker, and Janine Turner are the rescuers and John Lithgow leads his band of criminals through the mountians looking for three suitcases filled with untraceable cash. CLIFFHANGER has some incredible scenery and camera work and it's script is literate and intelligent.I do have one curious question? Was it really necessary to have Lithgow speak with an British accent? Never to quibble over technicalities, CLIFFHANGER is a solid action picture; fun, exciting, and well worth 2 hours of you time. CLIFFHANGER-***1/2 out 4.",Cliffhanger
152,PhilipJames1980,"Ah, nostalgia for an old-fashioned action movie!",8,20 February 2004,"Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s, a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as ""Die Hard in a /on a.""  Cliffhanger is ""Die Hard on a mountain,"" and pretty good, for what it is.But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege, which are decent Die Hard clones on their own terms, Cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that, in their immensity, threaten to overwhelm and  trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks.Years before other movies like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations, Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings.The opening sequence has already received substantial praise, all of which it deserves: its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening.  Not even Harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal, which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke (and which he repeated in Deep Blue Sea), or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite's face, can dim the sequence's power.The next impressive set-piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet. As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin, the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not: the bloody double-crosses are completely unexpected.  As Roger Ebert has observed, the stuntman who made the mid-air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition.Later, during the avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists/thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain. So far as I know, no one was killed in the making of this movie (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts), so obviously a dummy was used for the shot.  But the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how Harlin (or more likely one of the second-unit directors) knew exactly where to place the camera.I'll take Sly Stallone as my action hero any day of the week, because he's one of the few movie stars I've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain, and at the same time actually feels that pain.  The role of Gabe Walker really complements Stallone's acting strengths: he plays an older, more vulnerable kind of action hero, giving an impressively low-key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself.In contrast to many of today's post-Matrix, comic book-inspired action heroes, Stallone's Walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer-enhanced abilities.  In Cliffhanger, the hero almost freezes to death, and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another.  He winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut, particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a Rocky-style pummeling from one of the mad-dog villains.It should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness: when I first saw this movie as a teenager, I was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust (or rather, the ice); at one point I actually cheered as one of the most cold-blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise.Lithgow's British accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter, but he's fundamentally a good actor, and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue: in one scene, looking at his hostages Stallone and Rooker, trying to decide which tasks to give them, he actually says ""You, stay!  You, fetch!""  Even a better actor, such as Anthony Hopkins, might have had trouble with that line.Even if Cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside, it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show.Early in the movie, for example, Lithgow openly says to one of his men ""Retire [Stallone] when he comes down.""  No real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously: his carelessness allows Rooker to shout a warning up to Sly on the rock face, and this precipitates a gripping tug-of-war between Stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg.Lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means, but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given Rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor.Done very much in the style of a Saturday matinee serial or (at times) a Western, Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film.Besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before, the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with REALLY fake snow, as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action-packed narrative.  Finally, Harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless, since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes.
It's a shame that Stallone is now too old for action movies, because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably I wonder what he would be like years later.  But perhaps it's best that Cliffhanger stands on its own for all time, without a sequel: there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already.  There was an unofficial sequel that called itself Vertical Limit: compared to that clinker, Cliffhanger belongs on the IMDb's Top 250 list.Rating: 8 (Very good, especially considering most of Stallone's other movies.)",Cliffhanger

It is so awful, that I am not sure where to begin, or even if it is worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I feel sorry for 'Sly' as he puts in a decent performance for his part. But that plot ... Oh dear oh dear. I particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top, whilst the helicopter is on the way. A climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes! I could go on: but it isn't worth it. Apart from the grim opening (which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of) the rest is drivel. Sorry folks, but this is about as bad as film making gets.",Cliffhanger

Pretty good stunts, and of course the snowy mountains and climbing is cool in the movie. Some good fights. It has kind of a good story, and a very intense scene at the beginning. And its one of those movies where you count how many more bad guys are left to be killed. And i like how there are things that get screwed up with the money they are trying to find. The bad guys are mean. It is a very brutal and bloody movie. The movie is great to watch on DVD, it is extremely loud, the speakers nearly explode, with the explosions, sound effects, and gunshots. You can really hear the blood when people are shot and punched or whatever, you can hear squishy noises, very loud bone breaking, a lot of blood. And its very satisfying when the bad guys get killed.

However, if one enjoys the action genre, these movies can be very entertaining.  But then there are movies like Cliffhanger, which stretch credibility so far (while pretending that it has some) that the movie suddenly becomes laughable.  The strongest, well-bodied and athletic person in the world could not even accomplish 85% of the things Stallone seems to be able to achieve in this movie.  Not only that, but sometimes the movie defies basic scientific theories (like Armageddon does).  Even more unrealistic than True Lies, and with a much worse plot, this movie gets put near the bottom of the barrel, even among the action movies that I've seen. Stallone fans and action movie buffs may enjoy this movie, but I can't imagine anyone else feeling like their money and time was well spent.",Cliffhanger

There are a few minor things in the story that seem wrong, but still, this is a wild ride through the mountains, with actors that do a great job with their parts. Best I've seen of Sly. John Lithgow plays the cold-hearted villain to perfection. Michael Rooker is excellent as Sly's hot-blooded climbing colleague, and Michelle Joyner is superb as his girlfriend - her performance haunts me still! Janine is lovely and excellent, though her part is much like her NorEx character.

159,LivingWitness,Good movie; peak '90s ridiculousness,7,30 April 2021,"The best way to describe Cliffhanger is that it's a good halfway point between a '90s action movie's incessant need to be ridiculous and actually being a good movie. Part of this is just because it had the budget to do what it was setting out to do (though the plane crash scene towards the start does look a bit weak by modern standards) and the other part is that the performances are fairly strong.Arguably the weakest part of this movie is John Lithgow's accent. His performance is otherwise fine and he seems to be totally aware of what kind of movie this is, but I think the movie would have been fine if he kept his usual American accent instead of trying to be a British villain.Still, basically everyone involved in this movie knew that despite the movie's high budget (by the standards of the time), it was still just a silly action movie. Nobody's going out of their way to ruin it with an awful performance, but nobody's pretending that they're going to win their first Oscar because of their part in Cliffhanger.In terms of special effects and action sequences, the movie makes the best use out of its $70,000,000 budget. None of it is really groundbreaking stuff, but with the exception of the plane crash bit towards the start, all of it holds up pretty well. It doesn't have any embarrassingly dated CGI like some other movies released around this time do.Beyond that though, this is basically just a good action movie. It's never going to be considered to be among the best of the best, but it achieves what it sets out to do and it's clearly not among the worst of the genre or anything like that. It's a great movie if you just want something you don't have to think too hard about.",Cliffhanger

The plot itself is also interesting, at least in the beginning, so long as you don't expect much reality. The last 45 minutes or so, the cat-and-mouse game that Hollywood loves so much starts getting a bit boring, though. The degree of predictability also points downwards, and am I the only one who is getting tired of watching scenes where someone with a machine gun is able to hit everything but the man running in front of him? A bit more reality such places would not make such movies less interesting. But to conclude, just sit down, enjoy the ride and switch off the brain.

161,dv909,Sylvester Stallone - Action Hero,10,12 January 2007,"My Stallone kick goes on.Ever since I saw ""Rocky Balboa"" recently I've been re-watching all the Stallone flicks I remember enjoying. I recently watched the Rambo trilogy and wrote here on IMDb about ""Rambo III"" and how much I enjoyed it more than the other two. And I look forward to ""Rambo IV"".I am an unabashed Stallone fan, within reason. I cannot watch everything that he's done. But Stallone is without a doubt one of my absolute favorites. When he delivers the goods in movies, it usually counts as a very memorable viewing experience.Let me say right now that there is nothing better on TV on any night of the week than ""Cliffhanger"" on DVD on a 42"" Phillips plasma screen with Ambi-lite and 5.1 surround sound. Period.The scenery, the villains, and the action are top dollar. ""Cliffhanger"" is very enjoyable. Not for the kids mind you. The violence is absurd as a cartoon but very intense. My ten year old was mesmerized watching the first few minutes with me as he stalled going to bed. We let him watch the beginning, and then I found myself explaining to him that it was ""just a movie"". So parents beware.Stallone is all action here. He plays down his super hero status to play a believable and well fit mountain climber who is thrust into a wild situation. And that's really it. There's no other way I can dissect this flick. I had a huge bowl of popcorn, a can of ginger ale, a brain on auto pilot and not a care in the world. Kinda like when I was a teen. For a couple of hours at least.

166,bobjm,"Lots of fun, Lithgow steals the show",9,13 November 2000,"I can only guess the relatively low average rating for this movie comes from those who were expecting something totally different. Go in with the expectations you'd have for a Bond movie and you'll love it.This flick is what it is and what it is is fun. The opening ten minutes are about as nail-biting as it gets. The plot the rest of the way could be right out of one of those crazy thrillers being mass produced by the likes of Cornwell and Patterson, no more believable, no less. Bond fans will appreciate some of the aerial plane to plane, sky-diving, and mountain climbing feats accomplished here.The incredible plot twists hold up quite nicely, thank you. And Stallone has plenty of opportunity to be ""the man"" in both strength and intelligence, just as all Stallone movies demand.The movie is made most fun, however, by John Lithgow's delightful work as the international villian. He seems to relish his own evilness and we get to enjoy it with him. Check his callousness and nifty lines as he bumps people off, it's just too much. His most fun to watch role since the mad scientist in ""Buckaroo Banzai"".A poor turn by Janine Turner stops me from giving this movie a full 10.

The first Rocky movie, which was made from a script written by Stallone himself, was about a man who gets a second chance in life when he is chosen to fight the heavy weight champion of the world. Cliffhanger takes this immortal premise another step further into mythological territory, where a man must not only struggle against himself, but also against powerful and wild enemies equipped with deadly firepower and the relentless force of nature. About the negative opinions many people seem to have about this movie, I can only say that critics are dead wrong. Cliffhanger is often criticized for being a mindless violent movie, but hey, Cliffhanger is an action movie, if you want high drama and academy award acting go to see THE GODFATHER, GLADIATOR or FORREST GUMP. Many people don't like Stallone, and they attack his projects, mostly, if they are hits, but hey, you want real cheese ?, take a look at Arnie's LAST ACTION HERO, unquestionably one of the worst movies ever made. The plot is interesting and the cast was wonderfully chosen, John Litgow was one of the best movie villains I have ever seen on film.

Also, the Treasury cops don't seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people.  Also, bad guys who couldn't hit the side of a barn with really high-tech looking automatic weapons.I liked John Lithgow's villain initially, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't care at all about any of his own bad guys, or all of them getting killed.

I crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous. Judge Dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie.

The villain's plot is, if you really look at it, just too ambitious.Speaking of the villains, the group is plainly filled with cliché characters. There's the black dude, the corrupt cop, the mastermind and his woman, and for some reason, a Brit. Doesn't exactly scream harmony, does it? And personally, John Glithgow as villain is laughable, especially if you've seen Orange County lately.Nonetheless, ""Cliffhanger"" is quite enjoyable, particularly the scenery and the climbing sequences.

186,bubba99,That very rare movie,2,8 October 1999,"Once in a while, a movie will sweep along that stuns you, draws you in, awes you, and, in the end, leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form. This is not it. This is an action movie that lacks convincing action. It stinks. Rent something else.",Cliffhanger
187,amalex5,"Not a film about climbing, but Die Hard in the Rockies",7,19 April 2001,"When I first heard about Cliffhanger, I expected it to be an action film about climbing.  It's not, and that's why i was fairly letdown the first time I saw it.  In fact, Cliffhanger  is just ""Die Hard"" set in the Rockies. With that in mind, Cliffhanger is a very acceptable action flick.Cliffhanger stars Sylvester Stallone, Michael Rooker (JFK), Janine Turner (Northern Exposure), and John Lithgow (3rd Rock from the Sun, Shrek) in his usual role as a villain. After a fatal accident in the Rockies which he blames himself for, Gabe Walker (Stallone) retires from climbing.  Nearly a year later, he returns to say goodbye (!) to his girlfriend, Jesse (Turner).  Walker discovers that some climbers are caught in a storm high in Rocky Mountain Nat'l Park, and his nemesis Hal Tucker (Rooker) has gone out alone to rescue them.  Walker follows, and the pair of them soon discover that whom they were trying to rescue were not climbers.  Instead, a small jet used by international criminal Eric Qualen (Lithgow) and his gang crashed in the storm, and $100 million in cash was lost.  The criminals then enlist the climbers to recover the moneyAlthough it has a thin plot and some unbelievable scenes (remember Sly: guns and water don't mix), it pulls through quite nicely, with Oscar nods for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Effects, and Best Sound.  Filmed in Italy's Dolomites due to enviromental concerns by the DoI.  One of the beginning scenes saved the day for the President's family at the end of Air Force One",Cliffhanger
188,damianasandorova,"Yes, Sylvester Stallone is simply a badass",7,5 January 2021,"Okay, so Cliffhanger can be classified as a 90s action in a nutshell. In 2021 I cant help laughing at that typical drama aspect of the movie, just enough of slowmotion, over the top music, which sets basis for thousands of new action movies nowadays.
Aside from predictibility and simplicity of the plot, this is as fun as it gets, with as always badass Sylvester Stallone and stunts, which one and only Tom Cruise can be jealous of.
So yes, fun from beginning to end and a bonus of beautiful beautiful sceneries without a touch of SGI.
And somehow this is still a feelgood movie 😄",Cliffhanger
189,reallyangryguy,Cliffhangar is Amazing,10,6 August 2006,"Cliffhangar is a true gem in the action movie genre. Action movies have become stagnant and clichéd in a gradual downward spiral since this film. Who could ignore Stallone's colossus of a performance or not cower in fear of the greatest villain of all time, played charismatically and viciously by John Lithgow. Unlike his most famous other role, ""Rocky"" Stallone's diction was easily discernible and even, sometimes, quite apt. Mountains themselves could never be as timeless as the roller-coaster, nail-biting, thrill a minute, powerhouse of a picture that is: Cliffhangar.Cliffhangar is so good no critic could possibly do it justice. That's why they haven't, ignore them all. Simply watch: Cliffhangar.",Cliffhanger
190,jsylvest,Laughable,1,4 August 1999,"I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity.  (For one, if Stallone is out free-climbing by himself, there's no need to carry any gear, but I guess those dangling carabiners look sorta ""mountain climby,"" so let's throw them in).  For those lobotomized folks who think that Colorado looks anything like the Dolomites in Italy (where the movie was filmed), well the Hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous & foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow.",Cliffhanger
191,njamos,Great!!!,8,28 September 2000,"I didn't watch this for Stallone, I've never been a fan of his. I watched it purely for John Lithgow because I love him playing the bad guy and this movie didn't disappoint me. I rate it 8/10 for the action and of course Lithgow!!",Cliffhanger
192,Sebastian B,Great opening scene! The rest is mediocre action.,6,25 April 2003,"You have got to watch the opening scene, it is just as exciting every time I see it. The rest of the film is for those who are really in to action and regular Stallone films. It is not bad but not good either, just ordinary -No more or less than expected.Grade: 6/10 (would have been 4 if it was not for the opening scene)",Cliffhanger
193,anouarmaknassi-81157,Agent Travers plan doesn't make sense,6,2 May 2021,"If you think about it, agent Travers only needs Kristel, her co-pilot Mike, the Treasury Jet Pilot and Qualen (with his international connections to move the currency) for his plan.He doesn't need the rest. The less people involved, the more money for agent Travers.",Cliffhanger
194,nirmalasandun,Modern Day Movies Cannot Touch The Level Of This Movie,10,23 April 2020,I don't know what to say after watching this movie. Incredible work with good thriller scenes. I know that most of modern thriller movies cannot reach to this level. Great movie to watch and it never disappoints you.,Cliffhanger
195,nick_rog46,Last great Sly movie !,8,30 November 2005,"To be honest, I didn't like that much this movie when I saw it for the first time. But I guess the trouble is that I haven't seen it in a theater. Big Mistake ! Because the #1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and #2 is the cinematography. Try to see this movie on the largest TV possible and a great sound system. The music is good and puts the movie to a higher level (and a commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it.It's definitely one of Renny Harlin's best movie. THis guy knows about action. Die Hard 2, The long kiss good bye, etc. And it's particularly good in this movie. The special effect are great and spectacular. Stallone really needed that movie get back with success. Still good to see him !",Cliffhanger
196,ltybl,worth the watch for the giggles,5,15 December 2020,The landscape seems very unreal. doesnt seem to be set in america more like the Andes. Lithgow's accent is spotty at best. typical 90's action. worth it for the cheap laughs and silly one liners by Sly.,Cliffhanger
197,ivymunni,Underrated action masterpiece,10,28 March 2018,"The film has an eclectic cast of character actors, TV performers and Hollywood A-listers. Whilst it is often considered a second-tier action movie (and in truth it can't quite compete with the likes of Die Hard and RoboCop et al) it is still a film jam packed with memorable moments be they of the action variety or cringeworthy one-liners. The film is set apart from many of its competition thanks to its setting, and whilst there have been a few mountain-bound action films, Cliffhanger is undoubtedly the best and the locale adds an extra layer of tension to the already volatile situation.",Cliffhanger
198,xtn_cs,Top 5 action movie of the 90's,9,25 May 2009,"This movie is just great. It's entertaining from beginning to the end, you're always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. In my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics.Sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain-rescue guy Gabe Walker. Together with him Michael Rooker makes a great appearance as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen of him as a villain.And the fact that 75% of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action! Brilliant movie!",Cliffhanger
199,bastian_hois,one of the best action films,10,27 February 2005,"Cliffhanger is one of the best action films I have ever seen. SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY plays very good and the film has a excellent action like no other film. In this film are great and new ideas, very good special effects,a perfect creating of suspense and so in my opinion this film must get an 9 or 10. In this times there were no good other action films to see and some like Bad Boys, Predator 2,Total Recall,Lethal Weapon are not as good as Cliffhanger.So cliffhanger must get a very good vote because he the best actioner out of the 1990th and a vote around six is not OK for this wonderful action film.",Cliffhanger
200,mleijonhielm,this might be the best movie ever made,10,6 April 2005,"thats right: the best! granted that Renny Harlin is a awful director...granted that Sylvester Stallone isn't the best actor in the world... granted that Micheal Rooker is ugly...still... *SPOILERS* Hal tucker(rooker), perhaps one the best climbers the world has ever seen forces his woman up on a remote mountaintop, supposedly to have a pick nick or something. unable to come down they would be done for weren't it for the perhaps even better climber Gale (Stalone) who shows up and saves the day in a helicopter. tragedy strikes however when its time for Hals women to slide across the cable to the helicopter. the safety-harness fails and unable to do the simplest of things and hang on to Gales hand she and a stuffed animal of some kind falls to their deaths. Hal is furious with Gale for daring out on that cable (made for one) to save her (disregarding that it was the harness that broke, not the cable) and blames him for the death of his woman and possibly the harness.can Hal ever forgive Gale and can Gale ever forgive himself? maybe... heres the actual storyline.a rotten cop (john lighgow) is going to heist a plane transporting money. but something goes wrong when it comes to the part of the plan where they slide the briefcases over to another plane by a cable (sort of like they did in Air force one only a lot cooler because this movie doesn't end with the president saving the day). The money is lost and the plane crashes. I don't remember why this happens but there's a lot of shooting. anyway they crash on Gales and Hals mountain and sends out a distress call claiming they're lost hikers.G and H is now forced to work together to get to the hikers only to find out that they're really terrorist. the heroes, setting their differences aside are taken hostages and forced to guide the terrorists to their money (they had some sort of transmitter or something). this leaves Gale no choice but to rip his shirt of and kill them ONE BY ONE! somewhere along this ongoing killing spree explosions and hot chicks are produced. I don't remember how but it all adds up...you're going to want to see this film 1-2 times day to get the most out of it. did I mention there's a German getting impaled?enjoy!",Cliffhanger
201,mandtplatt,Poor film,2,2 May 2015,"A very disappointing film. Stallone's acting skills have never been the finest but he was clearly wasted on this pointless attempt at showing how rock climbing can be dangerous. Probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. Unusually Ralph Waite, who is 65 plays the part of the helicopter pilot. He was the father figure in the Waltons. I have no doubt about Ralph's acting skills but why on earth choose someone like him to be a helicopter pilot. The cheapness of how each and every one of the actors was killed or shot at beggars belief. I was very surprised this film ever reached the cinemas. 1993 was clearly not the best year for Stallone movies.",Cliffhanger
202,martyhalvorsen,Great Movie,8,27 February 2016,"The movie is shot very well. One of Harlins best films. One of the last films to have many action scenes filmed without green screens. There are some but not what you see today.. The story is solid, the casting excellent. To me one of the films underestimated. One of Stallones most under looked films. The villain John Lithgow was also a great casting choice. John Lithgow is a great actor and brought much to the story. Reny Harlin is known for fast action and being physically demanding on his actors. Clifhanger is thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I think one of the overlooked films of that year. It's also one of those films that stands the test of time even on 2016.",Cliffhanger
203,anthonynudo,"Slightly underrated, deserves more attention",7,21 August 2021,"Solid 90s action movie! Well worth a watch, there are a few moments in the movie that were a little out there, but that doesn't mean that it is a bad movie. The plot is very intriguing and keeps the viewer immersed throughout. Overall rating should be closer to a 7.",Cliffhanger
204,kkryska,"If you're a climber, be prepared to cringe",5,12 March 2019,Sylvester Stallone is enjoyable to watch when he's not climbing. So if you can get over the unrealistic climbing and backcountry safety it's a relatively okay and nastalgic 90's film.,Cliffhanger
